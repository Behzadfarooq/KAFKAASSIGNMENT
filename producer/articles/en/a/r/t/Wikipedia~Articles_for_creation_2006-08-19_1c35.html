<p><a href="http://www.JenKunDoeProductions.com" class="external text" title="http://www.JenKunDoeProductions.com" rel="nofollow">(Production Company website)</a></p>
<p>My family moved down to Florida when I was 9 months old, but I was born in Philadelphia. I started in the film and entertainment industry when I was 5 years old. Back then it was acting, hey have you ever seen a 5 year old grip? Not good. So I did the whole acting thing for a while, but over the years I decided it was more fun to be behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I've been writing for about 16 years. Of course back then it was weird little music videos and telling all the other kids what to make their dolls say, and now it's screenplays and dialogue and funny little stories, but still, there's a correlation in there somewhere. I wrote for a local T.V. show called Comedy Night School for all of season one and part of season two up until last year.</p>
<p>I like to mess with everything, because, I get bored very easily, so, in addition to writing, I also draw, sculpt, play classical piano, make patterns for clothes, do a little acting, and art direct movies and still photography sessions. I've won awards for my writing and my artwork, nothing big, but satisfying just the same, especially the people's choice awards; nothing matters as much as the opinion of your audience (most of the time). I don't believe in censorship, my parents never kept anything from me, and I'm not a crack hooker or a mental patient, so it must have been kind of okay. I love gargoyles and Stephen King, and my Mom, Linda, used to read Stephen King and Dean Koontz to me as bedtime stories. If I were to say I had influences and I wouldn't, but if I did, they would be Tim Burton, Jim Henson, and Stephen King (in that order), because those are THE guys, if you catch my drift.</p>
<p>When I went to college about 6 years ago I wound up in theatre and then film quickly there after. At the theatre I painted sets, worked my butt off as the scenic charge, and did a little design work. When I moved into film I quickly transitioned to the role of Art Director. I worked as the Art Director and Production Designer on a string of films, including pick up days on 'Deadly Species' (now available at Blockbuster), and a number of other independent features, including Da' Bros (as B-Unit Art Director).</p>
<p>Aside from that, I'm a Cancer, I have 3 dogs, I love the ocean, my boyfriend Alex, my family and my friends, and I love to cook. I'm short too, but I don't have a Napoleonic complex or anything. My favorite colors are purple and green. I love things that are unique. I go insane without music. Oh, and I also read palms and juggle. Thusly giving you more information than you will ever want, about me, Jenny Coyle.</p>

<p>Liston B. Ramsey (1919 - 2001) was an influential leader of the North Carolina state legislature from 1961-2001. Born in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_County%2C_North_Carolina_7e9d.html" title="Madison County, North Carolina">Madison County, North Carolina</a>, Ramsey graduated from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_Hill_College_4c4e.html" title="Mars Hill College">Mars Hill College</a>, located in Madison County, in 1940 when it was a <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_college.html" title="Junior college">junior college</a>. A Democrat and a devoted admirer of President <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Roosevelt_8ba9.html" title="Franklin Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a>, Ramsey was first elected to the North Carolina <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Assembly_f52c.html" title="General Assembly">General Assembly</a>, the lower house of the state legislature, in 1960. He was re-elected 18 times, and during his 38 years of service he became one of the most powerful legislators in North Carolina history. In 1981 he was elected Speaker of the General Assembly; he served a then-record four terms as Speaker. Ramsey used his power to bring large sums of state money to the western mountains of North Carolina, many of whose citizens felt that they had long been neglected by the state government in favor of the more densely-populated <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont.html" title="Piedmont">piedmont</a> and coastal sections of North Carolina. Since North Carolina's governor had no <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veto.html" title="Veto">veto</a> power in the 1980's, Ramsey was considered by many political observers to be the most powerful man in the state government during the eighties.</p>
<p>Despite his accomplishments, some Democratic legislators from North Carolina's <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban.html" title="Urban">urban</a> areas resented what they felt was Ramsey's secretive, rural-oriented leadership. In 1989, 20 Democratic legislators led by State Rep. Joe Mavretic joined with 45 Republican state assemblymen to oust Ramsey as the Speaker of the General Assembly. Despite this defeat, however, Ramsey continued to be an influential member of the legislature until his retirement in 2000. He died in 2001.

<p>Gareth Hattersley was born on May 11, 1979. He is an international pizza maker and was an avid soccer player. His career started in 1990, when he moved from his homeland of South Africa, and moved to the U.S. Although this move was not fruitful, it gave him experience for him to use in his pizza making career. Throughout his life, he thought he was great at golf, and often bragged to his companions, and tried to teach them how to play; but he was unsuccessful. His golf career fizzled out when he broke his pinky toe after playing basketball barefooted against Ryan Khanna. He did not make it to any college, as his ACT score was a 2. His pizza making career as a busboy has developed him into a great busboy. Now his soccer career is also over, because he was found to be taking steroids. He currently lives on galapogos islands, trying to talk to the turtles for his new living, but has not made any human contact for 2 years.</p>

<p>Has been teaching martial arts in Burbank for over over 30 years. His own instructor, a native of Korea, is the widely respected Premier Grandmaster Young Ik Suh. In retiring from teaching martial arts in 1976, Master Suh entrusted his style and school to top student Don Baird.</p>
<p>In the 80's, Grandmaster Baird developed one of the most potent sport fighting teams on regional and national levels which put him in the spotlight. Pyong An Do changed the face of competition by presenting a genuine system of kung fu that also worked in the sport environment. After spawning several champions as well as writing many articles for such magazines as Inside Kung Fu and Black Belt, Grandmaster Baird decided to follow his personal passion of helping people utilizing the ideals and traditions of Kung Fu.</p>
<p>In 1992, Grandmaster Baird was appointed Technical Advisor to the Burbank Police Department. He devoted more than a year to the department doing research, technical development, and riding hundreds of hours on patrol. At one point, he received a commendation from an officer that credits Master Baird with saving his life. Later, he was praised in an open letter of recommendation by Police Chief Dave Newsham.</p>
<p>Grandmaster Baird focuses today on using kung fu as a tool to assist people with their lives, goals and dreams. His passion is tireless and his teaching poignant. He touches student's hearts and souls by being available at any hour, for any reason. Between spending time to himself or spending time with his students.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-19_1c35.html" title="Edit section: Mumford Cove">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mumford Cove</span></h2>
<p>Mumford Cove is a private association in Southeastern Connecticut located adjacent to Groton Long Point, bordered by <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noank.html" title="Noank">Noank</a>Connecticut's Haley's Farm nature preserve, Palmer's Cove, and Fisher's Island Sound. It is a part of the town of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groton%2C_Connecticut_e43d.html" title="Groton, Connecticut">Groton, Connecticut</a>. The neighborhood was first developed in the late 1960's, and a number of the original ranch, raised-ranch, and colonial homes remain. More recently, new construction and high home values have made Mumford Cove a desireable location in the Mystic/Groton area. Homes currently for sale range in price from about $500,000 to $2.5 million, while the average home in Groton sells for about $220,000.</p>
<p>Mumford Cove has private tennis courts, a large beach, a marina, a boat launch, picnic grounds, communal sail boats, a playground, and other amenities for residents, as well as neighborhood-wide parties, tennis matches, and picnics. A former home for <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ella_Grasso_f240.html" title="Ella Grasso">Ella Grasso</a>, Mumford Cove is now notable for resident Claire Gaudiani, prominent for her role as Chairman of the New London Development Corporation, which organized the <a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminent_domain.html" title="Eminent domain">eminent domain</a> seizures that lead to a recent Supreme Court case, and her presidency of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut_College_961a.html" title="Connecticut College">Connecticut College</a>.</p>
<p>Mumford Cove is notable for being an entirely private community; unlike its neighbor Groton Long Point, it is not a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borough.html" title="Borough">borough</a> of Groton, and therefore maintains its roads, snow removal, dredging, garbage collection, and other neccesities independently, mainly through annual dues paid by residents. This status makes it illegal to walk, drive, park, or use any facilities if you are not a resident or a guest of a resident. Additionally, Mumford Cove has strict rules in regards to new construction, notably pertaining to the size of homes, the percent of the lot used for the home, and the setbacks from both neighbors and the road. For these reasons, lots tend to be larger, homes more proportionally sized, and living more private than in Groton Long Point, Noank Village, and other beach communities in the area. <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mason%27s_Island_9ccf.html" title="Mason's Island">Mason's Island</a>, in nearby Stonington, Connecticut, is the most similar locale in the Southeastern region of the state.</p>
<p>Mumford Cove was marred by ecological crises in the 1970's, when raw sewage was routinely pumped into the waters of the cove and salt marshes of the area. Since this practice was halted, the EPA has studied and assesed the health and safety of the waters off of Mumford Cove, which have now nearly returned to their natural levels.</p>

After the children were placed in one of the bedrooms, they were told to "fais do-do" and the parents and older siblings would gather on the porch or in the front yard and have a party. Usually, "Memere", grandmother, would watch over the children and could tell "Mere et Pere", mom and dad, where the "enfants", children, were sleeping.</p>

His aliases as a young child were... JJ, JB, Lil Joshie, &amp; The Beat. Joshua Bridges is an infamous Baller. Known for being especially smooth with the ladies, steadily pimpin' at even a young age. Joshua Bridges is known by close friend's, and family for his crazy personality, including many catch phrases, jokes, and is known as the king of comeback's... A good example of this is one time a overweight child said "The Football doesnt like me" Reffering to the fact that he could not catch very well. Joshua than responded by saying "Neither does your metabolism." Another time his own mother said... "Man this chicken is a wreck" an Joshua responded by saying. "No that would be your finances." Alot of people mis-understand, or simply don't get Joshua Bridges sense of humor, because while being very uplifting, an happy it is at the same time very dark, an cynical. Josh often purposefully exagerates situation's on purpose, and many times he mocks whoever he is talking about, even himself, whether he is making fun of them or not. Thru having to move many times, an switch school's thruout his life Joshua has gained the abilty to relate to all different types of people, an generally carry a conversation, however there is nothing he hates more than a person with no sense of humor, or is simply as he would say a "Douchebaggette". Joshua refuses to crack jokes, an relate to people that do not treat him with at least minimal respect. Joshua Bridges has a massive Ego... <b>A VERY VERY BIG EGO</b>. Although Joshua is a mild tempered man for the most part, he does get very angry on certain occasions. Although he may seem like a nice person who is harmless, if you purposfully push him into anger he can be sent into rages that would scare the evil kenival himself. In first grade a teacher angered Joshua to this point, so he threw a chair at her. Josh has occaisional small relapses into depression. You can usually spot this, because his jokes will turn from happy, an playful to dark, angry, an ocaisionally mean. He always recover's, but they are usually related to his past. Being estranged from his Sibling's, an Father at a young age, he suffered several very tramatic, an one near death experience at a young age. Josh is an undercover nerd. Not many people would expect this of him, but he spend's the majority of his days just surfing the net finding new info on computers, games, an especially albums. Joshua bridges has an extensive music collection of over 2,500 song's, an is very proud of it... Quick word of advice. If you want to get your ass beat quick, than you also want to insult his musical tastes. Although the mojority of his palette consist's of Underground Hip Hop... (Not that mainstream garbage) He is proud to also have nice collection's consisting of Punk Rock, R&amp;B, Soul, Jazz, Classical, an even some Persian citar recording's. Joshua Bridges is a wigger. He admit's this, an even celebrates it, but he absolutely hate's it when people point it out just to look cool. Josh is a great public speaker, wether written, or off the top of his head he never fails to impress audiences with his gift of speach. He also frequent's Freestyle Rap Battles, an competes in them. Wether is person, or on letsbeef.com where he is undefeated at 8-0, and ranked #115 out of more than 25 thousand user's. Joshua bridges Hobbies include Rapping, an playing Basketball, both of which he suck's at, but practices as hobbies for fun. Joshua Bridges has recorded 6 full, and 4 freestyle Rap song's under the alias "Young Prophet", and has produced over 40 instrumental track's. His best freestyle is undoubtedly "Masta Wit Blasta", his best song's are "Don't Get It Twisted", an "Sililoquy of Insanity". His finest productions include "Old School Jazz", and The Beatles Sampled "Abstract spins". Josh is a good Producer, especially for a beginner, but a bad Rapper. He is a supiriour Lyrsycst, but his delivery is awefull, an many times he sound' simply like a White dude trying to sound Black.</p>

<p>Christopher Gardner</p>
<p>is president and CEO of the Chicago-based brokerage firm Gardner Rich &amp; Co., which he founded in 1987. Prior to launching his own firm, Mr. Gardner worked for several prestigious Wall Street firms. He landed his first job in the securities industry in 1981 with Dean Witter Reynolds, coming out of their training program. Later, he spent four years with Bear Stearns &amp; Co., where he became a top earner. A self-made multi-millionaire, Gardner is intent on giving back to the communities where he conducts business because he has never forgotten his humble beginnings or the odds he has surmounted. Christopher Gardner's accomplishments are extraordinary on their own merit, but are all the more astonishing because of the unimaginable obstacles he encountered on the road to success.</p>
<p>Always hard working and tenacious, a series of circumstances in the early 1980's left Gardner homeless in San Francisco and the sole guardian of his toddler son. Unwilling to give up Chris Jr. or his dream of financial independence, Gardner started at the very bottom of the financial industry ladder and pulled his way up, often spending his nights in a church shelter or the a bathroom at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station in Oakland. The amazing story of Gardner's life will be soon be published as an autobiography, The Pursuit of Happyness, by Amistad/Harper Collins on May 23, 2006, and will also be the subject of a movie with the same title starring Will Smith as Gardner to be released by Columbia Pictures in December 2006.</p>
<p>Born February 9, 1954 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Gardner never knew his father. He lived with his mother, Bettye Jean Gardner, and her family and, when necessary, in foster homes. Despite a life of hardship and emotional scarring, he always had supreme love and admiration for his mother, who was a trained schoolteacher. His mother taught him some of the greatest lessons of his life, which he follows to this day. When Gardner told her he wanted to be the great jazz trumpeter Miles Davis she said, "Son, there's only one Miles Davis and he got that job. So you have to do something else." He understood from that day forward that his job was to be Chris Gardner - whatever that entailed. Bettye Jean also taught him that in spite of where he came from, he could attain whatever goals he set for himself by saying, "If you want to, one day you could make a million dollars." Gardner believed this to be fact, and it allowed him to persevere through the years when and his son were struggling for survival and a better life.</p>
<p>Straight out of high school, Gardner enlisted in the Navy, just like his uncles, his role models, had done previously. After the military, Gardner went to San Francisco and took a job as a medical supply salesman. Then he reached a turning point in his life. In a parking lot, he met a man driving a red Ferrari. "He was looking for a parking space. I said, 'You can have mine, but I gotta ask you two questions.' The two questions were: What do you do? And how do you do that? Turns out this guy was a stockbroker and he was making $80,000 a month."</p>
<p>That pivotal encounter gave Gardner a clear career goal, but he still needed a way into the world of high finance. Without experience, connections, a degree, or pedigree, Gardner began knocking on doors, applying for training programs at brokerages, even though it meant he would have to live on next to nothing while he learned. When he was finally accepted into a program, he left his job in medical sales. But his plans collapsed when the man who offered him the training slot was fired, and Gardner had no job to go back to. Things got worse. He was put in jail for $1,200 in parking violations that he couldn't pay. Chris Jr.'s mother left and Gardner, despite his circumstances, fought to keep his son because, as he says, "I made up my mind as a young kid that when I had children, my children were gonna know who their father was."</p>
<p>Although he managed to enter a training program at Dean Witter Reynolds, Gardner's meager stipend as a trainee meant he, like so many working poor in America, had a job but couldn't make ends meet. Chris's co-workers never knew he spent his evenings trying to arrange day care, find food and a safe place for him and his son to sleep. After spending nights in a locked bathroom at an Oakland subway station, Gardner persuaded Rev. Cecil Williams, founder of a new shelter program for homeless women at Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, to let him and Chris Jr. stay at the shelter.</p>
<p>Gardner passed his licensing exam in 1981 on the first try. He arrived early, stayed late and worked the phones day after day to lure new clients. He and Chris Jr. got an apartment, and in 1983 he joined Bear, Stearns &amp; Company. After becoming a top producer, first in San Francisco and later in New York, Gardner left in 1987 to establish Gardner Rich &amp; Company, Inc., an institutional brokerage firm specializing in the execution of debt, equity and derivative products transactions.</p>
<p>With a network of offices in New York, Chicago and San Francisco, GRC has grown by focusing on its commitment to provide quality service and excellent trade executions for clients. The firm executes trades for some of the nations largest institutions, public pension plans and unions. Under Mr. Gardner's directions, GRC has adopted a "give back to the community" program. The Company donates 10% or more of the company's earnings toward school and educational projects in the communities it serves.</p>
<p>Chris Gardner's remarkable story of struggle, faith, entrepreneurialism, and fatherly devotion has catapulted him beyond the notoriety he has found on Wall Street. He has been featured on CBS' "Evening News with Dan Rather" and ABC's "20/20," as well as being the subject of profiles in many newspapers and national magazines.</p>

<p><b>Basic life assurance and general annuity business (section 431F ICTA)</b></p>
<p>Basic life assurance and general annuity business is defined as being life assurance business not fitting within any other category of business. It is often abbreviated to BLAGAB. BLAGAB is taxed on the so called <b>I minus E basis</b> (ie the company is taxed on its investment return minus its expenses of management). The <b>I minus E basis</b> raises the UK Exchequer more revenue than it would get if it were taxed on a trading basis. This is because a trading computation would tax Premiums plus Investment return minus Expenses minus Claims, and the expectation is that policy holder claims will be greater than the premiums they pay, as policy holders tend to hold life assurance policies as an investment that they hope will grow. To ensure the Exchequer does not lose out in a year where a trading basis would yield greater tax revenues, E (expenses of management) is restricted so the I minus E cannot be lower than the measure of trading profits, with any restricted E being carried forward and deemed to be E of the subsequent period.</p>
<p>Before 1 January 1992, there were separate tax computations for basic life assurance business and for general annuity business, since then the two categories have been combined into BLAGAB.</p>
<p>Capital redemption business written since 31 December 1937 has been treated as though it were BLAGAB from the first accounting period of a company ending on or after 1 July 1999. Before then, it was treated as a separate business taxed on an <b>I minus E basis.</b></p>

Narasimha Saraswati From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Shri Narasimha Saraswati (Nrusimha Saraswati) is considered the second avatar of Shri Dattatreya. The only way we know about his life is through the remarkable and most influential book in Marathi literature, Shri GuruCharitra written by Shri Saraswati Gangadhar, one of the most talented poet and philosopher ever known in Marathi literature in Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Shri Narasimha Saraswati (henceforth referred in the article as Shri Guru) is considered as the incarnation of Shri Shripad Shri Vallabha who lived in Kuravpur. Shri Narasimha Saraswati is considered as the Guru by the Datta-Sampradaya people. His life story as given in Shri GuruCharitra is read and followed by hundreds of thousands of devotees. Shri Saibaba is also considered in this lineage of the Swamis or Gurus.</p>
<p>His name is Narahari or Shalgramdev that was kept at the begining. His father's name is Madhav and mother's name is Amba-Bhavani. They lived at Karanjapur which is modern Lad-Karanja in Maharashtra. His surname is Kale. At Lad-Karanja there is original house where he was born. Although the house is no longer in the original shape, but still some parts remain and have been converted in to a temple.</p>
<p>The study of his life and life events have put his time to be from 1378AD to 1458AD when he took Samadhi in Kardali-van (Jungle of Kardali trees). The only documented source of his life is Shri GuruCharitra. The writer of this book did not have direct contact with Shri Guru, but possibly had the original Sanskrit version of the Guru-charitra in front of him written by one of the four disciples of Shri Guru. The disciple is Shri Siddha. The whole book is written as a conversation between a disciple Namdharak and Siddha.</p>
<p>[edit] Life and Work In Shri GuruCharitra Chapter 11 onwards is the description of life story of Shri Narasimha Saraswati. After he was born the first words he said were OM which are considered very holy. However, till he was 7 he did not utter any other word other than OM, so his parents were worried about his speech ability. However, he showed by hand gestures that after his Upanayana (Munja) he will be able to speak. In fact after his munja was performed he was able to speak all the vedas and even started delivering lectures on it. This was remarkable for a 7 year old kid and many senior learned Brahmins in the village started coming to him for learning!</p>
<p>He left home and went for Kashi-pilgrimage and took Sannyasa at Kashi from Shri Krishna Saraswati. The second part of his name comes from this guru, who eventually named him Shri Narasimha Saraswati. This is a Sanskrit name. Now he became the Guru. After visiting several holy places he returned back to Karanja, met his parents. He was possibly of age 30years that time. After that he further visited various places and finally settled in Ganagapur (now in State Karanataka) for the last few decades of his life. All of this is reported in Shri GuruCharitra.</p>
<p>One of the most important event in his life (towards the end) was the meeting with the Muslim king (Sultan) of Bedar who is possibly Allauddin-II of the Bahamani Sultanate who was ruling that area that time. These rulers were different from the Delhi Mughals and there were four such states which were existing that time. Many times "chahu rashtra" term occuring in</p>
<p>Shri GuruCharitra possibly points to this. The king visited Shri Guru because he was suffering from a blister which was not curing. No one was able to cure, so he was advised to visit Shri Guru, and after visiting him he was cured. Among the Bahamani kings, only Allauddin-II is supposed to have died due to the blister as per the records of his court historians. This king was very moderate and did not destroy temples or old monuments. He also was supposed to be quite friendly towards the Hindu communities.</p>
<p>The work of Shri Guru has to be seen in the context of the time he was born and social turmoil the society was facing that time. The Muslim attack was imminent and the famous Vijayanagar empire was destroyed. The brahmins of this time had started working for the new rulers and were losing all the past traditions. The revival of the Sanatan Dharma (the old Hindu Religion, as revived by Jagatguru Shri Adi Shankaracharya) was to be revived again. The main teaching of Shri Guru has been that the life of Brahmins is fully covered by the rules given in the old scriptures and they are to be strictly followed by them in their daily lives to acheive happiness and ultimately moksha (the final attainment of soul where the soul is liberated from rebirths cycle). He insisted on his disciples to follow these routines. This improved their confidence and self esteem which was very essential at the time the attack of a foreign culture was going on. This feeling penetrating through the generations, gave a special sense of self esteem and pride which eventually resulted in the coming up of the fighters like King Shivaji and Peshwas in later years in Maharashtra. Shri Guru helped all the people from all the communities and can be seen in his life stories.</p>
<p>After the meeting with the Muslim king, he thought that his fame has gone to such an extent that now all types of people will start coming in, and will start troubling him and his disciples. Thus he decided to take samadhi. He left for the jungle of Kardali (a type of tree). Shri Swami Samarth of Akkalkot, who is considered as his avatar, is supposed to have come from Kardali-van (Jungle of Kardali). Although the time difference between them is of few centuries. The Datta-sampradaya people believe that Shri Guru re-incarnated as Akkalkot Swami.</p>
<p>Datta-Sampradaya, many Muslim fakirs or Pirs are also accepted as an incarnation of Shri Dattatreya. This is very remarkable and can be seen how Hindu and Muslim cultures were slowly intermixing together before British rulers poisoned them.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-19_1c35.html" title="Edit section: Edgewise">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Edgewise</span></h2>
<p>This hardcore band from West Chester, Pennsylvania was founded in 1988 and continued with various lineup changes until 1996. In 1990, Edgewise released its first EP, "Silent Rage", on legendary Smorgasboard records, featuring Al Spina on vocals, Darren Saxton on guitar, Vince Spina on bass, and Jack Collins on drums. Influenced by bands like Cro-Mags, Youth of Today, and Black Sabbath, they combined screaming vocals with metal riffs to produce a unique hardcore sound. Shortly before release, Vince Spina moved to lead guitar and Matt Tincani joined on bass.</p>
<p>The Release of "Silent Rage" was followed by a tour of the eastern US in 1990 playing with notable hardcore bands including Turning Point, Judge, Integrity, Endpoint, and commercial punk rock legends Green Day. They played in clubs ranging from the Zodiac, the Unisound and Lost Horizon to Victory Records owned Club Blitz.</p>
<p>In late 1990 Edgewise returned to Why Me? Recording (Starkweather, Turmoil, Brody (Taking Back Sunday), Turning Point) to cut some tracks for compilations. Tolerance was featured on the genre defining East Coast Assault Vol. 1 on the Chord Magazine/Too Damn Hype Label.</p>
<p>In 1991, Edgewise embarked on a second tour this time heading across the country and playing shows with Lifetime, UpFront, Earth Crisis, Strife, and 411. Returning to Clubs like The Lost Horizon in Syracuse, NY but also hitting all agaes hardcore shows at the legendary Gilman St. Warehouse and Spanky's Cafe for a hardcore fest.</p>
<p>In 1993, Edgewise released its first full length LP, "Massacre of the Innocents", on Vince Spina's label, Harvest Records. Guitar player Darren Saxton and Drummer Jack Collins left the band prior to recording "Massacre of the Innocents", which featured a new drummer, Derek Wilson. Edgewise embraced a more guitar-focused, commercial sound for the album, whose guitar solos and layered tracks departed from the band's earlier style. Edgewise played only a handful of shows to support "Massacre of the Innocents", and the band was defunct soon thereafter.</p>
<p><br />
A new opportunity came in 1995, when European label Gain Ground offered to re-release the "Silent Rage" EP, and to release the band's second full length album. Edgewise reformed with former drummer Jack Collins on vocals, Vince Spina and Darren Saxton on guitars, Matt Tincani on bass, and Turning Point's Ken Flavell on drums. Their second, self-titled LP released in 1996 was perhaps Edgewise's best work, featuring a dark, metal-edged sound with brutal guitars and relentless vocals. During this period, the band also released songs on two compilations, including “The World Still Won't Listen: A Tribute to the Smiths" on Too Damn Hype/Chord Records and AngelFace on the 10 Years Later Comp featuring AFI, Rancid, Down By Law, and Seven Seconds. Edgewise was also featured on the Victory Records Area 51 comp and were in negotiations with the label for a contract.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the band’s second full length album was poorly distributed, and Edgewise played only one show in West Chester Pennsylvania after its release. That was the band's last show.</p>
<p><br />
In 2003, Edgewise was revived when Thorp Records released a "Complete Discography" of recordings as part of its "Unsung Heroes" series. This album, featuring 28 tracks, pays tribute the band's cutting edge sound and contribution to the history of hardcore. The Masasacre of the Innocents was remixed for the discography at Philadelphia International Records (Chubby Checker, The O'Jays, Sound of Philly) in Philadelphia. The album has received favorable reviews from Aversion.com, Geekburger.com and is carried at VH1.com/MTV.com and VirginMegaStores.com in the UK.</p>

<p>"Tag LK" is a monthly comic/manga hybrid created by BK Studios and The LK Publishing Company for the kids who go to Lazer Kraze (a lazer tag arena based in Ohio). All issues are fairly short, counting around four or five pages of comic not including the cover, a coupons page which lists one "two for one" coupon and a discounts ad. There is also a copyright page with a letter to the reader on it. Originaly designed to promote the company and get customers to return again, "Tag LK" has grown quite a bit. The planning for making the main character a mascot is underway. Within the following months, this comic will reach all Lazer Kraze buildings and be accepted as a permanent form of commercialism.</p>

<p>Shri Keremane Shambhu Hegde is an artist who added new dimension to Yakshagana.He revived the troupe in 1973 and made several innovations and experiments during his colorful crusade. He is first ever to start the time-limited experiments while the whole field is running behind nightlong shows. His experiments on presentation style with explicitly sensitive and artistic expressions in dance made the field to adopt the same. Diploma in choreography under the guidance of Smt Maya Rao obviously assisted him doing courageous experiments in the field. His portrayal of roles with perfectly balanced four Abhinayas acclaimed by many. Especially his works on uncultivated areas of dance like pathetic mood (Shoka Rasa) made him distinguished.</p>
<p>On studying the classical scripts of Yakshagana and dance, he introduced a new semicircular stage, which is considered as the first ever endeavourer of improvising stage perspective of traditional theatre. The stage enabled grater freedom to artists and offer clear view to spectators. It was designed in such an artistic way that it can easily be constructed and dismantled and conveniently transported.</p>
<p>Provoked by Shambhu Hegde's vigor and distinctive style of direction with equilibrium, a researcher submitted a thesis on Shambhu Hegde's achievements to Karnataka University and obtained doctorate.</p>
<p>Hegde conduct Lecture-Demonstration Programs all over India to create awareness on the medium and to widen the apprehension of art among audience. After finding the fact that the field is facing lack of good artists, he founded a training centre for Yakshagana in October 1986 with financial aid from Govt. of Karnataka. Many NGO's and cultural organizations felicitated and honored him for his vivacious spirit. His outstanding performance fetched him Central Sangeeth Natak Academi Award in 1993.</p>
