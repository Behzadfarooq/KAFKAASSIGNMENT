<dd>You really should read that page more carefully. It is quite clear that meeting any one of the listed criteria is sufficient to establish notability, but that the list is not exclusive or exhaustive. The guideline also states, quite explicitly, that "<i>Receiving full professorship at a prestigious university, or receiving a named professorship at a reputable university</i>" can be considered a notable award or honor. Since there is no dispute, I hope, that Harvard is generally regarded as "prestigious," it should be clear that the article clearly asserted, and gave presumptive evidence of, notability. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 18:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, bad faith nomination with dishonest rationale.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Please read my statements a bit more carefully; the nominator stated that the article didn't include any "information on the notability of the subject"; your point is that it did include information of that sort, but that the information may not be sufficiently verified or may be inaccurate. Those are two different issues. I was quite careful to note that Eusebeus misrepresented the contents of the article, a point that you don't seem to disagree on. And, besides, the second and third Google primary entries for this search document his status as having chaired the department <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Christopher+Winship+Harvard+sociology&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Christopher+Winship+Harvard+sociology&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 16:03, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I <b>do</b> disagree on it, strongly; I am quite capable of saying what I really mean, and am in no need of (generally inaccurate) inferences of what others think I mean. As it is, Eusebeus' views on why he does not find a department chairmanship notable in of itself are not only defensible, but not subject to a referendum; he belives what he believes, and I doubt he's asking anyone's permission to do so. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was not the one who initially prodded the article, <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">User:Scientizzle</a> did; I am simply restating the reasons given by the initial prod. However, asserting that being chairman of a university department (even Harvard) is immediate and indisputable grounds for notability is simply <i>ingenu.</i> Chairmanships are served on a rotating basis by faculty and are often avoided assiduously as being a burdensome administrative and political position. There is a standard for inclusion of professors on WP, and while you could perhaps be excused for overlooking this, the fact that San Saba has specifically outlined it above makes your angry demand to speedy keep and your gratuitous accusation of bad faith and dishonesty seem simply absurd. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 16:22, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You might consider telling the truth. I did not say that chairing a Harvard department was "indisputable grounds for notability." I said it was information relating to notability. You posted a claim that the article contained no such information. Were you deliberately misprepresenting the contents of the article, or are you claiming that an obviously inaccurate claim in a prod nomination is a good faith reason to propose deleting on article on an otherwise notable subject? And, despite your snide, uncivil and almost entirely uninformed comments on the notability standards for professors, it will be clear to anyone who actually reads the page involved that San Saba's analysis was undeniably incorrect. Perhaps you should read the page before you propose any further deletions of notable academics. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 17:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, I'm sorry for all my wanton lying. Look, there are perfectly valid reasons to vote to keep. But you state that I misrepresent the article, which notes he was <i>Chair of Harvard's sociology department</i> and <i>Director of the Program in Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences at Northwestern</i>. I don't believe that presumptively confers notability, my <i>snide, uncivil and almost entirely uninformed comments</i> notwithstanding. You can certainly disagree with that - adamently if you like. But it is a leap to arrive at an <i>AfD nomination which so clearly misrepresents the contents of the article in question (that) it is impossible to take in good faith.</i> <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 18:39, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I have to say, I'm ashamed at the shoddiness of people's due diligence here. This guy has over 70 publications and has written/cowritten 3 books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/002-9231694-7637625?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;dym=0&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=stripbooks%3Arelevance-above&amp;field-keywords=Christopher%20Winship" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/002-9231694-7637625?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;dym=0&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=stripbooks%3Arelevance-above&amp;field-keywords=Christopher%20Winship" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. He's a full professor at Harvard with a named chair (not the same as chair of the department -- a named professorship is a professorship that comes with its own funding and is considered prestigious to get... though at a well-funded school like Harvard, it may be more the rule than the exception). He was the chair of the department from 1998-2001. He was also the chair of the Sociology department at Northwestern from 1988-1992. This guy is an <i>accomplished</i> academic, nowhere near run-of-the-mill. He meets criteria 3 and 4 of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> easily, and arguably criteria 2 and 8 as well. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 19:31, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Is there any evidence his 3 books meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> readership criteria? IMO, <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> isn't valid as it isn't an accepted guideline.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:01, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Then I suppose you prefer "more well-known and more published than the average professor" from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which this guy still vastly surpasses. But you would do well to pay attention to WP:PROFTEST; it actually does have a lot of support, and furthermore, it's there to be informative about academia's own standards for success. It's easy for us all to understand that being in a major motion picture qualifies an actor, but similar concepts in academia are much more difficult to define. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 22:07, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> "more well-known and more published than the average professor" isn't an accepted guideline either...

<li><b>Comment</b> From WP:BIO, "This is not meant to be an exclusionary list."

<li>At least two of his peer-reviewed articles have more than 100 citations from other peer-reviewed publications, which is darn impressive (IIRC the median number of citations is around 5).

<li><b>Comment</b> I placed the prod tag on this and a few other similar pages because, simply, while this professor may be a fine researcher does it merit an encyclopedia article?

<dd>I am an academic myself, so I fully recognize how these researchers may be <i>important</i>, but generally non-notable. I personally think <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> may be too lenient (8 criteria seem ~equally weighted, but I think they're inherently unequal: there are a lot of mediocre scientists with a large volume of published data, for example, and many awards <i>sound</i> important but mean little to anyone outside of a particular field). I gladly open this up for debate because, as a community, the larger desires of the Wikipedia community should determine academic notability.

While I agree that there's a difference between good articles re: academic folks and trashy articles about garage bands and vanity nonsense, I don't know that there's an official place recommending what you're suggesting. Sounds like a nice-to-have. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 13:55, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is considered polite to do so but there is no <i>requirement</i> (see for example <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_changes_patrol_3ff8.html#Suggestions_for_patrollers" title="Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol">Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol#Suggestions for patrollers</a>) Likewise there is no <i>requirement</i> that articles which fail to assert notability must be deleted as quickly as possible. From looking at his publications (takes 5 minutes but I can only do it at work) he has written about social inequality, the problem of getting black youth into the labor force, and the bell curve controversy; his authored books are maybe not so prominent but he has written chapters for a dozen significant books in the field. But I am not a sociologist, and the time it would take me to become familiar enough with the topic to write a decent stub that clearly meets BIO and V could be much better spent on articles that I actually know something about. Unfortunately wikipedia has many more editors who are steeped in various aspects of pop culture than it has sociologists. Here is a partial list of articles that were nominated for deletion because they didn't properly prove notability when first written; all were kept, and I'm sure there are more cases that have fallen under my radar. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Paul_Boghossian" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Paul_Boghossian" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Helgason_Asgeir" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Helgason_Asgeir" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ronald_Collé" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ronald_Collé" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Elizabeth_Kerner" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Elizabeth_Kerner" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gulfside_United_Methodist_Assembly" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gulfside_United_Methodist_Assembly" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Westsail_32" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Westsail_32" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/John_J._Gumperz" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/John_J._Gumperz" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Theater_intime" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Theater_intime" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> All I want to know is, why is it so urgent to delete articles of borderline notability?

<li><b>Comment</b> His books as main author, <i>Organizations and institutions</i> (1988) 122 libraries; <i>Changes in the relative labor force status of Black and white youths</i> (1980) 50 libraries; he has also contributed chapters to <i>The Urban underclass</i> (1991), <b>1222 libraries</b>, and <i>Securing our children's future</i> (2002) <b>729 libraries</b> and <i>Intelligence, genes, and success</i> (1997) 594 libraries, among other books he has written chapters for. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 13:56, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact that he holds a real professorship at a prestigious university means that academia, and more specifically academic sociologists, regard him as notable. Some random wikipedians do not, but I think I'll rather trust the people who know something about Winship and the field in which he is working. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 17:08, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
