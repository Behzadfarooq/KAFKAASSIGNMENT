<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">This comic should not be deleted. Wikipedia has retained Elijah and Azuu on that bases that it is the #1 strip style comic on Drunk Duck. DD has two catagories for comics strips and graphic novels. Since Charby is the #1 Graphic Novel on DD, and even more popular then Elijah and Azuu, it should logically also be retained. -EEN <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.75.124.5 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.75.124.5_15de.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.75.124.5">contribs</a>).</small></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">I agree witht the above. This comic is entertaining, and has wonderful art, but due to the vastness of the archives, numerous people ask the same questions over and over on the site. A wiki will solve this problem. People can instead of asking a question, first check the Wiki, and THEN ask the question. I don't understand why this has been put up for deletion. -Milknut <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.193.135.216 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.193.135.216_34ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.193.135.216">contribs</a>).</small></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">CTV is an incredibly popular comic, especially taking into consideration the drop on DD readership after the crash. The plot is complicated enough with the dozens of characters and subplots to merit a reference. --Hazgarn <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Hazgarn (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hazgarn_cabd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hazgarn">contribs</a>).</small></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep</b> Reasonably written and informative. Despite the author specifically disliking promotion, it has easily made it to the most read of all drunk-duck story-based webcomics. Also, isn't there a little more to whether something is encyclopedic than mere number of google hits? It is relatively unknown, but rabidly followed by those who have found it. It is, in my opinion, an interesting anomaly of sorts and quite at home with having a wikipedia article.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 75%;">Not to mention that with the sheer number of secondary characters, many people following the webcomic would be very grateful for this article's continued existance. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister_cope_fd5a.html" title="User:Mister cope">Mister cope</a> 23:37, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</span></p>
<dl>
<dd><span style="font-size: 75%;">Oh, and when googling it is easy to forget that Charby the Vampirate will, unlike, say, Secret of Mana Theatre, turn up only results SPECIFICALLY about charby the vampirate, as Charby is a rather uncommon name, and vampirate is a compound word if not coined by the author, certainly very far from common. To get a more fair comparison to other, aparently acceptably noteworth webcomics, you should search for the entire phrase. For example, "Charby the Vampirate" returns just over 600 pages. "Secret of Mana Theatre" returns a masssive 630, and depending on whether you search for "TIN The Incompetent Ninja" or simply "The Incompetant Ninja", you get either a colossul 220, or up to an incomprehensible entire 770 pages. And the latter's article barely qualifies as a stub!. <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister_cope_fd5a.html" title="User:Mister cope">Mister cope</a> 00:05, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</span></dd>

<p><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep.</b> Charby is a very well-detailed comic, and has become very popular. It is definitely worthy of a page. --Andsean 00:57, 28 March 2006 (UTC) -Just because the article says that it's "relatively unknown in the webcomic community" doesn't mean that it's not worthy of a wikiedia page. If you keep this page it will help improve CTV's popularity. I also find that CTV is an incredibly detailed comic and has many devoted fans (check the forums) and yes it even has it's own forum! Amelius is and incredibly talented person and mannages to maintain CTV while also working on Unlife is Unfair, so I therefore believe that the CTV wiki entry should NOT be deleted. ~Kioushan <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.199.86.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.199.86.187_7788.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.199.86.187">contribs</a>).</small></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 75%;">When compared to other comics it can be seen that Charby is above average in plot development, artistic quality, and character organization. Though this is largely a matter of opinion, many have proclaimed that Charby is their favorite. The comic updates regularly as promised and Amelius is more than willing to communicate with her fan base, a quality that’s not all to common with artists of her caliber that will ensure her comics growth. Charby also has a relatively active and growing fan forum demonstrating the growing potential of this comic and need for a Wiki reference.Daggertooth 01:19, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep</b> There isn't any reason I can see to get rid of this entry, the subject is (as stated previously) large and features a lot of points of interest that a wiki entry would be useful to keep track of. The claim that it's relativly unkown should not be considered a prominant enough complaint to warrant deletion. This is a popular comic, and there are many lesser known tv-series/games/comics/people featured on wikipedia. I had thought the point of this site was to inform. Not just to inform on the overly popular subjets. --SeanJKS</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep.</b> Despise the slight error in Cyril bio (he wasn't killed), I beleive this should stay up. Charby the Vampirate is a good enough comic to deserve a wiki page, and, despise the authors modest personality, needs a little more publication. I'm sure her loyal fans (which are many) would love to see this page stay.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Weak keep</b> It is at the top of one of Drunk Duck's list, which is comparable to <a href="../../../g/o/d/Gods_of_Arr-Kelaan_6172.html" title="Gods of Arr-Kelaan">Gods of Arr-Kelaan</a> and Elijah and Azuu. However, neither of these has been AfDed yet, so I don't know if that actually means anything. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 02:04, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>KEEP</b> There is no valid reason to delete this entry as outlined in the Wikipedia Deletion Policy. The Article is well written for covering the amount of information it is covering. The comic is increadibly popular, one of the most popular comics on Drunk Duck, it's popularity should not be an issue. This article on "Charby the Vampirate" should be kept.--Neilak20</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep</b> This webcomic has fulfilled all the requirements that have been put forth. it is a perfectly stable comic with a rigorous update schedule, it's drawn by a hard-working artist, and it has a very valuable and (obviously) very loyal fanbase. There are many other webcomics listed on this site and there has been no viable argument for its deletion other than mentioning the artists own distaste for self-promotion. As this article was not even published by said author, this argument is obsolete. --~SilverWolf~</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Strong Delete</b> - I came across this checking out the Whatlinkshere from Elijah and Azuu, which has been on my watchlist for a while pending an AFD. I was doing research on the thing before possibly AFDing the thing. Drunk Duck itself has an Alexa rank of over 100,000. Drunkduck is described in its article as being a small community, if that is correct, then the community reading Charby the Vampire is going to be even smaller. Also influenced to vote delete based on Kioushan's first few sentences above. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 17:54, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Strong Keep</b> - Well, where do I begin. Charby the Vampirate is an incredibly origional comic, that has more readers than any other comic on the prestigious site, DrunkDuck.com. I can understand why you wouldn't want to have an article about an "unpopular" webcomic, but this is far from upopular. Since the author is not doing this for personal gain, because she does not like promoting, I think this will be a valuble recourse for many Charby fans' needs. I think we should keep this Wiki article here. - Shippo no Neko 17:57, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep</b>: I see no compelling reason to delete. Hanchen, you would make a similar argument even if it was hosted on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a>. You know Alexa is virtually useless. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberSkull_302c.html" title="User:CyberSkull">Dread Lord <font color="#FF0000">C</font><font color="#EE0000">y</font><font color="#DD0000">b</font><font color="#CC0000">e</font><font color="#BB0000">r</font><font color="#AA0000">S</font><font color="#990000">k</font><font color="#880000">u</font><font color="#770000">l</font><font color="#660000">l</font></a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberSkull_40df.html" title="User talk:CyberSkull">✎☠</a> 21:40, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">As useless as you think Alexa is, Comic Genesis obviously generates a lot more traffic than DrunkDuck does. I had a look around drunkduck, it's a tiny community, there's only 1000 people in their forums. I'm sure that's not a great indicator of how popular the drunk duck community is, but there are less members there than the forums of a singluar unreleased mod for Half-Life 2. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 22:52, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">DD just crashed about 2 or three months ago and was until recently only supporting a few new fuctions as it was recoded with new options. 1000 people re-joining a forum in that short a time span isn't anything to scoff at. Before the crash they had a much larger member list in the multiple thousands.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Delete</b>, does not appear to have any reliable sources, does not appear to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 04:27, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 75%;">Point of Observation - Being the Top comic on DD was enough to get Count Your Sheep into Keenspot which I most will agree is no small feat. That would suggest that top DD position is something of a notable acomplishment unto itself and that DD has some notworthy standing in the comic community even if it isn't the number one comic hosting site. Charby did win several of Drunk Duck's Evil Empire awards before DD crashed and erased everything on that site. Lastly its 600+ issue full color archive is an impressive accomplishment by anyone's standards and that Charby at least has some impressive staying power with fans that most other comics lack. Charby and its characters are easily more popular then several obscure villians from main stream comics which have somehow gotten their own wiki entry despite extream obscurity and unpopularity mearly by the association with a large name publisher.</span></p>
