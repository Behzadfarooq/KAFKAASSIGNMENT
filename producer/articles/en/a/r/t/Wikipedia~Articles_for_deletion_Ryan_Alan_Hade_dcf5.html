<dd>well, I'm sorry. I've had doubts about the usefulness etc., etc., of wikipedia for quite a while, but this is too much. I've no idea whether Ryan Hade had any effect on laws at all, but NEITHER HAVE ANY OF YOU. You seem to be basing your decisions on who/what is important using google. google doesn't show information on this, therefor it's not important. How sad.</dd>

<dd>Yes, we often use the "Google Test" to determine the notability of an person. If Google can't find information on a modern-day person, it's likely that their notability is, at the very least, highly questionable. With the pervasiveness of Internet news, it should be simply easy to find links between a person and his claim to notability. If it is difficult, then that rightly invites discussion of whether that person's claim to notability is sufficiently encyclopedic. I would invite you to stay on Wikipedia and improve it - these discussions are part of the ongoing process and if you want your voice heard, make it so. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 17:45, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Edwinx2 18:43, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) <b>[NB - This user's only Wiki contributions relate to this vfd]</b> - User's second vote, struck through.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Updated entries to reflect clarification of background info (strike moved from second entry to first).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I feel that I must clarify that I have no previous knowledge of any of the subjects of the article in question; I just found the entry compelling, and created my account to introduce research advocating the inclusion of an interesting, though possibly only of local interest, historical footnote. My decision to wade into public Wiki mediation is based solely on my reaction to the pathos of this poor kid's brief little life-- to survive through all that and affect (indirectly, I suppose it could be argued) major legislation-- only to get killed in a motorcycle accident. It seemed to me that no one was willing to look deeper than what a cursory Google returned, and a potentially important (beginning) of an article was to be dismissed without adequate research consideration.</p>
<p>Apologies for accidentally voting twice; that was not my intent. I suppose I should have read the instructions more thouroughly; I thought noting that the summary provided was an update would be sufficient. I suppose it is not outrageous to assume that I have some personal interest in this issue, based solely on the fact that it is my first foray into wikipedia research advocacy, but, again, the first I heard of any of this was reading through the delete comments on this entry. I don't even know anyone who has been affected by a similar tragedy, nor do I have personal experience with any of the issues involved.</p>
<p>I have no problem with the article being deleted based on the merits of the facts of the story as exposed by research, but I have read no response addressing the four linear links which provide documentary context in the above summary. If the local nature of the story makes it inappropriate, then delete away... I suppose it is not inappropriate to scrutinize the motives of someone who posts emotional pleas or pure opinion in defense of an article. It is, however, inappropriate to ignore clear research in favor of speculation about the motivation and character of the researcher. Edwinx2 01:04, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No one was disparaging your character, but in votes for deletion it is common to note users who's only contribution to Wikipedia is on deletion pages, because of the potential for abuse (See <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, although I'm not implying you are a sockpuppet at all).

<li><b>Keep</b> A google test on a then-minor child (who would NOT have been named at the time, unless he were already dead) is madness. How about the 50 zillion hits for "a 7-year-old boy" which DID refer to him? To know what later happened to him isn't just "insufficiently tragic", it's really interesting and important. This aspect of Wikipedia really bothers me. Articles which could be expanded to be really interesting and informative are placed on Vfd ten minutes later on the basis of three seconds of google search. That's what's really sad. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 28 June 2005 18:26 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> So-called <i>Ryan's Laws</i> are now quite common in US states. While the child victim was really just in the "wrong place and the wrong time" (clearly a 7 y.o. didn't write nor significantly push the law himself), his was one of those unlucky accidents that achieve notability. By analogy, think of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candace_Lightner_d99f.html" title="Candace Lightner">Candace Lightner</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/d/MADD_74eb.html" title="MADD">MADD</a>, or even more-so <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Walsh_27df.html" title="Adam Walsh">Adam Walsh</a>. Candace Lightner actively formed the MADD organization, her daughter seems not to have an entry; but Adam Walsh himself was just a young victim, even though his murder pushed his father into notable activities. Similarly, <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Hagerman_af90.html" title="Amber Hagerman">Amber Hagerman</a>.

<dd>Do you <i>really</i> doubt that the <i>Ryan's Laws</i> are named after Hade?! Or are you just being pedantic about an ultra-rigorous <i>proof</i> that it is so? I guess it's <i>conceivable</i> that the newspapers are falling for a hoax, and some different Ryan was the inspiration for the laws rather than this one that died... but pretty darn unlikely. FWIW, I think almost all these laws named after child victims are quite offensive to civil liberties; dead or abused children make for convenient hysteria. But good or bad, the laws (and indirectly, their source vicitims) are <i>notable</i>. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 2005 June 30 17:44 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, that UK case is something different (different vicitim and criminal, different decade). I definitely remember hearing about "Ryan's Laws" in a US context, starting around 1990 (i.e. "preventative detention" of "sexual predators"; e.g. semi-judicial w/o reasonable doubt conviction). I also remember reading much more recently about the Manchester murders, which horrifying also, natually. And I guess one of those Manchester victims was named Ryan (I hadn't recalled that until I clicked Etacarl1's link). Despite the common first name (and perhaps similar laws), these are definitely different cases. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 2005 June 30 20:51 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More on context. While I certainly never knew Hade's name prior to today, the so-called Ryan's Law(s) that came out of Washington state (but were later copied in other states) are well documented. In Washington, this was passed as the "Community Protection Act of 1990." The history, in synopsis:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1989, Governor Gardner established a task force on community protection following a trilogy of events: the murder of a young Seattle woman by an offender on work release; the brutal assault of a young Tacoma boy and the murders of two small boys in Clark County. The task force conducted a series of public hearings across the State to discover what citizens believed were major flaws in our State laws regarding sexual and violent offenders. Following extensive research and study, the task force made three key recommendations: significant increases in offender control and treatment, community prevention and protection services, and victim services. As a result of the task force work, Washington State was the first state in the country to pass a community protection law (the Community Protection Act of 1990). <a href="http://www.doc.wa.gov/CPU/lawenf_index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.doc.wa.gov/CPU/lawenf_index.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>

<dd>Now admittedly, you have to put some pieces together to conclude that the recently deceased Hade is the same Ryan. But typically news agencies wind up knowing, but not disclosing, the names of rape victims, and especially of juvenile victims. Rape shield laws typically prohibit disclosing their names prior to their death (or the victim's voluntary statement as to their role). I find it <i>unlikely</i> (but admittedly not inconceivable) that CNN, AP, etc. didn't, in fact, look up their old non-disclosed name for Hade before running his victim status in his obitz. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 2005 June 30 21:19 (UTC)</dd>
