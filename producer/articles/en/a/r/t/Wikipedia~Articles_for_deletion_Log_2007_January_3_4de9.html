<li><b>Comment</b> - It doesn't matter if the company making the product releases the information or not. What matters is that the source being used is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>. As it stands, there may be elements of original research, but that is likely correctable. And being badly written is not a deletion criterion. But lack of reliable sources is.

<li><s><b>Rewrite or Delete</b></s> The issue of reliable third party sources aside this appears to read mostly as a how to or at least an indiscriminant collection of information whose primary use is in reverse engineering or defeating this software. Wikipedia is not the appropriate for this information. I admit there is some information contained in the article worthy of a wikipedia article but with most of the article being inappropriate a rewrite from scratch would not be a bad idea. I would delete the sections that need to be deleted but it would either not stick or be unappreciated by well intentioned editors who care about this article who could do a better job than I.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 21:08, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Involuntary removal of governments" is <b>not POV at all</b>. It means that the existing government is removed against the will of the government.

Can you cite an example of such a case? A thank you note from a deposed head of state perhaps? I mean seriously, are you joking?

(NB: This meant dropping a lot of info from the article but didn't mean cutting anything significant from Wikipedia as a whole, since everything I cut could also be found in the respective game articles.) <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonMerlin_5f2b.html" title="User:NeonMerlin"><span style="background:#000;color:red;border:#0f0 solid;border-width:1px 0">Neon</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeonMerlin_f87e.html" title="User talk:NeonMerlin"><span style="background:#0f0;color:#000;border:red solid;border-width:1px 0">Merlin</span></a> 21:06, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>DO NOT MERGE/Delete or Redirect</b> As much as I agree with the non-notability of this subject I also agree with the organizational argument and I think the worst choice is to merge non-notable gamecruft back into an excellent history article. I would suggest converting this page to a disambiguation page or a category with links to all of the videos games that use the weapon which is not too far from wha it is now. With that said there is little reason not to outright delete as non-notable.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 21:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep or Split and Merge</b> The Masamune may or may not be a big deal outside of the gaming community, but inside the vast majority of the population it is a big name. I would recommend, rather than outright DELETNG the article, all the data for the FF section be moved to the appropriate page, and all the data for the Chrono Trigger section be moved to either the Frog page or the Masa &amp; Mune page. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChimeraman2_fa88.html" title="User:Chimeraman2">Chimeraman2</a> 23:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm sort of stumped about what to do with this. I guess I'd go with <b>split and merge</b> for various pieces of the article, where appropriate: a very short blurb in the historical article, and mentions in the individual game articles. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 06:03, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. The pop-culture section in the Masamune article is as informative as the entire article - this is basically a list of video games that contain a weapon named Masamune. —<a href="../../../x/e/n/User%7EXenoveritas_98ff.html" title="User:Xenoveritas">Xenoveritas</a> 07:11, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

There's absolutely no need for a separate article chronicling where the name has popped up. There's absolutely no space for this subtrivial crap at the main <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masamune.html" title="Masamune">Masamune</a> article whatsoever, other than a one line mention and link to the two games.

<li><b>Keep or Move or Create Category</b> I am undecided. Before all you deletionists go crazy on the issue, you should probably look at <i>why</i> the list was created. The original reason for the creation of this list was because there was discussion about the inclusion of "competitors" on the pages of all the computer system manufacturers listed here (see <a href="../../../a/c/e/Talk%7EAcer_%28company%29_ac33.html" title="Talk:Acer (company)">Talk:Acer (company)</a>. The discussion basically said that the inclusion of a 'competitors' section on each computer system manufacturer page was not neutral and came across as an advertisement. I don't mind changing or moving the page, but I vote for keeping. -- <a href="../../../b/b/o/User%7EBboyskidz_e5a6.html" title="User:Bboyskidz">Bboyskidz</a> 00:55, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>A musical genre that almost certainly does not exist. A google search for the words "alternative synth" throw up a few usages of the phrase "alternative synthpop", although not much, and alternative synths, referring to synthesisers, but no mention of this as a genre. Surely any genre could have 'alternative' placed on the front? 'synth' isn't really much of a genre, so much as a description, in the same way I could invent 'Loud Alternative Black Gothic Christian Synth Metal'. The only link to this page on the rest of Wikipedia is a list of music genres. Oh, and, it is unsourced, furthering my belief that the genre does not exist outside this user's media library. <b>Delete</b> from me. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 00:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

As such, this article should be about the etymology and history of the term "fingering", a neologism.

<p>This article has been around for almost a year, and has been subject to regular tides of promotional edits and negative criticism, but in all this time I've yet to see a single <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> added to supplement the sole link to the company's website.

There is not even a clear criterion for inclusion; judging by the one line of text on the page, it's not nationality, so is it ethnicity or language?

<li><b>Keep</b> I started a temporary page in one of my sandboxes and I have just moved it over.

They are on a small but reasonably notable record label started by a major force in a small but notable musical movement. I have seen string cheese incident (the creator of their label) in concert before and they definately have a major following all over the internet. This band is more on the edge but definately not your run of the mill myspace wannabes using wikipedia for promotion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 21:53, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>del</b>. I am afraid it is a piece of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> about a phrase from play, song, and TV show. I failed to find any refefence that explains this phrase. In any case, the text in the body of the article is highly dubious. At best, this page may stay as a disambiguation for the song &amp; TV show. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 02:51, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The phrase "Ladies who lunch" goes back at least 60 years and was commonly used by everyone from Bennett Cerf to Letitia Baldridge. It predates the television show it's currently used on, and may very well predate network television in the US. The only problem is that someone would have to find back pages of the New York Times and other newspapers of the late 40s and 50s to find reliable sources from society columns and some such, and I don't know if anybody's going to bother. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 01:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Charlene. There is more than enough reference to this term right now in books and periodicals to be satisfactory for inclusion, like: <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2007/01/03/FDGMBNA49M1.DTL" class="external text" title="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2007/01/03/FDGMBNA49M1.DTL" rel="nofollow">Rotunda's GM leaving ladies who lunch for Bergdorf's</a> in the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i>, <a href="http://www.portfolioweekly.com/Pages/InfoPage.php/iID/2349" class="external text" title="http://www.portfolioweekly.com/Pages/InfoPage.php/iID/2349" rel="nofollow">Ladies Who Lunch</a> in the <i>Port Folio Weekly</i>, and especially <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0304367990&amp;id=uIRi0BOvTi4C&amp;pg=RA2-PA437&amp;lpg=RA2-PA437&amp;dq=%22ladies+who+lunch%22&amp;sig=5GHbk5WtjnJ69jxkVI_amgxaqnM#PRA2-PA437,M1" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0304367990&amp;id=uIRi0BOvTi4C&amp;pg=RA2-PA437&amp;lpg=RA2-PA437&amp;dq=%22ladies+who+lunch%22&amp;sig=5GHbk5WtjnJ69jxkVI_amgxaqnM#PRA2-PA437,M1" rel="nofollow">Brewer's Famous Quotations</a> By <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Rees_4107.html" title="Nigel Rees">Nigel Rees</a>, which clearly states the term is for "(mostly middle-aged married) women who have nothing else in their lives but to organize and take part in lunches for charity." --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 14:59, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. Also, I disagree that the phrase is original research.

<p>Following precedents of mast stub deletions, I'm nominatiing this batch of US masts below 540m in height. None of the masts that I am nominating are notable in any way whatsoever, as far as I can tell. Most stubs are over a year old, and have remained in the same, sorry vegetative state since creation, some have not even been categorised. None of these articles have any substantial additional information other than their name, location and height. This information already exists albeit in more concise but no less informative tabular form in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>, so I see no point in redirecting. <b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>.

<li><b>Neutral</b> The list, as it currently exists, is completely worthless. Why are these genes notable, and why would I care?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I Googled several of these genes and found over 40,000 Google hits for individual ones. The list is supposed to be of genes so notable they have Wikipedia articles. It is thus an overview of an importaant part of 21st century science and medicine. There is no proposal to list every gene whether or not its function has been detyermined. My training is far from this field, but even I have heard of the BRCA genes which predispose to breast cancer, and the gene for lactose intolerance, but I would not eaasily find most of them because of their cryuptic names. This is a crucially important field, and a Wikipedia level treatment of the various genes will be useful to people with a diagnosis of genetic disorder, or who want to follow up on something in the news. The future development of the article may require breakup into sections for developmental genes, genes related to cancer, etc. For now the present list should be kept and improves. If we have articles for 493 Pokemon video game characters, which get featured status, since Wikipedia is not paper, we should keep a list of human genes to help find articles on individual ones with non-rememberable names. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:54, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The human genome is very notable and the most notable genes within it notable as well. I don't think that this would do well as a category alone.

<li><b>Comment</b>, at this time I have started a rigourous cleanup of the article, starting at the top of the list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_notable_genes&amp;diff=98392230&amp;oldid=98273377" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_notable_genes&amp;diff=98392230&amp;oldid=98273377" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. As you look at the article now, the top of the list is already adjusted, the bottom is still the old list. Many internal links were fixed, external links were directed to genecards instead. Most entries were corrected with regard to names, notability of genes was explained where not provided and a few will be removed from the list as I continue. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have heard these archtypes stated in more than a couple FAQ's and online walkthroughs referring to the Fire Emblem series in general, and while the article doesnt cite sources, it shouldent be that hard to go online and find multiple websites with lists of the same archtypes.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This has come up before. Furthermore the majority of entries aren't even actual archetypes per se (for all that archetype is really the wrong term... a better one was proposed some time ago but it never caught on and I've forgotten what it was). For the unenlightened, an FE 'Archetype' is a character type which has been repeated in several games, a la <a href="../../../c/h/a/Char_Aznable_2ecd.html#Char_Clones" title="Char Aznable">Char_Aznable#Char_Clones</a>. The best example is Kain and Abel, which are a pair of cavaliers in the first game that are red and green respectively and are friends from a long time back. In the majority of the following games, there are also pairs of green and red cavaliers the same as this, following on the tradition. This is a 'true' archetype. But somewhat recently some people have started creating 'archetypes' based on just about every FE1 character and then trying to fit characters from later games into them. Example from the article: Gato, who is basically 'a powerful character you get late in the game'. People like Athos aren't powerful characters you get late in the game because Gato was, they're powerful characters you get late in the game because characters you get that late that AREN'T powerful would be somewhat worthless. Yet this is becoming increasingly prevalent... 'Davros' (who isn't even called that) is one that I've never even heard considered before. Deleting this article won't stop it, but it will make it less 'authentic', if only a little. --Dark Twilkitri 04:22, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Make personal attacks against me as you will. However, <b>the deepest problem with the article is its lack of established notability:</b> "A topic is notable if and only "if it has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other." "The subject of" <u>does not</u> equal <u>merely mentioned in</u>. Right now, the cold hard facts mean the article does not meet that criteria. <b>Note:</b> Culling together sources that merely mention <i>Wanker</i> <u>as a colloquialism</u> only asserts that the article is, in fact, Synthesis and Original Research. I suggest if you want to keep this article, you best expend your efforts finding sources where <i>Wanker</i> "has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other." Right now it has only one which <i>does not</i> equal "mulitple". Meeting notability per Wikipedia policies, and only that, is what will keep this article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability_is_not_subjective</a>. - <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 08:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>POV Pushing by whom, the authors or the AfD nominator? <i>Wanker</i> as an offensive colloquial term for "masturbator" indeed needs to be mentioned as such in <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a>, nothing more, unless and only unless notability for <i>wanker</i> <u>as a term</u> worthy of an article as such is verified as "<u>the subject of</u> [not merely mentioned in] multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other" (bracketed verbiage added for clarity). <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 09:13, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly, wanker is slang, it is not colloquial. Secondly it means more than simply "one who masturbates". If I called someone a wanker it means I consider them to be irritating not because I think they go home and masturbate. Again, wanker is in the dictionary, it is the subject of a definition of its meaning. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 09:22, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if you can establish that <i>Wanker</i> is notable because <i>as a term</i> "it has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other" with "subject of" <u>not</u> equating with <u>merely mentioned in</u> articles - then fine.

Article is about the term <i>wanker</i>, not about "wanking," so redirect to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> is not appropriate (much as a redirect of <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a> to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> is not called for). The word is not a neologism, but has been in common currency for quite a long time.

<li><b>Strong Keep:</b> This is a commonly used term in Australia, as well as Britain and New Zealand. Given this, frankly, only an American would consider the term a neologism. Given this, to delete the article would be to pander to an American cultural Point of View. I would also like to add that an article needing improvement (e.g. more sources, etc.) in spite of very common usage and clear potential for improvement should not be deleted. I would further add that it is often not used in its literal sense (i.e. often someone is called a 'wanker' even if they do not regularly engage in masturbation), and thus anyone who thinks that merging the article with masturbation is... for lack of a better term... a wanker. - <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmishThrasher_13f9.html" title="User:AmishThrasher">AmishThrasher</a> 07:33, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Where to start? 1) <i>Inadequacy of previous AfD</i> - the result of the AfD was overwhelmingly for keep, and appears to have been so for non-trivial reasons - virtually none of those who voted keep appear to have done so "based on whether people were amused by the article or not", as anyone actually reading that AfD should be able to clearly see. 2) <i>Neologism, including the bit about "non-trivial sources about rather than using the word"</i> - I'd regard the <i>Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang</i> as such a source. It cites the term Wanker as having been used since at least 1950 in its listing of the word. 3) <i>Mergability</i> - the popular usage of this word <i>per se</i>, as opposed to its usage as a term meaning masturbation, is enough for it to survive as a separate article. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 07:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A number of the formulae ["you wanker" and "fuck off, wanker" (from page 205)] use as a form of address the word <i>wanker</i>. Literally, the word <i>wanker</i> in New Zealand English denotes a male who masturbates. But it is also used as a general term of abuse among New Zealand males.

It's obvious that this isn't a neologism by any stretch of the imagination. As for redirecting to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">Masturbation</a>, that's blatantly misleading. In modern usage, "You are a wanker" does <b>not</b> strictly mean "You are a regular masturbator". That's exactly why this article needs more than a dictionary definition, to make it clear what the expression actually means nowadays, and show examples of how it's used nowadays. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 08:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC) <a name="More_reference-padding" id="More_reference-padding"></a>

<p>Above I demonstrated by evidence that the reference in the article, <u>Jenny Cheshire, 1991, <i>English Around the World: sociolinguistic perspectives,</i> Cambridge University Press, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0521395658</a></u>, verified nothing in the article except a dictionary definition.</p>
<p>I again have uncovered what appears to be more reference-padding.</p>
<p>The following is included as a reference in this article:</p>

</dl>
<p>Just as with the book, I searched its entire digitized contents for the term <i>Wanker</i>.</p>
<p>The word appears <u>once</u> in the book, on page 36, within a table that categorizes British "swear" words from "Very mild" to "Very strong". There under the "Moderate" section we find the word <i>Wanker</i> in its sole entry in the book.</p>
<p>The mention was so minor that <i>Wanker</i> does not appear in the book's Index on page 275, where it would appear otherwise between "VALA" and "warrants". In contrast, the word <i>fuck</i> is discussed in some depth in the book, and appears in its Index as such, on 40 of the book's pages.</p>
<p>Page 36 of the book, other pages, as well as the book's entire index can be viewed at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415258375&amp;id=iKbvbEwNjugC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;ots=NLoQNfcvYH&amp;dq=Swearing+in+English:+Bad+Language,+Purity+and+Power+from+1586+to+the+Present+wanker&amp;sig=-lvzmVG03R0CpZ61_wgBT8DdZ8g#PPA275,M1" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415258375&amp;id=iKbvbEwNjugC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;ots=NLoQNfcvYH&amp;dq=Swearing+in+English:+Bad+Language,+Purity+and+Power+from+1586+to+the+Present+wanker&amp;sig=-lvzmVG03R0CpZ61_wgBT8DdZ8g#PPA275,M1" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanker.html" title="Wanker">Wanker</a>, the sole pertinent reference cited in specifically the reference section is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Cameron, Deborah "Naming of Parts: Gender, Culture, and Terms for the Penis among American College Students", in <i>American Speech</i> Vol. 67, No. 4 p372.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the entire journal article, the word <i>wanker</i> appears only once, indicating nothing more than the fact that college students in the researcher's study group used the word <i>wanker</i> as slang for masturbation. Here is the exact sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apart from the two fellatio-related terms above, there are two references to anal sex, <i>rectum wrecker</i> and <i>anal intruder</i>; <b>and one to masturbation, <i>wanker</i>.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is the full extent of the coverage of <i>wanker</i> in the reference. No further discussion or mention is made.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanker.html" title="Wanker">Wanker</a> claims,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wanker...is also a slang term for penis used by American college students. This usage implies that the penis is primarily a tool for masturbation.[1]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously, based on the cited source, the claim that <i>wanker</i> is a term for <i>penis</i> is not verifiable, patently false. This speaks nothing of the ludicrous Synthesis/OR claim that follows, "This usage implies that the penis is primarily a tool for masturbation."</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> despite <i>very</i> impressive research and justification by nominator.

<li>I just want to mention here that the nominator did NOT nominate this article after extensive research. It was listed for AfD based on "Inadequacy of prior AfD discussion", "WP:NEO" and "mergability" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wanker_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;oldid=98074406" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wanker_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;oldid=98074406" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Only when after two days almost everybody disagreed with these arguments, the nominator did research on the article and switched to the arguments of "WP:WINAD", "WP:V" and "WP:OR". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wanker_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=98600959&amp;oldid=98589640" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wanker_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=98600959&amp;oldid=98589640" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.

This article consists pretty much of subjective comparisons of movies. There are exactly zero citations, and two shakey (at best) links at the bottom- a "discussion" and a "blog discussion." Obviously some movies will bear a striking resemblance to each other via ripoffs and such, but how do we draw the line? Are they similar because of genres? Actors? Plots? How do we define "similar release dates"? What critics and sources would we consider notable or numerous enough for movies to be "similar". This list is just too vague abd subjective.

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems like we're having a hard time coming up with an apt title for this article, and yes it is open to subjectivity, but I find the article very interesting and valuable for anybody interested in the film studio system. It's not as if it's a list of movies that make you feel good or something subjective by nature; it's a list of movies that seem to be made just to compete with another. Additions need to be moderated or the text should be changed so people better understand the purpose, though (having Master &amp; Commander and Pirates of the Caribbean listed together is just silly) -<a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel</a> 04:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>My argument is that it's really not possible to create an objective list here. How many critics (or other important people) must mention that one movie is similar to another? How do we define "similar" release dates? I feel that the last question in particular would just end up being completely arbitrary. Would a movie like <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_Story_6f9e.html" title="Toy Story">Toy Story</a> be considered similar to <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_Soldiers_e67a.html" title="Small Soldiers">Small Soldiers</a>? --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 04:28, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. To compare to movies on Wikipedia without an independent source discussing it first is the very definition of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>: An editor went out and saw (ie researched) both movies and made his/her own decision about their relatedness and then decided, "I want to feel smart and tell the world about my discovery on Wikipedia!"

<li><b>Delete</b> I think this article would fail an <a href="../../../a/n/o/ANOVA_0b44.html" title="ANOVA">ANOVA</a> if you could run one. Miserably. Looks to me like within-group variance is at least as large as between group variance! In other words, it would be just as easy to match two films from <i>different</i> categories as they stand now as it is to agree with the match of the films IN the categories as they stand now. So I agree strongly with <b>original research</b> comments. Great point above on <i>"<a href="../../../f/l/u/Flushed_Away_e25d.html" title="Flushed Away">Flushed Away</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratatouille_%28film%29.html" title="Ratatouille (film)">Ratatouille (film)</a> being considered similar because the protagonists are rats? Nevermind that the actual themes are wildly different."</i> There are tons of examples throughout the page of this. <i>"Event Horizon (1997) and Sphere (1998), both involve an abandoned U.S. spaceship that contains a giant orb and members of the search or rescue crew who hallucinate their worst nightmares."</i> You could just as easily argue that <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_b021.html" title="Nightmare on Elm Street">Nightmare on Elm Street</a> should be on that list with the hallucinatory nightmares. While we're at it, I don't know about you, but those Aliens were pretty awful, and they were birthed as eggs (spheres) and Ripley <i>does</i> have nightmares... (*tongue in cheek*). If something like this is going to stay, I'd argue <i>strongly</i> that it should be stripped down to things that can be supported with citations(similar to the pruning comment earlier)...which, since there are currently no references, sounds like a fresh start might be a good idea. The list is also <b>haphazard</b>, so I don't think it meets Wikipedia's quality standards. Maybe these things would make more sense in the "Trivia" that appears at the bottom of some film entries.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just looked over this article again, and I think some contributers were confused as to its intention. Many films are/were listed just because they happened to have similar surface content (ie probably a coincidence), but the article should only be listing films that were made seemingly to compete with eachother (Deep Impact, Armageddon) or capitalize on a trend (Matrix, Thirteenth Floor, eXistense). Perhaps it should be retitled/repurposed (again), maybe to "List of films made to compete with eachother", which would be notable and would be much less subjective (and printed reviews could probably be used as sources). --<a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel</a> 02:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC) (Used the wrong signature code first time)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I still maintain this list is arbitrary and unmaintainable. We have a vague definition of "similar release dates" which would, at best, be arbitrarily decided by the community as some form of consensus-driven <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>- even then, we're still left with the whole principle of drawing a line somewhere- are movies considered similar release dates if they're in the same year? Two years? Five? How about ten? If we were to eliminate the date criteria, we'd simply be left with "lists of films with similar themes/plots/whatever", which could be indefinite and unmaintainable seeing as any critic could compare any two movies and declare them similar. This leaves out that there's a question of <i>how</i> similar two movies must be, whether through plot, actors, score, theme, etc. This whole article seems to hinge on an undefined concept of "similarity". I completely agree that it's a phenomenon noted in the press through common ripoffs and movies riding trends, but I don't think it can be made into an article because it's essentially a collection of "Hey, these two things are sort of alike according to so-and-so" --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:27, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I still maintain that this is a phenomenon that is widely reported on in the media.

<li>I'm saying it would likely be easy to find consensus, if we tried. All of the copycat movie articles I've read, and all the typical examples (Bug'sLife/Antz, Capote/Infamous, TrumanShow/EdTV) are very close in release dates, usually under a year. Movies take about a year or less to make; for two movies that are very similar to come to fruition within a year is notable. I'm going to keep trying to improve this article during this AfD, adding references, removing OR, and trying to find consensus on the talk page about what the list definitively is for.

<p>This discussion is pretty much headed in the direction of no consensus. Since I (and many others) really dislike the article in its current state, I say we compromise:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rename and restructure</b> to List of trends in cinema, or something similar. This eliminates the criteria of "similar" themes and release dates. These trends will cover things like the current trend with penguins in movies, Bond ripoffs, etc. Of course, trends need to be cited (which is pretty easy to do in most cases). These trends are far more significant than "movie x looks like movie y" and they are noted for historical importance by many critics and film historians.</li>
<li><b>Provide some examples</b>. Trends obviously exist, so what we could do is have a small selection of, say, two or three films (cited, of course) which are the best examples of such trends. I think something like "This movie started the trend, this movie capitalize, and so did this one" or something like that.</li>
</ul>

<dd>A good topic for an article, perhaps "Trends in Cinema" with an appended list. I'd suggest you do it regardless of the outcome here. Not the same as the list here tho, as this deals with <i>specific</i> pairs. <b>Re-examining</b> the list, I think its present state is quite respectable, with good annotations on all items. Meets the guidelines in WP:LIST, and the standards seem to be applied fairly rigorously. Very few red links.

<dd>Wikipedia always had the policy that when in doubt about an article, don't delete it. If the criteria are vague and there is no consensus if this article meets those criteria, there is doubt, so no deletion. The sourcing of the article has improved dramatically since it was nominated (from 0 to 36), and the few I checked indeed supported a link between the movies they were supposed to deal with. A better introduction to the article would be wanted though. Concerns about POV and "really disliking the article" are no reason for deletion. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>Relax please, I was <i>asked</i> on my talk page to comment on this proposal. I do not <i>count</i> on anything, nor do I have affection for this particular article. My only concern with is was sourcing (as I already stated on the 3rd of January) and this has been largely solved. If an administrator decides to delete, then that is his call. The one "counting" on no consensus was Wafulz, who writes above "this discussion is pretty much headed in the direction of no consensus", and apparently disliking that potential outcome he states "I (and many others) really dislike the article" as an argument to plea for essentially removing this article and replacing it with List of trends in cinema, an article he has all the right in the world to write anyway (regardless of the outcome here). --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>I think this idea has some potential and credibility if implemented properly as a history article and not particularly as a list. I think the similar theme and date issue could be covered within such an article without the issue of being an exhaustive subjective list. Examples noted by critics could be cited without the issue of original research that we have here. With that said I still object and vote delete regarding this article as an unmanageable subjective list containing original research.

<dd>I like the idea, in fact if there isn't an article about cinematic trends over the years there definitely should be. However, the thing I like about this article as-is is how it insinuates a level of subtrifuge on behalf of the movie studios. That many movies are made with the blatent intention of taking the audience from--, hoping to be confused with--, or attempting to be compared to-- another movie. This seems to be a separate (more conscious) movement from a trend.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose the problem with that is that there's no clear way to source whether a movie was in fact just conforming to a trend or trying to mimic another movie. In fact, if you asked anybody point-blank if their movie (say, AntZ) was meant to copycat or compete with another movie (say, A Bug's Life) they would probably say no, even if they had. I guess that makes it impossible to make the distinction between trendiness and a knockoff, so a list of cinema trends would be a fine compromise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only question would then be, do we format it the same as the current article by date and list "2000s': Penguin Movie trend: <i>Happy Feet</i> and <i>Surf Penguin Or Whatever It's Called</i>" etc, or do we sort it by trend. "Penguin Movie Trend: <i>Happy Feet</i> and <i>The Other One</i> (CGI Penguin movies) seemed to follow the popularity of the award winning <i>March of The Penguins</i>."</dd>

<li><b>Support proposal but still delete the article</b>, I rather like Wafulz's proposal here. My main concern (after the OR and verifiability bit) was the <b>notability</b> of these comparisions, especially in light of the plethora of sources. Sure, someone decided to compare two movies in some reliable source, but is the comparison notable? I can't imagine every single one listed could be notable enough to include on Wikipedia. With Wafulz's proposal, some criterion for inclusion seems inherent in that the movie must have started a trend, rather than simply an isolated and possibly coincidental similarity. In this way, the article becomes much less indiscriminate than the current article as well. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose proposal, but let's work on this some more</b>. Wafulz's suggestion is a good start, but let's keep talking before we put anything to a vote. These are not "trends in cinema", which is pretty vague (CGI is a trend. Jump cuts are a trend. Science fiction was a trend in the late 1970s, and adventure in the early 1980s. Film noir was a trend, if not a movement). What we're talking about is the fact that studios often go head-to-head (or close to it) with two, or occasionally more, similar films. I agree that the reason for why this is so is often unclear, from great-minds-thinking-alike to copycatting to coincidence; and I also agree there's no reason for us to decide why this was, either. But "trend" is just too unclear for me. I still think a variation on the present title would be a little more apt, i.e., List of films with similar topics released within a short time of each other. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:#800">Pro<span style="color:#a00">hib<span style="color:#b00">it<b><span style="color:#c00">O</span>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>ns</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 22:43, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Yes and no</b>. One argument <i>for</i> deletion mentioned by many above is the vaguely defined scope of the current list. A list of trends in films, while perhaps not a bad topic for an article per se, would be even more vague, and would almost certainly have to exclude items on the current list. The fact that "Turner &amp; Hooch (1989) and K-9 (1989) are both movies where a police officer gets a dog for a partner" is not notable as a <i>trend</i> on its own, but is probably notable as an <i>example</i> of the <i>specific trend</i> of films with similar themes and release dates. I don't see a reason why Wikipedia shouldn't include this information (yes, I realize that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>). On the other hand, a list of trends in films would be able to focus on the larger picture, which is obviously also important. For instance, inclusion of Flushed Away and Ratatouille on the current list may not be justified, just because they are computer animated films from 2006/07 with rat protagonists. However, a list of trends could accomodate the fact that DreamWorks and Disney have their own "trend" of releasing films with similarities (Antz/A Bug's Life, Shark Tale/Finding Nemo, Madagascar/The Wild, Flushed Away/Ratatouille). — <a href="../../../k/w/i/User%7EKwi_d01c.html" title="User:Kwi">Kwi</a> | <a href="../../../k/w/i/User_talk%7EKwi_0378.html" title="User talk:Kwi">Talk</a> 23:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: as <a href="../../../k/w/i/User%7EKwi_d01c.html" title="User:Kwi">Kwi</a> said, movies that bear an uncanny resemblance are often put out at the same time, and that is phenomenon notable.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> With respect to film, this is as important an article as any. To be honest, I'm surprised that it hasn't been addressed before now. I agree with ProhibitOnions (and others) that what you're proposing is not about trends in cinema per se. However, I disagree with his/her suggested name change. A better title would be "competitive implementations of thematic devices in cinema," or something to that effect. Also, when you limit it to similar films that were released a short time apart from one another (i.e., The Time Machine / The Butterfly Effect), you are effectively ignoring longstanding patterns of competitive pseudo-plagiarism. An angle worth exploring would be studios' years-long infatuation with releasing cookie-cutter blockbusters: alien movies, disaster flicks, superhero films, mobster films, spy films, neo-noir, the whole gamut. This phenomenon has as much relevance to the matter at hand as any two similar films released in practical simultaneity, and in fact would serve to establish a broader framework for a more thorough investigation. Best of luck to you. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 14:31, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that the keep votes such as you don't understnad that the delete votes don't think that the subject of competition in the movie industry by closely mirroring the themes of other studios is not real or notable or worthy of an article. It is simply that this article as it currently stands is not appropriate for wikipedia. It is an exhuastive subjective list. If an article was written to explain and demonstrate this phenomenon without caliming to list every example tehn this would probably be all keep votes.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 19:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But Nick Y., that's precisely the reason many of us are arguing to keep the article. If even you believe that it's a worthy topic for an article, how about helping improve it, suggest guidelines that you find suitable (or at least give people some time to get it up to shape) before chucking the whole thing out the window. The solution for a topic worthy of an article with problems is improvement, not deletion.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 23:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I believe what Nick is trying to say is that <i>this</i> article is inappropriate, but a different incarnation of it with better, more encyclopedic criteria would be good. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 02:53, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think this list works fine, but within the context of a more complete article. I suggest it be kept and improved. It needs a larger introductory statement, with referecnes relating to the practice of "borrowing" ideas over the history of cinema. Begin with genres of film that obviously mimic or were inspired by another. Spaghetti westerns and samurai films, for instance, or Brian DePalma's Hitchcock infatuation early in his career, both of which are well-documented. One doesn't need to be a film historian to see that this kind of thing has gone on for a very long time. A lot of these references are solid, and it'd be a shame to let the research go to waste. The appropriate call is to enhance the article with more history, and to pinpoint objective relationships between sets of films. If the release dates of two films were very close together, one could easily reason that a studio got word of another's idea, but it is important to be able to substantiate the claim with either hard evidence, the opinions of several journalists, film critics, or industry insiders, or an overwhelming public belief in the existence of such a connection. Look up pre-production dates and cite IMDB and other sources for things like scheduled release dates versus actual ones. If you could show that film X was rushed through production to compete with film Y, it wouldn't hurt. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 06:57, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see why either of these need their own article. It should be covered in the main article. I understand some sub articles such as for a list of episodes or I might even give you a list of characters; however I am of the (sane and thoughtful) opinion that not every fictional entity and room in a notable show is necessarily notable independently of the show. There are many characters or entities that are, such as <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_Wonka_9737.html" title="Willy Wonka">Willy Wonka</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Montag_e914.html" title="Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordor.html" title="Mordor">Mordor</a> because they have entered into main stream popular culture. These article deal with subjects that are exclusively for fans and are not in common use outside of the fan base. Please give me an example of use of "The white room" or "Wolfram and Hart" in a context not having directly to do with the show and I will change my mind. Fictional characters and organizations can be culturally and historically significant these two are not.

<dd><i>Gross leasable area</i> and square feet are different. The site you are referring to <a href="http://www.sanjacintomall.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.sanjacintomall.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> just says the mall is 1.2 million square feet. Leading me to conclude that they are counting the entire mall. The proposed guideline says the the "gross leasable area must be more than 1 million." Thus, in my opinion this still doesn't make it notable unless the GLA can be confirmed. But I was unaware of this proposed guideline, so thanks for pointing it out. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 13:13, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> A guideline's acceptance hinges in part on whether it is referred to in AfDs. That seems to be how consensus is developed that the guideline is used and useful.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> At 1.15 million square feet of gross leasable area, this is a large regional center that justifies inclusion under the proposed criteria specified at <a href="../../../m/a/l/WP%7EMALL_3c10.html" title="WP:MALL">WP:MALL</a>.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> It seems to me like this mall probably has an interesting history which could be expanded in this article if someone cares to bother. However, the article is currently rather POV and doesn't describe the mall itself very well. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">Matth</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">w<font color="green"><b>UND</b></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewUND_1acf.html" title="User talk:MatthewUND">talk</a>)</sup> 09:52, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The end is in sight for mast stub deletions. I'm nominating this [final] batch of US masts for deletion (below 580m in height). As before, none of the masts that I am nominating are notable in any way whatsoever, as far as I can tell. Most stubs are over a year old, and have remained in the same, sorry vegetative state since creation, some have not even been categorised, and none have any substantial information other than which already exists, albeit in more concise but no less informative tabular form, in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>, so I see no point in redirecting. <b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>.

Add to that the POV problems inherent in any article that describes its included examples as "significant" and the very good likelihood that there will be fighting over what single event gets listed with what year as the "significant" one and the article just seems like way more trouble than any encyclopedic worth it might have. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:03, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> it lacks information</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I just stumbled onto this discussion, when I clicked on the list as a way to navigate through the years in film. It was precisely the page I was looking for. I see no need to delete, and the page serves a purpose. <a href="../../../k/g/w/User%7EKgwo1972_3caf.html" title="User:Kgwo1972">Kgwo1972</a> 19:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC) Edit: I also note that six other languages have the same page.

<li><b>Keep</b> If it's good enough for a category it's good enough for a list. Also, we have the same sorta thing for music, so it's not as if we don't have a precedent. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 00:16, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmm. That article has a lot of the same problems, but at least limits itself to listing a few <i>really</i> noteworthy events on particular years, rather than picking five or six events for each year, as this list does. I suppose this list might be rescuable if an objective criteria for "important" films were determined which would trim things down. Perhaps list the film with the single highest gross revenue for each year? <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 02:02, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b>. This is how the guys at the various film wikiprojects organise their work. Deleting this list and its sub-lists would be wrong both in principle and in terms of the amount of extra work it would generate. The argument in the nomination that duplication with a category justifies deletion is fundamentally flawed. List are never made redundant by categories. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 08:46, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The year-specific lists aren't under discussion. It's just this single summary page that's being nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 11:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Noted, but this article is part of the navigational structure. No merit in dismantling part of it. Besides, a delete here would set a bad precedent if someone deletion-happy were to start proposing the underlying articles for deletion. (There seems to be a lot of deletion-happiness about at the moment. I seem to have spent the last couple of days doing nothing but protecting good work from ill-conceived AfDs. But I digress.) The important point about this article is its place in the organisational structure. Most delete voters here don't seem to like the "significant examples" (although I like them, and it seems to me they can be cleaned up and verified just like anything else). But the examples are just window dressing, and they could be removed or replaced with something else. The CORE of this article is that it's at the heart of the navigational scheme for organising films on Wikipedia, and that is why I'm so strongly in favour of keeping it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 13:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Neutral</b></s>. I agree that all the content attached to the years is POV and has to go. However this page is the only way (until now) to navigate in all years in the Years in film series. Please note that in (say) <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_in_film.html" title="1995 in film">1995 in film</a>, in the navigation template at the top right, the top leftmost link "Years in film" redirects here. We could replace the content of this page with a more compact navigation, so one doesn't have to scroll down to come to the present. We could also just transclude a template. Alternately, we could put the overall year navigation in each year, but that would be very problematic in the latest years which are very very long and overloaded with tables etc. <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> <small><a href="../../../h/o/v/User_talk%7EHoverfish_2aee.html" title="User talk:Hoverfish">Talk</a></small> 21:31, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I checked this guy's name against <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> news database. 4 hits (3 unique) in the archive.

They get maybe 60 words out of a 1300 word article.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the article... well I'm kind of overwhelmed. Let's deal with the IMDB TV/film acting credits listing as surely that will come up:<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0069021/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0069021/" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. Well, the Name of the Rose movie part is definitely a bit part<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091605/fullcredits" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091605/fullcredits" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. The other parts appear to be bit parts or one or two minor roles in German TV series. He <i>seems</i> to have had a lead role in a made-for-TV Swiss movie called <i>Flaming Armadillo</i>[<a href="http://english.crew-united.com/index.asp?show=memberdetail&amp;ID=48474" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.crew-united.com/index.asp?show=memberdetail&amp;ID=48474" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>.... The claimed stage career isn't verified (seems like a lot of these "reference" links in the article just go to other wikipedia articles or to german webpages that prove a location (a theatre or whatever) exists but doesn't verify anything else). Given the inflation of his Marilyn hobby, and the inflation of his bit part in Name of the Rose, I'm concerned that there is pattern of inflations through the article....</p>
<p>Urrgghh!!! I flail my arms around wildly. Massive suspected <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> abuse of wikipedia in one article. If there is really an article about a verifiable, possibly encyclopedically notable acting career here - I recommend that this article be scrapped and the author creates a much more modest article with proper referencing in his userspace and then resubmit it for community review. This article is just not acceptable in its current state.</p>

<dd>No, Even if there was a re-write, there needs to be multiple, reputable, reliable, notable, independent (from the subject), third-party, published sources giving him non-trivial coverage. There isn't any that I can find using Google, or even the ODIN public library search software for the tri-state area (north dakota, south dakota, minnesota). He isn't mentioned in a published book, I haven't found coverage from multiple sources on his MM work. No, 'Cumulative' does not equal notability. Bit parts in movies does not equal notability, and there are no sources to back up the claims made (as pointed out in the original post) of the acting. Monroe activism? Let me say this from the original post:</dd>
</dl>
<p><small><i>The main claim to encyclopedic notability as "the world's leading expert and authority" on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroefails</a> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</i></small></p>
<p>There are nothing in the news, in print, or on the web to back up this claim.</p>
<p><small>I checked this guy's name against <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> news database. 4 hits (3 unique) in the archive. All 3 unique hits are from Los Angeles Times, in which he is mentioned as a Marilyn Monroe enthusiast and one of the major Marilyn Monroe memorabilia collectors in the Los Angeles area, but <u>none of the articles are primarily about him (all mention him in passing or as secondary quote) and none cite him as a world expert or even the leading LA collector</u></small></p>
<p>What this means is ONE notable new sources has mentioned him in an article. HOWEVER, per wikipedia policies, the articles must be primarily about him...they are not. None of them say he is a world expert...or even having the largest or most notable collection.</p>
<p><small>The most recent article is about Marilyn Monroe memorabilia fraud - but is mainly about another collector whose collection is suspected of being dubious - Bellinghaus and his rival/partner Cunningham (the other guy writing the PR-Inside "articles) are mentioned in passing with a quote towards the end as people who have suspicions. They get maybe 60 words out of a 1300 word article.</small></p>
<p>That is a mention in passing...a trivial mention per wikipedia policy. A person can have 100 mentions in passing in articles and would not be concidered to pass wikipedia policy. So no...'Cumulative' coverage does not work. None of his acting career is sourced properly, and nothing about his MM activism makes him notable. I still stand by my delete opinion... and actually am changing that to STRONG delete since now that I think about it, the article is a puff piece more suited to Myspace...were you can claim anything without providing proof --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 18:50, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, without prejudice to Guinnog's ability to write a better one. This would be a bad Myspace page. There is so much there that it is barely possible that Guinnog can eke out a bit, but I'd have to see it. Most of it is intense puffery of a minor actor and obsessed fan, which is all well and good (probably half of us editors are obsessed fans), but no different from thousands of others. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 19:04, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Open letter to "Bschott" &amp; "AnonEMouse": Dear Brian, (I forwarded this email also to AnonEMouse who is not discribing him/herself as a "director on youtube" in his/her profile).</p>
<p>I just read your comments regarding your opinion towards the deletion of my Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Let me just do a little explanation here, if you have a minute. Last year, I bought original hair curlers at an auction--they originated from "the estate of Marilyn Monroe," and five months later, there comes this "exhibit" into town and shows fake ones. But not only that, they show 95% fake items.</p>
<p>What would you have done? You tell me that none of my action has made me a "noteable Monroe enthusiat?" You discribe yourself as a "director on youtube" and try to make me look as I was a crackpot that has never worked in the business, when I worked in 26 productions, such as movies, tv and theater. Oh I know that is not important, cause it is not youtube. I would really suggest to you to rent a movie, it is called SCHTONK, and it was nominated for BEST FOREIGN ACADEMY AWARD, and it was made in Germany. It is telling a story, which you might recognize, when you read what I have discovered.</p>
<p>I can guarantee, that there will be a movie, which is portraying all the fraud and the ongoing that I found and brought to light. Even Hugh Hefner, the guy who is some day resting next to Marilyn Monroe was supporting this BS fraud on Marilyn Monroe.</p>
<p>One last thing, this is not about me, but I have to state who I am and if you check: I do not have a Myspace page and I don't think that I really want one. But I have tell who I am and what I am, otherwise I would not have been so successful in stopping that fraudulent exhibition, which could have also traveled to your home town and taken money from your family and friends (in case they like Marilyn Monroe).</p>
<p>I have proof for all the work I have done, I am not making anything up. You might be just too young to understand that, but I have stood up against something really ugly. And I am still shocked, that I succeeded. I closed a fake show that could have made $100 million. That is a fact. And I have worked on and for this for thirteen months. And you want to seriously tell me that this is worth nothing? Do you want me to forward you all the emails that I got from all over the world, from supporters and fans of MM?! You got a lot of awards on your site. They must be standing for something as well.</p>
<p>Please think about all of that I just said. The story is not going away, and I am not going away either. I have defended Marilyn Monroe, against sick people and sicker fraud. You'll be the judge.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<dd>Mark, I'm not saying that you were wrong or your cause wasn't just. I'm not saying your life has no meaning or that anyone could get a bit part in a movie, but the facts I am stating is that per wikipedia policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V (all about verifible sources and information)</a> and in relation to that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS (all about what wikipeida conciders reliable and non-reliable sources)</a>, and then [[WP:BIO|WP:BIO (what criterias are required or to be met by a person to merit a wikipedia page). While we are not like the Britanica or any other paper encyclopedia that has a fairly high bar for what they will have articles on, and while Wikipedia does have the ability to include many more things that a paper encyclopedia couldn't, we do still have standards which need to me met. The standards are fairly applied to everyone. Two of my favorite bands put up pages here but were removed because they didn't meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guideline yet. I voted delete in both cases even though I love their music.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, I am not claiming notability nor am I claiming anything really. I don't have a page in the main wikipedia namespace, it's just a user space about the editor (me), which is really just a quick stub of who I am. A director account on youtube just means you can post videos longer than 10 minutes so it's really nothing special but I mention it so people who wanted to learn more about me could. Not everyone has an account and those that do mainly are posting videos on personal opinions and such. Nothing more, nothing less, nothing notable, nothing worth an article. Never factored into the decision/opinion I had about your article. Haveing a cause is great but the thing is the cause hasn't drawn much media attention outside of the LA paper and even there, the articles are not primarily about you. Even if this were the case, that is only one paper which does not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Multiple major papers or news reports would need to also be reporting stories based primarily on you. It's nothing against your cause or life, but the fact is, the average person needs be able to easily and simply find the sources to back up the claims made about your acting career. The links provided just go to the theater's webpage...great but where are the newspaper articles or tv/radio reports on those plays you were in? Someone that doesn't know you from the common man on the street needs to be able to verify your claims. That's all. I may be young (at 29) but I'm looking at your article with uncolored glasses, making an opinion based on wikipedia policy and standards. Nothing more, nothing less.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 21:23, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good for you. Please note that we are not denigrating you or your life's work, it's certainly a useful thing. It's just not necessarily <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a>, in the sense that many have heard of it. Notability is not the same thing as value - for example, many dictators, mass murderers, and other actively harmful persons are highly notable, while many perfectly fine people contributing to the world behind the scenes aren't.</dd>
<dd>I support giving Guinnog another 24 hours or whatever, though I'm still skeptical. Just making the images smaller helped a lot, though I have to say sentences like "Without any doubts, Bellinghaus created the most successful blog article in the history of blogging." still seem just a bit overstated. (For example the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drudge_Report_b304.html" title="Drudge Report">Drudge Report</a> article that led to the <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewinsky_scandal.html" title="Lewinsky scandal">impeachment of a president</a> would probably find a number of backers.) <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 20:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. Saying "Person X doesn't deserve a Wikipedia article" does <b>not</b> in any way mean that Person X is a bad person who has contributed nothing to society. Lots of good people who do good things don't and shouldn't have Wikipedia articles. I'm sorry to say that due to all the graphics and the congratulatory tone, the article strongly resembles a MySpace page. This is not intended as a personal attack or an insult. After all, you're a newbie and you didn't know. (And frankly, there are a lot of Wikipedia articles that look worse, so you are far from alone.) I suggest you head over to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to see what qualifies for inclusion here, and <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> to see how articles ought to look.

<li><b>Update</b> My work so far is at User:Guinnog/mb. It is far from finished. It may be that the sceptics are right and this will have to be deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> Blatant self-promotion of a blatantly non-notable individual. <i>"In 1988 he played Rüdiger Burkhard in the hit show Verkehrsgericht (Traffic Court), episode 21, "Unfall nach Discobesuch,"</i> ...

<ul>
<li><b>Update</b> with kudos to Guinnog, but Dhartung said it correctly: "If there were a slight chance of a keep, in my book, the WP:COI strikes it." In the end the last thing we want to do is encourage people with very marginal claims to notability to post their heavily embellished vitae here and expect us to clean it up for them. This is also relevant for the question whether Wikipedia can in the future operate without advertising, since for-profit vanity Who-is-who publishers are a dime a dozen, allowing such content on Wikipedia undermines the non-profit substructure of this project. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:57, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further update</b> Well, I've done what I can with it for now. It could still do with some refinement of the prose and structure and a few more references for the second part.

<li><b>Final update</b> Well, I think I've finished. I've taken out pretty much all the unreferenced and POV stuff, and cleaned up the formatting a bit.

<li><b>Another update</b> I've now edited Guinnog's edit and cut the article further to the essential points. The early "deletes" were based on an article which is very different to its current form, which shows sufficient acting achievement with lead parts etc to bestow minor notability, added to the Monroe incident. The article has to be judged objectively as it now is, regardless how it started out. In the circumstances, if there is still a desire to delete it, it may be best to relist and start the AfD with a clean slate. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 22:46, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very strong keep.</b> I have personal familiarity with this topic, although I had not seen this article before. It is a notable subject among chess players and fans. Among the several hundred articles in the Chess category and its subcategories, this one certainly belongs. The first part of the article reads like an essay, but the later part about computer analysis of human moves comes from a chessbase.com article, which I think is cited, and the chessbase.com article in turn cites an article from the ICGA Journal, a serious scholarly publication specializing in chess and other computer games. I would recommend some cleanup. Perhaps the title should be changed to "Historical Ranking of Chess Players," and the article will begin by explaining why such intergenerational rankings are difficult, then it will go into the greatest player ever debate. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 17:15, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article outlines some metrics used to decide the best chess player, and offers some suggestions that have made by published sources. Since it doesn't make final statements like "X was the greatest ever, end of story.", I don't have a problem with it. No objection to a rename in principle, but we can take that up on the article's talk page. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 02:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or allow a page for the unofficial site?? BrianRFSU 06:57, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Amended:</b>- The TNA Community, whether officially recognized or not, is still the #1 form of communication from the federation to their fans, and while the community is not recognized, the promotion is, as I have noted in my unofficial site, the Miami herald, a preeminent newspaper, wrote an article about the "feud" between TNA and MLB. To say that having two of the top ten sports in our country working together, is not notable.. then what is? Also TNA is the #2 wrestling promotion in the US, if not the world. Especially with the introduction of Kurt Angle, an olympic medalist, from WWE to TNA , TNA is becoming more and more notable. What I think is interesting is that there are sites for defunct sports teams. So why couldn't we a defunct to the commmunity page and call it a day
<ul>
<li>To allow an article on any unofficial sites would not resolve the problem that this article has no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> indicating any sort of notability per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Assuming that articles on unofficial, fan-run sites would likely run into the same problem, it seems apropos to say that two wrongs don't make a right here. Please base your recommendation to keep on Wikipedia policy and guidelines, as that will strengthen your argument. Can you provide sources indicating that the particular site being discussed herein is notable? --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 07:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Publicity puff with mostly unverifiable content. Turek does appear to be a photographer of note -- and this is not a proposal to delete <i>any later article</i> on the same person -- but I hardly know where to start rewriting this article in an encyclopedic manner and therefore suggest clearing it and allowing a completely fresh start. <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:45, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article is poor and the editor has made wild claims about Turek here and in other articles that just aren't true (for example, he started an article on Lith-printing and claimed that Turek was "One of its original users" even though the process pre-dates his birth by 50 years or more. Similarly, many of the claims in this article are not independently verifiable. That said, however, I do find Turek to merit an article, just not this one. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 07:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with your criticism of the article as it stands. I also agree that the guy is probably sufficiently notable to merit an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Naturally any free, open-source Linux game is going to have far less coverage than a PC game with advertising-sponsored media, so one most consider the notability of a product in this market in that context. I believe it is notable given the relatively limited number of games for Linux machines, and the review I found at <a href="http://linux.about.com/od/softgame/fr/fr_Globulation2.htm" class="external free" title="http://linux.about.com/od/softgame/fr/fr_Globulation2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://linux.about.com/od/softgame/fr/fr_Globulation2.htm</a> as well as a number of user-rating sites (e.g.: <a href="http://www.happypenguin.org/show?Globulation%202" class="external free" title="http://www.happypenguin.org/show?Globulation%202" rel="nofollow">http://www.happypenguin.org/show?Globulation%202</a> ) that suggest to me that it's in the top-tier of usage for its market.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> No claims of notability. Looks like fun and I am a big fan of open source software but this does not seem notable.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - I think most of the comments above miss the point: there is a fairly broad spectrum of accusations that Judaism discriminates against non-Jews. Most of these accusations come from antisemitic sources, but there are also less rabid sources, such as <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Shahak_0de1.html" title="Israel Shahak">Israel Shahak</a> and other commentators. The accusation exists, and if nothing else, it has become a central theme of antisemitism. I see it as something like the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">blood libel</a>, which has its own entry. Obviously, the term "blood libel" carries its own judgment about the accuracy of the accusation, and I think this article ought to make more clear that the term is an accusation rather than a phenomenon that everyone recognizes. But the fact is that there is a pretty big body of claims of anti-Gentilism and responses to these claims, and I think it is appropriate for an encyclopedia to recognize this fact. "Anti-Gentilism" seems a reasonable name to give to an article on this exchange, although if someone could point me to another article that addresses the matter (I think "blood libel" is too specific), I could see merit in deleting this one. -- DLH <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.82.9.92_6c1f.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.82.9.92">66.82.9.92</a> (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.82.9.92.html" title="User talk:66.82.9.92">talk</a>) 15:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is pretty clearly going down. I have the impression that most people read the "-ism" suffix as connoting a more cohesive social phenomenon than I do, which is fine: the meaning of a word is whatever most people think it is, and, no, I would not say that the term "Anti-Gentilism" with the connotation of meetings to plot how to screw the goys, etc., needs an encyclopedia entry. But I still think the exchange of accusations of discrimination against non-Jews and responses to the accusations is something that merits notice, possibly as a subtopic in the antisemitism article, as I think someone suggested above. Thoughts? -- DLH 66.82.9.92 06:07, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The militarism of space is an issue of serious concern. This group appear to be notable within the sphere of interest in which it operates and I value the way in which Wikipedea opens my mind to new ideas. Whilst possibly bring an element of humour to the subject, that is nevertheless a valid approach in the situationalist art / activist worlds (I guess - not being an artist myself).

<p>Formerly a rather vainglorious article from what seem to be the same anonymous editors who also puffed other far-right topics of no real significance outside of a tiny minority of disaffected Tories (e.g. Gregory Lauder-Frost and the Western Goals Institute). Cleaned by SandyDancer, but on reviewing the sources I find that all are essentially the group itself (its publications, its founder or a single interview with its founder), with the exception of a single story in City Limits about one party the group organised. Gets 20 unique Googles outside Wikipedia, and Wikipedia and mirrors account for more than half of all the hits overall. Nothing on Factiva. Group appears to have been active for less than five years, which is probably why. Whether Hart is notable I would not like to say, but I'd say this group was of no demonstrable significance. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 18:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm also willing to accept lower Ghits for a UK than a US organization, due to the UK's smaller population. --<font color="#00CC00"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:#dd3300;border:thin solid black;background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></font> 07:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, I live in England, you know, and I've no memory at all of this lot - and this was a time when I was politically active, a regular on the Radio 4 letters slots (worked with John Humphrys' ex-wife) and active on the UK Politics forums, I still have an archive of my long discussing with Vincent Hanna somewhere. Honestly, I can't find any evidence that this group had any significance outside the minds of its members. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:03, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'd forgotten this group's name, but certainly remember their activities. Though a small organisation, its influence was very real. The named members are certainly significant, the campaigns they started or influenced were not minor, the money behind them was very real. Too much in there about Perle - he wasn't a member - but that they could get him to support is in itself an indication of their importance. So there's not much on Google. So what? It predates Google. I'm surprised that <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a> never heard of them (or the campaigns they mounted) but perhaps the give away is that he was <i>a regular on the Radio 4 letters slot</i> - what does that mean????

<li>The issue, I understand, is verifiability rather than notability. Are the Hotpoint and Zanussi articles considered adequately verified at the moment? If so, the Servis article is equally-well verified, with links to the websites of the company itself and its parent company. If not, additional information is needed for all three articles; what sort of information would this be? <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 17:00, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've done some more research and I agree with JROBBO. I think the material should be merged with the Mercy Ministries section of the Youth With A Mission article.

<li><b>Keep but help us to make the page better</b> I am the contributor who first put this up on Wikpedia and I am still learning the ropes. Some coaching would be welcome. I have put in some cross referneces and rewritten sections of the article, I trust that this will set skeptical minds at rest. In answer to Kevin's comment on our financials - true we have few assets - we give everything we can away. The article about the millionth dollar clearly says that it is talking of funds donated over the past seven years. Our momentum is such that we should give away a million dollars every 2-3 years now. Yes we are part of Youth With A Mission but we are seperately run entity and to merge us into the larger YWAM pages would deny us the distinctive place we have cut for ourselves in Mercy Ministries - we are known as ARMS before we are recognised as being part of YWAM.<a href="../../../o/z/m/User%7EOzmercy_87be.html" title="User:Ozmercy">Ozmercy</a> 12:47, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry I may have put my comments on the wrong end of the debate and am not sure of the etiquet of moving them once they have been uploaded.

</ul>
<p>I will not make any further defense of who we are after this, you guys will have to do whatever it you are going to do, but I am surprised at some of the above comments. for instance I not sure why Sarah says that the article does say that ARMS is part of YWAM when the opening statement of the article reads <i>Australian Relief &amp; Mercy Services Ltd (ARMS) is a Christian aid and development organization that cares for the poor and needy both within Australia and overseas and is the mercy ministry arm of Youth With A Mission in Australia. The organization was founded in Canberra in 1988.</i> and links to the YWAM page.</p>
<p>With regards to the comments made about our budget size - regular NGOS have admin fees of 30% + that pay wages etc - we do not pay wages- all of our staff pay for their own travel - so effectively our budget could be measured as 30% higher than what it is - even though we have a small budget - our influence in some sectors of the industry is significant. Are we notable? I think so. But money and budget size does not define notability. Have we shown outside sources and news articles - yes. Do we seek organizational fame no. A lot of what we do we quickly and well. When we were in Iraq at the out break of the war we were the first western NGO to be operational in Iraq. The officer in charge of the Humaniatrain operations center medical response commended us on our work and ability to make a quick response - but there were no news articles about it, other than those we generated ourselves - but self praise is usually seen as no recommendation. When we were in Aceh Australian TV news covered our work in the refugee camps there and credited it to another agency who used the footage to fund raise for themselves nationally. We did the work but because of the inappropriate actions of others we lost the opportunity to tell our own story, as the Australian public saw that incident as being someone else. We find these things sad, but we are still detemined to do the work God has called us to whether any one recognises it or not. Thanks for taking time to comment on our aticle, I look forward to your final decision.<a href="../../../o/z/m/User%7EOzmercy_87be.html" title="User:Ozmercy">Ozmercy</a> 10:24, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The publication of someone's name in a newspaper does not mean we always carry it. Perhaps we have more integrity than they.

<li><b>comment</b> So by your own admission there is only one notable source reporting about this. The playboy coverage is skeptical unless cited. One source could have 1000 articles on the subject but <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requires multiple sources. I don't beleive the Arizona Republic is notable, regardless of the fact it covers all of Arizona. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Forum_of_Fargo-Moorhead_f48c.html" title="The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead">The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead</a> covers all of north dakota, though the primary distribution is the eastern part of the state, and the north-western part of Minnesota, however it has been said not to be a notable source.

<li>I don't believe there is any policy that declares state newspapers as a whole non-notable, particularly if it is the largest newspaper in the state and circulated throughout it.

<p>Nominated for AfD by 81.178.88.149. This is a procedural nomination - my opinion is <b>Neutral</b>. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 22:31, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Jude Rawlins, whoever he may be, is not prolific, interesting or significant. This page deserves to be removed as it spoils the entire wikipedia project, and was clearly written by Jude Rawlins himself. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.178.88.149_7d06.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.178.88.149">81.178.88.149</a> (<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User_talk%7E81.178.88.149.html" title="User talk:81.178.88.149">talk</a>) 22:33, 22 December 2006</small>

<li><b>Note</b> - The above anon editor has vandalized the page since nominating the AfD. Possibly bad-faith? <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 22:49, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The nomination makes a nonstandard argument against notability. But the article lacks reliable sources -- this and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subterraneans_%28band%29.html" title="Subterraneans (band)">Subterraneans (band)</a> are both largely sourced from a self-published autobiography by Rawlins. There is an intriguing magazine profile, but by itself this apepars to fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:02, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Additionally, Rawlins and Subterraneans lack AllMusic entries, and the claim of multiple film soundtrack works seems to be unverifiable without more information. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I find the nominator's behavior disturbing, but I can see no reason to keep the article in anything like its current form. It doesn't truly demonstrate notability, uses weasel words (he was "involved" in a Madonna album), and appears to be narcissistic self-promotion. <a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 22:54, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, it urgently needs independent non-trivial sources or we will see it nominated again <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 17:42, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, per Alf. I looked at the Google list; it appears that this is much more than a vanity article, but no source has individually compelling credentials, and the overall g-hits are not by themselves compelling. What I'm seeing is enough to dispute the premise of the nomination. I would bet that there are sources which could be found by a motivated editor. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 18:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and/or Merge</b> Sorry to throw a new suggestion into the mix but it seems that the almost single note worth keeping on this guy is that he is/was the leader of a mildly notable band <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subterraneans_%28band%29.html" title="Subterraneans (band)">Subterraneans (band)</a>. THink about what is worth keeping. Most of it reads as a user page or as a resume.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 00:46, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Agree with Nick Y - difficult to justify keeping this in. Having looked at <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subterraneans_%28band%29.html" title="Subterraneans (band)">Subterraneans (band)</a> which is the only notable justification for its presence I have to argue that Subterraneans itself has a pretty weak case for inclusion. I suspect both this and Subterraneans entries are vanity pieces and have numerous (cleverly worded) claimed associations, none of which have credible sources to substantiate their validity. If they did exist I'm sure they would be there, but suspect the clever wording is there to mask the non-existence of those sources in the first place. I know this sounds very cynical but I've seen a lot of this on Wikipedia and it annoys me!</li>

<li><b>Question</b> I read on his obituary he was the Canadian secretary of the World Peace Council. At first I assumed it would be a somewhat minor role, but according to the WPC article the Secretariat are one of the governing bodies. The WPC site has been done for (at least) several days, so I am unable to find any more information on this. How many members of the Secretariat were there, and I assume they were elected positions? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 09:00, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You know when I look at these again, especially the England one which he has worked on the most, I am beginning to think you are right. I still want to see where he is going with this beyond making lists but the articles do indeed seem to have been created prematurely. Especially the fact that he is trying to work on so many at the same time concerns me given his very low edit count.

<p>The whole idea was that I will create the infrastructure and then the federations themselves will fill it with the data. Only the federations keep record of how it all began , the history and so on. It must take some time , until the federation will fill it with content. If the article is to be deleted so quickly , I think that i will change the order of what I do&#160;: I will stop (of course) to create new articles, and wait till the federations will give me the material and then I will try to post it again.</p>
<p>If then you will think that it is to be deleted - so be it.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you, that was very informative. In light of what you just wrote I think the best situation would be for you to move the articles to subpages of your user page and work on them from there. I don't think it is a bad idea, in fact I think it is really great that you want to expand this apparently underrepresented topic here but keeping the individual country articles in main space right now probably isn't the best idea. I really hope it doesn't discourage you, it is meant as a help to give you peace and time to expand the articles without being concerned about someone trying to delete them. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 12:50, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Like stated above the editor of these articles clearly has good intentions and I don't see the reason why they should be <i>inherently</i> bad ideas. The problem is that rather than leaving the editor prone to biting of the newcomer it would be in his own best interest to work on these from within his userspace until he has gained experience and expanded these articles to a level where they are no longer candidates for deletion. We should not bite the newcomer but on the other hand there is no reason why the newcomer should be left vulnerable to such biting. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 09:05, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I hope that the updated version is nearer to what an article should be. I will wait now till you reach a decision, as it may be a waste of time to spend on other articles if the whole idea is incorrect.

<li><b>Comment</b> You are off to a better start now. First of all you need to stop putting your signature on the articles themselves.

<li>If that's true, you need to source the article much better. Since you know about some of these books, it sounds like it is possible. It would not be the first time a topic went from almost unanimous deletion to 'keep' when the article became much better sourced. As it is now it looks more like an ad for your blog rather than a legitimate topic that's been noted by the media. In addition to book sources, I think you'll need to provide some sign that the news media has recognized it as a concept/term. I'll change to keep it if it can be shown that this can be well-documented with multiple independent sources (which means a couple of sources beyond those pushing the concept directly). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 15:37, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree that there's perhaps no one using this term, I just thought it might make sense as a redirect. Now that I've read some of the linked websites, it seems that if they're what the article is meant to be about, then it's even more different from covenant marriage than I thought, though. I also wonder, from reading them, if there could be an article about those ideas. This article, though, doesn't seem to go conceptually with those references, even, so if there is something out there for there to be an article about, this isn't it (and apparently isn't the right name for whatever it is), so I'm still for deleting it. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 02:55, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Without firm sources, I'm doubtful whether this qualifies for inclusion. Possible neologism, possible synonym for other term, possibly "something made up"; on the other hand, possibly a groundswell of traditional values. An unimpeachable reference would go a long way to helping the community to decide. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 08:03, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Article Improved</b>:I have re-written the article with greater emphasis on its long established underlying principals as laid down by Helen Andelin. This topic does warrant its own entry as it does not fit with any other marriage or power exchange topic. The D/D, D/s and BDSM topics have a strong sexual and violence component which is not present in a Devotional Marriage. Equally this form of marriage due to its very traditional and conservative foundations is not defined in common law as a typical modern marriage. There is a very large following of these values within Western Society which makes this topic of interest to a wide range of people. -- User:DevotedMan 5 January 2007</li>

<li>Unfortunately it is still lacking references that are encyclopedic. You need "secondary sources" (sources which provided summary and analysis) not primary sources (like the Bible, which requires interpretation) or websites that are mostly run as personal sites.

<li>Now since you brought up the topic, discussions can go smoother if you define scientists and pseudo-scientists. -Paras Chopra
<ul>
<li>It is a term that enthusiastic students and other types of promoters (its a great title for a popular book that describes the real science) like to use to sex up an existing scientific field. It makes it sound cool since it uses the word "hacker" but there is not journal of "Biohacking", there are journals about "Computational biology", "Systems biology", "Molecular engineering" and what not. Just as there are no "hacker" job titles outside of a few fringe shops, there are "Software engineers", "Software developers", "Senior software analysis", etc. This is a slang term, which enthusiastic students such as yourself are attracted to since it is how you like to view yourself. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisWakefield_2552.html" title="User:ChrisWakefield">ChrisWakefield</a> 19:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>In my opinion, judging scientific fields from the journal names is not a very bright idea. Even if we use that to judge, If I start a journal named "Biohacking", would that make this term more acceptable to you than what it is right now? Also remember that terms such as "Software Engineers", etc. did not exist always, they were also coined some time in history and if Wikipedia were present at that time, Software Engineering would never have been allowed to be accepted as a scientific term. -Paras Chopra <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_59.180.123.247_0690.html" title="Special:Contributions/59.180.123.247">59.180.123.247</a> (talk) 16:00, 8 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>goethean, please stop besmearing me, I have set word to Larry V on this. U are the one who have gone on pages making unfounded accusations. No, I nominated this article because of the above reasons. I would appreciate if you would stop harrassing me and for being so arrogant.

<p>goethean look above - I said because of the above reasons - not notable, sounds more like an advertisement, just because Chicagoans, and I might assume from your statement above, are an Chicagoan, maybe u can make a Chicago Wiki, since its of local interest but as for an encylopedia, its not mean for such trivial local stuff. It seems like a bulletin at a local library inviting u to come to this festival. So there is my elaboration of the reasons for delete. Let people decide. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForrestLane42_e645.html" title="User:ForrestLane42">ForrestLane42</a> (<a href="../../../f/o/r/User_talk%7EForrestLane42_6867.html" title="User talk:ForrestLane42">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ForrestLane42_1faa.html" title="Special:Contributions/ForrestLane42">contribs</a>) 04:31, 3 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Clearly a stub, this festival is a major event. The article needs to be expanded and its importance added, but that shouldn't be too difficult to do. <a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 12:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>So Keep it is, but I think that the name of speakers is not necessarily at least it is a little less than a stub. If goethean reduces the name of speakers to many one or two, then I with draw my desire to delete this article. As for Eleuther, I do not mean to be "dueling" but goethean and I are at cross purposes and he has insulted my reputation that I will not tolerate. I think you have seen him in action, it is hard to be restrained when he posts messages on my talk page saying im harrassing him when he is the originator of the conflict. Eleuther I invite you to look at his archives, it is not just me who he has gotten into conflict with...there are least 5 or more previous incidents..<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForrestLane42_e645.html" title="User:ForrestLane42">ForrestLane42</a> 17:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)ForrestLane42</p>

<li><b>DELETE</b> This article is not notable and should be deleted. This festival is a minor one in Chicago, with very limited reach and interest and as such, need not be cluttering wikipedia with excess minutia.</li>

<p>As said, this festival has been long running, but this alone does not make it notable. I am for deletion of this article.<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalleyeone_d376.html" title="User:Walleyeone">Walleyeone</a> 16:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Mr. Nazim al-Qubrusi is a very prominent Sufi Scholar of North America. I understand due to his past links with Hisham Kabbani (probably the most hated North American by Wahhabies) they would hold a grudge against him as well. The votes for speedy deletions would be more of a very biased POV. (I would not understand why a Shia would share that grudge. Please educate me). I would vote to keep the article about everyone I would hate, and not call him not notable. I would however vote for removal of Honorific title <i>Shaykh</i> from the title. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHassanfarooqi_1cb2.html" title="User:Hassanfarooqi">Hassanfarooqi</a> 17:55, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Peter Dietrich has been featured on MLG's Pro Circuit on USA Network. MLG is a very significant league - it offers the most prize money for its permanant games and has broadcasted shows on USA Network featuring every single player and team on the list. Most if not all players have had articles written about them in their local newspaper. EGM magazine - the most popular gaming magazine (you can get it in any of your local pharmacy stores) regularly feature MLG and its best teams and players. Wall Street Journal published an article about the first contract deal MLG offered to its top gamers.</li>
<li><b>SMerge</b> to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Gaming_b3d2.html" title="Major League Gaming">Major League Gaming</a>. Isn't notable enough on his own to merit an article, but a brief mention (i.e. two or three sentences) in the MLG article wouldn't be out of line, something along the lines of the header at the top of his article as is not exists. It could go under a new section for "notable players", or somesuch. Failing that, <b>delete</b>, since it can't pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> on its own (due to a lack of reliable sources).

<li><b>Keep</b> Regarding James Hurtak: This person has two credible Ph.D.s and for the person who said founder member of the Mars Society what it says is founding member of the Mars society which I checked and it is true. Alice Coltrane is a very popular musican and is already listed in Wikipedia and this supports her reference. I see no reason to delete this person as he is an important person to have listed. He is connected also with the United Nations -- you cannot say that for too many people. Regarding "Keys of Enoch" although I don't see why these two are linked together -- there are now several independent science sources that have been placed at the end of that page and some interesting science sections that should be kept on Wikipedia. It appears to be a valuable source of information from something that has been a popular term in some circles for over thirty years.User: PriscillaW 1:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— Informed1212 (<a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInformed1212_9dbc.html" title="User talk:Informed1212">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Informed1212_78f2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Informed1212">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small> <small>— 24.6.140.56 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.6.140.56_82ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.6.140.56">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> Regarding the Keys of Enoch: this book is quite uncommon but definitely worth a read and already translated to about eight languages. Regarding James Hurtak: he is not very present in the net but his work has influenced a lot of different people and he did not write just one book, it is more like 20 books and papers not counting the audio books. The Keys of Enoch are just his main book and it is already over 30 years old. James Hurtak is also quite often a guest in TV and radio interviews. I already seen him twice in Austrian local TV. In my opinion the book and the author are defenitly notable. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaByte_f4ab.html" title="User:MetaByte">MetaByte</a> 01:20, 5 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaByte_f4ab.html" title="User:MetaByte">MetaByte</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MetaByte_3d86.html" title="Special:Contributions/MetaByte">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a “surface user” of Wikipedia I have never before added or contributed to an article (though use it often for encyclopaedic references). But seeing an article on Hurtak I felt it was about time someone did that. I am a psychotherapist working in Germany and first read about the Keys of Enoch in an article on somatic psychotherapy and biosynthesis in the renowned German journal ' 'Energie &amp; Charakter' ' where concepts of that book were taken in psychotherapeutic practice. (I have added the link.) The book contains valid concepts that have contributed to this work in Germany. Years later I heard Hurtak speak in Munich at the so-called "Genesis Symposium” where he spoke with physicists Simon Shnoll and V.P. Kaznacheev on cosmic radiation fields and their impact on mind and behaviour. Yes, I think the man is notable.Given the notability of both the book and the man, the two articles are probably not self-promotion as whoever wrote about Hurtak would almost certainly also post on Keys of Enoch.Soundscape12 07:02, 5 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— Soundscape12 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Soundscape12_53a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Soundscape12">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>And now that I look at it, the whole thing could do with a face-lift. How about we shift USA's list into a new page and expand on that there? At the same time, Canada,China,France, ie. all countries occupying major size on that page shifted to new pages. If all the larger countries have links, the page will turn tiny.

<dd><b>Question</b> This is confusing. What is being done? A "List of nuclear power plants" is useful. It's the sort of information people seek on the internet. By country would be good. <b>Keep</b> if this is what is going on, namely the discussion of whether or not to keep this list. A nuclear power plant is not the same as a nuclear reactor. A List of nuclear reactors could be a page with links to the various types of lists, although there are so many small research reactors, it seems unwieldy. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 20:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think it would be better to present list of nuclear power plant as a tables with detailed information by world regions, countries and plants.

<li><b>Comment</b> The tables do carry useful information, especially containing, as they do, the type of reactor at each facility.

<li><b>Comment</b> Where it turned up is that nuclear submarines, just like nuclear power plants, have nuclear reactors. You're suggesting that something with a nuclear reactor, nuclear power plants, be redirected to nuclear reactors. I'm asking if everything with a nuclear reactors should be redirected to nuclear reactors. Power plants, just like submarines have different types, coal-fired, natural gas, riveted boilers, welded boilers, different types of turbines, different types of coolants. So, nuclear power plants and nuclear submarines both have nuclear reactors. If nuclear power plants should be redirected to nuclear reactors, shouldn't everything else with nuclear reactors be redirected to nuclear reactors? And if not, why not? And if other things with nuclear reactors are not redirected to List of nuclear reactors, why should power plants with nuclear reactors be redirected there? By your submarine answer it seems that nuclear power plants should not be listed in List of nuclear reactors, but rather in List of power plants. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 20:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As for power plants, well, of course they're not all nuclear. Maybe I fail to see the point you're bringing up... you wish to redirect anything related to nuclear applications to this one page?

<li><b>Comment</b> Again, as above, if not everything, why set aside only power plants with nuclear reactors and require they be redirect to List of nuclear reactors?

<li>My most sincere apologies if I offended any reactor purists by even vaguely suggesting that one is <i>more</i> a reactor than the other. The fact of the matter still remains that nuclear submarines deserves to be listed under types of submarines. we're looking at the context here, are we not? as you've explained at length above, different submarines have different types, all the types and sub-types could be listed on one page. on that page would be a little heading 'nuclear submarines', and under that heading it would explain how reactors are used, and somewhere there would be a small link which takes you to 'list of nuclear reactors'. there is a <i>very</i> big difference between linking an article and re-directing one. <span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../x/c/e/User%7EXcentaur_defa.html" title="User:Xcentaur">xCentaur</a> | <a href="../../../x/c/e/User_talk%7EXcentaur_db5b.html" title="User talk:Xcentaur"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span> 20:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think we're even talking about the same subject, so there is not point in continuing. You seem to think that a nuclear reactor is the same thing as a nuclear power plant.

<li>I assure you, I know very well what you're talking about, don't clutter this page with your condescending assumptions. You miss my point here. Its absurd to <i>redirect</i> every single page related to reactors to the list in question. <span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../x/c/e/User%7EXcentaur_defa.html" title="User:Xcentaur">xCentaur</a> | <a href="../../../x/c/e/User_talk%7EXcentaur_db5b.html" title="User talk:Xcentaur"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span> 20:51, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not condescending, it's from your statements, and your failure to assert any reason why nuclear power plants, which are not nuclear reactors, should be in a list that redirects to nuclear reactors. That you consider something <i>absurd</i> is simply your POV, as you have offered no evidence for its absurdity, particularly in the face of your asserting, without any reasons, that one category of things that contain nuclear reactors should be treated as if they <i>are</i> nuclear reactors, while other categories of things that contain nuclear reactors should not be treated as if they were nuclear reactors. I have to understand the underlying reasons for a move in order to make a decision. I don't, so I asked. You haven't answered, and you have given no reasons, and you appear to again be equating nuclear power plants with nuclear reactors, as if you don't understand the difference--if you don't understand the difference, there is no point in discussing the issue with, or with you responding to my questions. If you do understand the difference, then user your understanding to clarify for me why you think only one class of things that contain nuclear reactors should be treated as if it is synonymous with nuclear reactors, but others shouldn't. If it's <i>absurd</i> to direct every single page, then why is it not absurd to direct some, and what is the qualifying characteristic for which ones should be redirected and which ones shouldn't? <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 21:56, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just to clarify,the list of nuclear power plants was taken from list of reactors, that is the only reason that I'm saying that we do not need two lists with the same content. Which is why for nuclear power plants, I suggested a re-direct, and not for everything else. Now, you can go ahead and re-direct a dozen pages, with my blessings.

The second one should be widely expanded (esp. USA section). I'm going to place links on these articles in "List of nuclear reactors" and to rewrite that article by splitting power plants and research reactors in different sections.

Regarding the <b>plant-reactor</b> discussion, I propose to simply use the general reference for reactors, as eg by the IAEA, numbering the reactors of the same plant (eg: Doel-1, Doel-2, Doel-3 and Doel-4 reactors for the Doel nuclear power plant or NPP). If you make a table, you name the reactors that way in the same column, and it at once makes it clear that they all belong to the same plant. Sorry I am totally new to Wikipedia, hope this comment is ok, sorry if not. --Jputte 13:11, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, this is standard American format, numbering the reactors. I didn't know it was IAEA, also, so, yes, it would have been clear, as the table is not complete, that this was what was done.

<p>Of course there are many mentions of iSkin in iPod accessory articles, but these are trivial coverage. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> 12:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article cites one press release only to establish ownership or at least claim of ownership to the trademark "Si" and it cites the <a href="../../../i/l/o/ILounge_5e68.html" title="ILounge">iLounge</a> blog only to establish that they won the award from that site. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> 16:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I direct your attention to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>: <i>"Newspaper stories that do not credit a reporter or a news service and simply present company news in an uncritical or positive way may be treated as press releases unless there is evidence to the contrary."</i> <a href="http://www.twice.com/article/CA6285952.html?q=iSkin+Offers+%271st%27+Dual%2DLayer+iPod+Shuffle+Protector" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.twice.com/article/CA6285952.html?q=iSkin+Offers+%271st%27+Dual%2DLayer+iPod+Shuffle+Protector" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> falls foul of this rule, and the Chattanooga Times Free Press story probably does as well.

<ul>
<li>My understanding is that stipulation is meant to identify press releases that are not identified as such, and it's quite clear to me that the TWICE article is not a press release. It was written by the staff at TWICE who do seem to be working off a press release (with their wording like "said to be" and "said the company"), but it is an independent source that found the product interesting enough to publish about it. The Chattanooga article was written by Kim Ossi of Knight Ridder Newspapers and picked up elsewhere; it is not a press release either. You are correct that the MarketWire and PRNewspaper sources are press releases, as I identified above. The "Legend Mobile" article <i>is</i> a press release, but from another company: Legend Mobile. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> 17:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Granted, the reviews/descriptions are quite small, but there's not much one can say about an iPod cover&#160;:-). What's important is that multiple publications found it notable enough to write about. I'm omitting the many very trivial coverages along the lines of "iSkin is a company that makes iPod covers" in an article about iPods. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> 03:05, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> After doing some checking, it seems that there are two articles, this one and <a href="../../../c/f/e/CFE_CFE738_4464.html" title="CFE CFE738">CFE CFE738</a>. As there is no company called "CFE" (as there is with <a href="../../../c/f/m/CFM_International_00c2.html" title="CFM International">CFM International</a>), it seems to me that <i>that</i> article should be the one eliminated. Yes, I understand that the CFE738 is a partnership between GE and Honeywell, but since GE is taking the lead in the marketing of it, I believe that the title should properly be that of this article. Therefore, I propose that this article be kept, and that the other article be redirected here. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 20:55, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The subject of this article is a sophomore, and while she has been named "poet laureate" of a county, I don't think that's nearly notable enough to be worth an article in Wikipedia. If she publishes some books or received some national award, she'd be as prominent as many of the 1,500 or so American poets who have articles here, and I wouldn't object.</p>
<p>As a resident of Wayne County, I assure you that this is a very prominent award in a very bland area of our country. Parrish is a local hero, adored by nearly all who call Eastern North Carolina home. I'd also like to point out that while you may feel that there are 1500 or so American poets with articles, many of these poets were not honored, revered, or even popular during their lives, becoming "prominent" after their deaths. To not recognize the up and coming poets of today goes against what makes Wikipedia great. Not making the poets of today known in their own lives, especially one that has won numerous awards during her short lifetime, is to turn us back to the times before such technologies such as the internet. During his lifetime, would you have allowed Edgar Allen Poe to have his own Wikipedia article?

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Rewrite</b> with Nuetrality and inclusion: I have nominated this article for deletion because it has a strong POV, it is poorly written, the sources are not cited, it contains original research. It is biased and exclusive of certain countries, see talk page. <b>Certain countries are always removed from the list despite valid content with references.</b> It is not of encyclopedic value but a collection of people opinions of racism by country. Some of the material here is copy and pasted and hence available in the respective sections. If offers nothing of value and is again a serious NPOV.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 05:24, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the claim that it has no references is false, although a large amount of text is unreferenced.

<p>Following the failure at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KDEN_TV_Tower_c9db.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KDEN TV Tower">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KDEN TV Tower</a> but overwhelming success elsewhere (see <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_Far2manymasts_c9a5.html" title="User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts">User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts</a> for fuller list) I'm relisting this reduced list for deletion on the grounds that the failure was but a random quirk of the system. Those in the previous nomination which were nominatively linked to radio/TV stations have now all been redirected tho the relevant broadcaster. This bunch of US radio and TV towers are below 360 meters tall, and we have deleted useless stubs up to 500m, and counting. None of the towers that I am nominating are notable in any way whatsoever, as far as I can tell. There was one mast (<a href="../../../c/h/c/CHCH_Television_Tower_39d5.html" title="CHCH Television Tower">CHCH Television Tower</a>), that was improved during the AfD, which could have been partly responsible for the train-wreck. None of these articles have any substantial additional information other than their name, location and height. This information already exists albeit in tabular form in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>, so I see no point in redirecting. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 05:04, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> As a former Kansas resident, I'm partial, but nearly anyone in Kansas would call Spangles notable (and delicious!) It's certainly as notable as or more notable than most of the bridges, neighborhoods, rivers, etc. that are all over Wikipedia. Nineteen restaurants seems good enough to be a chain to me. There's quite a few small chains with local notability, such as <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_Guys_da05.html" title="Five Guys">Five Guys</a> in DC/Virginia that are so locally popular and widespread that they meet notability standards based on reputation drift through tourism, migration, etc. and I think Spangles probably fits here. Also, the article does present quite a bit of verifiable information.--<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelvet_elvis81_65b4.html" title="User:Velvet elvis81">Velvet elvis81</a> 06:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Despite being relatively unknown on a national level, Spangles is one of only a handful of successful Wichita-only establishments, and is a full-fledged part of the city's culture. As a Wichita resident, I can verify that most citizens know all about Spangles, its commercials, and its oft-maligned spokeswoman, Rene Steven.--<a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoonyLeif_3c47.html" title="User:LoonyLeif">LoonyLeif</a> 23:00, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't believe the Westgarth Primary School (Marske) article should be deleted. If it is a real school and there is valid information presented in the article, it should be allowed to remain as a fact-providing, useful addition to Wikipedia. Perhaps someone could contact the school's administration and suggest they let the children decide what information should be included in the article as a project and lesson in sharing information. Deleting it seems silly if the article is or could be useful. Perhaps the powers that be should focus instead on removing articles that do not provide actual facts or contain facts that are of dubious or questionable origin. Someone, some day will probably search for Westgarth Primary School, and if the school is gone, this small but factual article may be all that remains of it.</p>

<p>The result was <b>No clear consensus</b> to delete. I had some difficulty evaluating this one. When we look at article on "fringe" subjects (such as pornography) we need to evaluate the notability within the context of the subject. In this case I believe that Bob made a strong argument <i>within the context of the industry</i>. However, the arguments for delete were also compelling on a more fundamental level of what constitutes notability. Hopefully when this comes up again in a few months Bob's predictions of continued success will make this issue moot. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 19:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good morning! My name is Bob Preston. I'm the executive editor at XFANZ. I submit these reasons for why we're not spam:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>We make no money from our users.</b> None. It's free to join our site. Like many Web 2.0 enterprises, we make money from ad revenue.</li>
<li><b>We're a legitimate news outlet.</b> We're an offshoot of XBIZ.com, a prominent trade Web site and publication that covers the adult industry. For the record, I offer the Alexa ranking of XBIZ as proof of its popularity. Today their aggregate ranking is 7,777: <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=xbiz.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=xbiz.com" rel="nofollow">[70]</a> XFANZ, by contrast, is a consumer site. Think of us as Entertainment Weekly for the adult biz. For the record, we launched on October 2, and we're steadily climing up Alexa's rankings: <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=xfanz.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=xfanz.com" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> OK, so we cover the adult industry. Pretty goofy, right? But Wikipedia has made room in its annals for two entries on Adult Video News, another prominent publication and Web site that covers the adult biz: <a href="../../../a/v/n/AVN_Magazine_c136.html" title="AVN Magazine">AVN_Magazine</a> <a href="../../../a/v/n/AVN_Awards_0318.html" title="AVN Awards">AVN_Awards</a> But besides AVN, Wikipedia also offers dozens -- if not hundreds -- of other articles on the adult industry, including (at a glance) at least a dozen entries on news outlets, blogs, magazines and Web sites that cover the adult industry or human sexuality in general:<a href="../../../p/o/r/Category%7EPornography_aa0a.html" title="Category:Pornography">Category:Pornography</a></li>
<li><b>We're Web 2.0, all the way.</b> (I offer this on a more qualitative, emotional level.) We started XFANZ to offer Web-savvy porn fans a way to interact and connect with each other and porn stars. We offer (again, for free) a full community, a full forum and a growing library of viral videos. Our news stories all have social bookmarking tags (reddit, del.icio.us, Fark). We also have future plans to add other Web 2.0 features, including a social bookmarking portal and a full viral video service, a la YouTube.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd><b>In closing:</b> Pursuant to previous notes we've received from Wikipedia editors, we're going through our entry to streamline it and add citations for all the factual claims we make Guys, we fully realize that a lot of jerks from the adult industry have abused Wikipedia. We really want to be a part of the Web 2.0 community and a part of Wikipedia. Thanks for your time! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by JeeBee25 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JeeBee25_4c04.html" title="Special:Contributions/JeeBee25">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<ul>
<li>Good evening, guys. I thought I'd answer the "non-notable" charge. My response has two parts:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>I would politely direct anyone to re-read what I said about our commitment to Web 2.0 development. <b>We are the first community-based adult industry portal that goes straight to the fans.</b> The only other site that even resembles us is XPeeps.com, which caters directly to the industry only and doesn't offer any of the news, interviews or videos that we do.</li>
<li>OK, I've done some reading about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">notability guidelines</a> for Wikipedia. I'd like to call your attention to the seventh prong: <i>Content that is distributed by independent online sites will almost certainly satisfy the first criterion However, this criterion ensures that our coverage of such content will be complete regardless. For example, Ricky Gervais had a podcast distributed by The Guardian. Such distributions should be nontrivial. Although GeoCities and Newgrounds are exceedingly well known, hosting content on them is trivial.</i></li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Many Web sites use XFANZ RSS feeds for their news content. One prominent site that uses our content is Booble.com (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booble" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booble" rel="nofollow">Booble's Wikipedia entry</a>), the adult search engine: <a href="http://booble.com/nation/" class="external autonumber" title="http://booble.com/nation/" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> You'll see that <b>we are the sole news provider for one of the most popular adult search engines on the Web</b>. Based on our unique combination of adult industry coverage, Web 2.0 development and prominence on outside Web sites, we satisfy the requirements for notability by Wikipedia's own guidelines. We've also demonstrated our willingness to accept and implement notes from Wikipedia editors. We're <i>delighted</i> to do it. I respectfully submit that no common spammer would do this. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by JeeBee25 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JeeBee25_4c04.html" title="Special:Contributions/JeeBee25">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm at work and can't poke around regarding adult websites so I can't really evaluate the notability of the article. I did however want to note for Bob Preston that arguing for the retention of this article by citing other articles that you believe are less notable than yours is an invalid argument. See <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>. The notability of one article has no bearing on the notability of another. Naming off articles you think are less notable than yours won't bolster your case. It'll probably just get the other articles nominated too. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:57, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- Bob, I have to thank you for your willingness to come up with ways to make the article work. That being said, my personal feeling is that Xfanz and the other adult sites you mention are all not notable, despite their inclusion in WP. I've voted against more than one adult site that has ended up being included, and will likely continue to. My personal feeling is that the sites in general do not have the independent, empirical citations and sources necessary to qualify as notable. Is this something that you can fix by a wave of a wand? I don't think so, unless you can get citations in either the mainstream media or in the technically-oriented (i.e., sites like Slashdot or other web-centric sources) media in very short order. I don't consider my stance to be an arbitrary one, but I do consider it to be a significant litmus test that must be passed, in my opinion, to be notable. In terms of your other contention (no ordinary spammer would do this), I would agree with you, and would not term you a spammer. However, I would question whether or not you understand that Wikipedia is not a promotion vehicle. A site, company or entity does not have a 'right' to be here, per se, and shouldn't be here simply because it exists. I can't see your company being included in Encyclopedia Brittanica, and I can't imagine you working this much to get your site included there. As a result, my earlier vote to delete Xfanz stands. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 21:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Weak Delete</s>. First, let me thank Bob for his courteous writing here (I took the liberty of indenting responses for readability). I agree the article isn't spam. Unfortunately, Xfanz seems too new to have gained much notice, which is really what <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia: Notability</a> is all about. It may be used by <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booble.html" title="Booble">Booble</a>, but, frankly, Booble isn't incredibly notable itself, so I don't think that makes it meet criteria 3 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The sorts of things that really would prove notability would be coverage from unrelated sources, especially the mainstream press. I don't see that yet, perhaps it will come, and when it does we should have an article on it. If there are two unrelated non-trivial articles about Xfanz, I'll change my opinion. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 22:21, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

The point is that this site is for building an encyclopedia which requires a certain level of neutrality. Since you have a vested interest in XFANZ, the fact that you are a major contributor to the article forces the rest of us to question and scrutinize the neutrality of the information provided by the article. This is not acceptable practice and goes against the guidelines (just as you should not start a Bob Preston article even though you may have enough notability for arguing with a Baldwin to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>). If you are notable enough, then someone else will write an article about you...which is also usually a good litmus test for <i>prima facia</i> notability too (and not a back-door shoestring attempt at having your RSS feed hosted on a back-scratching company's website who buys advertising on your own site). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 02:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Bob here again:</b> Guys, thanks for all the feedback. I need, however, to reiterate a previous point I made in reponse to Anon:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Anon, with respect, asking for mainstream press coverage of an adult site -- no matter how notable -- is a pretty onerous requirement.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My problem here dovetails with an earlier complaint I made -- that Wikipedia includes dozens (if not hundreds) of articles about the adult industry and adult performers. I retracted an earlier argument I had made about those other articles being less notable than the Xfanz article. I'm not advancing that argument again.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's what I <i>am</i> arguing: The requirement for <i>mainstream</i> press coverage to satisfy the notability requirement for an adult entry is not only onerous, but would -- by definition and mandate -- automatically <i>preclude</i> virtually all entries about pornography. That unleashes a host of freedom-of-speech issues, but -- like Mhking said -- something doesn't deserve to be on Wikipedia just because it exists.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mhking, though, did say that coverage by a tech-oriented blog (like Slashdot) would satisfy him. I cited two entries on the popular adult blog Fleshbot.com -- <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=fleshbot.com" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=fleshbot.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa ranking 3,320</a> -- but no one here even acknowledged them. Here they are again:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Here's some coverage from the prominent adult blog <a href="http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/events/porn-valley-dispatch-the-shay-debut-210218.php?mail2=true" class="external text" title="http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/events/porn-valley-dispatch-the-shay-debut-210218.php?mail2=true" rel="nofollow">Fleshbot</a> about our launch party, which featured Dave Navarro and his band The Panic Channel.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<li><b>Additional comment</b>; I would argue that Fleshbot is not a mainstream tech-oriented news aggregator in the same vein as Slashbot. The only coverage you have offered in a mainstream vehicle is the debate you had with Baldwin. That, simply, is not enough to warrant inclusion, as the article (Xfanz) still (IMO) does not meet the qualifications of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 22:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Ju66l3r, with respect,</b> I disagree with your assessment of the KSEX article I linked, and I simply don't see how the participation of an XFANZ staff member -- no matter who it was -- in that debate wouldn't raise the profile of the entire company. When someone appears in a political debate, say, doesn't their appearance benefit the image of their party? Or when an author appears in a televised debate, doesn't that automatically raise the profile of his or her works?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I respectfully submit that it's disingenuous to argue that my appearance in that debate didn't raise the profile of XFANZ.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This leaves us with the self-promotion issue. I've read Wikipedia's guidelines about this, and here's what I take issue with:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. How does an Xfanz entry on Wikipedia even <i>benefit</i> us? The only search-engine-related change I've noticed happens when I search for "xfanz" -- Google returns our Wikipedia entry third or fourth, but that would only happen when someone was already looking for Xfanz to begin with.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2. Without the intrinsic benefit of having a Wikipedia entry, this brings me back to why we got flagged for deletion to begin with -- the assertion that our entry was spam. User Artw initially flagged us, and when we asked him why, offered only this:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The article (by XFANZ TEAM) is IMHO clearly spam. I have no idea what the actual site is like and do not care.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Suffice it to say, Artw's rudeness bothered me, to say nothing of his baseless declaration that we're spam.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>I'm also delighted to report that everyone who has taken the time to respond here has proven themselves the opposite of Artw. Thank you for taking the time to respectfully mount your arguments. I appreciate it.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With respect, I believe that I've answered that claim gamely here. At least two respondents here have conceded that our entry isn't spam, and most of the rest of the respondents have fallen back on the notability complaint, which I also believe I've answered.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the self-promotion charge, I dovetail my complaint with my unhappiness with Artw:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I respectfully submit that the conflict of interest and notability guidelines -- especially regarding the adult industry -- need revision. I admit that my experience with Wikipedia is a fraction compared to everyone here, but as a member of the adult industry, I find these guidelines to be insufficiently fleshed-out and arbitrarily enforced.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A Wikipedia page filled with hundreds of links to free-hosted galleries and affiliate links (for, say, Tera Patrick) that would clearly benefit one user? That's spam.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A Wikipedia entry for a prominent website (within the adult industry) made in good faith by a user clearly willing to abide by Wikipedia's editorial feedback and guidelines -- and that has no immediate financial or traffic-generating benefit? I certainly don't think that's spam, and I (again, respectfully) submit that Wikipedia has room for such an entry.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On a side note, I readily concede that even though I'm an Internet geek, I'm hardly an expert on search-engine theory or application. If there is some robust benefit that comes from having a Wikipedia entry, please just let me know.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On another side note, how long does this process go on? Will a higher-lever Wikipedia administrator make the final call?</dd>

<p>The result was <b>MOVE TO PROJECT SPACE</b>. Basically, the arguments that this list as it currently stands is not sourced and therefore is, or is subject to, point of view issues is pretty telling. Will Beback's comparison to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a> is interesting; it's possible in my opinion that if this list was sourced as rigorously as that list that it <i>might</i> have a place in article space. Flat-out deletion seems unnecessary to me; projects are allowed a fair amount of leeway in their material, and this list with its disclaimer is not really defamatory to the point where its a problem, I don't think. And it certainly seems useful as a navigation tool for editors doing work on the subject. I'm not sure if it should go to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Pseudoscience_7116.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience">Wikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Rational_Skepticism_4cea.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Rational Skepticism">Wikipedia:WikiProject Rational Skepticism</a> or somewhere else, so I chose the former, editors may correct this as appropriate. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:04, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This unsourced list uses <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel words</a> to tarnish various topics and people with the pejorative term "quack" by stating that some people consider these things "related to" quackery. Discussions on the talk page indicate an unwillingness to provide evidence for an article's inclusion in the list, an explanation of the reasons, or a grouping of list articles in the belief that that would indicate a POV.</li>
<li>The attribute "quack" is in essence an opinion rather than a hard fact. Opinions must be attributed to a source worth quoting. A list of opinions solely of those who support e.g. evidence based medicine over alternative medicine (no matter how worthy those opinions might be), would make an inherently POV list.</li>

<dd>The list is very careful to not express any opinion either way on any subject. No labelliing is being used for very obvious reasons. Any POV problems are in the eyes and thoughts of the beholder. This list is an attempt to avoid the problems that were involved with the now deleted quackery category, where the cat. tag was attached to articles without any comment, thus labelling the article. The editor above has misunderstood and misrepresented what is happening, and any conflicts will be because the concept is hated, and because editors will be tempted to include labeling and POV. Such labelling should not be allowed, and such editorial errors are not a legitimate reason for deleting the list. The list contains strong cautionary notes only visible in the editing mode. I suggest that anyone who investigates this matter read them before making any decision.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b><s>Strong keep</s></b> (change to blank page, but leave talk history, see below) The list is a resource for students of the subject and even a casual examination of the content <s>(something the editor above seems not to have done)</s> shows that there are subjects, organizations, and persons on all sides of the issues. None of them are labeled as to their particular affiliation with the subject. Their respective articles can do that. This list is not for labelling anyone, and the attempt to delete it is an editorial attempt (by some editors) to suppress what is seen as opposing POV, in spite of the fact that such POV is not attached to any item on the list. Let readers come to their own conclusions.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is for presenting all major POV, and significant minority POV -- without taking sides -- and the articles listed are representative of subjects of interest to debunkers as well as promoters of quackery. Editorial POV suppression is a violation of NPOV policy and should not be allowed here. The concept of quackery is very real, it exists, and it is unpopular with those who believe in it. They would love to delete the word and attempts to expose quackery. Such attempts should not be allowed to move from the real world and into Wikipedia. The list is still in its beginnings and it should be allowed to develop and strengthen as a valuable resource. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 16:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>For people and organisations to be "related to quackery" they pretty much have to be involved in quackery or a campaigner opposed to it. The reader is not given the option of "neither involved in nor campainging against quackery" (i.e. "quietly involved in mainstream medicine"). Therefore an opinion is being advanced that requires sourcing.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>For treatments and practices to be "related to quackery", the logical conclusion the reader will make is that someone thinks they (wholely or partly) are considered quackery.

<dd><b>My apologies</b> for what is taken as a personal attack. I was indeed irritated by what still appears to be a "reading into" the list of something that is deliberately avoided, which is the idea of providing labels, which would indeed create serious NPOV issues. Even without any labelling and with very strong cautions against it in the editorial notes (invisible to readers) and talk page, there are still attacks (from many) based on what appears to be an assumption that such labelling is actually occurring, yet no one can point to evidence of such. If fact it is repeatedly discouraged. Even if it might not be outright stated (above) to be the case (and it seems to to me to be outright stated), readers who don't see the list itself will likely get the impression that POV labelling is actually occurring, which is not the case. I just want to make sure no one comes away from reading the AFD nomination above with that false impression. I will exercise good faith and assume that that was not Colin's intention, but that is the impression I got, and I know the content and cautionary messages very well! If I got that impression, how many others coming here will still get that impression, and then vote accordingly? I'm sure it wasn't Collin's intention, but maybe he could revise the wording to avoid that implication? (Unfortunately voting is already occurring based on a false impression, and even attempting to convey a false impression independently of the AFD nomination above.) -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 19:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect that much of the problem hangs on what meaning one attaches to the word "related". I didn't choose the title, but have interpreted it broadly, since a narrow definition would immediately justify deletion. I want this list to be a resource for all parties, so "relation" refers to any concept, method, profession, organization, or person who has ever (including historical) been associated with the concept of quackery, whether on the "receiving end" of accusations, or on the accusing end, or on the study end (hence the inclusion of various terms related to psychology, logic, law, etc.). Thus it becomes a broad NPOV resource that is totally lacking here. (The articles themselves can do the labelling and have the NPOV problems!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When the category was deleted, it was then suggested that a list would be better, but the list is still not acceptable to those opposed to the existence of the word. They won't be content until the word quackery is removed from the face of the earth. Without the category or a list, how can students of the subject be enabled to study what Wikipedia has to say on each topic?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The long and bitter controversies that surrounded the Category:Quackery led to the deletion of the category. Why? Because of NPOV issues that can be dealt with in articles, but not in categories:</dd>

<dd>I think can see where you are coming from now and the problem is perhaps few people take your broad <i>no offence intended</i> view of "related to quackery". Try replacing the word with "fraud" or "dishonesty" and you should see why people don't want to be associated in the slightest with those words. A well sourced and informative list can be so so much better than a category. You're just not allowed deliberately bare unsourced lists in article namespace. I sympathise with your desire to find a way to collect related articles for researchers. A solution in this hotly contested subject won't be easy. Clicking "What links here" on the Quackery article is a poor-man's solution. Perhaps shorter, more focused and well sourced lists (not necessarily stand-alone) are the way to go. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 22:59, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a false charge. No one has used the term about anything or anyone on that list. It's a mixed bag and if readers supply the term in their own head, that is their own doing. In real life one can with impunity (in the USA) call anyone a quack without any legal consequences. That has been decided in court. I'm not recommending one do so without evidence, but that's the case. Free speech allows pejoratives, and since the concept is a serious issue that costs people their lives and money, it is far more than a mere pejorative, but a term describing a serious problem that should not be disparaged and ignored. The government (especially the FDA and FTC) certainly recognizes it as a problem, and deals with it within certain limits. It is in that sense (not as a pejorative) that it is used here at Wikipedia, and whenever I rarely use the term about anyone. It is then a descriptive term for actual behavior that can be documented, and not a careless pejorative. (There are a select few scammers for whom I reserve the term.) When others perceive the use as being a pejorative, it is often because they feel hit, which reveals their own self-described position on the subject. I can't say if that's the case here, but that's often how it is with many objectors, and that is not my fault, or the fault of the list, or of the term. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 20:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Just a relation to it. Both sides of the issues are present in the main articles. The list is the only way for students to resource so many different articles. Without this list it would be impossible to find and research the subject. I hope Wikipedians understand this list is an educational tool for readers of the subject. Perhaps, any misunderstanding are now cleared up. Additionally, there is a strong disclamer paragraph at the top explaining about the list does not define the article or subject as a quack, just a relation to it in some way. The reader can read any article and can easily come to their own conlusions. Again, the list is an extremely helpful educational tool. Possibly, expanding the first paragraph will avoid any more misunderstandings in the future. On that note. This is an article listing. Nothing more. Lists on Wikipedia is encouraged.

<li>Greetings Colin. I think you are misunderstanding the title of "The list of articles related to quackery". The title which I carefully named and created actually has a double meaning. Related to quackery has a broad meaning. For example, a person who is opposed to quackery. Lots of people are gladly and willing to be associated with quackery. Skeptics are associated with quackery. The FDA is associated with quackery. Consumer advocates are associated with quackery. I, the QuackGuru, is related to quackery. We need to give the reader a little credit and allow them to come to their own conclusions. In conclusion, there needs to be a resource for people to learn and educate themselves on this topic. This is only possible by creating a broad list. Thank you. --QuackGuru 01:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I don't get this "article" at all. I think it is a reaction to the recent deletion of the pejorative category "Quackery". Anyhow, there is nothing encyclopedic about this article. It just lists a couple editors opinions. What qualifies something to be on this list? A subject merely being related to quackery? Who says the subject is related? How closely related does it have to be? The wording at the top is pretty weasel-ly and in the end says nothing. This is a lot of POV pushing and WP:OR. I can't imagine this being any help to anyone other than the person who needs to fullfill some inner desire to see these subjects and quackery existing somewhere together in Wikispace. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevine2112_645e.html" title="User:Levine2112">Levine2112</a> 02:01, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There are several problems with this list. The vague and fuzzy criteria for inclusion in the list violate WP rules that state that a list should have a precise scope. It also opens for endless edit wars with no way of determining who is right.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(It also gives POV warriors in the pro Alt Medicine camp a tool to make a mockery of the list and destroy it by including everything under the sun: US Senate, Ronald Reagan, senator Kerry, Coca Cola Company, Monsanto, Prozac, Prilosec, Zoloft, Paracetamol, Merck, Wyeth, CNN, Nature, Financial Times, NY Times, JAMA, European Commission, Spain, US army, FBI, Truman Capote, Kevin Costner, Sharon Stone, Snoop Dog, Rolling Stones, organic chemistry, all amino acids, genocide, carbon, zinc, selenium, lead, magnesium, the Hubble Telescope, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also have problems with the claimed purpose of the list as a “guide to the subject”. Making a list with a disclaimer is new to Wikipedia. In my mind it is a self-serving and hypocritical trick to deceive readers and circumvent WP rules about verifiability of claims. The “quack-busters” lost the debate over the Category Quackery that got deleted. Now they want to reintroduce a way of indirectly labeling everything outside conventional medicine as “related to quackery”.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the list is not deleted I can foresee endless POV wars when the Quackbusters will try to add reciprocal See Also links from most of the mentioned articles. The readers of the other articles will only see the link but not the disclaimer, and hence be deceived.</dd>

<dd>No its not a straw man but the obvious conclusion from observing the deeds and actions of the “Quackbusters” – on Quackwatch and here on Wikipedia.

<p><b>Riddle</b> Here is a riddle for us: According to the article on Quackery, A "quack" is "a fraudulent or ignorant pretender to medical skill. A person who pretends, professionally or publicly, to have skill, knowledge, or qualifications he or she does not possess; a charlatan." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackery" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackery" rel="nofollow">Quackery</a></p>
<p>Now for some bizarre reason, Linus Pauling, the only winner of two unshared Nobel Prizes makes this list either as a quack or is related to quackery, but ex-psychiatrist Stephen Barrett, who failed his boards yet has represented himself in courts of law as an expert witness in psychiatry, is considered by his disciples to be the expert/guru/clearinghouse of who is and isn't a quack. Shouldn't he be considered a quack, too?</p>
<p>Links to Stephen Barrett Enterprises sites(Donations gladly accepted!) are liberally sprinkled here and around WP by his followers. Shouldn't his sites logically be purged from Wikipedia as unreliable? Just some thoughts that strengthen my reasons as to why this list should be removed. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteth_a418.html" title="User:Steth">Steth</a> 13:58, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Though an attempt to find a way to present the concept of quackery without naming names is not without merit, this method is an example of why avoiding NPOV doesn't work. It confuses the reader and leaves the wrong impression about most of the articles listed, creating a feeling of nonsensical disbelief. If this has some value to Quackbusters, so be it.. put it in a work space and use it for whatever purposes it might have value for, but I would think it will only take up space because they already know what they want on the list. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 15:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> &amp; <b>Relocate</b> - the list contains many topics that I personnally indeed do view as more of a New-Age religious belief system than real verifiable scientific clinical therapeutic systems. As such some form of collection of articles on twaddle (for want of a better term) seems useful.
<ul>
<li>1) However the term "quackery" is problematic - it presumes a deliberate intent to mislead or defraud customers, and whilst much of alternative medicine I would perceive as mis-guided or wishful thinking, I am sure that most practitioners of homeopathy, accupuncture or herbal medicine do not have criminal intent to lie. Whereas any claims from someone practising <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_healing.html" title="Crystal healing">Crystal healing</a> as curing cancer I might so view. I think items in the list that contains this term must, as far as an encyclopaedia trying to protect itself from any libel liability, be only practices for which <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sourced</a> third parties have made the claim.</li>
<li>2) The second problem with the list is "related". I appreciate that this allows inclusion of both for and against articles, but its usage in the article is so wide as to make the list less useful. As an example <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_bias.html" title="Confirmation bias">Confirmation bias</a> is a straight forward piece on psychology of interpreting results and data, but is it useful to so include it in the list between <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complication_%28medicine%29.html" title="Complication (medicine)">Complication (medicine)</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consciousness_causes_collapse.html" title="Consciousness causes collapse">Consciousness causes collapse</a> (that concious thought has quantum effects thus linking meditation with hard science)?</li>
<li>3) As MaxPont mentioned above, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pseudosciences_and_pseudoscientific_concepts.html" title="List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts">List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts</a> seems a better constructed list, i.e. has more clearly defined purpose and inclusion criteria. The maintanece of the two lists seems duplication, and whilst I would vote to keep a modified form of List of articles related to quackery if it were the ony list, for now I vote for relocating the information; but I welcome opinions as to why these are different or separately worthwhile.</li>
<li>Should not therefore this list be dissipated - some items already included in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pseudosciences_and_pseudoscientific_concepts.html" title="List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts">List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts</a>, others might be moved there (and that might include the articles dealing with underlying concepts needed in understanding the scope of pseudocience such as the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_bias.html" title="Confirmation bias">Confirmation bias</a> article). Other topics perhaps should be incorporated into <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackery.html" title="Quackery">Quackery</a>, or the concepts that distinguish conventional from alternative scientific opinion might be mentioned under <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a> (or if specific to a particular scientific discipline, then under that subject e.g. <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">Medicine</a>).</li>
<li>Finally suggestions for project space seem one means of covering much of the information, but that too I forsee as problematic - it will be objected too as POV as might <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allopathy.html" title="Allopathy">Wikipedia:Wikiproject Allopathy watch</a>. In essence it is really just an attempt to ensure that NPOV guidence is maitained across scientific/medical topics, namely that minority opinions whilst needing to be mentioned do not need to be given equal space in the encyclopaedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm leaving my vote as 'Delete' (already registered above). This is just a comment on moving the list to project space. The latter space is not a Wild West for defamatory material. If you do move the list, I advise you shouldn't call it 'List of articles related to quackery'. Instead it should be the work list of some project (formal or informal) whose mission could be explained. For example, a 'List of articles in topic areas where bad medicine is sometimes alleged'. I.e. explain how the list relates to a project, formal or informal, and then show how the project's activities are using the list to develop better articles. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a></li>

<dd>That sounds like a good idea. I support first moving it to project space (WikiProject Pseudoscience sounds good) and using another name without the Q word. Then blank this list ASAP so it doesn't continue to detract from our other tasks here. In the project space it can get pared down and some parts merged into the existing articles and lists. (Merging takes time, and this list shouldn't exist here while it's going on.) There they will fit in better, and with good sourcing.

<dd>The difference between a pseudoscience (science, including medicine) list and a quackery (only medicine) list is simple -- they overlap alot, but are not identical. Not all pseudoscience ends up as quackery, and not all quackery is based in pseudoscience. Some quackery (a minority of cases) is just plain criminal fraud, while most of it involves no deliberate fraud, but is based in pseudoscience, ignorance, faulty education, well-meant attempts by true believers, etc.. "Quackery's paramount characteristic is promotion ("Quacks quack!") rather than fraud, greed, or misinformation. Most people think of quackery as promoted by charlatans who deliberately exploit their victims. Actually, most promoters are unwitting victims who share misinformation and personal experiences with others." While quackery and quacks deserve criticism, it's the actual frauds and scammers that deserve most attention, exposure, and often prosecution. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 09:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I find it astonishing that in this, your very first edit, you were so well versed in Wikipedia code and programing. I've been here for nearly a year now and I hardly understand anything beyond leaving comments or adding or deleting a word here-and-there. Have you edited on Wikipedia before under a different name or IP address? Or did you study Wikipedia editing policy a lot before making this first edit. I understand that as a Quack Buster you like to point fingers a lot and feel it is your duty to tell others who is to blame for all of their troubles. Just remember what happens when you point at others ~ you end up with three fingers pointing back at you (and your thumb is pointing up at God or something). I've seen the Assume Good Faith policy brandied around here and I think this is as good a time as any for its invocation. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDoctorIsIn_634b.html" title="User:TheDoctorIsIn">TheDoctorIsIn</a> 18:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is some discussion on the talk page about this issue. It would appear <i>both</i> sides have canvased for contributors using email, talk pages and project pages. QuackGuru has himself asked editors to reconsider their "vote". I don't see any evidence that this debate has been overwhelmed by one group of editors or that such canvansing has always produced the result the canvasser would have desired. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 18:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Right. I originally brought the point up because I was unsure about policies on the matter. Upon further investigation, I've found a <i>proposed</i> policy, but no explicit rule against canvassing for votes. Plus, it does not appear that either side has affected the outcome anyway.

<li><b>Comment</b> Currently the consensus is approx even between Delete and Move to Project. My own view is that it should not be moved verbatim (as has been done here: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_Rational_Skepticism_List_of_articles_related_to_quackery_c503.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject Rational Skepticism/List of articles related to quackery">Wikipedia:Wikiproject Rational Skepticism/List of articles related to quackery</a>) and this view is shared by many of the Move and probably more of the Delete editors. The word "quack" is interpreted differenty by editors, with some taking great offense. Many editors feel there is value in a wikiproject maintaining a list of medical articles that are controversial and may benefit from improvement or watching in order to achieve NPOV, V, etc. Can this be done in a non-confrontational manner? Could the moved article be simply Wikipedia:Wikiproject Rational Skepticism/Medicine? The list can be broken into sections that would help with navigation. The word "quack" needn't appear as an entry criterion. The list also needs trimmed to remove the every-day words. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 14:55, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The name you have suggested does not match the list. Another name I was thinking of was &gt; the <b>List of articles related to skepticism</b>. Note the "Q-word" is gone but still has a similar meaning. I still prefer the original title though. I would like to know what you think of this title. The list could be categorized better and improved as you stated to help with navigation. <i>Everday words</i> could be put into there own special category. My concern is I do not want to lose any valuable info which is important as a navigational tool for the general public &amp; students in the field of research on a variety of topics. I want this list to be complete. That was my idea from the start. --QuackGuru 17:58, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But this is a medical/health list, not just all skepticism. A long name isn't required and the prefix of "Wikiproject Rational Skepticism" tells you most of what it is about. Maybe "Health" rather than "Medicine"? I really don't see what "everyday words" have to do with the project – why should project members be interested in the article on <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honesty.html" title="Honesty">honesty</a>? Ultimately, the organisation of "articles of interest" is a matter for the Wikiproject so perhaps you should take the discussion to their talk page. However, if you want to collate info for the "general public &amp; students", a Wikiproject is not the place. If the purpose of your collation is to further a campaign against quackery, then Wikipedia is not the place either since it is not a <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">soapbox</a> – there's the whole rest of the Web for that. Several editors (including myself above) have made suggestions on different approaches you might take to collate the info in "articlespace": more focussed, neutral and well-sourced. Look at how other controvesial topics have been handled, ask for help on the Wikiprojects. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 18:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Suggestion: Well, the list should have a genuine title. What title will describe the inclusion of the list? The project is to develop the list to bring back to mainspace. Once everything is focused it will be back where it belongs. A navigational tool for Wikipedia readers is very good I would think. Here is another title for the resource list. ----&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p><i>List of articles related to skeptical health topics.</i> BTW, Wkipedia is for readers of the general public for knowledge. Or what is the purpose of Wikipedia? Schools around the world are telling students about Wiki. That is how I found this place. I hope you welcome students here on Wikipedia to benefit other students. --QuackGuru 18:53, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment: For the WikiProject it will be used only as a watch list. Is that it? I'm afraid it really will be sent to Wiki-Outer-Space. --QuackGuru 21:01, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That title isn't grammatical. I think you misunderstand my point about "general public &amp; students": I said a <b>Wikiproject</b> isn't for them. Wikiprojects are pages and teams internal to Wikipedia for editors only. Of course Wikipedia welcomes students. As someone new to Wikipedia, you might find it helpful to get a mentor (<a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_a79f.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User">Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User</a>) and to read some more about our guidelines and policies before embarking on too much. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 21:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Inherently original research attack article. We don't get to decide what is "quackery" for inclusion in something like this. Not one thing is sourced <i>ON</i> the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> the title and inclusion criteria are weaselly, the list is indiscriminate and OR. I wouldn't support a move to project space unless the article is changed to elaborate how this helps wikipedia and the inclusion criteria are rewritten. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 23:07, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>The logical end-run fails the smell test. The weaselly logic tries to evade <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> by saying a list of names including living persons are "related" to quackery, but some are quacks and some are anti-quacks. This fails, because it is as if someone made a list of persons "related to pedophilia" then as you look at each name, the articles for A, B, and C say they are staunchly anti-pedophile, whilce the article for D just says he likes to invite kids to his home to eat candy and play video games. The inference is made clear to the reader. If the articles about living persons were deleted from and kept off the list, that would reduce the libel exposure of the Wikipedia project. If that is unacceptable, then the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:20, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Okay, so someone somewhere spoofed <i>The Matrix</i>. This is not exactly a world-shattering event. Having an article for this would be not unlike having an article for every single <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whassup__9901.html" title="Whassup?">Whassup?</a> parody that popped up back when the Bud ad campaign was going strong. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 23:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - How many of those spoofs are the length of a feature film? It's not a fan film because it pokes fun of the original. No Matrix fan would ever acknowledge it. The movie does a very good job at entertaining those who were disappointed with the official Russian translation. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronolegion_cf63.html" title="User:Chronolegion">Chronolegion</a> 13:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not a question of length, it's a question of significance... and whether <i>Matrix</i> fans would ever acknowledge it is irrelevant. (For the record, I'm not a <i>Matrix</i> fan.) Neither is it a question of whether it entertains people. These are not things that decide whether or not something should be included in Wikipedia. Generally, the topic <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">should have been</a> <i>"the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself."</i> Now, I can think of some expections to that guideline, but I can't see why they would apply to this. I mean, is this a bone fide cult phenomenon? If so, fine, that's good enough for me. But if that is the case, surely there are some references to it somewhere? -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:03, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Goblin's humorous translations created a cult following among the Russian-speakers. Unfortunately, Google does not seem to have much information related to the film. However, if you use a Russian search engine like www.yandex.ru to search for "Шматрица", you will find Russian online articles describing and reviewing the translation. For example, if you translate <a href="http://www.kinokadr.ru/articles/2004/01/12/shmatrix.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.kinokadr.ru/articles/2004/01/12/shmatrix.shtml" rel="nofollow">this</a> article with an online translator like Babelfish or Worldlingo, you will see that Russian reviewers consider Goblin's work seriously (despite it being humorous). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronolegion_cf63.html" title="User:Chronolegion">Chronolegion</a> 15:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, I am entirely unqualified to evaluate the Russian sites -- I mean, I don't know which ones of them have credibility and which ones do not. Take the kinokadr.ru article that you refer to, for example -- I have no idea if that'd be the equivalent of, say, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>'s site, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ain%27t_It_Cool_News_c906.html" title="Ain't It Cool News">Ain't It Cool News</a> or a random internet fan thing, or none of the above. The fact that I'm reading it through a Babelfish translation doesn't really make it easier for me. =) But that said, "Шматрица" gets over 35,000 hits, and I'm assuming that it's not a word that means anything else in Russian. That instantly puts it in a different category. If someone can shed some light on whether these sites qualify as credible Wikipedia sources, I'm quite happy to change my vote here. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 16:48, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The kinokadr.ru website's "about" section describes it as a professional online magazine. Information in their articles is complete and truthful. Their attendance is currently about 200,000 visitors per month and rising.

I'm not sure what the Wikipedia standards are for credible sources, but I would assume that a professional online magazine qualifies. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronolegion_cf63.html" title="User:Chronolegion">Chronolegion</a> 17:02, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>List was created to give editors who create articles on non-notable internet drama a place to put them after the article is deleted, to discourage recreation. While I understand the sentiment, I don't think it's a good idea. If something doesn't belong on wikipedia, it doesn't belong, period.</p>
<p>Also, this list is likely to be dangerous from a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> perspective. For a start, the term 'scandal' is kind of inherently pov. Crook and his fake DMCA take-down notices, for example, are imo less a scandal and more a really stupid move on his part. And every time one of these flash-in-the-pan Internet 'scandals' happens, we get droves of people wanting to add their own commentary on it to the 'pedia. Take the whole <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_How_NOT_to_steal_a_SideKick_2_caba.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/How NOT to steal a SideKick 2">'stolen sidekick' fiasco</a> for an example. People who were following that one came to wikipedia to add information that was uncited, and in some cases possibly libelous and potentially dangerous for the young lady accused of stealing the device. We should not be encouraging people to add uncited and non notable material on any subject, but internet drama least of all. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 17:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

And this is most certainly a fan-dub, as the creator was never authorized by New Line, Peter Jackson, or the Tolkien estate to create this project. I'm also highly dubious of the unsourced claim above that this project is commerically available, as the film is nothing but massive copyright infringement.

<dd>Notable non-fan dub.&#160;:) Goblin invented "Funny translations" and remains the only popular author of such dubs. And subj is the most popular one. There were lots of immitations. Most notable one is <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_One_%28Russia%29_92a9.html" title="Channel One (Russia)">Channel One (Russia)</a>'s <i>official</i> "funny translation" of Night Watch, which was labeled as "Goblin's translation" though it's not concerned with Goblin. Goblin tried to make them remove this lable but nickname "Goblin" is not copyrighted so he failed.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this translation is one the most popular of Goblin's works among the Russian-speakers. While the film itself it not available for sale internationally (primarily because of copyright issues), it can be bought in Russia both online and retail. There are Russian online magazine articles describing Goblin's works in general and several of them in particular (this might be one of them). These articles can be easily translated (although poorly) into English with free translating engines like Babelfish. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronolegion_cf63.html" title="User:Chronolegion">Chronolegion</a> 20:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Indiscriminate collection of information. You could pick any two rival football teams and find dozens of players who have represented both. This article doesn't even limit the list by country or by level, so there could be thousands, or even tens of thousands of names on the list when it is completed, and it's doubtful it ever could be completed. At the very least the scope of the article should be restricted and it should renamed to reflect that. <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGasheadsteve_2c86.html" title="User:Gasheadsteve">Gasheadsteve</a> 18:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Two clubs in the same league or division are somewhat rival, right... (not even talking about rival clubs in the same area but in different leagues, which may be rival as well). So, any player having played in two clubs in the same league or area could be included in this list. As Johan Elisson put it, the list cannot be maintained. --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 19:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I think the list of players who have done so numbers five or six, so really it doesn't seem that hard to maintain a list like this once you get a few editors working on it. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 00:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>There are a finite number of football clubs in the world. I would imagine every single one of them have fans who are wikipedia editors. Each club is liable to have one other main rival (Ipswich-Norwich, Liverpool-Everton, Wolves-West Brom). The numbers of players who have played for both clubs in a particular pairing is not going to be high considering all the clubs available for a player to join in his career. I really dont think it would be difficult to maintain this list on that basis. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 02:24, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>- which rivalries are to be included? It's possible to argue massive numbers of them, rendering this article almost impossible to maintain, and possibly NPOV (who decides what constitutes a rivalry? It's not always clear cut). Also, I really don't see what purpose a list such as this is likely to serve- it seems to be just a list for the sake of making lists. There are articles on some particular rivalries which are verifiable and notable, I think they would be the appropriate place to list any players who have switched sides. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 01:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Who decides what constitutes a rivalry? Surely every club playing in a league are rivals as they all want to win it. On the other hand, Swansea &amp; Cardiff could be defined as rivals despite playing in different divisions. An argument could be made for any two clubs really. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexj2002_245b.html" title="User:Alexj2002">Alexj2002</a> 11:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've been asked by <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> to clarify my vote, so that's what I'll do. The main problem I have with this article is that it doesn't really show what's so special about this webcomic. Although a few vague claims are made, such as being the best known ascii webcomic and the only one that's still produced, how do I know that's true? Especially the first claim, being the best known ascii webcomic, needs to be backed up by a source, if not a reliable source (but any source would do at the moment!). As it stands there is nothing to back up the notability of this webcomic, and there's no reason to believe those claims. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 10:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

I think it's purile, badly drawn, and pretty crappy a comic. But it did have a readership, popularity and significance in the webcomic medium, as evidenced by it's award nomination. (Also, and I've no idea if it'll be taken as a sign of noteability or not, but Comixpedia referenced the comic in a number of it's news articles. <a href="http://comixpedia.com/nc_17_or_17_notorious_webcartoonists_by_xaviar_xerexes" class="external autonumber" title="http://comixpedia.com/nc_17_or_17_notorious_webcartoonists_by_xaviar_xerexes" rel="nofollow">[91]</a>) --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 23:51, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. This has survived deletion by overwhelming margins in the past, and it's all but a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> to nominate it again. Since we're going for repetition, I'll repost the reason that 20 people voted keep last time: comic is on <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a>, a notable webcomics syndicate of which almost every other strip has an article. As a result, <a href="http://www.dayfreepress.com:81/network/ableandbaker/Able%20and%20Baker/short_ableandbaker2-a.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dayfreepress.com:81/network/ableandbaker/Able%20and%20Baker/short_ableandbaker2-a.jpg" rel="nofollow">[92]</a> appears as a sponsored link from both <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">Questionable Content</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Dinosaur_Comics_952e.html" title="Daily Dinosaur Comics">Daily Dinosaur Comics</a>. Furthermore, the editor of Dayfree was named as one of the 25 notable webcomics people in Comixpedia for 2004, and used his interview there to mention Able and Baker as a hot strip. Since Dayfree membership is by application, its membership in the syndicate constittues a jdugment of quality and notability from a highly important source. I also ask whoever closes this debate to glance at <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_Webcomics_0e1f.html" title="User:Snowspinner/Webcomics">User:Snowspinner/Webcomics</a> - I believe I have qualifications that make me a particular expert on webcomics and their notability, which might be taken as relevent in determining consensus. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 13:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> These are not stand-alone songs about a vague topic; each song is about a specific subject, and as such, each track has a story behind it. Every song has a reason for the lyrics and content. For an example, an uninformed listener of the track "Lee" would have no idea why the lyrics are as they are.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Non-controversial is a) not a criteria for keeping an article and b) not true, since it's here being discussed for deletion. The existence of "1000s" of other similar articles does not affect the decision for any other article to remain here. In fact, I thank you for bringing some of those to my attention, I am submitting at least one of them for deletion per their inability to be verifiable nor meet the notability and source requirements for an article. Finally, Wikipedia is not a repository of all information nor is it personal webspace meaning if the information is important (but not applicable to this website) it should be hosted somewhere else and not here. Maybe you could start a LawyerWiki or WikiFirm. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 22:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a> do not be americocentric. en.wikipedia is an English language web encyclopedia NOT an American encyclopedia. LeBoeuf Lamb is merely ranked 36 in the USA for law firms (see <a href="http://www.ilrg.com/nlj250" class="external free" title="http://www.ilrg.com/nlj250" rel="nofollow">http://www.ilrg.com/nlj250</a>), Luzzatto &amp; Luzzatto is ranked 2 in Israel (albeit of patent attorney firms). An Israeli business can be on wikipedia and so can a US business - as long as they confirm with the rules set in WP:CORP. I (and many others seem to agree with me) think there is a place for the likes of Luzzatto &amp; Luzzatto here. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenqish_4b84.html" title="User:Benqish">Benqish</a> 09:30, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

As both the article and talk page demonstrate, it has certainly caught on, and has been discussed in major media outlets (even the Wikipedia article on series of tubes has been discussed in mainstream media, a newspaper article if memory serves). I fail to see why Wiktionary is a more appropriate venue. Finally, I see little in Wikipedia policy and guidelines that would lend credit to a "delete" argument. The only argument seemingly put forward for deletion in the nomination is a general "notability" argument (without reference to any specific policy or guideline either on notability or something else). This is when the concept of notability (as a general, amorphous, undefined concept) is at its <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_On_notability_01d9.html" title="User:Jersyko/On notability">most dangerous</a>.

That's what would have made it a lovely topic for Wikinews back when it occurred.

The <i>Clubhouse</i> article should probably be AFD'd as well, because I'm not really convinced its significant at all, and at the very least it should be rewritten. (Allow me a slight digression, though: the episode descriptions are awesome. <i>"Krysta finds out her sister, Jan , is taking drugs. Krysta and her sister talk about it, and pray. Jan promises not to do drugs again."</i> Well, that's the drug problem beat, right there -- now, if only there was some way for everyone with a drug problem to know about this wonderful solution! Apparently, the same episode also includes "Psalm 139 Rap". People, I would gladly take rabbit punches to the kidneys just to hear that song. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it would be beautiful and touching and not at all awkward in any way, yo!) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 23:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>This article is a bit silly compared to the Frederick Lenz (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Lenz" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Lenz" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Lenz</a> entry). Is anything covered in this article that is not covered there? Also it has many quotations with no supporting citations and the section on “Organisation &amp; finance” mentions specifics on three kinds of students… I don’t see any evidence to support that the cult functioned in that way. Further more isn’t Organisation spelt Organization. Whomever created the original entry was probably not all that serious about documenting facts. So why do we not delete this article?</p>

<li><i><b>Keep with rename and improvement.</b></i> I agree that the article is underperforming, but it has encyclopedic utility, as well as the usual insider opponents who may try to suppress the reference to their membership as a cult. • The POV title could renamed to Rae Chorze-Fwaz / Rama, and <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama_computer_cult.html" title="Rama computer cult">Rama computer cult</a> should become a redirect. • There aren't enough references, but it's not like they aren't available to rebut the OR charge — the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Lenz_2103.html" title="Frederick Lenz">Frederick Lenz</a> article has 81. • The British spelling of "Organisation" is to be kept as found per Wikiguide. • For notability, {"Frederick Lenz"} has 23,400 Google hits; {"Frederick Lenz" cult} has 2,050; and is cult-listed by Rick Ross, Steven Hassan, and others. <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/lenz.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/lenz.html" rel="nofollow">Wired 2.01</a>, a reliable source used only at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a>, reports an allegation of "massive frauds" committed against the computer business industry (see alleged fraud details <a href="http://www.ex-cult.org/Groups/Rama/rama-update-1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ex-cult.org/Groups/Rama/rama-update-1.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) The alleged fraudsters were notable enough that Wikipedia disambiguates their nickname <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_California_Raisins_%28disambiguation%29_3ec2.html" title="The California Raisins (disambiguation)">The California Raisins (disambiguation)</a>. As a matter of public policy, credible warnings of repeatable fraud are generally assumed notable so the warnings will be propagated. • The <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Lenz_2103.html" title="Frederick Lenz">Frederick Lenz</a> article is large at 63 Kb and focuses on the life of Lenz and his teachings. A second article to focus on the the problems alleged to be caused by his students and his organization(s) referred to as cult(s), is entirely reasonable and could reduce the size of the Lenz article. The Wired businss fraud charges seem incompletely or not at all covered in the article#section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Lenz#Adversity_with_cult_watchdog_groups.2C_deprogrammers_and_former_students" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Lenz#Adversity_with_cult_watchdog_groups.2C_deprogrammers_and_former_students" rel="nofollow">Frederick Lenz#Adversity with cult watchdog groups, deprogrammers and former students</a>. Much of this section appears to be pro-Lenz and anti-anti-cult to the point of a POV endorsement of Lenz. Milo 01:06, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am definitely in favor of keeping this article. However, providing references is a bit tricky. I definitely have a positive view of this group and, although I am opposed because of Wikipedia etiquette to just deleting swaths of an article, I have been trying to make edits that give a more positive slant on the subject matter. Thus, I am not going to be the one to provide references for the negative stuff although I can provide references for the positive additions I have made. The original creator of this article seems to have disappeared. However, I do know that, from a neutral perspective, there are references supporting both the positive and negative claims made here.</li>
</ul>
<p>I already posted my reasons for wanting the article kept on the talk page, but to reiterate:</p>
<p>As someone with a favorable opinion of this group, I do not want to draw too much attention to the press coverage this group received, which unfortunately was mostly negative. Yet the press coverage--albeit largely negative in nature--surely is indicative of the significance of this group. The group was discussed in articles or television programs in Wired Magazine (2.01, again in 7.09), Psychology Today, Dateline (August 1996 and March 1997), New York magazine, Newsweek, the San Francisco Chronicle, Santa Fe Reporter, Philadelphia Inquirer, Portland Oregonian, Gannett Suburban Newspapers, the LA Weekly, and the Hartford Courant. As noted, the press coverage was mostly negative, although the New York magazine did declare Rama to be one of the 100 smartest New Yorkers.</p>
<p>With this level of local and national coverage, surely it must be agreed, even if there is controversy as to the accuracy of that coverage, that the subject is significant.</p>
<p>As far as merging it with the article on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Lenz_2103.html" title="Frederick Lenz">Frederick Lenz</a>, I would oppose that, firstly because the article on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Lenz_2103.html" title="Frederick Lenz">Frederick Lenz</a> is already long enough, but also because a group is not the same as its leader. What <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Lenz_2103.html" title="Frederick Lenz">Frederick Lenz</a> advised the group to do through his teachings, and what the group actually did, sometimes were two completely different matters and deserve separate articles. --Dash77 02:48, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>I see folks have some strong feelings for keeping the article. The big issue is that the name of the article is slanted. If we could change the name to something more neutral then I would be happy to help create a well rounded article.</p>
<p>The best name for the article would be: “Students of Rama – Dr. Frederick Lenz” The reason I would NOT go with “Rae Chorze-Fwaz” is because Students of Lenz seldom refereed to themselves as “Rae Chorze-Fwaz”. Mostly “Rae Chorze-Fwaz” was known as the fictional secrete society in Lenz’s book about snow boarding, Rae Chorze-Fwaz was only used to refer to his Student’s on rarer occasions… hence a redirect to this article is appropriate. I also think the California Raisins might be another good choice for a rename of this article. But “Rama Computer Cult” is really not going to do it because this article should be about more than the group’s proclivity for computers. What about the group’s history prior to the computer boom. Lenz’ had many followers prior to his endorsement of computer related jobs. Perhaps it was because of his endorsement of computers (and career success) that his more flakey students became turncoats and started creating negative press… people fear change.</p>
<p>Anyway I suggest this article be changed to one of the following:</p>
<p>“Students of Rama – Dr. Frederick Lenz” “California Raisins” or it just be removed</p>

<p>OK, I am not entirely convinced about notability of this product. It <i>seems</i> to me to fail <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. In particular I do not see "multiple non-trivial published works", nor does it seem to be a "core product of a notable software developer or vendor". It seems to be a minor, experimental product, still in early stages of development. A browser that does not support CSS and JavaScript would be <i>severely</i> crippled and hardly suitable for real use, as the image of Wikipedia front page shows. On the other hand I may be entirely mistaken. It's for the Wikipedia community to decide. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabriel_Knight_c18b.html" title="User:Gabriel Knight">Gabriel Knight</a> 20:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In Glasgow, football allegiances have traditionally been linked to religious affiliation. As the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangers_F.C._0dbb.html" title="Rangers F.C.">Rangers F.C.</a> article says, "the club has traditionally been identified with the Protestant Unionist community of Scotland." Similarly, the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_F.C._6309.html" title="Celtic F.C.">Celtic F.C.</a> has traditionally been supported by the Roman Catholic community of Glasgow. So the significance of this list is that the football team has in recent years hired some players without regard to (or in spite of) their religious affiliation, which might not have happened 50 years ago. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 21:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. Claims of notability are at best weakly established and set out in the article, but better described here. Editors are encouraged to improve the stub. The Math departments bulletin (currently at the MIT Math department website linked in the article), notes a promotion to Associate Professor on page 2, right after a pair of tenure awards. At MIT this rank can be tenured or non-tenured, and in this context I interpret as not yet tenured, contrary to the IP editor's statement below. The MacTutor test is nowhere described as one of our standard tests.

<p>This mathematician does not appear to have sufficient notability. It was never the Wikipedia policy to include all faculty of all universities -- the university websites are sufficient for that purpose. I suggest to stick to really notable mathematicians, like Fields medals or important historical figures. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nabla2006 (<a href="../../../n/a/b/User_talk%7ENabla2006_9599.html" title="User talk:Nabla2006">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nabla2006_0915.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nabla2006">contribs</a>) 20:32, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not going to vote because I happen to be acquainted with the subject of the article. I however urge the voters to look up the nominator's contribs -- the deletion nomination is their 3rd edit on the wikipedia, which seems to be done out of spite following own unnotable article deleted. Somebody bit the newcomer too hard, maybe? In general, when somebody asserts non-notability, I'd expect some backing information, such as the number of citations of the AfD subject's works (clearly appropriate in a mathematician's case), some google testing, or whatever.else. Nevertheless, I think that there is no problem in evaluating any particular article's worthiness even if clearly less notable biographies are still present. Go ahead and see for yourself. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBACbKA_d1dc.html" title="User:BACbKA">BACbKA</a> 21:42, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> I'd rather abstain from a more definite opinion but as someone who is somewhat familiar with the research area of Igor Pak, let me make a few (hopefully helpful) comments. I'm concerned about the lack of reliable third-party coverage which would be our only chance to create a thorough article. On the other hand he's clearly an above average mathematician. I've heard his name a number of times (although I share some of his research interests so that might not be so indicative of wider notability) and he's <i>definitely</i> a productive researcher (very solid list of publications) and a respected authority in his subfield. He's a borderline case of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> however because it's difficult to find independent sources that specifically mention him as an <i>important</i> figure whatever "important" is supposed to mean. The situation looks like this: if we believe that Wikipedia should contain articles for every mathematician who makes solid contributions in his field, a few of which will likely still be remembered in 50 years, then we keep this article. If we believe that Wikipedia should only contain articles for mathematicians whose contributions have been central to the advances in mathematics, who will be regarded in fifty years time as key figures of their (mathematical) time, who are or are almost certain to soon be the primary subject of third-party works, who have garnered various mathematical distinctions, then we should delete this article. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 22:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">Google test</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a no-brainer. I'm a mathematician active in combinatorics. Pak is an enormously important combinatorialist, who has important publications across different subareas of combinatorics. I don't have hard data, but he's definitely cited much more than most mathematicians twice his age.

<dd><b>Comment</b> If a mathematician is in MacTutor, he or she is probably notable enough to be here. But absence from MacTutor should not be used to support a claim of non-notability.

<li>The only reason this is a "relisting" is because someone took it upon him/herself to break up an existing nomination. It is disingenuous in the extreme to suggest closure on that basis and quite frankly your cherry-picking the listings you want speedily closed does not speak well of your motivation. The reason for the nomination is <i>right there in my comments as nominator</i> and stating that there is no explanation is just flat out not true. As for the discussion at the previous nom, a number of those voicing opinions called for keep/close only because of the mass nature of the nomination.

<li><b>Question</b>. Can you explain what you mean? To me this seems to be a truly bizarre assertion. Of the first ten items on this list, only two have articles for the character in question, so categorising them seems to me to involve at least an 80% loss of information (or alternatively the creation of 8 AfD-fodder sub-stubs). Then there's the loss of explanatory text: in the same 10 items I make that 125 words out of 177, so that's a loss of 70%.

<li>The only reason this is a "relisting" is because someone took it upon him/herself to break up an existing nomination. It is disingenuous in the extreme to suggest closure on that basis and quite frankly your cherry-picking the listings you want speedily closed does not speak well of your motivation. The reason for the nomination is <i>right there in my comments as nominator</i> and stating that there is no explanation is just flat out not true. As for the discussion at the previous nom, a number of those voicing opinions called for keep/close only because of the mass nature of the nomination.

<li>The only reason this is a "relisting" is because someone took it upon him/herself to break up an existing nomination. It is disingenuous in the extreme to suggest closure on that basis and quite frankly your cherry-picking the listings you want speedily closed does not speak well of your motivation. The reason for the nomination is <i>right there in my comments as nominator</i> and stating that there is no explanation is just flat out not true. As for the discussion at the previous nom, a number of those voicing opinions called for keep/close only because of the mass nature of the nomination. It's ridiculous to claim that those procedural&#160;!votes constitute consensus on every article individually. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:09, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I posted the same infomation in each of these nominations (which I did not list individually, by the way) so that editors who see them understand why they were nominated. It strikes me as bizarre that you would criticise me for posting the information into each nom when you copied and pasted your text into all of them. And it strikes me as fundamentally dishonest for you to have claimed that there was no explanation given for the nomination. And as I also said and as you either didn't understand or chose to ignore, a number of the opinions expressed at the now-closed mass nom were based in part on the mass nature of the nom. Now those who objected to the mass nom have the chance to weigh in on them individually rather than&#160;!voting keep/close on a procedural basis. So, did you have an actual opinion on any of these or is this just a platform for your Wikilawyering? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:01, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The only reason this is a "relisting" is because someone took it upon him/herself to break up an existing nomination. It is disingenuous in the extreme to suggest closure on that basis and quite frankly your cherry-picking the listings you want speedily closed does not speak well of your motivation. The reason for the nomination is <i>right there in my comments as nominator</i> and stating that there is no explanation is just flat out not true. As for the discussion at the previous nom, a number of those voicing opinions called for keep/close only because of the mass nature of the nomination.

<li>The only reason this is a "relisting" is because someone took it upon him/herself to break up an existing nomination. It is disingenuous in the extreme to suggest closure on that basis and quite frankly your cherry-picking the listings you want speedily closed does not speak well of your motivation. The reason for the nomination is <i>right there in my comments as nominator</i> and stating that there is no explanation is just flat out not true.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> high-entertainment value. All kidding aside, I'd like to address the above concerns about subjectivity. This is not a list about altruistic prostitutes, it's a list of characters which reasonably match the description given at <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooker_with_a_heart_of_gold.html" title="Hooker with a heart of gold">hooker with a heart of gold</a>. It's useful to have this list of examples precisely because it supports that article (which I think all would agree to keep without question). So what if some of the fictional hookers on the list only had hearts of silver? The list still serves its purpose. Plus most of the films cited are so well-known that I bet with a few days work we <i>could</i> actually find at least one film critic supporting that classification. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 10:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One film critic, or even 5, is not enough - all you'd have is a 'list of people some film critics called...'. It is still subjective. It can't be anything but. An article on 'hookers with a hear of gold' can say x has been described as such by film critic y' and thus retain a descriptive neutrality. But lists are Binary, Wikipedia has to decide who is and who isn't, that ultimately is subjective and thus cannot comply with NPOVV. It doesn't matter how many people&#160;!vote that this is entertaining, it offends core policy and MUST be deleted.

<dd>Extra reply to Doc above. I value NPOV as much as anyone, trust me. But you are applying it without the degree of common sense that is required in this case. Also let me make it clear that I don't think the article should be kept because it's entertaining but because it provides a valuable encyclopedic resource that complements the article <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooker_with_a_heart_of_gold.html" title="Hooker with a heart of gold">hooker with a heart of gold</a>, which is also a valuable topic of definite interest. This list <i>also</i> happens to be entertaining. Also, if you think that helps the lead can be changed to something more elaborate so that it's understood that the list is not intended to be a subjective judgement but rather a list of examples which were deemed significant by reliable sources (see above examples. But please let's not start creating List of fictional characters who have been described as a "hooker with a heart of gold" which we know is an offensive term but hey we did not make it up. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 10:44, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

While I'm at it, let me also point out to Doc above that noone in their right mind would want to delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_blaxploitation_films.html" title="List of blaxploitation films">List of blaxploitation films</a>. Yet, this classification is not objective in the very strict sense that you mention. So why do we keep it? We keep it because it's a well-known film genre, an oft used terminology and one that allows us to provide interesting unbiased content. The core policy of neutrality (if one takes the time to re-read it properly) is intended to handle controversial subjects and to avoid original research or "truthiness", not to prevent Wikipedia from using classifications of topics, characters, genres and so on. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:30, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know what that mezzosoprano business is all about but there's no denying that "hooker with a heart of gold" is the standard way to refer to this archetype. I suppose it does not say much but the phrase gets 39K hits on Google. Throw in, say, film + critic and you will still get hundreds of hits.

<dd>The question of whether or not a given fictional character is a prostitute is most certainly something that does not require the educated opinion of scholars. The problem is with the heart of gold business. Of course, you won't find any deep scholarly debates on whether the heart of Bree Daniels is a full 24 carats but I don't feel that this is the issue at hand. What we are looking for is significant evidence that a large number of independent scholarly sources consider this character to be representative of a well known stock character, most commonly refered to as the "hooker with a heart of gold" (although I'm sure you'll find many observers using different terminology). Yes it is difficult to find a single authoritative definition for this concept and you'll find some discrepancy in its use. The same can be said for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-hero.html" title="Anti-hero">anti-hero</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villain.html" title="Villain">villain</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_scientist.html" title="Mad scientist">mad scientist</a> but I still believe that all these topics and related lists can be constructed in a careful manner so as to include examples which are universally recognized as fitting the archetype. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 19:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The question is, can it be neutrally and objectively defined - you haven't answered that. If it can't it must be deleted. Notability is irrelevant.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 18:43, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, singificant archetype, list of examples is useful. Perfectly reliable critical sources frequently use this term. Frankly I'm not sure where Doc is headed with his argument -- half the topics on Wikipedia can't be neutrally or objectively defined, e.g. country, city, war, nation, etc. I don't see that this inhibits our writing about the topic neutrally -- we simply need to present both sides of contested issues. A list is quite capable of doing this (unlike a category). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 21:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To try to explain in a nutshell (and then I'll drop it): articles can discuss whether someone is x or not. They can qualify statement with 'generally regarded' or 'according to reliable source y' - thus Wikipedia doesn't have to decide whether the subject is truly x or not. Lists are different, because ultimately we have to put the subject on the list of x (meaning we agree that they are x) or exclude them. Wikipedia has to make a decision. The fact we can show that a number of reliable sources agree with our assessment doesn't cure that - we are still making an assessment, we are no longer neutral.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 21:34, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't wholly disagree, but I would make two comments: (1) your view basically excludes lists altogether; certainly, I think, it would require the deletion of most of the lists we have on Wikipedia, and probably all of the most useful ones. (2) further, the idea that articles aren't subject to the exclude/include dilemma while lists are is false; the same techniques used to qualify the inclusion of information in articles (e.g. to explain the scope of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_culture.html" title="Western culture">Western culture</a>) can be used to qualify the inclusion of information in lists. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 21:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(edit conflict) How about qualifying the whole list by stating that "The following is a list of notable fictional characters <i>generally regarded</i> (or have been described by sources) as hookers with a heart of gold ..." --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 21:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That definitely sounds like a good idea. I think it would also make sense (like it does in so many lists) to hide a note in the source requesting that people add new entries with some degree of care. I've seen that done a number of times and I think it helps somewhat. Furthermore, adding references systematically will probably set a good example for future additions. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 23:58, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sounds reasonable but I don't think we should bury the article beneath a lot of half-hearted qualifiers either. We just need to focus on providing good sourcing, and after this survives AfD I'm willing to help with that; hopefully others who supported this article will do so as well. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 00:01, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

Funny, but not supported by <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>: "Lists should always include unambiguous statements of membership criteria based on definitions made by reputable sources, especially in difficult or contentious topics. Beware of those cases in which the definitions themselves are disputed... Even if it might "seem obvious" what qualifies for membership in a list, explicit is better than implicit." If any of these entries can actually find a source (any of the currently 71 entries all of which are unsourced) can find a secondary source so it is not just Wikipedia contributors saying that these character are hookers with a heart of gold, then they can be added to the main article (assuming the main article can find a source to describe what a "hooker with a heart of gold" is). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean</a> 07:00, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> On the main wikipedia page for the University of St Andrews there are already multiple links to other halls of residence.

<li><b>Delete</b>. University Halls of residence are not notable by default per abundant precedence. This one may be the oldest hall, but aged does not imply notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: please don't confuse notability of the subject with organisational structure within Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Non-inclusion is not an indicator of non-notability, and the list may serve for development purposes. However, sources would be nice to prove that the other 214 are notable; as I'm not familiar with Assyrian music, I won't vote on this unless I have time to do some research. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 23:53, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I think it's quite plausible that even the big names in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_music.html" title="Assyrian music">Assyrian music</a> would come out as red-links.

<li><b>Keep</b> - the reason I created this page is because unregisterd users (many different ones) kept on adding Assyrian artist names to the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_music.html" title="Assyrian music">Assyrian music</a> page, and it wasn't looking nice by making the list so long and whomever they added was always red. So what I did is kept the ones that are not red in the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_music.html" title="Assyrian music">Assyrian music</a> page, and created a new page for a complete list. The page is basically a list..as people start pages of these artists, little by little the page will show its significance. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 03:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Most lists these days are not devlopment lists, but that doesn't mean that they have become invalid.

<li><b>KEEP</b> With a little work this article could add value to Wikipedia. It is about a real-world issue that effects millions of business transactions every day.

<dd>Well, for a start the article fails to claim notability in anyway. From <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other. The show is notable. A fictional demon-friendly karaoke bar is not. And straight from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source." Where can I check a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> about this article? This article also fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Wikipedia's no original research policy</a>, as the only place this information comes from is original research. I agree that this is not the Encyclopedia Britannica, and I welcome popular culture, but, only popular culture that is verifiable and not involving original research. All of the above arguments have focused on the notability of the show and not this room. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 00:38, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I might take your arguments more seriously if your repeated use of the word "room" to describe Caritas didn't indicate to me that you have no real awareness of what the article's even about. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The article doesn't have to claim notability when it is a sub-article of a television show. Furthermore, there are references. Take the Buffy/Angel magazines, I'm sure they had some information about Caritas, as it was a set used multiple times over several seasons. Try an unreferenced tag next time. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The television show has notability. This does not. "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other." The show has been written about, this place has not. Buffy/Angel magazines are not reliable source that are in my opinion "independent of the subject itself." Furthermore, while you can argue notability and sourcing here, and claim that there are sources out there, they were not cited or used in this article. The entire thing fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. And again, if you want to rewrite, take 5 minutes and do it. I will take another look then. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 16:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A further thought, if this show filmed at a gas station, under your reasoning, what stops someone from creating an article about it? It was on the show, so it is notable, and we would have to allow an article? Who decides what is a minor and trivial element in relation to this show? The answer to the question would be we would look at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. If it passed both of those we would keep. But, if it failed, as this article fails, we would delete. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 16:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While the Buffy/Angel magazines are not completely independent, but licensed, they serve as useful references since they do contain valuable information about the series, and are substantially more than just press-releases. They are reputable sources as far as I'm concerned. And while a set that only appears once may not be important enough for its own article (it would probably best receive an entry in whatever episode description there is for the series), a set that appears multiple times in the same series is another matter. And seriously, if you want people to rewrite it, you should have tried the option of asking first, then if that didn't happen going to AfD. The fact that it can happen though, is enough for me to stick by my keep. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If they are not independent, they are not reliable. And while they may be useful references for a fan of the show, they do not qualify as sources for Wikipedia. Someone rewriting an article to fix objections happens all the time in AFD. And, I don't want to delete anything that passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, these do not. I am also curious how you respond would respond to my hypothetical gas station article above. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 16:57, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>They are not independent, so they are not reliable? Sorry, does not compute. Where in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> can I find support for this claim? Even if it were there, you should note that RS itself says "However, it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception." Accordingly, you cannot just say that the magazines are licensed and therefore, they are not reliable sources. You'd actually have to convince me that the actual magazine itself was unreliable. Common sense should tell you that something in print is likely to be edited for accuracy and especially when it's licensed and the owners of the media don't want false information about their product to be released. And I have already responded to your question about a gas station. Did you not realize that "a set that only appears only once" was about that subject? And no, I don't think that the gas station in season 5 of Buffy should have its own article. Information about it would belong in the episodes it was in. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is not from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. From there "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and <i>independent of the subject itself</i> and each other." And from <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a>, an essay not policy, "An independent source is a source which describes a topic from the outside." Clearly these magazines are not.

<dd>I wasn't using the magazines to assert notability, but offering them as references. If you need me to establish that the shows are notable, well, I would say the existence of the magazines would serve that purpose actually, but it's hardly necessary anyway. Television show on a major network? Notability is a done deal. And um, your reference to WP:INDY makes no sense, since the fact is, the magazines DO describe the show from the outside. They are not in-universe, they are licensed works about the show. As such, I consider them reliable in terms of the content they have to offer. Have you read them yourself? Because I get the feeling that you are objecting in ignorance. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:34, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, I was confused about the content of the magazines, and didn't realize that there they were not "in-universe". And as to the the notability. Notability of the show is a done deal, I agree. But not the notability of a fictional demon-friendly karaoke bar as a stand alone article is not. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 17:42, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, if knew more about the show, you might recognize that the setting appears in multiple episodes (and is the focus of at least one), so I'd say that establishes the notability, the same way with any other number of places in fiction, whether it be <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gondor.html" title="Gondor">Gondor</a>, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship_Enterprise_3c8f.html" title="Starship Enterprise">Enterprise</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/x/Baxter_Building_6156.html" title="Baxter Building">Baxter Building</a> or any number of other places important enough to have an article of their own. I would probably agree with you if it was in only one episode, or more properly fit under some sub-category but in this case? No, I understand why it's worth having its own article, even absence outside review. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, could these all fit into some single new article about the settings of the Buffy world? Say one detailing important places? I don't know, I am trying to come up with something. Then the article could be started and kept well referenced. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 18:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - These locations are notable as <i>crucial</i> locations in super-notable series. Wikipedia can cope with few of the most important locations from fictions, I'd never argue that we need an article for every room in a series, that would be madness. I'd agree that they could be improved by citing where information is coming from (e.g. footnotes referencing specific episodes). Wales: "free access to the sum of all human knowledge", we don't need to censor the popular culture bits, instead lets improve them. It's easy to sneer at popular culture, but the fictional narratives that millions share say a lot about us. - <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyverse_d279.html" title="User:Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The main problem with this article at present is that it is, at best, a summary of the primary source material regarding the subject. Per <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)</a>, it ought to discuss discussion of the room in a reliable source external to the show. If there isn't any to cite, well, perhaps it really isn't notable then. If there is, I think that will sway those who seek deletion. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 03:05, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hellmouth gets 315,000 Googlehits. The series was set in a town which happened to be on the hellmouth, so much supernatural horror arrived weekly. There have been numerous articles reflecting on the hellmouth as a metaphor for the angst of the highschool years: "The earlier and lighter years depicted suburban American adolescence as a metaphor for the Hellmouth." in "Buffy Rides Off Into the Sunset;" [Editorial]Gail Collins. New York Times. (Late Edition (East Coast)). New York, N.Y.: May 21, 2003. pg. A.30. "The premise of <i>Buffy</i> is that Sunnydale, the sleepy California town where Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her divorced mom (Kristine Sutherland), L.A. natives, have relocated, is built on the Hellmouth, a convergence of supernatural energies that draws a wide variety of vampires and demons." in "Yes, She's a Vampire Slayer. No, Her Show Isn't Kid Stuff." Steve Vineberg. New York Times. (Late Edition (East Coast)). New York, N.Y.: Oct 1, 2000. pg. 2.42. "Living in generic Sunnydale, California, which just happens to be on top of a Hellmouth -- the point of entry for vampires, demons, mummies, and other assorted monster-movie creeps -- Buffy is a social misfit." in "Buffy slays Ally: what does a vampire-killing teen have that a miniskirted lawyer doesn't?" Kingwell, Mark. Saturday Night. Toronto: May 1998.Vol.113, Iss. 4; pg. 77.

<dd>Please use the sources in the article. Cite them. Cite all the claims and the plot summary in the article. By your own admission the only way these sources were located was from Proquest. They were not used in the writing of the article. The onus for verifiability is on the person who adds all this information.

<dd>I think you misunderstand the purpose of NOR, which is not for things like this article which are based on real things, but for articles that are merely theories.

<dd>From <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, "Original research is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to material that has not been published by a reliable source. It includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position." So, it includes anything not drawn from a reliable source. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 17:33, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I really think you are missing the point of the OR policy. Observation of something in a fictional medium doesn't always require independent sources. If Giles says there is a Hellmouth in Sunnydale, I'm comfortable with an article that says there's a Hellmouth in Sunnydale. Thus while some of the content may be questionable, arguing that there are no independent sources is missing the point. Object to theories on the Hellmouth if you want, but it doesn't change the fact that common sense will tell you that the Hellmouth itself is not OR. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:17, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It's based on many hotels in Los Angeles...Angel lived in a larger suite in the hotel, like a honeymoon suite, the producers wanted Angel to have enough room to relax and get away from it all, do a little pondering, a little brooding, a little research.

<dd>The Television show claims notability. This is an aspect of the television show. Hence no assertion of notability is necessary. It's part of the show. If it is a minor trivial element of the show, that's one thing, it should be merged into another article, but not deleted. Furthermore, information about the Magic Box is available from Buffy Magazine among other places. If this article didn't use it, suggest a rewrite from such sources then. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:58, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The television show has notability. This does not. "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other." The show has been written about, this place has not. Buffy Magazine is not a reliable source that is in my opinion "indent of the subject itself." Furthermore, while you can argue notability and sourcing here, and claim that there are sources out there, they were not cited or used in this article. The entire thing fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. And again, if you want to rewrite, take 5 minutes and do it.

<dd>A further thought, if this show filmed at a gas station, under your reasoning, what stops someone from creating an article about it? It was on the show, so it is notable, and we would have to allow an article? Who decides what is a minor and trivial element in relation to this show? The answer to the question would be we would look at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. If it passed both of those we would keep. But, if it failed, as this article fails, we would delete. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 16:16, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I came across this when I was cleaning up a mess of vanity edits relating to one Thakur Sher Singh Parmar (now deleted per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Thakur_Sher_Singh_Parmar_7c15.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Thakur Sher Singh Parmar">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Thakur Sher Singh Parmar</a>).

<p>Firstly, the reason I didn't tag this as a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-corp_9f48.html" title="Template:Db-corp">db-corp</a>}} is because it has an assertion of notability, however weak that is.</p>
<p>Page was created in June, and has been tagged requiring references to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> since. It makes the weak assertion of notability of <b>allegedly</b> being the <i>Identity and Strategic design</i> company behind <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestl%C3%A9.html" title="Nestlé">Nestlé</a> and a couple of others. Firstly, I'm pretty sure they aren't the only company Nestlé and others have hired to do the same job - international corporations always do. It appears it only contributes to these companies in Mexico, which is the reason why I am nominating it, as a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">non-notable</a> <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">company</a>.

<dd>this is what I put on the talk page, I think it's a reasonable argument for keeping this article:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>part of why wikipedia is so great is that it contains info on many obscure bands, musicians, composers and djs like samix, similar artists on wikipedia include <a href="../../../l/i/v/Living_Legends_e495.html" title="Living Legends">Living Legends</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Martinez_4060.html" title="Josh Martinez">Josh Martinez</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retching_Red_ad3d.html" title="Retching Red">Retching Red</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilt.html" title="Tilt">tilt</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Grouch_3384.html" title="The Grouch">The Grouch</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skankin%27_Pickle_f8f5.html" title="Skankin' Pickle">Skankin' Pickle</a>, etc. etc. etc. (Particularly bands like Skankin Pickle and Tilt, who never really "made it" but are now broken up and no longer even in existence).</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this article is to be deleted then so are thousands of others, making the whole point of wikipedia moot.

<dd>also most every band playing music today has a myspace page, how is that evidence of anything <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStangoldsmith_1951.html" title="User:Stangoldsmith">stan goldsmith</a> 00:32, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Static Universe's point is that a legitimately notable or "big" band would probably spring for their own domain. Myspace (in my experience, and I'm sure that of many other editors) is often synonymous with unheard-of, no-name bands. — <a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb"><i>talk</i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb"><i>contribs</i></a></sup> 05:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, excuse me for saying so but every single band in the world right now has a myspace page, many exclusively so, I'm not sure if you are outdated or what, but that's the truth. Many bands rely exclusively on myspace for promotion, tour dates, networking and more, more so than their own websites nowadays (update for everyone!).... myspace is now, maybe before it was seen as lame, but now it's THE place...</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. This page contains much sexuality in its contents and quite a few inappropriate images. A normal encyclopedia would not have an article about this ridiculous erotic spanking. I think it is safe to assume that not too many users view this article, except those who are... unlike most, no offense. It is quite useless, in my humble opinion, and merely taking up space in Wikipedia. I did not expect many people to object. I am sorry if I have done something wrong by proposing the deletion of this article, it is just that I did not expect too many people to oppose my opinion. Please consider my suggestion to remove this article. I doubt it will greatly impact your life in a negative way if this article is gone, but I fear it is possible that the same cannot be said for others, especially younger users. Please support my suggestion. Thanks! <a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUioh_b3e0.html" title="User:Uioh">Uioh</a> 23:22, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The initial nomination basis is invalid because it is not based in policy. However, think <b>the policies</b> people. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. This article not only violates but radically violates <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>RATIONALE:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>This article does not establish notability, verifiability, or neutrality per how those are defined <i>in Wikipedia policy</i></b>
<ul>
<li>"A topic is notable if it has been the subject of <u>multiple</u>, non-trivial, <u>reliable</u> published works, whose sources <u>are independent of</u> the subject itself" (from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>).
<ul>
<li>The article uses only <u>one</u> book reference. That is INSUFFICIENT to establish notability. Moreover, the one reference in itself fails to meet standard of being a reliable independent source so as to establish notability, and it violates NPOV:
<ul>
<li>"In order to have a neutral article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will be <u>from unbiased and unaffiliated sources</u>; and that those interested in the article will not be exclusively <u>partisan or fanatic editors</u>" (quote from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). Clearly, this article violates that because:
<ul>
<li>1. The lone reference is of a book that is VERY clearly NOT from an "unbiased and unaffiliated source". The author, "<a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Green_58fa.html" title="Lady Green">Lady Green</a>", is very clearly a partisan practitioner of Erotic spanking. Her book cannot be used in this article but only in an article about herself (see #5 below).</li>
<li>2. The publisher of the lone reference in the article is <a href="http://www.greenerypress.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.greenerypress.com/" rel="nofollow">Greenery Press</a>. Nice sounding, but have a look at their website and tell me if you really think they meet the standard of being an "unbiased and unaffiliated source", or whether it is "independent of the subject itself". Not even close! Thus, even the lone book reference cited in the article fails to establish notability as that is defined in Wikipedia policies - it is not from "an unbiased and unaffiliated source".</li>
<li>3. "Those interested in the article," who have written the article, have very clear been "exclusively partisan or fanatic editors." This is evidenced by the product they have produced that uses the lone book source they have used in the article which is clearly NOT an "unbiased and unaffiliated source" that is "independent of the subject itself". As well, by the act of editing, editors implicitly consent that they know and author within Wikipedia content policies. This article has existed for almost 5 years and been subject to nearly 500 edits yet it violates said policies as just described and as will be described more below. This evidences they are "exclusively partisan or fanatic editors."</li>
<li>4. "Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy" (from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). Does anyone want to claim that "Lady Green" and Greenery Press tally to a "reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy"?? Hence:</li>
<li>5. The lone book used to justify this article is, per Wikipedia policy at <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Sources_of_dubious_reliability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources_of_dubious_reliability</a>, is a source "of dubious reliability", which are defined in the policy as "sources with a poor reputation for fact-checking or with no fact-checking facilities or editorial oversight." It continues, "Sources of dubious reliability should only be used in <u>articles about the author(s)"</u>.</li>
<li>6. The dubious reliability is evidenced throughout the article. Here is a <u>radically</u> dubious, and controversial, claim from the article: "Examples [of <i>spankophiles</i>] include the poet <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algernon_Swinburne_a890.html" title="Algernon Swinburne">Algernon Swinburne</a> and the philosopher <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_3039.html" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>." Wow!!! But per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, "Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources." Yet here in this article we have only a dubious source that, by Wikipedia policy, can not even be used in this article but only be used in an article about the author, i.e., "<a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Green_58fa.html" title="Lady Green">Lady Green</a>". Yet here we have it as the lone source!</li>
<li>7.<a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT#Wikipedia_is_not_censored</a> has a crucially important caveat.

Further, your notability rationale extends what the policy means beyond what it says. "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself" does not mean that the multiple sources need to be referenced in the article, but that they have to exist.

<p>LOL. The recent "reference additions" is what is called <i>reference-padding</i>.</p>
<p>The willingness to reference-pad further evidences that "Those interested in the article," who have written the article, have very clear been "exclusively partisan or fanatic editors."</p>
<p>Here is how reference-padding works:</p>
<ol>
<li>You write an article based on one book that, per policy, can only be used in the author's biography</li>
<li>Someone calls you on it (me)</li>
<li>You quick scramble and stick some other references into the article <i>while leaving the text intact</i></li>
<li>You magically think that fixes the article</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the funniest tactics of this was including <a href="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=XNNEFH7GDDQA9GALKUSDEG5XU50D71H2&amp;ID=65902" class="external text" title="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=XNNEFH7GDDQA9GALKUSDEG5XU50D71H2&amp;ID=65902" rel="nofollow">this URL</a> in the reference. It screams, "I have never actually read this article". But I <i>have</i> read the article, because I have access to it from my major university's library (the direct URL to the journal article is <a href="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/E-Text/View_EText.asp?sid=7PB1EGG8PJDJ9HS24WE5KJHPMVNK1LN5&amp;a=3&amp;s=J082&amp;v=50&amp;i=2%2F3&amp;fn=J082v50n02%5F04" class="external text" title="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/E-Text/View_EText.asp?sid=7PB1EGG8PJDJ9HS24WE5KJHPMVNK1LN5&amp;a=3&amp;s=J082&amp;v=50&amp;i=2%2F3&amp;fn=J082v50n02%5F04" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Guess what. <i>Nothing in the journal text provides support for the text in this WP article.</i> Thus, reference-padding.</p>
<p>If you want to prove reference-padding has not been further done, although anyone with integrity and sense will admit what I am saying is true and that this padding is as plain as day, I want to see <i>page numbers</i> to the "extra" references you added <i>keyed by footnotes to assertions in the text</i>.</p>
<p>Here is <i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3913/3913.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3913/3913.txt" rel="nofollow">The Confessions of Jean-Jaques Rousseau</a></i>, the complete book available to anyone because it is public domain. Perhaps you can start there. Surely if you have even actually read this book (VERY unlikely, of course) you will know where to find the text where he reportedly "confesses" to being a <i>spankophile</i>. Good luck.</p>
<p>However, please be assured <u>I will check the references and call you on it</u>, as I did <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_AfD_Original_Research_of_Wanker_and_non_Verfiability_of_claims_b54b.html" title="User:CyberAnth/AfD/Original Research of Wanker and non Verfiability of claims">here</a>. Surely, if no hocus-pocus reference-padding has gone on, no one would fear doing this.</p>

<dd>The first thing that you just have proven is that <i>you</i> have not looked at the actual reference. There is online access to the article and it is an article dedicated to "sexual spanking" (and more precisely, about how people practicing spanking see themselves), which states (let me quote <i>from</i> the article): <i>The specific activity described in this article is simply called erotic spanking.</i>. The second thing is that I did not include the article in a section "References", but in a section called "References and further reading" (I hope you appreciate the difference). Finally, <i>inline</i> citations are currently NOT required by Wikipedia (although they are encouraged), please read <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>. Yes, in time inline citations would be better, but at least now this very applicable article is already linked to from the Wikipedia article, allowing also others to more quickly find it.

<p>I know it has been reference-padded. That is what I said.</p>
<p>The purpose of the journal article is to delve into the <i>ontological identify formations of erotic spankers and how they psychologically guide themselves through stigmatization neutralizations</i>.</p>
<p>The piece asks, "How do spanking aficionados understand and explain themselves?" It seeks to understand spankers' "sexual scripts, neutralization of stigma, impression management, and the development of the sexual self". It uses interviews as its primary research method.</p>
<p>It is not about exhibitionism.</p>
<p>Here is a quote that captures much of the tenor of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About spanking aficionados, he did say, "We wonder about ourselves and our 'perversion' endlessly" ... Newer participants were especially prone to these musings. Andrew said, "You know, I can’t believe that I’m here. I look around and wonder what the hell I’m doing here. I mean, I'm not like these other people. This isn’t all I do or anything." He was trying to neutralize any stigma to himself by comparing himself to the other party-goers. He implied that the others had a single-minded focus on spanking–but he was "normal," his interest in spanking was just a small piece of his identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article then expands the above description of stigmatization neutralization, by showing it is done through comparing one's own behavior with others':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One group denigrates another "fringe" group in order to mitigate the stigmatizing effects: "are more normal than they are; they are the true deviants."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't "write an article" citing one unallowable reference and then "get it referenced" via reference padding with allowable ones, while keeping the text intact based on one unallowable reference. You scrap the text, go to the reliable references, and then write the article based solidly upon them. You might call that "bad faith", but I call it "how to responsibly write an encyclopedia."</p>

<dd>First of all, I didn't write the article. Second, you don't have to copy/paste random, beside the point quotes from the article to prove that you have access. Finally, although admirable, what you consider "how to responsibly write an encyclopedia" is not how Wikipedia currently works. All the time people are adding unsourced information. Given time and attention, that information will be sourced (by the same people, or by others) or removed <i>íf sources cannot be found</i>. You want to remove information without even having looked if sources exist (as proven above by the fact that you fully disregarded the mentioned article as a source). There is (in Wikipedia) nothing wrong with searching references for statements made by others. It happens all the time and is (part of) how Wikipedia works. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 22:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Random text? You're kidding, right? I gave a brief review of the whole article. The only thing it does is verify a few basic facts, e.g., "spanking often occurs on the buttocks". If you want to have entire books reference material, place the page numbers with footnotes at the bottom so people can actually verify it. Otherwise, no one can tell it from reference padding. Would you like people to have to read the entire book to verify some sentences? If you have the book, place the page numbers and reference them to specific portions of the text. That way I can (and will) verify (or falsify) it. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 23:02, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No I was not kidding, you are cluttering this discussion with unrelated things. The article is (as you yourself stated) based on <i>interviews</i> with people engaging in spanking. <i>They themselves</i> have stated they were "solely interested in “the bottom,” or the buttocks". This is the <i>perfect</i> source for that statement in the Wikipedia article. And yes, those are basic facts. Are you now saying that the basic facts do not need sources?

<dd>Some time ago I already accepted the two quotes as referenced reliably, remember? I showed what the article should look like based upon what is referenced and verifiable, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erotic_spanking&amp;diff=98722759&amp;oldid=98716551" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erotic_spanking&amp;diff=98722759&amp;oldid=98716551" rel="nofollow">see here</a>. I am speaking of the rest of the article that I cannot verify. If whoever added the Koetzle and Marcus book did not just reference-pad with them by just finding a book listed at amazon.com or something, it should not be too much trouble to post page numbers footnoted to article text so I can verify (or falsify) the content. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 23:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment on the "reference padding"</b> Okay, I'm the one who added the new paragraph on the Victorian spanking, the new book references, and the phrase about Rousseau's <i>Confessions</i>. I was relaying facts from a term paper I wrote three years ago for a class on Victorian pornography. If that makes me partisan, then so are many other people working in sex and gender studies. I'm sorry if I don't remember exact page numbers from books I read in 2003, but to impugn someone's integrity without knowing all the facts is cruel and insulting. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.224.105.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.224.105.69_996e.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.224.105.69">contribs</a>) 22:38, 5 January 2007.</small></li>

<dd>"Those interested in giving or receiving erotic spankings are sometimes (rarely) known as spankophiles.

<li><b>Comment - My rationale for speedy keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the fact that this topic is extremely notable and has historic significance, it's a part of healthy and consensual sexuality. Wikipedia is not censored for children, and furthermore, children are not idiots. Any minor with access to an unlocked computer (how many of <i>those</i> are around, I wonder) or a <i>library card</i> can and <i>will</i> get whatever information they need on just about any topic.</p>
<p>If they have a couple of bucks and an older friend, they can get everything they need to know in the way of pornography. On any topic related to sexuality, I personally would prefer they got their info <i>here</i>, rather than <i>there</i>. Erotic Spanking doesn't need to be deleted, it needs to be expanded and improved. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinaOdell_d40b.html" title="User:NinaOdell">Nina Odell</a> 01:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - the article is on a valid subject, notable enough for Wikipedia. If people want to see more references the way to go is to add an appropriate clean-up tag to the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:06, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy &amp; strong keep</b> - The original rationale is not only not supported by policy, it is opposed by policy. The detailed arguments of <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> speak to a need to improve the article. Given <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a>'s concern about the article, my suggestion would be that his/her energies be turned toward improving it. The subject is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> (close to 200,000 Google hits on the exact phrase "erotic spanking"). It's been the subject of book, magazine, film, and scholarly research. Notability is so clearly and objectively established in popular culture as to render assertions to the contrary doubtful at best. Certainly, the article needs improvement, but deletion is unwarranted. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 05:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> — The only time I have seen the word "wikifascist" was on a site highly critical of Wikipedia, where it was used to characterize me with regard to remarks I addressed to <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaisch_b417.html" title="User:Haisch">Bernard Haisch</a>. No formal definition was offered, but the context made it clear the intended meaning had nothing to do with rapid deletion of articles. (They chose the bits they wanted from what I said, and added a bizarre spin, so I would not trust their use of the term either.) I might vote to delete this article, but then (according to <i>its</i> definition) that <i>would</i> make me a wikifascist. It is a mere definition page, not an encyclopedia article; and it is Wikipedia talking about itself. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 02:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> No one is saying his life was not of value. However, there are MANY horrible deaths every single day and all of them can not be listed here. If we keep this article, then it could be argued to include every single homicide as notable, however unfortunate, but let's face it, NOT notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.134.56.20_581d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.134.56.20">70.134.56.20</a> (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.134.56.20.html" title="User talk:70.134.56.20">talk</a>) 03:49, 4 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep and/or Rewrite</b>. This article is very notable and I'll tell you why. Up until now, Tacoma has never faced a major massacre attack outside of the 2006 Tacoma Mall shooting, which ended in no deaths. Also, this news of Kok's death is very recent and will have more information added later, I'm sure. For instance, every 20 minutes more and more information on the massacre is coming out. In fact, just a while ago we've learned the gunman's name. As time unravels, this article will become very notable and will have much information for a nice and worthy article. I created this article as a way for people to learn more about this situation as it unravels and eventually create a great article. Also, this death has more shock factor and worth than any plain death. This boy died in his school, a place which should have been safe for him. And yes, even though school shootings are becoming more and more common each day, this death is quite rememerable and important, as it shows the very first major massacre in Tacoma which has in the end shoved a major city of 200,000 into distraught. Please keep this article as it will soon be very notable indeed. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacrio_fc7a.html" title="User:Jacrio">Jacrio</a> 21:08, 3 January 2007 (PST)</li>
