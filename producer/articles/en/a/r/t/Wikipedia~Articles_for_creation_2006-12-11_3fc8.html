<p>Fumio Manaka Sensei, who also goes by the martial name “Unsui”, has over 40 years of experience in the Japanese arts of kobudo, having started training at the age of 14 as the first student of Masaaki Hatsumi (Soke of the Bujinkan).</p>
<p>Unsui Sensei holds certificates of mastery (menkyo kaiden) in several martial schools and has formal training in many others. In 1996, Unsui Sensei founded the Jissen Kobudo Jinenkan. He also established Jinen Ryu Jissen Kobudo.</p>
<p>Manaka Sensei retired from the Japanese navy in 2001, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.</p>
<p>For many years Unsui Sensei had made regular trips to the United States to conduct training seminars and to directly instruct his students. From April 2001 to May 2004 Manaka Sensei lived and trained in Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.A.).</p>
<p>His goal in this move from Japan was to allow martial artists in the United States and Europe easier access to him and to raise the level of training in these areas. With his goals achieved, he returned to Japan in June 2004. He continues his tradition of annual seminars in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

<p>A product of a father who was a jazz drummer and a mother who was a classical pianist, indie soul singer Nedelle Torrisi, or Nedelle, grew up playing a variety of instruments, including violin, piano, and guitar. She eventually started composing and arranging her own material, which eventually led to her Republic of Two debut, which was released in May of 2003.</p>
<p>Il quarto album di Nedelle Torrisi si intitola I Hate a Mountain ed è uscito il 7 febbraio del 2006 sempre per Kill Rock stars, che ha pubblicato complessivamente tre dei quattro full lenght della songwriter americana. In questi giorni è possibile catturare Nedelle in italia per una serie di concerti che consigliamo a chi non conosce la sua intima comunione musicale tra folk, memphis e il misticismo alla fragola delle Lennon Sisters. Nedelle Torrisi comincia oggi a Milano al Leoncavallo e prosegue domani, 9 giugno a Genova al Madaleine Cafe, l'11 a Roma presso il Linux Club a ingresso gratuito, il 12 a Pesaro nei locali del Moloko, per finire il 13 giugno a Maniago, presso il Ridotto. Da qui pre-ascolto di una traccia tratta da una raccolta KRS e altri suoni sul profilo Myspace di Nedelle. <a name="Sources_6" id="Sources_6"></a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-11_3fc8.html" title="Edit section: CK collar">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CK collar</span></h2>
<p>The CK collar was invented by Chris Köhne from Perth, Western Australia around the time of June 2005. The problem at hand was that most clubs throughout the metropolitan area of Perth required males to wear a collar in order to be granted entry into the club. The CK collar was invented as a way to get around this problem without having to wear a collar all the time.</p>
<p>By cutting out the collar of an existing shirt, CK would have a piece of apparel that would serve as an entry ticket into clubs. Once cut out the “CK collar” can easily be stored in the back pocket of your jeans. Then when you come close to approaching the club all you do is take it out and position it underneath your t-shirt, with the collar sticking out. This gives the impression that you’re wearing a collared shirt underneath your ordinary t shirt. Once inside the club you can then take the “CK collar” out from your t-shirt and store it back in your pocket.</p>
<p>The “CK collar” is only know by a select few who are lucky enough to have some association with ‘the inventor’- Chris Kohne, however more people are hearing about it every weekend and soon enough its popularity will be evident.</p>

<p>This text was written in 1749 by Denis Diderot. Although he gave it the tittle "letter", it's more than 50 pages long. In fact, it's more an essay than a letter. In this text, Diderot tried to explore the world of the blind and the effect of their senses (and the fact they can't see) on their way of thinking.</p>

<p>A playground parachute is a round multicolored nylon sheet commonly 20 to 30 feet in diameter. It may or may not have handles on the periphery. It is used by arranging children on the outside, who then violently wave the parachute up and down. The playground parachute is common in kindergarten and early elementary school physical education classes and organized recess. Some activities with a playground parachute include:</p>
<p>Cat and mouse: one child is placed on top of the parachute, and up to three children under the parachute. The cat tries to tag the mice, but the mice are hidden by the wavelike movement of the parachute.</p>
<p>Ball games- one or many beach balls or playground balls are placed on top of the parachute. The teacher may try to encourage teamwork by getting the children to catapult the ball by working in unison.</p>
<p>Tepee- The parachute is brought up, then the children raise their part of the parachutes over their heads and behind their back, and sit down. This creates an air pocket which resembles a tent.</p>

<p>Senna (茜雫, Senna? lit. drop of madder) is an unusual young woman met by Ichigo and Rukia in the Bleach movie "Memories of Nobody". She appears to be a shinigami, but when questioned, she refuses to reveal her identity and evades their questions regarding her squad assignment. Soon after, she is attacked by a group known as the "Dark Ones" for unknown reasons. She and Ichigo fight together against this group and their leader Ganryu.</p>
<p>Senna wears the standard unseated shinigami uniform, known as a shihakushō, except for a large, red ribbon which she ties around her waist. Her zanpakutō is named Mirokumaru (弥勒丸, Mirokumaru? lit. Maitreya circle) and takes the form of a spear during its released state</p>
<p>There has been much debate over the appearance of Senna in the special opening and ending of bleach episode 106. Showing many scenes from the movie of her and the main character Ichigo it left many bleach fans confused to why she was so close with him. This lead people to believe that she is either another love interest specially for the movie in order to raise hype or that she is possibly Ichigo and Rukias daughter from the future. Since news broke that Kubo Tite created the characters it fueled belief that she could possibly be a future part of the story. Niether of these views have been proven however.</p>
<p>The movie airs in Japan on December 16th</p>

<p><b>Reject</b> - This article needs to make it clear that we are talking about a fictitious character in an Anime movie. The mutiple articles about the Bleach movie are currently the subjects of AfD requests. If the movie turns out to be non-notable, then this character certainly is non-notable too. If one of the movie articles is accepted after AfD then you should write about this character within that article - a separate article is rarely needed in these circumstance. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 22:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>66.245.146.7 16:35, 10 December 2006 (UTC) A noted national decorator acknowledged in the design press as being one of the top 100 designers in the United States with a practice from Pebble Beach to Palm Beach, La Jolla to New York and based in Dallas. She is known for her intelligence and a demand for perfection. Her color sense and understanding of proportion and scale in a classic environment embodying timelessness are her trademarks. Her maxim is "If you buy the best you only cry once." This is seen in her curatorial skills assisting distinguished clients with suitable and investment worthy antiques from around the world.</p>
<p>The Black &amp; White Years, formally known as The Trees, was formed four years ago by Texas natives Scott Butler, Landon Thompson and New York native John Aldridge. After meeting at Belmont University in Nashville, The Years began playing and recording in their on campus living quarters. As Music Business and Studio Production majors, The Black &amp; White Years spent the remainder of college life in recording spaces and live venues around Nashville. The Years have recorded songs at historic RCA Studio B (Chet Atkins, Elvis, Roy Orbison, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash), Oceanway Nashville and various on-campus studios. After graduation in 2005, the band relocated to Austin. Since then they have gained a loyal local following that sees them play in various venues including a chance to entertain the High Times Magazine crowd at SXSW 2006. In the late Summer of 2006, as The Trees, they headlined the Arbor Day festival at Texas Tech University. Two self-produced five song Eps and a full length self-titled album featuring 21 original tracks signified a new beginning for the group that would usher in the use of a drum machine, live drums and all of the fun toys normally heard at their shows. They are known for their energetic, up beat shows that can catch the ear of a passer-by and surprise those of a devoted fan. Modern Pop sensibility melds with Rock-Exotica roots Reggae-Folk for a Techno-Retro Black &amp; White Years Experience.</p>

<p>The Black &amp; White Years, formally known as The Trees, was formed four years ago by Texas natives Scott Butler, Landon Thompson and New York native John Aldridge. After meeting at Belmont University in Nashville, The Years began playing and recording in their on campus living quarters. As Music Business and Studio Production majors, The Black &amp; White Years spent the remainder of college life in recording spaces and live venues around Nashville. The Years have recorded songs at historic RCA Studio B (Chet Atkins, Elvis, Roy Orbison, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash), Oceanway Nashville and various on-campus studios. After graduation in 2005, the band relocated to Austin. Since then they have gained a loyal local following that sees them play in various venues including a chance to entertain the High Times Magazine crowd at SXSW 2006. In the late Summer of 2006, as The Trees, they headlined the Arbor Day festival at Texas Tech University. Two self-produced five song Eps and a full length self-titled album featuring 21 original tracks signified a new beginning for the group that would usher in the use of a drum machine, live drums and all of the fun toys normally heard at their shows. They are known for their energetic, up beat shows that can catch the ear of a passer-by and surprise those of a devoted fan. Modern Pop sensibility melds with Rock-Exotica roots Reggae-Folk for a Techno-Retro Black &amp; White Years Experience.</p>

<p>In 1968 Brooklyn, N.Y. Democratic leader,Meade Esposito secured an abandoned public school building for The Yeshiva of Kings Bay. At this same time I was a member of the board of directors of the Yeshiva. The building began being used as a teaching institution albeit in great need of renovation. With Mr. Esposito's help a major benefit dinner was organized honoring then member of Congress,John M. Murphy. It was to be held on the evening of June 5th,1968. The principal speaker was to be Robert F. Kennedy. This too was arranged by Meade Esposito. On June 4th. the board was notified by Mr. Kennedy's people that due to a comittment in California he would not be able to attend the dinner.Mr. Esposito then secured The Hon. Howard Samuels to take his place as speaker for the evening.The rest is history. For on the very night Mr. Kennedy was to speak in Brooklyn he was gunned down in California.</p>

Throughout the begining years of the colonial United States many attempts were made to initiate a postal service. These early attempts were of small scale and usually involved a colony, Boston for example, setting up a location in town that one could post a letter back home to England. Other attempts focused on postal service between two larger colonies, such as Boston/Deleware, but the available services remained limited and disjointed for many years.</p>
<p>Central postal organization first came to the colonies in 1692 when Thomas Neale received a 21-year grant from the British Crown for a <b>North American Postal Service</b>. In February, 1692 a grant from <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_and_Mary_edbe.html" title="William and Mary">William and Mary</a> empowered Thomas Neale "to erect, settle and establish within the chief parts of their majesties' colonies and plantations in America, an office or offices for the receiving and dispatching letters and pacquets, and to receive, send and deliver the same under such rates and sums of money as the planters shall agree to give, and to hold and enjoy the same for the term of twenty-one years."</p>
<p>Rates of postage were accordingly fixed and authorized, and measures were taken to establish a postoffice in each town in Virginia. Massachusetts and other Colonies soon passed postal laws, and a very imperfect postoffice system was established. Neale's patent expired in 1710, when Parliament extended the English postal system to the Colonies. The chief office was established in New York, where letters were conveyed by regular packets across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>1692: Thomas Neale received postal patent (concession) for the American and West Indies Colonial Post; Neale appointed Andrew Hamilton, Governor of NJ, as his deputy postmaster.</p>
<p>1693: May 1: Hamilton started weekly service between Portsmouth, N.H. and Virginia. Campbell, Duncan and John organized first postal network in America.</p>
<p>1698: Neale dropped Hamilton; Hamilton had revenue of less than 2,000 dollars, expenses totaling app. 5,000 dollars for period in office</p>
<p>Neale's franchise cost him only 80 cents a year but was no bargain; he died heavily in debt, in 1699. --&gt;</p>

<p>Baseball/Softball Training aids For many years players of the game of baseball have worked diligently to hone their playing skills. It is readily established by those who study and review sports that hitting a 90+ mph pitch is the most difficult thing to do in athletics. In the last 10 years alone there have been many devices designed and placed on the market to enhance a hitters ability to improve skills. From the early batting tees to soft toss nets to the most elaborate and costly pitching machines which even have curve ball and change-up capabilities have been introduced. Serious players and coaches are almost willing to try any product if they feel it will help hand eye coordination and accurate striking positioning to the ball. Video clips of each player are used now by every major league team to assess changes and areas for improvement in the hitter's body motion to the ball.</p>
<p>Recently Ed Sprague, former World Series winner from the Toronto Blue Jays now coaching UOP Tigers in Stockton had said he purchased a "Hitaway" for his team to work with and indicated it was a complete waste of money as his players "blew it up" the first day they used it. Obviously each device will not be all things to all people as the Hitaway was designed for a more youthful limted practice. With so many products to choose from how do you select the one that will provide the best value for the dollar as well as promote improved hitting? Virtually the only way is to experiment and try several until you find the tool that best universally meets your expectations. One new product on the market now called the Bataround was tried by Steve Sax, former rookie of the year with the L.A. Dodgers was received very positively. Though this is a new item and widely untested he indicated, "I can see the pros using this product". Basically this item has been found to be the most portable and the most challenging device for hitters available for the price. With the Bataround you can create varities of pitches and speeds in an instant which trains the eye following the ball and hand speed to the ball faster than almost all other products on the market. To view the product in this article you can visit www.bataround.com but using it is the only real test of validation.</p>
<p>Skill videos or DVD's have also become a huge part of training for prospective players looking to improve their game in all aspects, hitting, fielding, pitching and baserunning. These are often produced by knowledgable ex-players or coaches who can really describe and lay out effective practice techniques for players to follow. "Hittingworld.com" is just one of the many places to secure highly respected training videos for players to improve development skills from creditable sources.</p>
<p>All in all as long as there is this great game of baseball there will be a need for products and tools for players around the world to work on improving their game. What will be the next new tool out there? Who knows, but one thing for sure, we'll be out there watching for it!</p>

<p>The first Aviation meeting in England</p>
<p>In 1909, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster.html" title="Doncaster">Doncaster</a> and specifically <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster_Racecourse_1bfc.html" title="Doncaster Racecourse">Doncaster Racecourse</a> was chosen as the venue for an airshow, after the world's first air display in Rheims in 1908. All the world's leading aviators were present. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Cody_72b3.html" title="Samuel Cody">Samuel Cody</a> in an attempt to win a prize offered by The Daily Mail for the first British pilot in a British aeroplane to fly a circular mile signed British naturalisation papers in front of the crowd with the band playing both the Star Spangled Banner and the National Anthem. Unfortunately, he crashed his British Army Aeroplane No.1 whilst taxiing.</p>
<p>World War I</p>
<p>During World War I fighters based first from the racecourse, then a temporary airstrip near Finningley (later <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Finningley_78e3.html" title="RAF Finningley">RAF Finningley</a> and now <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_Doncaster_Sheffield_International_Airport_2a0f.html" title="Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield International Airport">Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield International Airport</a>) and finally, in 1916, from a newly built airfield alongside the race course, were deployed to defend the east coast against <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">Zeppelins</a>. On a number of occasions fighters took off to search for the intruders but none were ever seen. The Royal Flying Corps station trained pilots for the war in France. Within months of the war ending the entire station was put up for sale and two of its three Belfast hangars, the same type of hangar that now forms the basis for the Royal Air Force museum at Hendon, were sold to a Sheffield motor manufacturing company for storage and assembly at Finningley. The third of the hangars stayed in place, mainly housing buses, until the 1970s when they were knocked down and replaced with modern buildings.</p>
<p>Aviation Centre</p>
<p>In 1920 the Government asked local authorities to assist in the formation of a chain of airfields so this country would not lack behind other nations in the provision of civil air services. Doncaster took heed and, with expert advice from Alan Cobham, on 26 May 1934, opened a grandly called 'aviation centre'. Development of the airfield continued and on 1 July 1936 an international service was open to Amsterdam. On 1 November 1938, after long discussions with the Air Ministry, 616 (South Yorkshire) fighter Squadron of the Auxiliary Air Force was formed. Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939 the squadron went to its battle station and played an honourable part in the Battle of Britain. After the departure of 616 squadron its place was taken by the formation of 271 (Transport) Squadron composed mainly of requisitioned civilian aircraft and obsolescent twin engined bombers. 616 squadron should be noted as the first Allied jet fighter squadron, who were equipped with the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloster_Meteor_007f.html" title="Gloster Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a>. In 1944, after being re-equipped with Dakotas, the squadron moved south to take part in operation 'Overlord' and later in the airborne invasion at Arnhem where Flight Lieutenant David Lord was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.</p>
<p>Post World War II</p>
<p><br />
After the war the airfield reverted to civilian flying and finally closed in 1992.</p>

<p>From the creators of the cult classic "I Hate You. Fuckzine" came the band with the same name and ideals. After one practice, I Hate You recorded a demo tape, played their first Philly show and began receiving a lot of local attention. I Hate You has been quoted to play old-school hardcore with lyrical content being sarcastic, hilarious, and consistently enraged.</p>
<p>Eventually they released their first 7" with Tied Down Records and named it "Seven Inches of Hate." I Hate You had a lot of good press in the fanzine circuit which helped them gain much popularity, but still, the band never played a show more than 100 miles outside of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In 1998, I Hate You recorded "The Prime Directive." It was a 7" released by Punk Uprisings. Shortly after, the group eventually split during a weekend tour through New York. A few years later, a collection of everything the group had ever recorded was released (Discography 1995-1998) on Deathwish Records.</p>
<p>I Hate You never released a proper album throughout their career. They became an instant cult-classic because of a couple demos, two seven inches and a bad reputation. Hardcore will never be the same after I Hate You.</p>
<p>Members of I HATE YOU went on to play in: American Nightmare, Damage, Knives Out, Me Without You, and Champion.</p>
