Isn't it a fairly likely search term for someone who doesn't know the word "pseudoscientific"? Also, the guidelines at <a href="../../../f/r/i/Wikipedia%7EFringe_theories_37ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Fringe theories">Wikipedia:Fringe theories</a> do refer to "non-mainstream theories", apparently as a neutral, all-encompassing term. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Famous_Movie_Director_f37a.html" title="User:The Famous Movie Director">Grace</a> 01:02, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Non-mainstream theories can be respectable theories, they certainly don't belong by definition to the pseudoscience category. So, a redirect to the pseudoscience list would not be appropriate. A list of theories that can be considered to be non-mainstream is very problematic. Of all the scientific theories that exist a certain percentage is non-mainstream, in the sense that most other people working in the field don't buy it but as a theory it is not obviously wrong. But you can't make a rule to demark the boundary between mainstream and non-mainstream. In case of pseudoscience there are reasonable criteria, but even in that case you can expect some borderline cases. So, this is a recipe for POV disputes. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 01:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Criteria for non-mainstream are about as easy or difficult as for pseudoscience, and it's certainly <i>less</i> a recipe for POV disputes. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 07:06, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. There are clear criteria for <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>. The only POV disputes you can get is whether or not a particular theory satisfy these criterea. Of course, you can expect the supporters of such theories to resist their theory being classified as pseudoscience, because it isn't a label they like to see attached to their theory.</dd>
<dd>In case of non-mainstream theories there don't exist unambiguous criterea at all. Supporter of a theories listed as "non-mainstream" may not object as often compared to their pseudoscience collegues, but in case a dispute does arise, there is no way to resolve it using objective criteria. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 14:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are also clear criteria for non-mainstream: just consult textbooks. In practice the criteria are similar to those that now are used for the psuedoscience list: non-mainstream is what mainstream rejects as "wrong". And indeed, Wikipedia is in principle against pejorative labeling of ideas held by certain groups. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 19:04, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's utter nonsense. You make an excelent argument why this list should be deleted; the aim is clearly to try to get pseudoscientific theories such as creationism into the same category as non-mainstream theories such as, say, <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a> and oppose any kind of lists to which you can only add theories like creationism but not <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a>. For the record, mainstream scientists may not believe that <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a> is correct, most don't work on it (if they do they try to disprove it). But they don't label it as nonsense. Articles written on such theories are not rejected out of hand. So, clearly there is a huge difference between pseudoscientific theories and theories one could label as non-mainstream.</dd>

<dd>The labeling "pseudoscientific" for creationism may be pejorative for the creationists, but to put creationism and similar nonsensical theories in the same list as some non-mainstream theories is pejorative for scientists.

<dd>If I'm not mistaken, this discussion isn't about the proposed contents but about the subject. I fully agree that clearly there is a huge difference between pseudoscientific theories and theories one could label as non-mainstream. However, it has also been noticed that theories that simply are non-mainstream have (had?) a tendency to be included in the list on pseudo-scientific theories because a list of non-mainstream theories didn't exist. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 21:15, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I think it goes too far to call many of the topics listed in pseudoscience "nonsense" (many of them have a high level of internal consistency) what Iblis says is essentially correct. To use a related but more direct example- only a small fraction of biologists still think that birds are not descended from dinosaurs, but the opinion is very much not pseudoscience. However, denying <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_descent.html" title="Common descent">common descent</a> is. It would be terribly offensive and unencyclopedic to categorize them in the same way at all. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:51, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please do your research before spouting off claims. This is not a proposed list, this is a relic of a failed move. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudoscientific_theories&amp;diff=67884233&amp;oldid=67545498" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudoscientific_theories&amp;diff=67884233&amp;oldid=67545498" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudoscientific_theories&amp;diff=68055628&amp;oldid=67888543" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudoscientific_theories&amp;diff=68055628&amp;oldid=67888543" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Yes, it originally was at "List of alternative, speculative, and disputed theories," but that was a conceit to NPOV which opened the door to too many legitimate theories (What theory <i>isn't</i> disputed by at least one person?). The list was moved here to match the original intent of the list.</dd>
<dd>As for pseudoscience being used as a pejorative; that's completely irrelevent (besides, it's even mentioned in the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_FAQ_00b9.html#Pseudoscience" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ">official policies</a> with this word. However, there is a good point in that proponents of these theories generally contest the label, so I'm going to recommend a page move to List of theories commonly considered pseudoscientific. ---<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrLeebot_fec7.html" title="User:DrLeebot">DrLeebot</a> 13:01, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Things which are pseudoscientific are almost always currently non-mainstream, but may have once been mainstream, and things which are not mainstream are not necessarily pseudoscientific (some are just wrong, for example, and some are just unpopular).

<dd>William, there already exists a list of obsolete theories. But a list of alternative or speculative theories is very difficult, because what are the criterea? This is inherently POV. What is bound to happen is that the list will consist of not so popular theories of which a wiki page happens to exist. Of course in certain cases it's clear that a theory is "alternative", take e.g. various theories that assume that humans are not responsible for global warming. And even in this case, how many revert wars were there about the "small minority " sentence&#160;:) <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 12:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The current list also contains some theories that are completely <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_cube.html" title="Time cube">incomprehensible</a>, so then maybe we should move it to List of alternative, speculative, obsolete, disputed, or incomprehensible theories. And what about the theories it includes that are just <i>weird</i>? We could go on like this forever. Le Sage gravity shouldn't be included and should be removed if no one advocates it now, but if advocates are still around then it does qualify as pseudoscience. ---<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrLeebot_fec7.html" title="User:DrLeebot">DrLeebot</a> 13:01, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"pseudoscientific" is not more controversial from a reasonable neutral point of view at all. There are clear criterea unlike in the case of "non-mainstream". We cannot appease the pseudoscientists for opposing the the very reasonable majority view (based on objective criterea) that their theory is pseudoocientific just because they don't like it. Any list of "non-mainstream" theories is highly problematic because there are no unambiguous criterea at all. The original list before I renamed it had this problem. What happened was that the list contained almost exclusively pseudoscientific theories. That meant that you could not add theories that were "simply the minority view", because that would be offensive to the people working on that theory. Note that even if you split thelist in two parts on the same page, google's indexing methods will cause respectable theories on the list to be associated with the label "pseudocience". <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 12:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but properly sort. There are really three types of theories that would fit on such a list. <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a> as referenced above is a proposed theory that most physicists probably believe is a possibility, though they may not support it or work on it. Few would consider it impossible or nonsense. On the other hand, the Electric Universe theory (which among other things claims that black holes don't exist) is probably in the second category: most mainstream physicists believe that it is probably BS, and those who support it are generally not accepted as part of the mainstream. However, a supporter of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a> would not find himself ostricized in the community because MOND is accepted as a possibility, and isn't pseudoscience. Then, of course, there is the third category, the category of theories that are all-and-out pseudoscience and have no actual scientific backing. If the list can be properly titled and sorted, this would be quite useful. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 13:06, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> Why isn't this in Redirects for Discussion? The discussion here seems to be about the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pseudoscientific_theories.html" title="List of pseudoscientific theories">List of pseudoscientific theories</a> article (which is protected so can't be nominated for deletion yet) rather than about the article this AfD links to.

<li><b>Reply</b> No, this should be at redirects because this was a result of an attempted POV move by Arturo 7 and was then moved back.
