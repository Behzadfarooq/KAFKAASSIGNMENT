<p>The "teatro di narrazione" (narrative theatre) is a kind of theatre in which there are not any actor playing a dramatic role, there is no action, but only a "narr-attore" who tells the story as he was the narrative voice of a novel. During the show, the "narr-attore" often sits on a chair, doesn't move, just speaks. In the teatro di narrazione there are no theatrical objects, no costumes and no lights: just the ones necessary to let the audience see the performer on the stage: sometimes also the theatre is enlighted so that the narr-attore can see the faces of the audience because the narr-attore speaks properly and directly to his audience, without any fiction or scheme. It started with Mistero Buffo by <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dario_Fo_2023.html" title="Dario Fo">Dario Fo</a> in 1969. In the following years, two generation of "narr-attori" has grown and obtained a lot of success: Marco Paolini, Marco Baliani and Laura Curino belong to the first generation (the one of the performer born in the '50); Ascanio Celestini and Davide Enia to the second (they both were born in the '70). The "teatro di narrazione" tries to investigate in the "dark holes" of italian history: like the murder of Aldo Moro by the Red Brigades in 1978 in "Corpo di stato" by Baliani; like the experience of the business-men Camillo and Adriano Olivetti in "Olivetti" by Curino; like the tragedy of Vajont in "Il racconto del Vayont" by Paolini; the bombing of the Alleys on Palermo during the second world war in "maggio '43" by Enia; the nazi-fascist occupation of Rome in "Radio Clandestina" and the american liberation of the city in "Scemo di guerra" by Celestini.</p>

<p>Faye Abdellah, RN, Ed.D., Sc.D., FAAN, was the founding dean of the Graduate School of Nursing at Uniformed Services University located at Bethesda, MD. Abdellah was the first Deputy surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service.</p>
<p>She identified 21 nursing problems which were related to human needs in the 1960's. According to her, nurses use a problem solving approach to practice instead of only following the physicians' orders. She conceptualized nursing as an art and science that molds the attitudes, intellectual skills, and technical competencies of the nurse into the desire and ability to help sick or well people, and cope with their health needs.</p>

<p>A very unique person. He was the best arichitect born in Berlin in 1883. The son of an architect, he studied at the Technical Universities in Munich and Berlin. He joined the office of Peter Behrens in 1910 and three years later established a practice with Adolph Meyer. For his early commissions he borrowed from the Industrial Classicism introduced by Behrens.</p>
<p>After serving in the war,he became involved with several groups of radical artists that sprang up in Berlin in the winter of 1918. In March 1919 he was elected chairman of the Working Council for Art and a month later was appointed Director of the Bauhaus.</p>
<p>As war became eminent,he left the Bauhaus and resumed private practice in Berlin. Eventually, he was forced to leave Germany for the United States, where he became a professor at Harvard University. From 1938 to 1941, he worked on a series of houses with Marcel Breuer and in 1945 he founded "The Architect's Collaborative", a design team that embodied his belief in the value of teamwork. He created innovative designs that borrowed materials and methods of construction from modern technology. This advocacy of industrialized building carried with it a belief in team work and an acceptance of standardization and prefabrication. Using technology as a basis, he transformed building into a science of precise mathematical calculations.</p>
<p>An important theorist and teacher,he introduced a screen wall system that utilized a structural steel frame to support the floors and which allowed the external glass walls to continue without interruption. He died in Boston, Massachusetts in 1969.</p>

<p>Here is the storyline as displayed on the website itself, I have no ownership to this in any way and I do not claim to have any responsibility over it:</p>
<p>"It began approximately 5000 years ago in the land of U'Moria, a dark and barren wasteland that stood uninhabited for years. Humans thought the land of U'Moria was untouchable. That soon would change..</p>
<p>One day, the Humans that inhabited the nearby town of Crystallion were visited by a Dark Wanderer. His name was Krelon. A wicked, decrepit scientist who practiced the Dark Arts and intermingled those practices with his experiments. It was because of these experiments that he had been cast out of every town he visited. For Krelon believed that by tapping into the immense Plasma Energies found in the blood of the living, he could find a way to cheat death. So he went from town to town, hoping one day to find the right method for achieving his goal.</p>
<p>But finally, after much chastising by the townsfolk, he found his perfect lab rat. A Nobleman known as Delvagan who was cruel and wanted nothing more than absolute power. With the promise of everlasting life, he invited Krelon to his castle to begin the process.</p>
<p>No one knows exactly what happened in that castle, or what was being done to Lord Delvagan. Only this is known. Krelon created something in that Nobleman that would change history forever. Death was not cheated that day. Death was allowed to come into this world.</p>
<p>It was only when the townsfolk of Crystallion began noticing that some of their neighbors and friends were missing did they begin to suspect something horrible was happening up in that castle. So, armed with Pitchforks and Rakes, Shovels and Walking Staffs, the townsfolk stormed the castle. There they discovered Delvagan standing over several corpses. Citizens of Crystallion that were the missing neighbors and friends. They surrounded and subdued Delvagan and took him to the town square where he was immediately hanged.</p>
<p>History says, that the whole time he hung there, as his life was seeping from his body, he smiled. And at the moment of his death, something else came into this world at that very moment.</p>
<p>Wanting to purge this evil from the land, the people of Crystallion buried Delvagan in the forsaken wasteland of U'Moria. Never looking back, and never returning. So, of course they never knew that the grave in which they laid Delvagan was empty.</p>
<p>Many years past, and strangely enough, this wasteland of U'moria begin to spring to life. Fields of grass, trees, and all sorts of creatures began inhabiting the land. But still, the people of Crystallion would not venture forth into this awakening land and they declared it cursed and forbid anyone to enter it. Those that chose to ignore this edict were more times than not, never seen again.</p>
<p>Rumors began spreading when people began disappearing only to be found murdered.Everyone was perplexed as to what was causing these deaths, for the victims were always found with no blood left in their body and two small puncture wounds at the neck. Many suspected something Evil had come out of the Cursed Land and was slowly devouring the people of Crystallion.</p>
<p>After some time, the remaining residents of Crystallion formed a chosen band of Crusaders who marched to the Forbidden Land. Their Mission, to stomp out any Evil they found there.</p>
<p>It was here, in an area called The Dark Forest that they came upon Castle Vastill. This is where the Crusaders of Crystallion had their first encounter with a Vampire. Delvagan was the first of his Kind. The strength of Delvagan was unmatched by any mortal man. He tossed these Crusaders into the ston walls of the Castle as if they were molding putty. That night, Delvagan decimated half of the Citizens of Crystallion before they stabbed him in the head. Thinking him dead, they buried him in a hole 20 feet deep. When the last shovel of dirt was thrown on the grave, they left and never looked back.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the people of Crystallion, it was only the beginning. For when they walked away from Delvagan's grave, how were they to know that the next night Delvagan would return to Crystallion along with his new army of Undead Soldiers? That was the beginning of the first Vampire Clan know as The Elders.</p>
<p>Mayor Grayden was in despair over the loss of most of his town, when who should return, but Krelon on a dark and blustery night. Krelon used Mayor Grayden's despair to manipulate him into being his next lab rat. For Krelon had found hidden Plasma Energies in the blood of the Wolf. The Wolf was a creature of the Night, and Krelon spent many weeks fusing the blood of Wolf with that of Mayor Grayden. This is how the first Lycan came into being, giving Mayor Grayden the ability to change at will into a half Man, half Wolf creature with incredible strength and agility.</p>
<p>These creatures, filled with rage and violence, would soon become a worthy opponent for the Vampires of the Wasteland. Grayden spent that first night killing and turning several townsfolk and dragging them into Mt. Ravania in the wasteland of U'Moria. It was here that his victims shared his fate and formed the first Lycan Clan, The Rage.</p>
<p>Over time, the two new races began to work together and started a small township known as Millstown. It began to prosper until one fateful day when the unthinkable happened. Two lovers of Lycan and Vampire were with child, and this child would be the beginning of yet another new race. A Hybrid of the two. As this was forbidden, it fueled anger and resentment between the Vampire and Lycans which started the great Undead War. Many Vampires and Lycan were killed in this War until finally a truce was made. As more Hybrids came into being through the years, they too, began their own Clans.</p>
<p>Sometime after the War, Millstown grew and was renamed Melania. the city towered above the rest and no Human would venture to Melania. For if they did, they were food!</p>
<p>Welcome to Melania, my Friend! Choose your race and begin your journey into Melania and History. Will your path be of Peace or War? You choose. The adventure awaits in the Glow of the Crimson Moon ...."</p>

<p>The crossover with dance and pop culture has been an important factor in Damon's development as a composer. His style blends British and American influences in a highly personalised approach to jazz. While rooted firmly in the blue-note tradition his continued reference to wider musical settings creates complex and emotional music.</p>
<p>For his debut album as a leader, Damon brought together some of the most, talented and highly rated players from the British jazz scene. The original quintet was formed to introduce Damon's work to a wider audience, touring, extensively through out the UK in the spring of 1997. The enthusiastic response of audiences and critics alike led Damon to record the group's first album 'A Rhythm Indicative' (ZZCD 9806). Released in September 1998, it was received with unanimous praise.</p>
<p>In 1999, Damon Brown appeared with his band at The Red Sea International Jazz Festival in Israel sharing centre stage billing with Chick Corea and Kenny Garrett groups. That summer, Damon Brown also appeared at The Edinburgh International Jazz Festival (Scotland) and The Islington International Festival (London).</p>
<p>In 2000, Damon toured Europe with Italian pianist Antonio Ciacca and performed with Dave Liebman and Gary Smullian. In the spring he toured the UK again with his own quintet and played "The Jamboree" in Barcelona with his Quartet. In the summer Damon played his first week at "Ronnie Scott's Club in London. The Quintet has continued to perform at Ronnies every year. The Ronnie Scott's "Jazz House" label released "Blues On The Run" Damon's second album in February 2001. It is distributed by New Note Distribution.</p>
<p>Following the death of Stanley Turrentine, the Tel-Aviv Festival invited Damon to stand in as that years international jazz guest. Concerts followed in the Tel-Aviv and Haifa Museums of Modern Art . Damon also played the "Camelot Club", Israel's premiere jazz venue and the album Good Cop - Bad Cop, co led by pianist Jonathon Gee and featuring Israeli musicians Yaki Levi and Yoron Yorai, was released in 2002.</p>
<p>In 2002 Damon released an album featuring Ska legend Rico Rodriguez, A Bigger Picture and toured the far east. 2003 saw performances with Benny Golson and Steve Grossman among others and 2004 damon will be developing his standard repetoire touring with his band and also with the great guitar of Doug Rainey</p>

<p>Perique is a style of smoking tobacco originating from the area of St. James Parish in Louisiana. Perique is a spicy tobacco, typically not smoked alone but rather in tobacco blends containing a larger proportion of more subtly flavored tobacco styles, such as Virginia or Burley.</p>
<p>The process, orginally developed by Choctaw Indians (and later produced by the early French settlers of Louisana) involves fermenting the tobacco under high pressure in barrels, being periodically turned and again fermented, until the final product is achieved.</p>

<p>total internal reflection fluorescence microscope</p>
<p>Principle of the TIRFMA total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) is a type of microscope with which a thin region of a specimen, usually less than 200 nm, can be observed.</p>
<p><br />
Background In cell and molecular biology, a large number of molecular events in cellular surfaces such as cell adhesion, binding of cells by hormones, secretion of neurotransmitters, and membrane dynamics have been studied with conventional fluorescence microscopes. However, fluorophores that are bound to the specimen surface and those in the surrounding medium exist in an equilibrium state. When these molecules are excited and detected with a conventional fluorescence microscope, the resulting fluorescence from those fluorophores bound to the surface is often overwhelmed by the background fluorescence due to the much larger population of non-bound molecules.</p>
<p><br />
Solution To solve this problem, the TIRFM was developed. A TIRFM elicits an evanescent wave that selectively illuminates and excites fluorophores in a restricted region of the specimen immediately adjacent to the glass-water interface. The evanescent wave is generated only when the incident light is totally reflected from the glass-water interface. The evanescent electromagnetic field decays exponentially from the interface, and thus propagates to a depth of only approximately 200 nm into the sample. Thus the TIRFM enables a selective visualization of surface regions such as the basal plasma membrane(which are about 7.5 nm thick) of cells as shown in the figure above. The selective visualization of the plasma membrane renders the features and events on the plasma membrane in living cells with high axial resolution.</p>
<p>Importantly, the fluorescence excitation energy of the evanescent wave is the same as the energy of the wavelength of the light that was totally internally reflected.</p>
<p>TIRF can also be used to observe the fluorescence of a single molecule, making it an important tool of biophysics and quantitative biology.</p>

<p>Although few American feature films about the Vietnam War were produced during the war years (The Green Berets, released in 1968, is one notable exception), after the war a number of mainstream films dealt with this divisive conflict. Films such as The Deer Hunter (1978) and Coming Home (1978) considered the effects of the war on American veterans, but in many ways it was director Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979) that signaled an intense interest in revisiting the war as a theme.</p>
<p>The 1980s saw the theme reworked in movies such as Missing in Action (1984) and especially in the three Rambo films that starred Sylvester Stallone. The second in the latter series, Rambo: First Blood, Part II (1985), showed the hero returned to Vietnam after the conflict to free American soldiers still held as prisoners of war. It was an audience favorite despite a generally acknowledged a lack of realism. Later in the 1980s, movies such as director Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986) brought a more realistic portrayal of the experience of American soldiers in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Hollywood continued to revisit the Vietnam War as a subject in the 1990s and 2000s, in films as different as Forrest Gump (1994) and We Were Soldiers (2002).</p>
<p>The portrayal of the Vietnam War in feature films has changed over the years, often reflecting political themes of the day.</p>

<p>Lunging pete is a creature of mystery. Rumor has it that hes never been seen by human eyes, however there has been many artists impressions based on drugged up idiots acounts. Basically lunging pete is the god of all lunging and anybody whos ever lunged. he can straight back leg flip side reverse 247 times in a row, and that my friends is impressive. if lunging pete is the god of lungers then he has 3 disciples who will be spreading the word of this lord. They could be the only ever people to see him or they could be starting a new lunging craze and cannot deal with being the saviour themselves. all we know about these people is there names. They are Marc Crowther, Joe Riley and Matt Riley. Anyway, get lunging</p>

<p>Eternity Gold is forum website that is currently coding an RPG style game into it. It is located at <a href="http://s13.invisionfree.com/Eternity_Gold/index.php" class="external free" title="http://s13.invisionfree.com/Eternity_Gold/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://s13.invisionfree.com/Eternity_Gold/index.php</a> .</p>
<p>Owner David is said to be making plans to buy the forum a new server sometime before or during Q4 of the 2006 year.</p>

<p>The history of Eternity Gold started about 1.5 years ago with Eternity wich was discontinued after a brief spout between members that resulted in the prompt deletion of Eternity. As time went on, many different forums were spawned in an attempt to make sepreate forums for each member. This, of course, did not work, and with the help of pikkidodo, current mediator and mod trainer on E_G, the members realized how silly the fight was and decided to settle on just having one forum, Eternity Gold.</p>
<p>The coming together was a hit sucess! The team had even managed to find their long lost member Birdey, a now prominent mediator and mod trainer on the forum. Birdey - "Eternity Gold is a place where we all can escape from relaity and be at home with ourselves. It has really helped me simply relax." The team quickly grew stronger and are now searching for new members to join their crew of "E-nitians", as Co-Owner Choclit would say. As a matter of fact, she was the one who gave Eternity Gold it's first nickname: E-nity.</p>

<p>The coming-toghether was not without it's drawbacks, however. When the group had gotten back together, they had not realized that they were missing a very important member, Pezzy. However, they finally managed to contact her and found out that she could only come on every so-often. E-nitians also have a problem advertising. "There just aren't that many people interested in joining a small up and coming forum", says Choclit. "They all want the websites like Powerpets and Gaia where you can earn money or have pets."</p>
<p>Despite this, owner David (Keyblade Master on the forums) still has high hopes of having a boisterous, vibrant forum full of happy E-nitians. "I agree with whatever my members want," Says David, "But I still have high hopes -- and maybe my future projects will be attractive, as well as a little something for geeks, is also being planned. We wish anyone who wants to help, or be a member of a small, uncrowded, friendly community, will join. That's all I wish for, 100-200 members, all active, would make me extrordinarily happy.. by the way, I have a horrible habit of speechs like these." Despite his somewhat long and drawn out speeches, David is a very fun-loving guy who is well-respected and works endlessly trying to make Eternity Gold a better place. (<b>David:</b> Longer than endlessly, to be honest.)</p>

<p>The community on Eternity tends to vary wildly, but there are, unfortunately, many inactive accounts. If you join, please post at least 20 posts a week, and contribute to the forum. That is all we wish for; the forums themselves aren't easy to handle; there are many varied forums to chat in. General Chat, Eternity's most active forum, tends to be pretty random. the other forums under General tend to be stale, but sometimes have posts. besides the needed forums, Error Reports and Intros, tehre's always the in-depth forums if you wish to discuss countries, technology and other things. There are other forums, including animals and more discussion, but none as active as Eternity's trademark chat or as huge as the Archives. Eternity current clocks in at 40 members and 10,000 posts.</p>

<p>Cee Cee Michaela, pronounced (Mick-Kay-La), is a [Hickory, North Carolina] native and has been an entertaining every since she began singing in church as a little girl. Cee Cee is an Actress, Author, Singer and Absitinence Speaker. Her mother raised four girls alone, Cee Cee being the youngest.</p>
<p><br />
By the age of fourteen, Cee Cee Michaela pronounced (MICK-KAY-LA) was already singing in four octaves and four languages. She graduated high school as a [North Carolina] Scholar and Who’s Who Among American High School Students. She received her BFA in Musical Theater from The Boston Conservatory of Music and has graced the stages of Broadway In Jelly’s Last Jam and Smokey Joe’s Café. Not bad for a small town girl from [Hickory, North Carolina]. Of course Michaela has always had big dreams being that in her final semester of college she took the $40 bucks that her Mom sent for a book, traded it in for a Greyhound bus ticket and headed for New York.</p>
<p>She is probably best known for her zany character of Yvonne, the police officer and William’s fiancee, on the hit UPN comedy [Girlfriends] (executive produced by [Kelsey Grammer].) The actress co-starred in the role of Simone along with [Mo’Nique] in the comedy movie, [Hair Show].</p>
<p>(executive produced by Magic Johnson, May 2005 DVD release.) What’s more, Michaela is a singer and a songwriter and has an Inspirational CD entitled Everybody’s Talkin’, which she wrote, arranged, performed and produced (distributed by her own record label, Driven By a Vision Records.) The CD literally described as “Organic Soul” in [Japan], made it to #6 on the Gospel charts in Europe! The DVD, Live in Los Angeles, features Michaela with her seven-piece band, Lavender Soul, named after her favorite color and favorite style of music. She has shared her awesome testimony and songs at many special events and churches everywhere!</p>
<p>As if this girl doesn’t have enough on her plate, Michaela is also a prolific writer with her first book entitled I Wish I Had Known: 101 Nuggets of Wisdom For Healthy Relationships, published by her company Pop The Trunk™ Publishing. Her book is currently being reviewed by some of America’s top authors and professors for one of the country’s most prestigious literary awards for the appreciation of human culture. This new author is truly a young woman of wisdom and doesn’t mind sharing the revelation knowledge and lessons that she has learned. She even offers a self-publishing guide book so that you can publish your book too! She also is coming out with her second book entitled Satanic Set Ups...Demonic Distractions The Secret Things God Tells Me.</p>
<p><br />
Last but surely not least, Michaela is very excited about her latest addition to her business endeavors, Cee Cee Michaela Ministries, in which she tours the U.S. as a motivational speaker. Using her own life experiences and avid research, Michaela is spreading her powerful messages which promote abstinence, leadership, entrepreneurship, integrity, and character. Her life-changing empowerment workshop is highly requested.</p>
<p>Ms. Michaela is currently busy setting up her southern region headquarters of GodzGirl Network in [Atlanta], [GA] where she will present the "Holy"wood Retreat for girls/young ladies ages 12-30! She also teaches abstinence/etiquette classes for Girls in Atlanta. She is a member of Crenshaw Christian Center where the honorable Dr. Fred Price is pastor.</p>

<p>Magnetizing Force (H) is the electrical force that generates magnetic fields in a given material or the free space within it.</p>
<p>It is measured in amps per metre, and is converted into flux density (B in Tesla) by the permeability of free space (μ<sub>0</sub>, 4π Χ 10<sup>-7</sup>) multiplied by the relative permeability (μ<sub>r</sub>) of the core material.</p>
<p>Superconductors are limited to a certain ammount of magnetizing force known as the critical field (H<sub>c</sub>), if they exceed this limitation, they start to resist and generate heat.</p>

<p>Contextual Objectivity is a principle with roots in quantum mechanics that was adapted and applied to the explain and describe the operations of news media organizations during times of war. Proposed by Adel Iskandar and Mohammed El-Nawawy in their analysis of Al-Jazeera as a case study, the term expresses the attempt "to reflect all sides of any story while retaining the values, beliefs and sentiments of the target audience." The concept has been applied by some scholars to explain FOX News Channel's news programming in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2004. Other studies used contextual objectivity to describe differences between mainstream media and alternative ethnic media's coverage of post-Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. [edit]</p>

<p>Dol Ammad is a symphonic electronic metal band from Greece. It was founded by their keyboardist, Thanasis Lightbridge, in 2000 as a result of his interest in multiple genres of music. Because of fusing so many types of sounds into it's sonic definition, Dol Ammad consists of 15 members including drummer Alex Holzwarth of Rhapsody, Sieges Even, Val'Paraiso, Blind Guardian(former), Paradox(former), &amp; Avantasia. However 12 of the 15 members form a choir while the other three play guitars, drum, bass, synthesizers, samples, &amp; FX. There is no lead vocalist.</p>
<p>Dol Ammad is signed under Black Lotus Records. They released 2 demos in 2001 &amp; 2002. In 2004, they released their debut album "Star Tales."</p>
<p>Their sound is considered so refreshing that the Music University of Thessaloniki Greece interviewed Dol Ammad for inventing a new genre of music.</p>
<p>Their art is exotically colorful.</p>

<p>Patuckson was the "Christian Indian" who accused three Wampanoag of murdering John Sassamon. Patuckson accused King Philip's counselor Tobias, Tobias’ son Wampapaquan, and a Native American by the name of Mattachunnamo. Patuckson's testimonial was given in early June, months after the event took place. But the Plymouth General Court accepted his testimonial, despite the fact that it was given months later, and that he owed a gambling debt to Tobias.</p>

<p>Ashley Elpern is a teacher at the Wayland High School. She is a very important historical figure, for she won the Teacher or the Day award twice in one week, setting a new record. Ashley "Elpy" Elpern is a kind and considerate person, who has a reputation for helping special needs students, and not tolerating racism in her class. Elpern also came up with a very important theory on the Arab-Israeli war, which stated, that the reason for the war, was the lack of commericalism in the foreign places. Ms. Elpern quoted,</p>
<p>"They need to jump out of their 3rd world status, and join 21st century civilization. Get some stores and eateries, such as Krispy Kreme Donuts, which is my personal favorite."</p>
<p>Ms. Elpern graduated from Middlebury College with a Masters in Youth Education and History, and she also got 328th out of 330 competetors in the Crash B's Crew Race, in her senior year. She quotes,</p>
<p>"It just goes to show, one can't focus on athletics and academics at once. I chose teaching over crew" a decision that to this day, she still believes was right.</p>
<p>"People ask me whether I think I made the right decision between teaching and crew. And I tell them that when I see the children's smiling faces, yes, it's worth it."</p>
<p>Ms. Elpern enjoys Krispy Kreme Donuts, and the History channel. Her favorite student is Anil Singhal, or Corey Scank.</p>

The anode is traditionally written on the left, and the cathode on the right.<br />
Phases are separated by single vertical lines (ex: solid | liquid, liquid | gas, etc.)<br />
The porous disk or salt bridge is represented by a double vertical line (ex: anode || cathode)</p>
<p><br />
Standard Line Notation conventions are written as follows:<br />
anode || cathode<br />
site of oxidation || site of reduction<br />
negative electrode || positive electrode</p>
<p><br />
Here is one example of a reaction written in standard line notation:<br />
Fe(s) | Fe2+ (aq) || Ag+ (aq) | Ag(s)<br />
In this reaction, the iron is oxidized and the electrons travel through the electrode to the silver electrode, where a build up of silver solid occurs as the silver ions are reduced.</p>
<p><br />
In a solution where there are several aqueous species, each species is separated by a comma<br />
Ex: Pt(s) | ClO3- (aq), ClO4- (aq), H+ (aq) || H+ (aq), MnO4- (aq), Mn2+ (aq) | Pt (s)</p>

<p>Ston Easton Park in Somerset was built in the 18th century for John Hippisley Coxe. The Hippisley family had been Lords of the Manor of Ston Easton since 1544, and in the 17th century had moved from the old manor house by the parish church to a new Jacobean house. This Jacobean house was converted into a Palladian mansion by John Hippisley Coxe.</p>
<p>The identity of the architect is not known, although the design is reminiscent of the work of William Kent, and it is also not known exactly when the house was built. John Hippisley Coxe died in 1769 and his sons Richard and Henry further embellished the house and grounds. Henry Hippisley Coxe employed Humphry Repton to design a landscape park, although only part of this plan was actually created. Henry's widow Elizabeth further developed the grounds in about 1814.</p>
<p>In 1956 Richard John Bayntun Hippisley died, and his son John Preston Hippisley was obliged to sell Ston Easton in order to pay death duties. The house was neglected and fell into disrepair - it was even proposed that the building should be demolished, though it was thankfully saved by a Preservation Order in 1958. In 1964 Ston Easton was purchased by William Rees-Mogg who restored the building. In 1978 Rees-Mogg sold the house to the Smedley family, who further restored the house and grounds and subsequently converted it into a luxurious hotel. The house was sold again in 2001 to Von Essen Hotels, the present owners.</p>

<p>Macpac Outdoors is a successful New Zealand company that specialises in outdoor adventure equipment.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s Bruce McIntyre dropped out of university, bought a virtually unknown backpack label from a local saddler and started a one-man pack manufacturing operation from his parents' garage.</p>
<p>Macpac manufactures and designs a range of different outdoor equipment, from its infamous backpacks to light weight adventure tents.</p>
<p>Although it has always been known for its quality products and have somewhat became an iconic "Kiwi" made brand, in 2003 Macpac reluctantly decided to move its production to Asia to reduce production costs with the loss of 150 jobs in Christchurch. Managing director Bruce McIntyre says that the immediate causes are the 40% rise in the New Zealand dollar and the slow-down in international travel. The company lost $1 million last year, and predicts it will lose as much again this year.</p>

<p>International fashion retailers, require good relationships. Without these relationships no internationalization can occur. Relationships can be between franchises, internal departments and partner companies. Although companies have been expanding internationally throughout history, it has only been in the last 20 years that real growth has occurred.</p>

<p>elemetary computer projects I'm starting this page in order to exchange computer project ideas for elementary students, K-3 grade, with other teachers and staff in my district, as well as, with people around the world. Our school computer lab has been creating and implementing computer projects using the following programs, Kidpix, Kidspiration and Microsoft Word. I would love to hear more about other useful programs that may be available. I will be placing information about the projects our school has created in these programs over the past 5 years. I am hopeful that this will be a good resource for other teachers in my district, as well as, teachers in districts around the world. Since this is my first time using Wikipedia it may take some time for me to get things going.</p>

<p><br />
[edit] Swansea ... a lively and attractive city by the sea</p>
<p>It has a population of 230,000 and received its city status in 1969 from Queen Elizabeth II. Swansea is the second city of Wales and the bay upon which it stands, provides the city with a beautiful setting.</p>
<p>At the other end of the sweeping Swansea Bay, just 5 miles along the coast from the city centre, lies Mumbles, a place that has a well-established reputation for its special, seaside village atmosphere. Mumbles is a place that has been much appreciated by generations of Swansea students.</p>
<p>In recent years, the attractions of the city have been enhanced by the Maritime Quarter which combines a 600-berth Marina, a waterfront village, restaurants, art gallery, theatre, sailing and sea angling schools. Swansea’s parklands make the city feature regularly in the ‘Wales in Bloom’ Award; while the Maritime and Industrial Museum reflects the city’s nautical and enterprising past.</p>
<p>Swansea has a well-designed shopping and entertainment centre, including a world-famous indoor market dating back to the Middle Ages. The Quadrant Shopping Centre is an enclosed pedestrian precinct with a very attractive central area.</p>
<p>In a city that numbers Dylan Thomas among its notable sons, Swansea’s cultural life is very active. Each autumn, the city hosts the ‘Festival of Music and the Arts’, when international orchestras and soloists visit the city’s Brangwyn Hall. The Grand Theatre offers top entertainment all the year round, from pantomime and drama to opera and ballet. Opportunities for sport abound, watching or playing, with soccer, rugby union and cricket.</p>
<p>Swansea is surrounded by resorts, parks, wildlife centres, caves and castles. The Gower Peninsula was the first part of Britain to be awarded the title of ‘Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty’ by the Government in 1956. It is one of the loveliest peninsulas in the UK, with wide, clean sands and steeply cliffed coves protected by thick woods.</p>
<p>The whole area is ideal for swimming, sailing, water ski-ing, surfing, sea angling, canoeing, and rowing, or just for exploring on foot.</p>

<p>Industries can be categorised into groups on the basis of Finished Product or Function, which are also the 3 sectors of the economy –</p>
<p>1. Primary or Basic Industries : These industries form the core industries on which the other industries depend for their manufacturing. For example, iron and steel industry and petroleum industry.</p>
<p>2. Secondary or Consumer Industries : These industries process the basic raw materials into primary goods for direct use by the consumers. They include textiles, sugar, paper making etc.</p>
<p>3. Tertiary Industries : These industries provide public utility based services like railways, transport, banking, post and telegraph etc.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-27_76b6.html" title="Edit section: Need for Industrial Development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Need for Industrial Development</span></h3>
<p>Industries satisfy man’s needs, provide employment and raise the living standard of people. Manufacturing industries convert raw materials into manufactured products that are useful to man.</p>
<p>In the South Asia, industrial development is required for the following reasons :</p>
<p>1. Many countries including India are predominantly agricultural countries and more than 50-60 per-cent of the population is dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. However, agriculture cannot support the growing population and only industrial development can solve the problem of rising unemployment.</p>
<p>2. Industrial development provides support and strength to the agricultural base.</p>
<p>3. Industries produce goods and equipments which are required for the defence of the countries.</p>
<p>4. Industries are required to keep pace with the fast moving world in terms of advanced technology and know how.</p>
<p>5. Industrial development is needed to make the countries self-reliant and independent for all their needs.</p>
<p>6. In many of the countries, even in India, some of the regions are economically backward whereas others are quite advanced. Expansion of the industries in these backward areas is needed to correct the regional imbalance.</p>
<p>7. Industrial development is required to maintain a favourable balance of trade, i.e. more of exports than imports.</p>
<p><a name="Factors_Required_for_Industrial_Development" id="Factors_Required_for_Industrial_Development"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-27_76b6.html" title="Edit section: Factors Required for Industrial Development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Factors Required for Industrial Development</span></h3>
<p>1. Raw Materials : The decision regarding location of a particular industrial activity is guided by the availability of raw materials in a particular area. The earliest industries in India developed near the sources of raw material. The nature of raw material also decides the location of industries. For example the perishable raw materials have to be processed without loss of time before manufacturing. That is why sugar mills are located in areas of sugarcane production.</p>
<p>2. Water Supply : Water is required for the development of industries as it is needed in the process of manufacturing, for cleaning, cooling, washing etc. Some of the industries depend heavily on the availability of water for one purpose or the other. These include iron and steel, textile, paper and pulp, chemical, food processing, jute, leather, nuclear power etc. Therefore, these industrial units are located at places where water is easily available.</p>
<p>3. Energy : Energy is required to process the raw materials into manufactured goods. That is why iron and steel industry is usually located near the coal resource, as it uses cooking coal for fuel. Similarly, the electro-metallurgical and electro-chemical industries which require power are located where electricity is easily available.</p>
<p>4. Transport : Transport is an essential prerequisite for industrial development as transport facilities are required to carry raw materials to manufacturing units and finished products to the markets. The availability of transport facilities has led to the development of the industries near the port towns that are linked with rail and road to the hinterland.</p>
<p>5. Labour : The availability of both skilled and unskilled manpower is an important factor in the location of industries. The mobility of labour is also a significant factor. It is because of the mobility of cheap labour that a large number of industries are located in metropolitan cities. Some of the small-scale industries, traditionally associated with labour are glasswork, brasswork, utensils, silk sarees, carpets etc.</p>
<p>6. Market : The existence of market is the ultimate requirement of every industry because whatever is produced needs to be sold. High demand and a satisfactory purchasing power provide impetus to industrial development. For example, heavy chemical industries or machine industries are located in industrial areas because their products are required by other industries of the region. Similarly, petroleum refineries are established near the markets as the transport of crude oil is easier. However refineries using import crude oil are located near the ports.</p>
<p>7. Climate : It plays a significant factor in the location of industries especially agro-based industries. For instance, cotton textile industries have a favourable climate and soil for the growth of cotton. Extreme type of climate, i.e. is either too hot or too cold climate is also not favourable for the location of industries as it not only affects the availability of raw materials but also the efficiency of the workers.</p>
<p>8. The Government : The government has a very significant role in the industrialisation process, especially in the developing and the under-developed countries. The big industries which require large infrastructure and capital are set up by the government. The government makes rules and regulations for running the industries and also provides the basic facilities like land, water and electricity. Further, it is the government which makes policies and takes decisions to protect and encourage indigenous industries.</p>
<p>9. Organisational Skills : Proper and efficient management skills and technical know-how is a must for running an industrial unit. The management must have sound organisational skills to deal with a crisis situation.</p>
<p>10. Capital : Capital is required at every stage of setting up and running an industrial concern. Mostly financiers and capitalists are available in major cities. That is why most of the major cities are industrial centres. These cities have good banking and credit facilities which are necessary for setting up large-scale industries.</p>

<p>INDIA –</p>
<p>Natural Resources :</p>
<p>Mineral-based : India is a land of vast natural resources. It has fairly high reserves of iron ore, coal, mica, manganese, chromite, bauxite and limestone. Almost all of its petroleum is obtained from offshore Bombay High and from Gujrat and Assam. India has one of the largest programmes for renewable energy, such as biogas, biomass, solar, wind and hydropower.</p>
<p>Forest-based : With a wide range of climatic and topographical conditions. India has rich and varied types of forests. India has a forest cover of 6,75,538 sq. km, which constitutes 20.55 per-cent of its geographical area. The Deciduous forests found along the Himalayan foothills and on the north-eastern hilly areas of the Deccan Plateau and the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats are the most important from the commercial point of view and include trees like sal, teak, sandalwood, rosewood and shisham.</p>
<p>Agro-based : Rice is the leading crop, in terms of both area under cultivation and total yield. Wheat ranks next in both area and total yield. Other major grain crops are millets, corn and pulses. A variety of fruits and vegetables are grown in different parts of the country. Crops like sugarcane, cotton, tea and coffee are grown on plantations in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. India is known as the home of spices and produces a wide variety of spices like black pepper, cardamom, ginger, garlic, turmeric, chilli etc.</p>
<p>Animal-based : India has the world's largest cattle population. But because cattle are sacred to Hindus, the animals are rarely used for meat, except by Muslims and Christians. Farmers keep cattle and water buffaloes for ploughing and for milk. Most commercial milk production comes from water buffaloes. Hides from cattle and water buffaloes are used for leather after the animals have died. Sheep are reared mostly for wool and sheepskin. The production of chickens and eggs is increasing.</p>
<p>Fish-based : India is a major fishing nation. Croakers, mackerel, sardines, sharks, and shrimp are caught in the surrounding seas. People also catch Bombay duck, a small fish that is dried. Bombay duck is eaten either as an appetizer or as a relish with curried food. Rivers yield carp and catfish.</p>
<p>PAKISTAN –</p>
<p>Natural Resources : The Indus and its tributaries provide water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces. Hydroelectricity accounts for only 18 per-cent of the energy produced, obtained mainly from large dams. Pakistan has substantial deposits of natural gas (mainly at Sui, Baluchistan) and crude oil (chiefly at the Meyal oil field, near Rawalpindi). It has very limited resources of petroleum. Wheat is the chief crop of Pakistan. The farmers also grow cotton, rice, sugar cane, chickpeas, oilseeds, and fruits and vegetables. Canal irrigation has transformed arid lands in Punjab and Sindh to fertile areas and has enhanced crop production. Fishing is an important industry in the coastal regions of Pakistan. Shrimp, sardines, sharks, and other fish are caught in the Arabian Sea. Pakistan exports a considerable amount of fish and shellfish.</p>
<p>NEPAL –</p>
<p>Natural Resources : The mineral resources are small, scattered and under-developed. The important minerals are coal, iron ore, copper, limestone and mica. These minerals are though, virtually untapped. The river systems of Nepal provide immense potential for hydro-electric development. The crops grown include jute, maize, rice, millet, and wheat. A wide variety of trees and bamboo grasses grow in thick forests in this region. Buckwheat is grown at higher altitudes. Tobacco is grown in the Tarai area and cardamom in the eastern hills. Timber represents a valuable resource and a major source of potential revenue.</p>
<p>BHUTAN –</p>
<p>Natural Resources : Bhutan has significant mineral resources, found in its central and southern region. These include slate, sand gravel, quartzite, limestone, marble, coal, dolomite and gypsum. The Chhukha hydel project financed by India is the principal source of Bhutan’s hydro-electric potential. Barley, rice, and wheat are the chief crops grown. Most people in the high mountain areas herd cattle and yaks. Thick forests grow on the rain-drenched southern slopes of the mountains.</p>
<p>BANGLADESH –</p>
<p>Natural Resources : Bangladesh’s principal resources include the fertile soils of the delta region, heavy rainfall and the long growing season. It uses its abundant water supply for production of hydroelectricity and irrigation. It also has large reserves of natural gas and some petroleum deposits. Farmers in almost all parts of the country grow jute, rice, sugar cane, tobacco, and wheat in the rich, wet soil. Shrimps and prawns are the main catch in the seas.</p>
<p>SRI LANKA –</p>
<p>Natural Resources : Sri Lanka is not rich in minerals but it does have some iron ore, graphite, limestone and gems like sapphire and ruby. Since Sri Lanka is an island country, fish are abundant offshore. It has utilized the water resource of its many rivers by building dams to produce hydroelectricity. The chief agricultural products are coconuts, rice, rubber, and tea. Many of the country's farmers grow world-famous Sri Lanka tea.</p>
<p>MALDIVES –</p>
<p>Natural Resources : The only significant natural resource available in Maldives is fish including yellow-fin tuna and skipjack. The total catch is above 134,000 tonnes. Maldives has the highest per capita consumption of fish and fish products in the world. The people grow breadfruit, chilli peppers, coconuts, millet, and sweet potatoes. The women also collect cowrie shells from the shores.</p>

<p>INDIA –</p>
<p>1. Coal deposits, which form a major part of the infrastructure, are very unevenly distributed within different regions of India. Most of the coal deposits are located in the north-eastern parts of India, leading to uneven industrial and economic development.</p>
<p>2. There is heavy wastage of natural resources due to unscientific methods of removal and also due to the lack of suitable processing techniques. Also, the technology used in many of the industries, especially handloom, is obsolete.</p>
<p>3. Indian industries are also losing foreign markets due to the continued increase in the cost of production and the development of industries in a number of Asian countries like China and Japan, whose goods are cheaper and of better quality.</p>
<p>4. Also shortage of raw materials and irregular supply of raw materials has led to the importation of raw materials from other neighbouring countries. This has in turn led to the shortage of capital for investment in industries.</p>
<p>5. Thus in general, the lack of resources, energy, poor health of the labourers, inefficient system of transport in industrial regions, insufficient support from the government, the ever-growing competition from the world-market, lack of capital investment in industries, and primarily, lack of economic development has led to the limitation of industrial development in India.</p>
<p>PAKISTAN –</p>
<p>1. Pakistan is predominantly an agricultural country. Lack of modernization in agriculture has lead to a lower production of crops, and a shortage of raw material for the industries. Many of the farmers own only a small area of land, in which they work with simple tools and teams of oxen or buffalo.</p>
<p>2. Pakistan is still dependent on neighbouring countries like India, China and Japan for its resources, especially petroleum. Also lack of modern techniques in industries has left Pakistan way back in the list of developing countries.</p>
<p>3. Only the major cities in Pakistan have suitable conditions like climate, land (topography), energy, transport etc. for industrialization to take place. This has led to a regional imbalance in the country, preventing further industrialization.</p>
<p>NEPAL –</p>
<p>1. In Nepal, the mineral resources are small, scattered and under-developed. The minerals here are virtually untapped, preventing the growth of industries here.</p>
<p>2. Nepal has a rugged terrain and this terrain creates difficulties in transportation. Also, there is no railroad system in Nepal. The only possible method of transport is the airplanes. Hence, due to insufficient transportation, the minerals do not reach the industries on time.</p>
<p>BHUTAN –</p>
<p>1. Bhutan has only about 10 per-cent of its total land area exploited for agriculture to take place. Also, the labour force is generally engaged in subsidence agriculture. This shortage of land and sufficient labour has left Bhutan economically and industrially backwards.</p>
<p>2. There is no railroad track in Bhutan. Also the roads are undeveloped and improper for transportation.</p>
<p>BANGLADESH –</p>
<p>1. The farmers in Bangladesh use outdated tools and machinery in the farms. Thus, enough cannot be produced for the industries (agro-based). This shortage of raw materials for the industry has left Bangladesh undeveloped.</p>
<p>2. Road building is difficult in Bangladesh because of the need for bridges across the rivers and streams. Many of the country's roads and railways become unusable in the monsoon season. Thus, transportation is difficult here.</p>
<p>SRI LANKA –</p>
<p>1. Sri Lanka is not rich in minerals. Hence, there are hardly any mineral-based industries in Sri Lanka, which has led to a low economy graph. Also the total land area available is very small for major industries to be built.</p>
<p>MALDIVES –</p>
<p>1. Lack of both agro-based and mineral-based raw materials in Maldives has left them economically backwards. Also, being a group of small islands, there is always a regional imbalance in terms of industrial development.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-27_76b6.html" title="Edit section: Measures to Improve Industrial Development in South Asia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Measures to Improve Industrial Development in South Asia</span></h3>
<p>1. The Government of India sponsors programmes to teach farmers scientific farming methods. It also provides credit to allow farmers to buy improved varieties of seeds and fertilizers. The government encourages increased food production by paying farmers higher prices for their crops. This in turn provides more raw materials for the agro-based industries, and results in their well functioning. The government financed infrastructure projects also helped sparked a growth in construction of about 9.7% YOY April to December 2002.</p>
<p>2. The Government of Pakistan has drawn up five-year plans that set production goals for agriculture and industry and establish programmes for economic development. Government-owned companies provide telephone and telegraph services. The government owns Pakistan's radio and television stations. This has improved transport and communication facilities in Pakistan. Large government investments established the country's first large-scale ship-building and steel milling operations; the production of chemical fertilizers was also given special government support.</p>
<p>3. The Government of Nepal spends about 255 million U.S. dollars annually on development projects. This has helped construct roads, maintain health centres, and start small industries throughout the country. A number of public enterprises (PEs) were established by the government which built the industrial and manufacturing base of Nepal.</p>
<p>4. In 1972, the year after its establishment, the Government of Bangladesh nationalized most of its industries and set up nine corporate conglomerates to oversee the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). With a new government, in the period 1996–2001, 33 SOEs were sold by the state.</p>
<p>5. The market-oriented economic policies of the Government of Sri Lanka have encouraged industrial growth in the private sector, particularly in textiles, food and beverages, wood products, rubber and plastics, and other consumer goods. The government's industrial policy includes encouraging investment in industries in which it believes Sri Lanka has a comparative advantage.</p>
<p>6. A hydroelectric power station has been built at Thimphu, and another has been started at Paro with the help of the Government of Bhutan. A distillery and a fruit-preserving factory have been built. The Government has also helped Bhutan build roads and has trained farmers and veterinary surgeons.</p>

<p>From the above given details, it can be clearly seen that only India has reached the proximity of being counted as one of the world’s developed nations after USA, France, Canada, Germany etc. Other countries like Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are still far away from the developed state. This is basically due to the lack of infrastructure and technologies in these countries, which has left them backwards both economically and industrially. Majority of the Industries in South Asia are located in India, whereas the remaining are very scarcely distributed in the remaining part. Though the governments of these countries have taken initiatives for improving industrialization in these countries, they are not enough. India has also very scientifically and logically utilized its resources, which are available for future use also. It has also developed agencies like The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) which aims at preserving the energy resources. Pakistan has also taken the help of its government and industrialized rapidly over the years. But, it will still take time for the other countries in South Asia to develop. In general, the entire South Asia is still a developing area in terms of industries.</p>

<p>In April of 2006, the game split into two separate directions under two separate management groups. The original is now managed by those selected by the original game's creator while the new game is titled Realms of Kaos: Revolution (RoK: Revolution) and is managed by over a dozen former staff members from the original game. This group was formed after having been let go in a blanket dismissal of all seated management by the new management in February of 2006. Realms of Kaos: Revolution basically starts where the original left off in 2005 and uses a majority of the items, rooms, monsters, and quests from the original. The basic structure of the two games is essentially the same although they will both evolve into distinctly separate directions from there.</p>
<p>The two games began to deviate significantly beginning in April 2006. RoK: Revolution is currently maintained and developed by a team of three coders along with a start-up staff of Administrators, Wardens, Graphic Artists, Writers and Builders, the majority of whom were long-time staff members from the original game. Unlike the original version of the game, the position of "Builder" has been made less formal. In RoK: Revolution, anyone can download a basic version of the build software and create new areas for possible inclusion in the game. These player designed areas are subject to staff approval.</p>
<p>Apart from the build feature, players can also participate in the game's development through the "Suggest an Event" program wherein players may develop in-game events to be promoted and run by staff. These too are subject to approval.</p>

<p>When asked about one Mr. Keith Baumgardner many are quick to respond by throwing there shoes, feces and any potentialy sharp objects that they may have on hand.</p>
<p>however once one gets to know Mr. Baumgarder one will realize that deep down he's a loving caring person who often reads and fondles zoo animals until they fall asleep night. He then kills and skins them and gives their clothes to underpriviledged children who cant keep warm. In exchange he then sells them as cheep labor to foreign countries to keep the economy booming.</p>

<p>There seems to be nothing in the European Convention on Human Rights protecting human rights to access to information - at least any rights to information regarding the basis for decision of the Three Judge Committee to reject a complaint brought before the European Court of Human Rights. Note that a typical rejection letter from The European Court of Human Rights states that following the Three Judge Committee decision to reject a complaint, the person bringing the complaint before the European Court of Human Rights has no right to any specific information regarding the decision of the courts, no right to a reply to further correspondence regarding the case and no right to effective remedy against the decision of the Committee. A logical step towards guaranteeing human rights would be to bring this to public attention in hope to amend the Convention and include decision to protect human rights to access information regarding the Court's decisions. Making sure that following all articles of the Convention are to be not only expected by all nations but also by the European Court of Human Rights itself. For instance, the lack of application of Article 13 of the convention by the European Court of Human Rights to its own behaviour is highly questionable - the fact that the Court of Human Rights denies people any effective remedy against its decisions rejecting cases or finding them unfounded. This in combination with denying access to any specific information regarding the basis for Committee's decision to do so is reminiscent of courts under Stalin.</p>

<p>Synopsis: In the year 2131, the world has become a place of slavery once again. A workforce of humanoid robots with emmotions and human features were created to help with hard labor and servitude but quickly became more than just a workforce, and soon were doing everything in sight and are now slaves to the government. Chrome (played by Katie Tomlinson, a brand new woman-like robot who has seen what is going on in the world, has the idea to overthrow the government and she has many followers who proud to lead the war.</p>
<p>The film was fully shot from March, 2002 to November 2002 on a budget of $100,000 but was ultimately abandoned after Hines decided to bring back the project of <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Worlds_a459.html" title="War of the Worlds">War of the Worlds</a>.

<p><i>Yes, Have Some.</i> is an underground zine created and maintained by Carson Vaughan and Taylor Zlomke of Broken Bow, Nebraska. It features articles parodying various topics, ranging from music to politics. The publication is characterized by its heavy gravitation towards indie culture and political satire, most often targeting President George W. Bush. <i>Y,HS.</i> is "Your Bi-Monthly Guide To Real Events That Might Have Happened" and has released five issues to date. It was first conceived of as a pet project by Vaughan sometime in the year of 2005. Zlomke, a friend and fellow high school journalist, was recruited soon after. The two share the titles of co-editors, reporters, photographers, distributors, advertising managers, and foreign affairs coordinators. It is speculated that the name <i>Yes, Have Some.</i> is a tribute to the 1984 sci-fi comedy <i>Ghost Busters</i>.</p>

<p>The area postrema is a circumventricular organ at the base of the fourth ventricle, implicated with vomiting responses to scents and blood-borne toxins. Its position at the caudal (lower) end of the brainstem allows an organism to respond rapidly to these stimuli, as it is one of the first areas of the body to recieve blood from the heart.</p>

<p>Distance decay is the concept that as distance between two locations increases, the migrants in those locations have less accurate perceptions of those locations, and may decide not to migrate there, but instead migrate to another, closer location. They may continue to make short migrations towards the final destination, called step migration.</p>

<p>‘Gaslamp Fantasy’ describes a parallel universe of 19th-century-level technology corresponding to our world’s Victorian age, but containing science-fictional or fantasy elements not found in our mundane world- a modern version of the stories of HG Wells and Jules Verne, H. Rider Haggard, and other 19th-century authors of romantic adventure and super-science. The term was coined by artist/writer Kaja Foglio as a framework for the narrative-driven-art work "Girl Genius" produced by her and husband, artist/writer Phil Foglio.</p>

<p>Kominform is the abbreviation for communist information office and/or. "information office of the communist ones and labour parties", as the organization with full name was called, which was from 1947 to 1956 a supra-national alliance of different communist parties, which was dominated by the CPSU under Josef Stalin. Since 1946 Stalin tried to combine the sphere of influence of the USSR in east and south Europe into a firm unit and to implement the claim to leadership of the CPSU in ideological and political regard. After mehrmonatigen consultations with exception of Albania , but under participation of the communist parties from France and Italy , the leaders of the Eastern European parties for 22 were finally invited until 27 September 1947 to the conference of establishment of the communist information office (Kominform) into the Polish city Szklarska Poreba. The Soviet side represented with the fact the view that the world had split into two large camps and the relations between the communist parties would have to be out-arranged still closer in the interest of the self statement. The establishment of the Kominform took place officially on 30 September 1947 , not least also as counterreaction of the USSR on the Mars resounding plan of the USA. The Kominform should organize the co-operation of all communist ones and labour parties world-wide. To that extent it formed the successor organization of the 1919 on initiative of Lenin created third international one ( communist international ones , in the contraction usually Komintern mentioned), the 1943 in the course 2.

The SED received 1949 observer status after the establishment of the GDR. Seat of the Kominform was at the beginning of Belgrade, after which exclusion of Yugoslavia became 1948 the seat shifted to Bucharest. During the war the USSR was allied still with the opponents the USA and Great Britain ideological in the reason militarily in the so-called anti-Hitler coalition and formed together with them and other States of the allied war opponents of Germany. After the war again the economic, social and political clashes of interests were intensified in particular between the great powers the USA and the USSR, which flowed starting from 1946 into the cold war. The establishment of the Kominform was a Soviet reaction to this development. During the establishment debate Andrei Alexandrowitsch Schdanow gave its speech to before the opinion of the two-camps represented by US president Harry S. Truman (see two-camp theory ).

<p>The internet has given birth to new markets, a plethora of ways for companies to make money totally online. It sometimes comes as a shock to me that I can make money in something this is totally virtual.</p>
<p>A new service that is being offered to webmasters nowadays is something referred to as "paid forum posting". If you know any thing about web forum communities, you will know that having one on your website if highly beneficial. The posts lead to higher web activity to your site meaning higher page ranking in search engines, and the community eventually takes a life of it's own, a place for people to exchange information and learn more about you and your products.</p>
<p>Already we have seen how people can benefit from this service. Anyone that has tried to start their own community knows the pains of finding users to write on their topic. For those looking for information, there is none to be found unless something is there, and for those that are looking for a community to join, they are more inticed if they see that the people that are already posting are passionate about the subject. This is something that can be compared to the "cool kids" syndrome you experience in elementary school, where posters only like to join clubs that seem reputable and have a following.</p>
<p>Some bigger names in the industry include <a href="http://www.forumposts.com" class="external text" title="http://www.forumposts.com" rel="nofollow">ForumPosts</a>, <a href="http://www.inb0x.com" class="external text" title="http://www.inb0x.com" rel="nofollow">inb0x.com</a> and <a href="http://www.forumboosting.com" class="external text" title="http://www.forumboosting.com" rel="nofollow">forumboosting.com</a>, only a few months old, but it seems the second generation <a href="http://www.forumbooster.net" class="external text" title="http://www.forumbooster.net" rel="nofollow">forumbooster.net</a>, <a href="http://www.forumboosting.com" class="external text" title="http://www.forumboosting.com" rel="nofollow">forumboosting.com</a> and others are the ones that are taking paid forum posting to the next level with features such as tracking the postings as they happen and other additional SEO services.</p>
<p>We are indeed moving into different commerce areas where something as simple as a web community is sprouting web ventures to help support them, and indeed there seems like there is an opportunity and demand for the service.</p>

<p>Mordecai Ben Abraham Jaffe (c. 1535–1612)was a Jewish scholar and mystic. He was born in Prague, and moved to Poland when still young to study with Shlomo Luria and Moshe Isserles. He also studied Kabbalah with Mattathias b. Solomon Delacrut. In 1553 he returned to Prague and became the head of a yeshivah there. Later, he began a commentary to Joseph Karo's work <i>Beit Yosef</i>, but balked and finally ceased work on it when Moshe Isserles released his commentary. He then began to write Torah commentaries. He is the second person to mention the Jewish mourning custom of Yahrzeit (See <i>Levush Tekhelet</i>, no. 133). The first to mention this custom is said to be Isaac of Tyrnau in his <i>Minhagim</i> book (late 14th c.)</p>

<p>Kumar Vikram (b. 1973) is gaining prominence as an Indian poet writing in English. He has been noticed for lyrical beauty, psychological probing and subtle understading of social changes sweeping the Indian society. Kumar Vikram's poetry in English belongs to that arena where few Indian poets writing in English has been able to achieve. Indian poetry in English, that has always been dominated by urbanity and artificial sophistication, gets another dimension by the intervention of Kumar Vikram's verses carrying ethereal charm, intellectual energy and sensitivity. His poems like 'The Night You Left', 'Ramni Mohan Garden', The Ragpickers' etc must be epecially mentioned. He has read his poems at Book Mark, Sahitya Akademi (both at New Delhi. His poetry collection is being eagerly awaited.</p>

<p>The Covenant assualt carriers are commonly treated as flagships in the Covenant fleet. They are around 5 km long and have weapons superior to the normal cruisers and destroyers. The assualt carrier plays a role in the destruction of Reach. Reach's main defense force was being sniped by a powerful new weapon mounted on an assualt cruiser, before it was destroyed by the UNSC <i>Pillar of Autumn</i>.</p>
<p>There are many other examples of assualt carriers throughout Halo 2. They mainly occur in the <i>First Battle of Earth</i>, with the <i>Prophet of Regret'</i>s fleet. Within the fleet were two assualt carriers - one was destroyed by Master Chief with the <i>Cairo</i> station bomb, and the other one fled to <i>Delta Halo</i> and destroyed <i>New Mombasa.</i> It is theorized that the names "Command cruiser," "Flagship," and "Assualt carrier" all mean the same.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-27_76b6.html" title="Edit section: St James' Church, High Melton">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../s/t/_/St_James%27_Church%2C_High_Melton_ce54.html" title="St James' Church, High Melton">St James' Church, High Melton</a></span></h2>
<p>St James’s church dominates the village of High Melton, near Doncaster, in South Yorkshire. Originally built by Avice-de-Tania, (who also founded the Priory at Hampole) in 1153AD, it has been extensively extended.</p>
<p>Until at least the reign of Richard II (1377-1400), the church was known as the "Church of All Saints". About this time, a tower was added and a Lady Chapel to the south-east.</p>
<p>The ground plan is rather unusual, having two aisles - oen through a short nave within the chancel and the Western Tower, and also a continuous south aisle to the whole length of the church.</p>
<p>It has had several generous benefactors over the years, including the Fountayne family and its descendants, the Wilson family, which changed its name to Montagu following an inheritance. There are substantial memorials to members of these families in the Church.</p>
<p>Benefactors helped to improve the state of the Church in the early 20th Century. In particular, there is a spectacular rood screen and 'Corpus Christi' set of figures (1905) and a reredos and altar frontals (1907) which are the work of Sir William Ninian Comper, who also did much work for York Minster.</p>
<p>St James' is also known for its beautiful windows. John Fontayne, DD Dean of York, is stated to have installed several pieces of mediaeval stained glass obtained throughout the county, and also introduced quite a lot of painted glass (by Peckett of York), giving the church a rich inheritance.</p>
<p>The parish registers of High Melton begin in 1538 (this is unusual as in many other parishes the Registers only date back to the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth I, 1558).</p>
<p>It is part of the Diocese of Sheffield, now under the joint Benefice of St Peter's, Barnburgh, with St. James, Melton-on-the-Hill, and holds morning worship every Sunday starting at 9.30am.</p>

<p>Roller furling refers to systems that furl a headsail by rolling it around the forestay, or around its own luff wire. These systems, which range from very simple to very sophisticated, usually have a revolving drum at the base, worked by means of a line run aft to the cockpit. All systems have a swivel at the head of the sail, which allows the luff (and forestay, if part of the system) to rotate freely under load, although twisting of the luff or forestay can be a problem on simple systems.</p>
<p>The simplest systems consist solely of the drum and swivel. More sophisticated systems have a luff foil, a long hollow fitting that goes around the forestay. The sail is raised in a groove in the foil, and the foil is attached to the drum. When the drum rotates, the foil rotates around the forestay without putting any twisting stress on it. Recently, some vendors have offered continuous loop furlers, where the line runs once around the drum and exits, and is spliced into a continuous loop.</p>

<p>Unitube is the name of a character created by Ed Labetski. This lovable confused character in a gas-mask and surrealistic happenings in his post-nuclear surroundings became accessible to the public in 2004 as a webcomic. It became quite popular right away and tens of people kept coming back daily even during several months while there were no additions. People also created fan-art, including a song and a sculpture.</p>
<p>The distinguishing features of this experimental webcomic include monochromatic palettes and organic variations in style. Panels are created in different ways: pen, photogrpaphy, digital painting, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macromedia_Flash_1a63.html" title="Macromedia Flash">Macromedia Flash</a> animation. The point of view of some characters has particular recognisable style. Many panels are drawn only after days spent brain-storming and are packed with several references to popular culture, political and social subtexts wich may together result if not always in something "comic", as it were, then at least crafty.</p>
<p>The characters include a giant mosquito with strong motherly instincts, a romantically mooded female maggot Jel-Lo, a talking prophetic flower, a death-obsessed donkey, and many crazy mutants with a peculiar religion.</p>
<p>The author didn't set for himself a target audience and therefore is not restricted in what might be drawn.</p>

<p>Ashbury is approx. 1 mile from the town centre of Bangor, Northern Ireland and has transformed from a disarable place to live to a bit of a ghetto.</p>
<p>Originally not considered as an estate, it has come to be known as one as young ruthless youths occupy areas of the estate as their own ganglands. From the leafy (now leafless) Linear Park to the run down Ashbury shops the smell of cannibis and cheap cider fill the air with the distant cries of teens in in ecstasy, this is the familiar sounds and smells that the older population have gotten used to over the past few years.</p>
<p><br />
An Ashbury Insider claims " My house sits near the entrance to the Albany road Linear Park and I get nothing but abuse from the wee sh*ts!" This informant also claims,"This has absolutley nothing to do with the way I choose to dress."</p>
<p>Ashbury does have some tourist prospects. Young hoods in the summer are known to dander as far away as the Ranch to enjoy cider in the sun in the "dome" in Linear Park on those long sunny days.</p>
<p>A young girl claims she is up in Ashbury tonight to "Get her hole", and I'm in doubt that she will.</p>

<p>Cisco StackWise is a technology offered by Cisco that allows for up to nine Cisco Catalyst 3750 series switches to operate as though one 32-Gbps switch. This allows for greater resiliency, and performance.</p>
<p>One switch from the stack will act as the master switch. The master switch will maintain the stack and allow you to configure and monitor the whole stack as though one via a single console.</p>
<p>If one switch fails the remaining switches will continue to operate by looping back any information that would normally traverse the failed switch, effectively bypassing it. If the master switch fails, the next switch in the stack will automatically take over as master. This feature means greater redundancy, as one switch's failure will not bring about a failure of the entire stack.</p>

<p>his mighty robot is a 3 piece alternative rock band based in NY, New York formed in 2003.</p>
<p>The lineup consists of Soda (lead vocals and guitars), H-Rocker/Heather (backup vocals and guitars), and Barrett (drums &amp; programming). They were formed in 2003 by Soda,(who also performs solo under the moniker The Ghost Of Me) and saw a few lineup changes early on. When Barrett joined in 2004 their current lineup was cemented.</p>
<p>After heavy touring in the tri-state area, the band independantly released their debut 4 song EP, Open Your Mind, in March of 2005.</p>
<p>There is an obvious heavy influence from early nineties alternative music. A complete definition of the term "do it yourself", they have promoted, recorded, created their website, artwork, and merch, all on their own. Their live show, considering this 3 piece plays acoustic guitars primarily, is very intense. Acoustic guitars never sounded so aggressive.</p>
<p>In 2006 the band has begun to record their debut LP at Sony Studios in NYC. Changing their style from the programmed drums to live drums for this effort adds to their intense sound that they previously only displayed live.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-27_76b6.html" title="Edit section: Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp</span></h2>
<p>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp. 429 U.S. 252 (1977) In this case the village of <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington_Heights%2C_Illinois_0270.html" title="Arlington Heights, Illinois">Arlington Heights, Illinois</a> refused to rezone property so that low-income housing could be built. The developers seeking zoning changes sued, saying that the decision not to rezone violated the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_protection.html" title="Equal protection">equal protection</a> clause of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourteenth_Amendment_b4f0.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">Constitution</a>. The theory of the case was one of discriminatory impact. The plaintiffs relied on <a href="../../../y/i/c/Yick_Wo_49c6.html" title="Yick Wo">Yick Wo</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomillion_v._Lightfoot_6b80.html" title="Gomillion v. Lightfoot">Gomillion v. Lightfoot</a>, in which plaintiffs succeeded in challenging laws that were written in racially neutral terms, but that severely detrimented one racial group. The court has never recognize racial impact as an adequate basis for a constitutional violation all by itself, but has always required that the plaintiffs prove a discriminatory intent. However, in Yick Wo and Gomillion, the court accepted an extremely disproportionate impact as evidence proving a discriminatory intent. The plaintiffs in this case asserted that the disparate racial impact of the zoning proved that the city intended to discriminate against racial minorities.</p>
<p>The SCOTUS dealt with two significant issues: First, whether the plaintiffs had standing. Second, whether the zoning was in violation of equal protection. Regarding the second issue, the court stated that in order to use disparate impact alone to prove discrimination, they plaintiffs must show a "clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race." Ultimately the court ruled against the plaintiffs. This case reaffirmed the principle articulated in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_v._Davis_d89e.html" title="Washington v. Davis">Washington v. Davis</a>, that discriminatory impact was not a per se violation of equal protection, but merely evidence of discriminatory intent. While appearing to allow considerable latitude for the use of statitstical evidence of discrimination, in application Arlington Heights and similar cases almost entirely foreclose using discriminatory impact to prove intent. Ironically, many of the most fervent opponents of the use of statistics to prove racial discrimination end up using those statistics themselves to support overturning affirmative action.

<p>Colonel Robert L. Howard U.S. Army Special Forces is one of America's most decorated soldiers. He served five tours in Vietnam. Colonel Howard is the only soldier to be nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor three times for three separate actions within a thirteen month period.</p>
<p>He received a direct appointment from Master Sergeant to 1st Lieutenant in 1969, and was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Richard M. Nixon at the White House in 1971. His other awards for valor include the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star and eight Purple Hearts. He received his decorations for valor for actions while serving as an NCO (Sergeant First Class).</p>
<p>Robert L. Howard grew up in Opelika, Alabama and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1956 at age seventeen. He retired as a full Colonel in 1992 after 36 years service. During Vietnam, Howard was a veteran long-range reconnaissance team leader when he served in the U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets) and spent most of his five tours in the super-secret MACV-SOG (Military Assistance Command Vietnam Studies and Observations Group) also known as Special Operations Group, which ran classified cross-border operations into Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam during the war. The sixty-man recon company at Kontum, in which he served, was the Vietnam War's most highly decorated unit of its size awarded five Medals of Honor. It was for his actions while serving on a mission to rescue a fellow soldier in Cambodia, that he was submitted for the Medal of Honor the third time for his extraordinary heroism.</p>
<p>In later years, he served as chief of the Special Forces Qualification Course at Fort Bragg, N.C.; and his last command was chief of the Special Operations Command in Korea. The Medal of Honor was awarded to 17 Special Forces soldiers during the Vietnam War eight of them posthumously. Howard was the last Special Forces recipient still on active duty when he retired on Sept. 29, 1992.</p>

Lawrence Chou was born in Hong Kong on April 19, 1979. He has one older sister and grew up in Vancouver, Canada. Around the young age of 15, little Lawrence started participating in Karaoke contests and even won a few championships. Around the age of 16, from 1995 to 1997, he joined a Canada dance troupe and publicly performed about 250 times a year. Around the age of 19, he launched his singing career when he released his first Mandarin single "Don't Be A Fool", and then his first Mandarin album "I LOVe YOU".</p>
<p>Eventually, he ventured into the movie industry after releasing his last compilation album "People Says" in 2000. His debut movie "Merry Go Round" had him nominated as Best New Artist in the 21st Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Since his debut in the movie industry from 2001 to now, he has appeared in Asian movies like "The Eye", "If u care...", "Truth or Dare: 6th Floor Rear Flat", "The Death Curse", and "Dragon Squad" alongside big name stars.</p>
<p>During his entertainment industry career, he was also better known as Mavis Fan's (范晓萱) boyfriend. She was a Taiwanese pop singer that was two years older than Lawrence. Their romance began around the time Lawrence launched his singing career in 1998 and eventually ended in 2003. The reason they broke up was because there was some disagreements in lifestyle after living apart in two places for a long time. Lawrence and Mavis both first met on stage in Vancouver. Mavis met Lawrence through Lawrence's mother (who was handling the staging activities). It was a girl-after-boy and older-girl-younger-boy kind of love relationship.</p>

<li>Took Ella Koon's (官恩娜) first screen kiss in the 2006 movie "Without Words".</li>
<li>A romantic kind of guy, he declared his love to Mavis when she came out with a new album: "Mavis, I want us to be together!" and even wearing couple outfits while holding their pet dog as they walked the red carpet for the Taiwan Great Hit Award.</li>
<li>Mavis once had a thought of breaking up with Lawrence because she said he was too good to her. She had a melancholy disease (有憂鬱症) and got depressed over little things. Lawrence would help her by being her psychologist and even read alot of psychology books. Mavis said, "Because feeling he was too good, always allowing me to torture him, I get worried about him, that's why I would have this thought."</li>
<li>The first time Lawrence saw Mavis was at KTV, "that is because a friend had picked her song, that's when I knew of this person, started liking her from that moment on, felt she was exactly the type I liked."</li>
<li>All his albums were in Mandarin, but all his movies are in Cantonese.</li>

<p>Peter Urie has over 28 years experience in Television Production and related senior management roles, and has worked across a huge range of television programmes.</p>
<p>He joined the BBC in July 1976 as a graduate-engineering trainee, involved in the design and building of broadcast transmitters in the UK, gaining an invaluable technical knowledge of broadcast systems.</p>
<p>He moved into television production in 1978, as a floor manager at the BBC’s London television studios, television centre. In 1979 he became a Producer / Director for the BBC working on a range of location and studio based programmes including “Top of The Pops”, “The Two Ronnies” and it’s a “Knockout” as well as factual documentaries and series, both live and pre-recorded.</p>
<p>In 1981 he moved to BBC Bristol, as the Senior Production Executive of the prestigious Natural History Unit. His responsibilities included the overall control and management of the unit’s creative development, programmes, staff, budgets and resources (around £26m). He was also involved in the negotiation of International Co-productions including the writing of business / finance plans for the unit’s foreign partners.</p>
<p>In 1985 he was asked to move to BBC Pebble Mill in Birmingham, to help set up Daytime television for the BBC. As Head of Daytime Television, he was responsible for the overall management of all output including both original and acquired programming, some 30 hours of original production per week, some 80 staff and P&amp;L responsibility for the annual budget of £120m. He was also involved in the commission of the first Independent production for the BBC outside London.</p>
<p><br />
In August 1988 he left the BBC to join TVS as, Head of Factual Programmes. Working to the Director of Programmes, he was responsible for the overall programme output, management of staff, cash and resources (a budget of around £61m). In 1990 he became the Independent Commissioning Executive for TVS, and was responsible for the development, negotiation and commissioning of all Network and Local Independent programme for the company. He was asked to stay with TVS until February of 1993 (two months after the franchise ended) in order to continue to manage the Independent output to completion.</p>
<p>In August 1992, during the last year of TVS he also formed TSS Ltd (a production management company), and The Media Merchants TV Co. Ltd (with two other partners). A specialist children’s production company making network children’s programmes for both ITV and BBC. The company quickly grew into one of the largest Independent Producers of Children’s programmes in the UK and has won 17 national and international awards including two BAFTA awards and a further 6 BAFTA nominations. Under Peter’s control, the company was one of the fastest growing independent production companies in the UK and at the time he decided to sell, it had a turnover of over £6m including a successful merchandising division with a net profit before tax of around 46%.</p>
<p>In April of 2000, Peter led both TSS and The Media Merchants to a successful sale, worth in excess of £14m when both companies were 100% acquired by the then Britt Allcroft Group (later to become Gullane ENT. PLC), Peter, along with his two partners were locked into the company for a five year period as part of the terms of the sale. HIT Entertainment PLC subsequently acquired Gullane in August of 2002.</p>
<p>In addition to his responsibilities as MD of Media Merchants Ltd and TSS Ltd. Peter was appointed as, Senior Vice President, Group Head of Production (Europe) for the group shortly after the acquisition. He was responsible for all of the group’s European production activities including, such classic brands as Art Attack, Thomas the Tank Engine, Fireman Sam, Bob the Builder and Sooty as well as overall control of all programme development for Europe and P&amp;L responsibility for the division.</p>
<p>Peter decided to leave his various roles at HIT Entertainment at the end of his 5 year contractual lock in period in January 2005, and worked as a consultant for a number of media companies. He also formed Pure Investments, a partnership that invests in property and media related companies in the UK, Spain and America and Star TV Ltd. a rights ownership and TV Production Company.</p>
<p>In August of 2005 Peter was asked to join the board of TV Loonland PLC as the Chief Corporate Development Officer, tasked with developing the business as a whole by expanding the company via acquisitions and organic growth. He was also appointed as Managing Director of Metrodome PLC, a separate AIM listed company that is approximately 83% owned by TV Loonland.</p>

<p><b>Etimologjia</b> e emrit Kasem vjen nga fjala heleno-romake "Kas" qe don me thene kasaforte. Nderrsa mbiemri Gazari, sic mund te dallohet lehtesisht nga folesit e gjuheve indo-europiane rrjedh nga fjala e bukur shqipe "Gas" gaztor, i gazuar, gazplot...pra njeri me humor te mire.</p>
<p>Kasem Gazari eshte nje figure e njohur e rilindjes djaloshare te Shqiperise se jugut.U lind ne nje familje mikroborgjeze ne Fier me 23.09.1975. Qe ne femijeri u shqua per aftesite e tij organizative duke mbajtur pozicione te rendesishe si kujdestar klase, kapiteni i ekipit te lagjies apo babai ne lojen popullore "me shpira". Si pasoje e ketij "fati" ai u brumos qysh ne femijeri me kompleksin e supermacise.</p>
<p>Shkollen fillore e kreu ne vendlindje ne institutin kulturor shkolla 8 vjecare "Liri Gero". Faza e adoleshences do ta gjente te riun 15 vjecar nen diktaturen e rrepte te gjimnazit privat "Dertliu". Gjate kesaj periudhe mesjetare ne personalitetin e tij do te formoheshin ishuj pasigurie dhe ndrojtjeje. Fale rezultateve te shgkelqyera te arritura pas nje pune relativisht jo shume te lodhshme, Atdheu dhe vulat te ministria e Arsimit do ti jepnin te drejten te ndiqte studimet jashte vendit. (per arsye siguri nuk mund te permendim vendodhjen aktuale) Aktiviteti i tij exr\tar-kurrikular ka vazhduar dhe eshte profilizuar ne fushen femororo-politiko-ekonomike. Studimet e detajuara ne kete fushe do ta shnderrojne ne nje figure adapte pr sfidat e medha qe e presin vendin.</p>

<p><b>George Cox</b> (1853-1916) was a powerful member of the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_County_9243.html" title="Hamilton County">Hamilton County</a>, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_party.html" title="Republican party">Republican party</a> who controlled a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_machine.html" title="Political machine">political machine</a> in that county's main city, <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati.html" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>.</p>
<p>Cox began as a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barkeeper.html" title="Barkeeper">barkeeper</a> in the 1870s, but was soon furnishing illigal and fictitious voters for local candidates he favored, most of whom were Republicans resentful of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_party.html" title="Democratic party">Democratic party</a>'s control of the city government. Cox ran for and was elected to the Cincinnati <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_council.html" title="City council">city council</a> in 1879. Almost immediately he became a hugely influential member of Hamilton County's Republican party.</p>
<p>With the city council later falling into Republican hands, Cox built his political machine on the types of typical <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election_fraud.html" title="Election fraud">election fraud</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graft.html" title="Graft">graft</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bribery.html" title="Bribery">bribery</a> that typically accompany such machines. His control of Cincinnati's politics was so complete that by the 1890s, a Republican essentially had to have Cox's blessing to be elected. To neutralize the Democrats, Cox arranged for 40% of the city's appointed jobs to be held by the opposition party, preventing true opposition from coalescing in a Democratic candidate. As Cox himself one said: "The people do the voting. I simply see that the right candidates are selected."</p>
<p>But Cox's control of the city began to fall apart after he encouraged the city to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annex.html" title="Annex">annex</a> some of the nearby independent parts of Hamilton County. Many residents of these areas were middle-class, and saw Cox's political machine as seedy and undesirable. Cox found he had much greater difficulty controlling this newer, larger group of voters, and in 1911 Cox's candidate for mayor lost the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election.html" title="Election">election</a>. Cox, who had always promised more favors than he cpuld realistically deliver, never regained his power.</p>
<p>Cox suffered a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a> in 1916, and died in May of that year when he had another, fatal stroke.</p>

<p>The story focuses on Carol Shelton, a woman in her fifties who is going on a second honeymoon with her husband Bill. As they're driving to the house they rented in Florida, Carol gets a strong feeling of déjà vu, which she's been feeling since they were on their chartered plane. She is obsessively predicting what she'll see next on the side of the road as they approach the house, but for the most part her predictions are inaccurate. As they draw near, she wakes up and finds she's still on the plane. Things progress again as they had in her dream, and this time her dream seems to be coming true. She becomes panicked as they approach the house for a second time, and once again she wakes up to discover it had been a dream. She realizes that she is in fact dead, and is reliving the same period of time indefinitely.</p>
<p>King's note, at the end of the story, reads: " I think this story is about Hell. A version of it where you are condemned to do the same thing over and over again. Existentialism, baby, what a concept; paging Albert Camus. There's an idea that Hell is other people. My idea is that it might be repetition."</p>

<p>Mary Durack (nee Costello) married Patrick Durack in 1862. He was one of the great pioneer pastoralists who crossed uncharted lands to the Cooper’s Creek area of Queensland in the 1860s, and later worked his way overland to settle in the Kimberley District of Western Australia. While his wife is not given a place in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, she deserves a place in history, being an archetypal colonial wife, surviving all the difficulties of the outback. She gave unstinting support to her adventurous husband, who was often away for long periods, and she reared to adulthood six of her eight children. Mary Durack, her grand-daughter, gives an insight into her story in Kings in Grass Castles. While her inclination was for a settled suburban life she showed endurance and resourcefulness when travelling with small children through harsh lands. She experienced drought and flood, having at times to live off the land, economic depression, loneliness and fear of hostile Aborigines. She died in 1893, a loved and respected matriarch. The colour for Durack House is Black.</p>

<p>MLEC is one of only three area vocational-technical training centers. It is one of the two dual-delivery schools in <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami-Dade_County_3205.html" title="Miami-Dade County">Miami-Dade County</a>, providing adult vocational training in conjunction with a full-service high school. This allows MLEC's high school students to attend regular academic classes and technical or vocational training programs during the same school day on the same school campus. At time of graduation, high school students can receive both a high school diploma and a certificate of completion from the vocational training program in which they participated.</p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2010, all high schools in the <a href="../../../m/d/c/MDCPS_de89.html" title="MDCPS">Miami-Dade County Public School</a> System will shift over to the Collegiate-Honors System at which time the Valedictorian, Salutatorian, and Top 10 system will be abolished.

The change came about as a complete overhaul of the high school curriculum system modelled after the New York Public School System and implemented by the school board and superintendent. The system is already in place at the newly built <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Ferguson_High_School_%28Florida%29_9951.html" title="John A. Ferguson High School (Florida)">John A.

<p>The school's activities departments is involved with the student body to come up with creative and fun ways to entertain the student body, since the high school has no athletic teams.</p>
<p>MLEC has always had a considerable amount of dances, most of them held in either the high school cafeteria or gym. Some annual dances include the "Back to School Dance" and the end of the year dance, which is always popular.</p>
<p>Since the 04-05 school year, MLEC has had a mini-carnival along with a dance. Usually, it is called the "Harvest Fest," but because of the days off as a result of a busy hurricane season in the 05-06 school year, the date of the carnival was pushed back and became known as the "Winter Carnival."</p>
<p>School publications include the school newspaper (Sponsor, G. Lama) and the yearbook, Panthera Oncas (Sponsor, Mrs. N. Borges).</p>

<p>On December 18, 2006, television production teacher Gerald Veres punched and kicked a student in his Senior class. Veres then fled the scene. He was known by students as an avid Liberal who would rant all day about Republicans, Fox News, and Rush Limbaugh. Apparently Veres lost his temper and had stated several times that he hated his Senior class.</p>

<p>Since there are no official athletic teams in MLEC, the students put their own creative twist to basketball games.</p>
<p>Every few months, a basketball game is held in which teams from every grade level compete to see which grade is the best. Usually, the game comes down to Juniors vs. Seniors, and is always popular since the junior and senior classes are always the ones with the most rivalry.</p>

<p>MLEC is the only technical school to hold an annual Homecoming dance and game.</p>
<p>The Homecoming game is a "basketball jam" type of event in which current students play against alumni players. The first year this game was held was the 05-06 school year.</p>
<p>The Homecoming dance is always one of the most popular events of the school year. It has been nearly sold-out every year since the school first had it in the 04-05 school year. For a high school of about 1500 students, 500 tickets being sold the first year the event was held is quite remarkable.</p>

<p>Bellarmine College Preparatory has a CCS Divison I JV and Varsity Tennis program. The program this year was headed by Coach Glenn Hernandez, who then left the team midseason in search of a new job and the American Dream. Filling in was Coach Jeff Schilling, who also works for the school. The Bellarmine Bells of tennis this season have gone undefeated so far in the 2006 season, and recently participated in the WCAL (West Catholic Athletic League) individual tournament. The Bells will head into the CCS playoffs, where last year they were defeated by Los Gatos High School in the Division I finals.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the team is the players themselves, who are known to "have a good time" quite a bit. One fascinating player, for isntance is DJ Donald James. Donald, (DJ for short), has been noted for words like "milkables" and for popularizing the phrase "mammma mia" in the Bay Area tennis world. Another incredible player is Mitchell Knauff, who stands out for his sizable biceps and his stark resemblance to a falcon of ruddy complexion. Futhermore, players Sobrato and Winnike have been noted for their substantial lack of playing time, as well as for their rapidly-improving social and basketball skills.</p>
<p>By far the best player, and most famous, is Neil Weisman. Weisman has gained popularity for his impeccable teacher impersonations, and also his recent success with the ladies.</p>

<p>The Mind-blowing Air-powered</p>
<p>The magnificent air-powered car that I created has a very interesting method of working. My car stores energy when the car is just standing still and when the driver drives the car, the potential or stored energy is used. This is the procedure on how my car works:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, when the car is not being used, the wind pushes the turbine blades in the back of the car causing the turbine blades to spin.</li>
<li>When the turbine blades spin, energy is stored inside the car.</li>
<li>After lots of energy is stored, you just get into the car and drive.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you drive the car, the energy that was stored by the turbine blades is used. In the model I made, when the wind blows the turbine blades spin. The turbine blades are attached to the front of the car. When you spin the turbine blades, the rubber band gets twisted. The energy is stored in the twisted rubber band. When you let go of the turbine blades, the turbine blades spin pushing air back causing the car to go in the opposite direction which is forwards.</p>
<p>There are many types of turbines such as the steam turbine, gas turbine, transonic turbine, contra-rotating turbine, statorless turbine, etc. But, the turbine my car uses is a wind turbine. Wind can be used to do work. The kinetic energy of the wind can be changed into other forms of energy, either mechanical energy or electrical energy. A wind turbine is a machine that converts the kinetic energy into electrical energy. A wind turbine consists of six major components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A rotor that aerodynamically converts the wind energy into mechanical energy on a slowly turning shaft.</li>
<li>A gearbox that increases the rotor-shaft speed for the generator (some specially designed generators run at rotor-shaft speed and do not need a gearbox).</li>
<li>A generator that produces electricity.</li>
<li>A control and protection system that optimizes performance and keeps the machinery operating within safe limits.</li>
<li>A tower that raises the rotor high off the ground where the wind speed is greater and the effects of local obstructions are less.</li>
<li>A foundation that supports the wind turbine system, sometimes with the aid of guy wires.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wind energy converts kinetic energy that is present in the wind into more useful forms of energy such as mechanical energy or electricity. Wind energy is a pollution-free, infinitely sustainable form of energy. It doesn't use fuel; it doesn't produce greenhouse gasses, and it doesn't produce toxic or radioactive waste. Wind turbines, unlike other turbines, normally operate as a single stage without nozzle and interstage guide vanes. If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as a pump or grinding stones, the machine is usually called a windmill. Wind turbines can be separated into two general types based on the axis about which the turbine rotates. Turbines that rotate around a horizontal axis are most common. Vertical axis turbines are less frequently used. Wind turbines can also be classified by the location in which they are to be used. Onshore, offshore, or even aerial wind turbines have unique design characteristics according to where they are located. Wind turbines can also be used in conjuction with a solar power tower to extract the energy due to air heated by the Sun and rising through a large vertical solar chimney. The difference between a vertical axis turbine and a horizontal axis turbine are that a horizontal axis wind turbine has the main rotor shaft and generator at the top of a tower and must be pointed into the wind by some means and that a vertical axis wind turbine has the main rotor shaft positioned vertically. One of the strongest construction materials available (in 2006) is graphite-fibre in epoxy, but it is very expensive and only used by some manufactures for special load-bearing parts of the rotor blades.</p>

<p><a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> was good over all, for the American people outside the tragedy of millions of lives lost.</p>
<p>For those at home there was new prosperity. Income levels had never been as high. The unemployment rate in 1944, was 1 percent, 1938, that same rate was 19 percent.</p>
<p>The black people were able to get jobs; many were employed by the federal government. Both black men and women served in the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_Forces_ec0c.html" title="Armed Forces">Armed Forces</a>. The black women worked as nurses, but could not care for the white soldiers. The men were allowed to join the segregated black army with lower wages than the white soldier. The <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navy.html" title="Navy">Navy</a> accepted black men only for kitchen duty. While the economy was good during wartime there were still reminders of the blacks' inequalities. The American President <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> formed a new committee “<a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_Employment_Practices_Committee_0ec1.html" title="Fair Employment Practices Committee">Fair Employment Practices Committee</a>” (FEPC) to outlaw racial discrimination in war industries. During this era the civil rights movement made great positive progress.</p>
<p>Some white women came from being full time housewives to being (while retaining their housewife duties) needed to keep defense plants in operation for war. They earned a good living. The women liked having an income, and the independence it gave to them. Many of these women continued working after the war. This brought on another issue; the family unit began losing its unity and values.</p>
<p>In the 1920’s America had good economic growth. Next came a decade of the great depression. They could only hope for a new decade of opportunity. New Deal programs of 1932 were supposed to help end the crisis and it did give some relief. The war ended the depression. World War II created more social and economic change. It was a bloody war 400,000 Americans lost their lives. Globally, 80 million people died.</p>
<p>Factories which had operated at half-time now ran at full capacity for war time production. The American people conserved and recycled materials to be used by the factories. The materials used were metal, paper, and rubber. Household trash also had value: kitchen fats, old medal shovels, even empty metal lipstick tubes. (The shell was used as the shell for a bomb “bombshells”.) The factories used these recyclables to make war supplies.</p>
<p>There was a wave of migration approximately 700,000 people moved to the West and North. These people were going to work in the newly created industrial areas. Housing was a huge problem people had to share places to live. Some lived in tents until better housing could be found or built. In the new cities where the black migrants lived, many of them could vote, when they were not able to in the South. People from rural areas moved into cities. Farmers some migrated and some joined the military some women stayed home to tend the farms. Automobile assembly lines converted to producing tanks and airplanes. The Refrigerator companies converted to making munitions. (bombs/bullets) Industrialist <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_J._Kaiser_fbd7.html" title="Henry J. Kaiser">Henry J. Kaiser</a> constructed exceedingly large shipyards in California, to build war ships for cargo and landing craft. The vessels were built in 14 days compared to the previous speed of 105 days.</p>
<p>In America due to lack of some metals during the war some coinage in 1943, changed to using zinc coated steel for pennies. In 1942-1945 the war time five-cent piece was made of copper (56%), silver (35%) and manganese (9%) this was to take place of the nickel.</p>
<p>After the war the soldiers were handed a GI bill of rights it was originally to help the veteran transition in to the new society and economic era different from that of pre-war. The GI bill was a tremendous boost there skill level and their education level. Many of the veterans went on to universities and colleges to get degrees which gave them a larger portfolio and more opportunity to earn a better living; some went to trade schools or job training. The economy continued to improve after the war.</p>
<p>The legacy from the new Deal and World War II the new society in which they lived. The federal government became much bigger with more power. The President of the United States has much more direct authority over all including the federal government and the American people. The economy was much stronger than in the past. The American people as a whole were more independent only a few remained dependent on the federal government. The United States military became the strongest and most powerful in the world. The war was proof of their strength in strategy; their weaponry and their ability deploy rapidly. --<a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.101.12.html" title="User:152.163.101.12">152.163.101.12</a> 05:19, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is 920 by 350 feet, dawned with beautiful coloums and angles carved into stone. It was funded by charity, the director of building was done by Antonio de Pietro Averlino. The inside of the hospital was seperated by one wing for women and the other for men.</p>

<p>Edward Hastings Chamberlain (1899-1967) was an American economist. Published in 1933, his important book, <i>The Theory of Monopolistic Competition</i>, fused the previously separate theories of monopoly and competition, and sought to explain a range of market situations that are neither purely competitive nor totally monopolistic. Chamberlain held that most market prices are actually determined by both monopolistic and competitive elements.</p>

<p>Rho Pi Phi (ΡΠΦ), a pharmaceutical fraternity, was founded in November 1918 at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy under the name of Ram Bam Pharmaceutical Society. The following year, 1919, the Rho Pi Phi fraternity was organized and chartered as a non-sectarian organization. It gained its international status in 1926 with the establishment of the Nu chapter at the University of Toronto, Canada. The main goal and purpose of this fraternity could be expressed through its 3 mottos:</p>
<p>1. To maintain the Ethical Standards, dignity of and pride in the most ancient and honorable profession of pharmacy.</p>
<p>2. To contribute to the moral, social, and intellectual welfare of all students in Pharmacy.</p>
<p>3.... That we may take the lamp of research into the dark recesses of things unknown, and make our contribution to our fellow man.</p>
<p>Today, Rho Pi Phi is a co-ed fraternity that welcomes both men and women of good character who are dedicated to the profession of pharmacy.</p>
