<p>Miss Tony, real name Anthony M. Boston, was a pioneering performer in the genre of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Club_8238.html" title="Baltimore Club">Baltimore Club</a> music. Miss Tony released several of the most popular Baltimore Club songs, such as "What's Up What's Up", "Tony's Bitch track", "Pull ya Guns out", and worked with Baltimore Club pioneers Frank Ski and Scotty B.</p>
<p>Miss Tony was a male performer who often sang live over radio broadcasts on Baltimore radio station <a href="../../../9/2/q/92Q_9761.html" title="92Q">92Q</a> (WERQ 92.3) and in clubs such as The Paradox. Miss Tony was a popular drag queen in Baltimore and was discovered by Frank Ski in the mid-late 80's. Later in his career, Miss Tony became the co-host of the "Big fat morning show" on 92Q, alongside Frank Ski. The Big fat morning show was the most popular radio program in Baltimore at that time.</p>
<p>Miss Tony changed his on-air personality to "Big Tony" in 1998, and became devoutly religious but still remained part of the club scene. Miss Tony passed away from kidney failure on April 11, 2003.</p>

<p>Flushing Avenue is an approxiately five mile thoroughfare running through northern Brooklyn and western Queens beginning at the termination of Nassua Street, on the northern fringe of Fort Greene, and ending where it merges with Grand Avenue, in Maspeth. It serves as the dividing line for the neighborhoods of Southside Williamsburg and Clinton Hill and the neighborhoods of East Williamsburg and Bushwick. After crossing the Queens border, the avenue divides Ridgewood from West Maspeth. It finally terminates in Maspeth.</p>
<p><br />
The B57 bus runs the entire length of the Avenue, and the G line, the JMZ lines, and the L line all stop at, or nearby, Flushing Avenue.</p>
<p><br />
The avenue is primarily an industrial thoroughfare, especially on its extreme western end, where, on its northside, it serves the Brooklyn Navy Yard Industrial Park. The industrial park rents to over 200 tenants, primarily distributorships and light manufacturing concerns, though they also rent to a few artists. Mayor Bloomberg proposed a redevelepment of the yard that would put retail space in the yard's west side and television and film studios the yard's east side. In this district, the south side of Flushing Avenue contains many abondoned business that were supported by sailors before the government closed the yard.</p>
<p><br />
Continuing eastward, Flushing Avenue crosses the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). Here, many motorists hoping to avoid congestion exit the BQE and continue westward to the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. This section of Flushing Avenue, between the BQE and Brooklyn's Broadway, has seen considerable redevelopment over recent years by Williamsburg's Hasidic population, as young urban professionals displace them in the northern end of Willamsburg. The north side of Flushing Avenue in this section is primarily newly constructed residential, whereas the south side is primarily industrial, with the most notable exception being the world famous Marcy Houses project. Here, at Marcy Avenue and Flushing Avenue the G line stops.</p>
<p><br />
The beating heart of Flushing Avenue is where it intersects with Broadway and Grahm Avenue, in the extreme southern end of East Williamsburg. This business improvement district is serviced by the JMZ line. Here, one can find cheap retail shopping and excellent authentic Boricua food. This primarily Puerto Rican and Hasidic area is becoming increasingly populated with students and young professionals looking for cheap rent, cheap shopping, and proximity to lower Manhattan and Northside Williamsburg's nightlife.</p>
<p><br />
After crossing Bushwick Avenue, Flushing avenue becomes gritty again. To the south is residential Bushwick, and on the north are the massive Bushwick Houses. Where the L Train approaches Flushing Avnue, at Morgan and at Wyckoff Streets, a blossiming artist community has moved into the low rise lofts that were once abandonded. In fact, this artist community is growing so large, that it is able to support the two new bars that have sprung up on this section of Flushing Avenue.</p>
<p><br />
Continuing past Wyckoff Street, the avenue turns active industrial on both sides again as it crosses into Queens. Upon entering Maspeth, it is a residential street.</p>
<p><br />
Flushing Avenue has seen considerable decline since its heyday. But it seems as if the Brooklyn renaissance may finally reach this decrepit turnpike. In 2004, the city began a project to upgrade the water and sewer infrastructure on the road, and to repave it. The project is estimated to be complete in 2007. Until then Flushing Avenue will bo mostly a trench, but perhaps this rebuilding will be the catalyst for industries, artists, and residents to reinhabit all those abandonded buildings.</p>

wa-gwan is an online gaming clan formed originally by 4 friends, and now has over 40 members!</p>
<p>So, how did we pick the name? What does it mean?</p>
<p>Well the saying "wa-gwan" has Jamaican origins. We're not Jamaican (as far as I know!), but its such a catchy saying!! To the Jamaicans "wa-gwan" is used as a greeting, it's short for "what's going on?". Similar to "wa appnin mon?" (what's happening man?).</p>
<p>But then it got regularly used for victory and celebration, where it would be shouted to each other "WA-GWAN!!" with big Jamaican grins!</p>
<p>And now, the final evolution of the wa-gwan saying has been made. The final transition into what it is today has become complete: We use it as a war cry to psych us into the frame of mind we need to kill everything in sight!!</p>

Evaz is a small town situated in the southern province of Fars, Iran. Although Evaz has long been a scarcely populated town, the people (Evazis) have long survived through trade, particularly with countries on the Other side of the Persian Gulf. Initially the male providers of the families travelled by boat to countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait in order to take advantage of the flourishing port-based trade in order to provide for their families back in Iran.</p>
<p>This eventually led to a growing population of Evazis in the Arabian Penninsula, particularly in the United Arab Emirates. With financial growth, Evazis were eventually able to bring their families to the Arab Penninsula and settle. As Evazis have long been part of the minority Sunni Muslims of Iran (as opposed to Shi'ites), their settlement in the Persian Gulf amongst other Sunni Muslims was attractive to their growing population.</p>
<p>They were joined in this migration by members of close-by towns and cities in Iran such as Gerash and Lar (amongst many others). The similarity in religion, language and culture with these towns and cities effectively grouped them together in the Arabian Penninsula as "3eemi" or "Ajami" people, derived from the Arabian word for "foreigners".</p>
<p>The Evazi people are so-named in the Farsi language (the official language of the Islamic Republic of Iran), however in their own dialect they referr to themselves as "Avazis", which has morphed with the Arabic language in the Arab World into "Awadhis".</p>
<p>Today, many citizens and residents of the Arab countries populated by Evazis (especially some countries such as the United Arab Emirates, where a large population settled generations ago) share the surname "Al-Awadhi", which in Arabic means "The Evazi".</p>
<p>Although many of these people have long been immersed in the Arab culture (some of whom are third or fourth generation residents of the Arab world and may not have even been to Iran in their lives), this surname amongst other popular ones showcases their origins.</p>
<p>This is not to say the ties between the Evazis in the Arab World and Iran is not strong. Long-standing ties still remain and some even frequent their choice of residence between the two locations. Visitors to Evaz will notice the amusing way in which the tiny town has equipped itself with luxuries usually not present in towns of that size. The state of the art University and Hospital (amongst many other newly formed developments and improvements to the infrastructure). Many of the services are free of cost or offered at very low prices. All these new developments and services are payed for by the successul Evazi population of the Arabian countries, and not the Iranian government.</p>
<p>This cash flow from the Arab world to Evaz and other nearby southern towns of the "Ajam" people sustains their existence while at the same time serving to deepen and highlight the separation of the small Sunni population from the rest of Iran. It is unfortunately helping to affirm the bitter belief many of these people hold that the Iranian government does not cater to them based on their religious affiliation.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is also due to this reason (other than financial incentive) that residents of these southern towns continue to flock to, and hold a cultural exchange with, the Arab countries on the other side of the sea that separates them - the Persian Gulf. It is this immersion between themselves and with the Arab culture that has spawned references such as "Ajami" and "Al-Awadhi", and particularly the term "Khodmooni". This term is a variation of the Farsi term "Khod-e-mooni", meaning "one-of-us", and is now a frequently used in the various dialects of the many villages,towns and cities in the southern province of Fars to refer to the people from that area.</p>

The Midlothian Question is a term in British politics which refers to the problem of Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) in the UK being able to have a say in English affairs, whilst English MPs are not permitted to have a say in Scottish affairs. The term has since been used with reference to the same problem in respect of the Welsh Assembly.</p>

<p>Planktum is a trimmed live-CD, it's not and will not be a technical show-off, for version 01 it comes out based on SLAX, but future releases could be based in any system that allows to be customized (instead of a full fledge packaged system, we present a fast, versatile and "slimmed" spanish-english one) that simplifies at most the boot process and that includes a friendly GUI following an aesthetic touch close to the visual culture of the target group of users to whom it is addressed.</p>
<p>We intent to distribute this around immigrant communities, be it africans, latinos, chinese, etc. A graphical interface receives the user in an enviroment with 4 basic icons on the desktop. all leading to communication applications (present version includes Skype, WebBrowser, Email Client and an Instant Messaging application).</p>
<p>Planktum could be a build from a ranging sea of FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software): jabber to gollum or gnome metting to a puredata pidip based patch, all acording to the pool of resources that is out there in the opensource world withouth wich this project would'nt be possible.</p>

<p>Synat is a fairly typical teen band from Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, in that it is crap. It started life as a two man band for a fairly typical school talent contest, in that it was talentless. When the band was started by two fairly typical angry pubescent teenagers, who go by the fairly typical names of Ayden "Latrine Officer" Walters and James "Heavily Challenged" Fee. The first name that the band had was "Million Shades Of Grey" but, being fairly typical teenagers they changed it to something far more rubbish...S.Y.N.A.T. Music. We won't tell you what this fairly typical acronym means</p>
<p>The current band members are fairly typical in that they are angry pubescent teenagers. They go by the names of ( in alphabetical order); Jamie Bradley, Daniel Dolan, James Fee, Scott Ford and Ayden Walters.</p>
<p>To date, their music has been fairly typical teenage band produce in that it has been unmitigatedly awful. Their first home grown produce is "Over You". It is a good attempt to break the mould but sadly it has failed in a fairly typical fashion. The graceful voice of Ayden can't be heard over the killing of a guitar by James.

<p>ImageJ is a public domain Java image processing program inspired by NIH Image for the Macintosh. It runs, either as an online applet or as a downloadable application, on any computer with a Java 1.1 or later virtual machine. Downloadable distributions are available for Windows, Mac OS, Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p>It can display, edit, analyze, process, save and print 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit images. It can read many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, FITS and "raw". It supports "stacks", a series of images that share a single window. It is multithreaded, so time-consuming operations such as image file reading can be performed in parallel with other operations.</p>
<p>ImageJ was designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins. Custom acquisition, analysis and processing plugins can be developed using ImageJ's built in editor and Java compiler. User-written plugins make it possible to solve almost any image processing or analysis problem.</p>

<p>When I noticed that the Wikipedia article on Daniel Burros was linked to my name and that the link had no article, I thought I should submit this brief notice. My admission to the New York State Bar may be verified by checking the Attorneys section of the New York State Unified Court System's website. My publications in Cabinet, New York Press, and The New York Sun may be verified by searching Google or checking the websites of those publications. I assure you that I published three op-ed essays between 1986 and 1989 in New York Newsday, which has since folded. If that isn't satisfactory, you may delete the reference to New York Newsday. My marriage to Mimi Kramer may be verified by Google search and was mentioned in The New York Times. If anyone needs to contact me, I may be reached by e-mail at wmbryk@gmail.com and by telephone during business hours at (212) 266-1815.</p>

<p>The LockLegion was originally created as a joke by a member of the Blam Club. It was made to annoy the Clock Crew by a user known as StrawberryLock. One day BananaLock decided he wanted to take things seriously, so he made a website with an other lock. Everything was running fine and when clockcrew.cc was closed down, the LockLegion became bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>It has been through many ups and downs, but it is still present and making flash movies.</p>

<p>Death4u9 can be traced back to Red Alert 2, when the owner tried to sign up as death4u, that name was taken so he tried death4u2, that was also strangely taken so the name was once again changed to death4u29 he used this name for a while until runescape, when he needed a pure account, assasins_lie had been his account on a few games, but he decided that death4u29 was better for the war game, he changed the name to death4u9, and as they say, the rest is history.</p>
<p>Death4u9 has been used for thousands of online games, and is instantly recognised by his followers as "the pro that owned us", most recently he has began playing COD:UO, where his mere association with the game has started a cult following, a group that calls themself Nubines, and devotely follows death4u9's progress.</p>
<p>As the world of death4u9 continues to expand, surely everyone will want a peice of this great figure.</p>

<p>Task Force 6-26 is the creation of an executive order from President George W. Bush to detain, incarcerate, and interrogate foreign prisoners in what has become effective secrecy. Reportedly, the unit is comprised mostly of U.S. Navy SEALs. Their credentials cannot be verified, however, because the members of Task Force 6-26 are part of a Special Access Program and are permitted to falsify information, essentially making any investigation unlikely to succeed. This program is highly classified. Task Force 6-26 reportedly maintains off-the-record prisons where they are said to use more than moderate force in their coersion techniques.</p>
