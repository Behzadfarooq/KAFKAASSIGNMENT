<p>A <i>fictional</i> gym instructor who trains Pokémon.

<li><b>Keep</b>. In general have we not kept Pokémon and the human characters in the series? Also what is up with emphasizing <i>fictional</i> gym instructor? If there are there any <i>real</i> Pokémon gym instructors I would like to see some articles about them. (Actually I do not like the Pokémon at all, but I accept that that universe is large and that articles about characters in it should stay.) <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 09:25, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you Sjakkalle for your comments. In your own opinion, is there no bar of notability which needs to be met within the make believe universe of Pokémon for purposes of inclusion? How is it that articles about characters in a fictional universe should be kept, while real characters and locations here on Earth are not? GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 17:21, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That argument makes very little sense. Fictional characters become part of culture, and are usually not comparible with their real-world contemporaries on notability grounds. Mario is a fictional plumber, and is notable as a part of culture, while no real-life plumbers are equally notable. Oliver Twist is a fictional street urchin, and I don't see a whole lot of real-life street urchins with articles. The point is that things are rarely any less notable due to being fictional. Brawly is apparently a gym teacher. Is Pokemon a work of great artistic triumph for the ages? Who cares? Thousands if not millions of people are familiar with this character, which puts him above most (all?) of the real-life gym teachers out there. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 17:56, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just so I have this straight; you're asserting that a gym teacher from Pokémon is important above most (if not all) gym instructors in real life, while at the same time implying that <i>my</i> argument does not make sense? GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 18:02, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Absolutely. Let's look at some facts (keep in mind I'm not a pokemon fan, but I do know a fair amount about video games) Brawly appears in a GB game Pokemon Ruby / Sapphire, which sold <b>4 million copies <i>during their first six weeks on sale</i> in Japan alone <i>as well as the GBA FireRed/LeafGreen, which broke 1 million copies in its first 21 days of release in the USA. I can't find a single figure of how many of these games were sold total worldwide, but I'd say that</i></b> <i>10 million'</i> would be a conservative estimate. I also am not sure whether he has appeared in other games. I'd assume so, but let's move on. He's also appeared on the Pokemon TV series, which is very, very popular. I found one ratings source saying 5 million viewers in the US. Assuming it's at least roughly as popular in Japan (a safe bet) that's a further 10 million exposures, to say nothing of the rest of the world, reruns, etc (oh, and he's also been made into a toy). By even the most conservative guesses, I'd say that at least 20 million people worldwide are familar with this character. Now, really, in all seriousness, how many real-life gym teachers can that be said about? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 18:51, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I see it as indicative of systemic bias. If this were a character from an obscure sci-fi novel, we'd be falling all over ourselves to keep it. But a ludicrously popular cartoon, especially one of non-US origin, that has to go. I'm no Pokemon fan myself, but it seems pretty much impossible to deny that it's a major part of modern popular culture. On Google, for example, Pokemon gets about twice as many hits as "Mickey Mouse", "Charlie Brown", and "Bugs Bunny" <b>combined</b>! And that's not even counting Japanese-language references! <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:06, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Merge/redirect.</b> Even obscure characters from sci-fi novels get merged into single pages. (eg <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_a4b6.html" title="Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>) The same rule should apply to cartoons too. This isn't "systemic bias"; it's just a single rule being consistantly applied. Miss Pippa 09:34, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the rules being consistently applied to one group of articles are not being consistently applied to a different set of articles, would you not argue that in reality, the rules are not being "consistently applied" at all?

<li><b>Merge</b>. Is there consensus that minor characters should nearly always be merged? (well, it's somewhat referred to on the <a href="../../../w/i/w/WP%7EWIWO_5efd.html" title="WP:WIWO">WP:WIWO</a> page). Or should we put up a Policy Consensus to determine just that?
