<li><b>Keep</b>. As a High School it is certainly more notable that the Primary Schools also up for deletion. The stats from the BBC web site show its existance outside the material put out by the School itself. The article does however need improvement and I hope this Afd attracts it. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:41, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the BBC stats don't prove much more than that the school exists and has students who took the GCSE. Neither of those claims are evidence of notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I suggest High Schools are notable in the way that villages are. They contain much the same number of people. We do not delete articles on villages. Also biographies want to state which High School the subject went to and readers want to find out about the school. The best way to ensure this is not to delete articles on High Schools but to improve them. This argument does not apply to Primary Schools. These are rarely mentioned in biographical articles and they have less influence on people. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not quite. I've certainly seen articles on villages (or any other settlements) deleted when the only information is that "Dingsdorf is a village in the German state of Oberuntergammergau". All an article like that proves is that the place exists, which isn't enough for notability. Yes, if the village has more sources on it than that, it should probably get kept. To apply this analogy to this school, I don't see much more than the bare bones of existence in the sources. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:20, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - per "<i>Significant awards or commendations have been bestowed upon the school or its staff.</i>" Agree that the article needs expanding, but I don't think that stub articles should be deleted simply because they're stubs. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobwingfield_e0c6.html" title="User:Robwingfield">robwingfield</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobwingfield_a2c8.html" title="User talk:Robwingfield">talk</a>)</sup> 22:29, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, almost all English schools meet <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> because of their OFSTED reports. No evidence has been presented to indicate that this school is unlikely to do so. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:42, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Does not appear noteworthy. No nontrivial reliable secondary sources. OFSTED reports are trivial sources, because they exist for all schools as a mandatory function of the government, much like inspection reports for restaurants. In fact, it would be more noteworthy if an English school <b>lacked</b> an OFSTED report. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:51, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - My understanding is that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does not require multiple sourcing; it only seems to require one reliable source. Thus, the OFSTED reports seem to establish verifiability. On the other hand, notability requires coverage in multiple non-trivial sources or something similar. Winning awards is usually sufficient for notablity, so I think the awards the school has won are sufficient to establish notability. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 05:16, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the article meets all content policies. It's not really clear from the nomination why the nominator feels this article should be deleted; the solution to articles that fail to meet WP:SCHOOL is a merger, not deletion. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 06:28, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Nominator seems to be a single purpose account created to undo a whole string of failed AfDs. Nominator falsely claims that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> requires multiple non-trivial published works, when in fact, this is one of several criteria to support retention. As such, this vote is based on 1) Nomination was created in likely bad faith by a Single Purpose Account, 2) Nomination attempts to undo the precedent under which this article was Kept, and is part of a string of nearly a dozen such second and third cracks at undoing failed efforts at deletion (and as recreation of previously deleted articles is often used as a sign of bad faith and failure to observe precedent), 3) Nominator falsely claims that article fails <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> standard when criterion mention is merely one of several such criteria justifying retention, 4) this is is a high school and we have near perfect precedent for retention of existing high schools with any non-trivial content, a standard this article meets and exceeds, and 5) the school's receipt of the School Improvement award indicated for three consecutive years is evidence that the article meets the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:24, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
