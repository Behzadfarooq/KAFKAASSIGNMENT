<dd>Please familiarize yourself with the deletion process. non-Notability is a very common reason for deletion, common enough that the Guide to deletions has a designated shorthand code for it.

<dd>There is no evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be concurrently interested in this subject (eg. it is not well-known in a community); It is a stub rather than an expansion upon an established subject; There is no discussion on the article's talk page which establishes its importance. IOW, it fails each and every single one of the criteria defined by <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html#Importance_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance#Importance criteria</a>, which is in any case just a proposal. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 17:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I beleive all newly created articles can meet those criteria. Maybe because it was tagged for deletion in less than an hour after the creation time. For the first reason (in importance criteria), that's POV judgement, and cannot be objectively shown I think because it didnt get enough time for anyone to show that nobody is interrested to this article. Maybe it could've be more reasonnable to put a merge tag instead, or in the worst case the proposed for deletion tag. That why I think that this tag may be caused by an early judgement. --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanzoo_2f91.html" title="User:Banzoo">Banzoo</a> 18:08, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then you belive something that is clearly wrong. As for alternate tags - I have no problem with merging the scant information in this article with the broader <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Grapes_of_Wrath_e071.html" title="Operation Grapes of Wrath">Operation Grapes of Wrath</a> article, which is where I think this AfD is heading. I just don't think a non-notable attack that occured asd part of a larger military operation is worthy of an article, and expalined my reasoning. Can you shed some light on why you think this is a notable event? <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 21:15, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'm glad to see that the deletion tag is bit unjustified. That said, I'm not with meriging, maybe my idea was misrepresented, i was saying that other tags could've been more understandable than the deletion one. I support having a separate article for this one for the first reason that I was inspired by other wikipedia articles, and since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, so whenever someone would do a research it would find what ever was searching for. Even though, having an <i>article devoted to every single instance where a building was attacked as part of a military operation</i> seems reasonable for a good group of people, specially when considering that this <i>instance</i> resulted with a notable civilians cost. So maybe we'll <i>end up with several thousand articles for every recent conflict</i> but I dont see why this cannot be acceptable. After all, in my opinion Human loss during conflicts is not something to be neglected. --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanzoo_2f91.html" title="User:Banzoo">Banzoo</a> 17:05, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please don't put words in my mouth. The fact that I'm willing to accept a merge does not mean that the AfD tag is unjustified. I have yet to see any evidence that having an <i>article devoted to every single instance where a building was attacked as part of a military operation</i> seems reasonable for a good group of people. Human cost as part of a conflict is obviously not somethign to be neglected - and it isn't. The <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Grapes_of_Wrath_e071.html" title="Operation Grapes of Wrath">Operation Grapes of Wrath</a> already notes the number of civilain casualties in this conflict. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 17:23, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When quoting, it wasn't my intention to upset anyone, just to clarify things. Does <a href="../../../s/b/a/Sbarro_restaurant_suicide_bombing.html" title="Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing">Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing</a> fall in the same case as this article?--<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanzoo_2f91.html" title="User:Banzoo">Banzoo</a> 18:00, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. There is evidence that the Sbarro incident is notable - a google search for Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing yeilds over 20,000 hits. The event has several pages dedicated to it on the Israeli MFA web site, and was the subject of numerous articles in print -for example <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,534748,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,534748,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,534461,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,534461,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The <a href="../../../s/b/a/Sbarro_restaurant_suicide_bombing.html" title="Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing">Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing</a> is in the same class as <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_massacre_859b.html" title="Cave of the Patriarchs massacre">Cave of the Patriarchs massacre</a> - a terror attack on civilians, which gathered much public attention. Civilians dying in a war zone during a military conflict, tragic though it is, is simply not on the same footing. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 18:19, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I didnt know that this is the way to measure notability. But since it was mentioned, what was the stats for the article on question? Military conflict? isn't it the case for that bombing that took place during the al aksa intifada (that's considered as a conflict as far as I know). And why an attack on a civilian building in nabatiyeh is not considered as a terror attack? --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanzoo_2f91.html" title="User:Banzoo">Banzoo</a> 18:46, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
