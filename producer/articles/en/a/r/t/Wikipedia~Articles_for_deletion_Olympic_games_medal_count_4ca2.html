<p>This list of articles lack sources. Note this is not to delete the template but the article. It hence lacks citations. In turn it becomes original research. According <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> this is a candidate for deletion. Please, let us not act to hastilly on this one the idea seems to be good. It just really needs [citations]. It is also list.

<p><b>Note:</b> The AfD notice has been added to <a href="../../../o/l/y/Template%7EOlympic_games_medal_count_b436.html" title="Template:Olympic games medal count">Template:Olympic games medal count</a>, therefore this AfD covers <i>every single Olympic medal count in which that template is used</i>, from 1896 on.

<dd><b>Keep</b>. I just finished re-doing the 2 major pages (<a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Olympics_medal_count_09c2.html" title="Winter Olympics medal count">Winter Olympics medal count</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Olympics_medal_count_0d44.html" title="Summer Olympics medal count">Summer Olympics medal count</a>, and I have made sources for each. Each of the pages with a specific olympic date (i.e. 1960 Summer) do not have sources, though. These pages <b>can't</b> be deleted because a lot of hard work has been put into making them. Furthermore, these pages have been in Wikipedia for a long time, so why is it now that they are up for deletion? A source for this information can be found anywhere (IOC, Olympic.org, Sydney2000, etc) so the real problem is finding someone who is willing to find and append valuable sources for each of the other pages, or make an umbrella citation covering all of them. As for now, I think that the deletion should be removed and a tag for sources should be put on every page. --<a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 18:10, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, what is the purpose of having 4 tags? All that you need is that sources needed tag and the deletion one, because you and I know that this is not a matter of "factual accuracy"; the proble is that there are no sources. I have created a new tag that will act as the source tag. The other two (which are redundant) I am going to remove becuase they are appearing on 50 or more pages (because of the link to the template) and at a time of high traffic due to the current olympics, we don't want Wikipedia first time users to get a bad notion of Wikipedia because there are ugly tags filling up the page. I am not a vandal trying to ruin Wikipedia, I just am thinking of the other thousands of users and viewers.

comment in the talk page of CyclePat as Written by JzG:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Pat, next time you are tempted to tag up an article like that (let alone a template), please do ask around first. If you don't trust me, ask somebody else. Your action was precipitate - to suggest that an Olympic medal table "requires sources" is pressing a point too far since the sources are freely available on the Internet and published every day in the press, whether or not the people using them have accurately transcribed the figures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Apart from anything else you apparently only half-did the process, and it was the wrong process to start with (should have been miscellany for deletion). Oh, and you tagged entirely the wrong article - you tagged the medal tables template, in effect demanding sources for the existence of the 2006 Winter Olympics. The article you want deleted, Olympic games medal count, does not exist and never did.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you said in the delete request that all it required was citations - that is not grounds for deletion unless you believe that the article is irredeemable in that regard (i.e. original research without prospect of reliable external sources - absurd in the case of an Olympic medal table). If that sounds like "don't be a dick" then I probably got the tone about right&#160;:-) Just zis Guy, you know? [T]/[C] 18:43, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If you see how much time it took for you to find one year. How much time do you think it will take to find all the other years. Oh! And whatch what your saying there JzG. I might just snap. Please assume good faith in me. I appreciate your summary of the issue. (the one at the top of this nomination, not your comments just above this comment though) I think this label (Template:Medal sources also displayed below), which you removed, sumarizes the issue verry well. One of the reason I didn't put it on every article is my laziness to put the afd on every article. Why do that when you can simply put it on the template that shows up in every article. At the end we can decide on what article are properly cited or not. &lt;grinning/light heartly&gt; You old stuburn dog. &#160;:)
<ul>
<li>I removed the template, it's linked above. You don't include templates in discussions, it screws everything up. Pat, the difficulty or otherwise of digging up individual medal tables is completely irrelevant to whether all the medal tables should be deleted as inherently unverifiable, whcih is in effect what you've asked for. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 20:32, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> One question, how the hell is the olympic metal counts "original research". Honestly this is the biggest stretch I've ever seen. Since Cyclepat may not know what original research is I'll give an exmaple. Lets say I am a medical biology student (hey what do you know I am!!) and I do a cause and effect study, for example does deodorent cause breast cancer (dont laugh, someone actually tried to claim this), and instead of publishing in a peer reviewed publication, I publish it on Wikipedia. This would then be original research, and be deleted for it. Olympic metal counts are NOT original research. I am posting this to WP:AN as well since this is WP:POINT. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Mike</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../o/n/t/User_talk%7EOnthost_6d42.html" title="User talk:Onthost">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Onthost_a9ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Onthost">C</a>)</sub> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar_of_life.svg_5f65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Star_of_life.svg/20px-Star_of_life.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar_of_life.svg_5f65.html" /></a> 20:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation. Failing to cite sources does not make an article original research, and is not grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> has made at least one other bad faith/frivolous AFD nomination in the last few hours. Finally, adding the AFD tag to the template hides the AFD notice at the bottom of the article, rather than displaying it properly. It should be removed from the template as vandalism; if the user is fool enough to want to nominate these articles for deletion, put the tags on all the articles, so they display properly and can be seen by users as required! <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 20:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What makes that anymore different then saying 2 + 2 = 4? (original research)... The lack of sources may mean this information comes from such original research (or attending the event) (Or tabulating the facts to give a result!) It makes me assume, where there is no citation, that this is an individuals recollection or a tablature from a source (Original research). However if the source is properly cited we may be able to verify this. I'm not saying this is original research... well actually I am... But It may not be. (which the odd are probably very high... I hope!)... In that case it should be easy to substantiate all these claims. Otherwise, instead of claiming I have some bone to kick, why don't you try helping out to find a source to substantiate the unverified information. &lt;walking away... back to researching&gt; Now... How many medals where from 1976 or 1980... etc... --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 20:44, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
