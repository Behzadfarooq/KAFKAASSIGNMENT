Falcon is the leading gay porn studio: it produces big budget, widely-distributed movies. It is not some backstreet operation with limited distribution.

<dd>concur that there should be concern over this type of spam about which there has been discussion. When someone goes to this length to bias a discussion by contacting others with whom there has not been prior contact just based on their edits, that is spam. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> 23:36, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because AfD's are shortlived, it is wholly appropriate for someone to give notice to possibly interested editors. I thought WP was about <b>inclusion</b>; if someone's "spam" causes an editor to put in his/her $0.02 or it's British equivalent, so freaking what. You can contact whoever you feel to give input, too, it's a free country (free world). And your suggestion that my comment and position should be discounted or devalued because I was alerted to this by another editor is frankly kinda scary. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alerting other editors with whom you have dialogued is one thing, it is quite another to alert other editors with whom you have had no contact based on their edits alone.

<dd>If people complain about spam, then someone may address it; to try to push your POV by discounting my (and anyone else who has been contacted) opinion has no basis in WP policy. Often alerts are posted on message boards for various wikiprojects about ongoing AfD's, do we stop the counting then? No. Why? because WP should want to hear everyone's opinion. If they are new or a sockpuppet they get discounted anyway. We don't care whether they are "regulars" or "lurkers". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 03:06, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Response</i>: If I have violated a policy or a guideline, please let me know where I can find it, becuase I do my best to behave according to the rules here. I have looked, and have not been able to find a Wikipedia policy against alerting other editors to an AfD. I did not try to persuade editors other than on this page to vote against the AfD.

<dd>Zeromacnoo and others: I could have explained that better. There's an objection to "spamming" about discussion of deletion/policy/candidacy here at Wikipedia, because most of our processes work on the basis of consensus/rough consensus, the idea that most editors will come to some reasonable conclusion that is obvious, given the chance. Letting a certain subclass of editors know about a particular discussion skews those results and makes the final decision by the closing admin harder to determine if it's true or false consensus. Note that I didn't say "thse editors should be ignored", because a) that'd be assuming bad faith on Zero's part, and theirs, and b) I didn't look up what the reason was he contacted them (presumably, edit history with this or related gay porn articles). I just noticed that suddenly this discussion jumped from three commenters to six or seven, and wondered why. Does that help explain my message? -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub>[[User_talk:Nae'blis|</sub></i></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Zeromacnoo's contact with other editors is no reason to close discussion. As for the topic at hand: The reason why Erik Rhodes seems to have appeared in Falcon Studios videos only is that he has an exclusive contract with Falcon. Falcon Studio (+ Jock and Mustang divisions) produces a limited number of films per year. While I may disagree with Falcon's business model of concentrating mostly on white males, the "Falcon Exclusive" is a status that Falcon grants to a very select few gay porn actors. Rhodes has such a contract and most wannabe gay porn actor would kill for such a contract. As for notability, go to the falcon website <a href="http://www.falconstudios.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.falconstudios.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. See that guy on the left? That's Erik Rhodes. Falcon, one of the world's leading gay porn studios, promotes its website by putting Rhodes on its homepage. BTW, Rhodes (before signing on with Falcon) did appear in a video produced by Studio 2000, <i>Flesh</i>, in 2004. And yes, Studio 2000 is one of Falcon's main competitor for top talent. As for the counting bean criterion for notability: it's quite off. <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Idol_8c81.html" title="Ryan Idol">Ryan Idol</a>, one of the biggest gay (for pay) porn stars ever, appeared in around ten (10) non-compilation videos from 1990 to 1996. The reason he did so few was that he thought doing so many would make him more of a has-been a lot sooner. He was right. Idol is not alone.

<li><b>Keep</b> is more notable than most gay porn stars. There is an active discussion on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28pornographic_actors%29_6c54.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (pornographic actors)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (pornographic actors)</a> about what the relevant criteria should be but he looks to meet them. This can be considered to meet criterion 8 of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> as currently written. Note that IAFD has basically no coverage of gay porn. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 18:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
