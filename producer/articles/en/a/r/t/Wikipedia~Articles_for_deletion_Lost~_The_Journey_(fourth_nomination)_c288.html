<dd>Something interesting from the article itself, "<i>On the US release of the season 1 DVD boxed set, "Lost: The Journey" was cut due to space</i>".

<li><b>Keep</b> -- ob-note: it was rewritten (by me). The article is clear as to why it is a notable episode: as an attempt by ABC to bring non-regular viewers of the serialized drama up to speed, presenting for the first time a linear re-telling of the <i>Lost</i> storyline. Further, it is particularly exceptional for a clip series, as it handily won its timeslot-- up against the original programming of every other network. Finally, it is extensively referenced beyond what is included for even "regular" <i>Lost</i> episodes. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 06:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're saying that it was notable <i>because</i> it's a clip show? That's what you just described... a clip show... "OMG, ABC just told is what happened in the last 20 episodes..

<li>Comments such as the above aren't helpful in persuading AfD respondents of your justification for listing this for deletion. Sarcasm like "OMG..." undercuts your position.

<li><i>This is no longer the same article I originally wanted deleted. It now explains why this is a significant clip show, explaining the purpose behind it, and has references.

<dd>The 3rd example you have there isn't even accurate. <a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a> says nothing about clip shows and is a page that specifically discourages episode articles. People often misunderstand the first part of that page, "<i>Wikipedia contains a large number of articles on television episodes. There is some disagreement as to whether every episode of every show "deserves" an article, which leads to a large number of AFDs for such articles. The following suggestions aim to promote the creation of high-quality articles about television shows and their episodes, which should help to reduce acrimonious AfD debates.</i>" This means that the page hopes to reduce the number of AfDs via merges and preventing episode articles, which is different from not taking existing pages to AfDs. The first example calls it a notable episode, without even explaining why. I don't doubt that you will find people who want to keep something like this, but that means nothing if there is no reasonable logic behind it. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 01:04, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <i>No</i> episode article establishes real world significance; this one at least has actual references, including the rather significant viewership it garnered -- higher than recent new episodes of <i>Lost</i>. As pointed out by the TV critic for the <i><a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Post_Dispatch_89da.html" title="St. Louis Post Dispatch">St. Louis Post Dispatch</a>', "</i>the hour-long recap is, for once, not just a cheap way to stretch out a hit show.

<li>So it's not significant that this episode was (along with the <i>Desperate Housewives</i> special) the first primetime show streamed over the Internet by the ABC network?

<li>How about we <b>merge it with <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28season_1%29.html" title="Lost (season 1)">Lost (season 1)</a></b>. I think that this article contains solid, real world information that every other Lost episode article drastically lacks, and for that reason it should be kept. Yet creating an article for one clip show will create a precedent that all clip shows are notable, which is not true at all. Therefore I think the most sound solution would be to merge the more notable prose in this article into the season overview article. <a href="../../../j/t/r/User%7EJtrost_cae9.html" title="User:Jtrost">Jtrost</a> (<sup><a href="../../../j/t/r/User_talk%7EJtrost_b6ae.html" title="User talk:Jtrost">T</a></sup> | <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtrost_6c4f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtrost">C</a></small> | <sub><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Jtrost&amp;submit=Count" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Jtrost&amp;submit=Count" rel="nofollow">#</a></span></sub>) 01:57, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree with Jtrost. This article contains some of the better content written about lost on wikipedia. Particularly in terms of the episode guides.

<li>But it's <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">trivial</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">not</a> <a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">notable</a>. Just because it's it doesn't suffer from a huge plot summary does not mean it meets all of our guidelines. You can't honestly tell me that anything in that article is of any importance. It's a <i>clip show</i>. It's not a real episode, at all. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 21:05, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The fact that there are other articles to delete is not a reason to keep this one. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 03:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>merge with <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28season_1%29.html" title="Lost (season 1)">Lost (season 1)</a></b>, because the sources and real-world discussion are valuable information to be kept and needed in other articles. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Are you saying that the <i>subject of the article</i> is non-notable, but the <i>contents of the article</i> are notable? That seems like contradictory logic to me. <a href="../../../j/t/r/User%7EJtrost_cae9.html" title="User:Jtrost">Jtrost</a> (<sup><a href="../../../j/t/r/User_talk%7EJtrost_b6ae.html" title="User talk:Jtrost">T</a></sup> | <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtrost_6c4f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtrost">C</a></small> | <sub><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Jtrost&amp;submit=Count" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Jtrost&amp;submit=Count" rel="nofollow">#</a></span></sub>) 01:11, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem isn't notability at all, it that there isn't enough non-trivial information for the article to stand on its own. Basically, the only bits of nontrivial information are the original broadcast date and the ratings from that night. Whether or not the subject is notable doesn't matter if it is impossible to provide encyclopedic coverage of the topic. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 01:59, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
