No, Virginia, not every song is worth an article. We've had a practice since 2002 at least of having articles only for songs that are truly outstandingly remarkable. Being a #1 hit is one criterion. Being a song that influenced everyone else (e.g. "Great Gig in the Sky" wasn't a #1 hit of any sort, but everyone knows it, and musicians have been darkly envious and wistful about imitating it since) is another. The Beatles are huge, but that doesn't mean that "Doctor Robert" or "And Your Bird Can Sing" would be worth an article.

Answering previous question: The policy about Beatles songs should be similar to that of Beethoven or Mozart, given their massive and undeniable contribution to the history of music. If there's no problem with <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_Quartet_No._5_%28Beethoven%29_8667.html" title="String Quartet No. 5 (Beethoven)">String Quartet No. 5 (Beethoven)</a> being included in Wikipedia, then the same courtesy can and should be extended to most Beatles songs.

They have been merged. All three of them. Hunger, Pain &amp; Betrayal as one. 50% plus have agreed to this, so i went through with it and merged the articles. I did not know there was a different policy in place for merging articles than deleting articles. It is done now.</p>

<li>Um, no one at all agreed to what you just did. Nor does it appear that your merging is done. The present article doesn't even explain why the three of them have been put together in one article, nor are the "lordly" epithets you've added even explained. All you've done is cut and paste the three complete, independent articles into one under what appears to be a wholly arbitrary and unsearchable title ("The Three Dark Lords of the Sith ~ Hunger, Pain &amp; Betrayal").

<li>I think the anon user's motives are suspect, considering how listing Star Wars characters for deletion is all that he does on here, but nonetheless this should probably be merged into both the article on the game and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Sith_characters_c6e5.html" title="List of minor Sith characters">List of minor Sith characters</a>, and redirected to the latter. It's a character in <i>one</i> video game; until it appears in more <i>Star Wars</i> media (or more pervasive media like a cartoon or movie), it's a minor character. That the game gave this character voluminous backstory doesn't make it more notable, and the article doesn't even establish how important this character is to the game—what role does he play in what the player experiences? Someone should rewrite the content so that it's actually from the perspective that this is a video game character, and that every portrayal of him is derived from that game. Any unfamiliar reader will have no idea how this character is encountered by the game player or how his "biography" is revealed to the player in the context of the game. Articles should not be written as if this encyclopedia existed in the Star Wars universe, and simply adding the fact that he's a fictional Star Wars character isn't enough. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:36, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Good God, those are some long articles. I'm shocked a game player has time to actually accomplish anything in the game if he's spending so much time reading backstory. Right now, <i>none</i> of those articles are written with the proper presentation and context appropriate to a video game character—<b>what do they actually do <i>in the game</i></b>? Does the player actually encounter these characters, or just learn about them? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 08:52, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>It explains their actions in the game quite well, actually. It just doesn't always say "this is what happens in the game at this point," because frankly, that would read more like a strategy guide than an encyclopedia. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they couldn't stand to have a little user interaction detailed in their articles, but to say that because it isn't written correctly by some people's standards then the knowledge it imparts should be limited, isn't doing it, or Wikipedia justice. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 16:55, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article is entirely written as if Sion's story is an absolute narrative that a player passively observes and cannot affect. "He would later duel with the Exile on Korriban, and defeat him, but the Exile would escape." I only learned from reading <i>another</i> article (<i>not</i> this one) that the "Exile" is the <i>player character</i>. So does the quoted sentence mean that the player has no choice but to duel with Sion on Korriban and will inevitably escape no matter what he does? It doesn't say "if the player survives past level 3..." or "if the player decides to go to Korriban, he will be attacked by..." And does that sentence mean that the player is incapable of defeating him, no matter what? Why? It doesn't say "the game designers made Sion impossible to defeat," it just states that the player is defeated. For all a reader of the article knows, it's just because no one who wrote the article was good enough to defeat Sion at that point in the game. Yet somehow the player is destined to escape; does Sion always refrain from delivering a fatal blow? What if the player decides to remain there until one of them dies? Is the player swept away to safety against his will? The entire article is written like this ("the Exile was forced to use his powers of persuasion to turn Sion against his own beliefs"), without any acknowledgement that a real human player <i>interacts</i> with this character and becomes involved with the story, which is instead described as if it were merely a self-contained narrative. The entire article is nonencyclopedic fancruft writing, written simply to satisfy fans who want to know the complete fictional history of the fictional <i>Star Wars</i> universe, rather than to portray facts about how a fictional character was created, how the fictional work portrays him and his relationship to it, how he is experienced/encountered by the consumer/audience, and what that audience thinks about him. The article needs more than just a couple style tweaks; it needs a complete rewrite. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 18:22, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes. The player has no choice on Korriban. He must duel, and must lose.</li>
<li>He must go to Korriban, or never finish the game. Needless to say, it is stupid to preface every statement with "And if the player decides to keep playing and completing the game, he will..."</li>
<li>Yes. Sion always refrains from a fatal blow. No dialogue option will cause Sion to kill the Exile on Korriban, as part of the story, for obvious out-of-game reasons. The ingame player is not swept away against his will, but the player outside of the game is, as the Exile escapes in a cinema with no dialogue options which will change anything.</li>
<li>You don't seem to understand, Post. The article describes what is canonical. The canon rules for SW state that plot events for games are canon, branching plots have one specific unique singular end-branch which is canonical, and that's <i>it</i>. The minutiae of the actual game implementation are not canon- including game mechanics and possible plots like you endlessly harp upon. Sion does not need a "Rewrite", it needs expansion. Go ahead, add audience reaction, go ask the producers who wrote in Sion, what were they thinking, what early versions of Sion were there, and how did they differ, etc. But don't call the article unencyclopedic (or, if you do, then go start several thousand vfds to cleanse Wikipedia of all SW 'fancruft'), or use fictional as an epithet. It incorporates what is available, sourceable and reliable. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> 19:08, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That should be described and explained.</li>
<li>It should at least be prefaced by "When the player makes it to Korriban;" otherwise, it sounds like a player has no volition over that outcome.</li>
<li>This should be described and explained, and the parts of the game that the player in fact passively watches ("the Exile escapes in a cinema") should be distinctly separated from the parts that the player actively participates in. And what the player actually <i>sees</i> should be separated from that which he is merely <i>told about.</i></li>
<li>What you don't understand is this is not the Official Canon Encyclopedia of Star Wars. The article needs a rewrite because it just relates a story abstracted from the source from which it is derived, without any sense of how the media actually constructed the story. And yes, there <i>are</i> a lot of Star Wars articles that need similarly serious cleanup. This particular article should focus on describing what the player sees him do in the game, what he does to the player, what the player does to him, and what the player is told about him and how. Considering how he's a bloody video game character, one would think that these would be the most fundamental things to set forth. Then a <i>separate</i> section on how this portrayal of the character fits into Star Wars canon may be appropriate, but that certainly shouldn't be the overriding perspective. No, "fictional" is not an epithet; I've written quite a few articles about fictional subjects myself. But the article should not itself become fiction; it should write <i>about</i> fiction by describing <i>works</i> of fiction, and write about subjects of fiction by describing exactly <i>how</i> the works portray them. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 06:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>He did make a claim to notability, and a very impressive claim at that. His notability is such that I had heard of him before seeing this article, and there is very little dispute that the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAMO_88e0.html" title="USAMO">USAMO</a> is the most prestigious American high school math competition. However, I wouldn't call its fame widespread (I get questioned all the time when I wear my "I survived the USAMO" t-shirt, usually by people wanting to know what the USAMO is, immediately followed by people wanting to know why I would ever wear such a shirt). So I don't think that placing top 12 once is enough to establish the level of notability required for a Wikipedia article. Maybe four times is enough, like Tiankai Liu or <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reid_Barton_a4e5.html" title="Reid Barton">Reid Barton</a>. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a><a href="../../../a/e/r/User_talk%7EAerion_8e19.html" title="User talk:Aerion">//talk</a> 15:19, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless someone can demonstrate that this album was noticed by anyone of any importance. Given the technology available nowadays, you can produce an album in your back room, so merely having something available as an album isn't notable. A google search reveals that this 'Horizon Recordings' was set up by the artist himself - so his own album, 'recording studio' and record label. I wonder if the creator of these articles left off this fact deliberately?

<li>Android79: katakana is used for emphasis and onomatopoeic sounds, not just for foreign names. The (e.g. your name) is discriminatory and inaccurate: if you are japanese, your name is most likely not written in katakana, and wikipedia should be written for all. And kanji represent ideas; Kanji, either alone or in groups, form entire words.

<p>Please excuse my previous statements- I understand that you are doing the best that you can to adhere to the standards that Wikipedia has set. I also know that this project would be a massive mess of abstract data if those policies were not in place, and strictly enforced.</p>
<p>What I believe should be taken into consideration though, is that the Internet does not record enough information that is due a notable status. My uncle (Herbert Wilkins) is clearly notable. But because of his low profile, and insider status, not much has been released in "publicity" structure.</p>
<p>My reasons for initiating inclusions to Wikipedia are simply to create an "educational presence" for members of my family that have not been noted by other "educational" mediums. My background is also "notable" in that I have had special relationships with historical figures in the finance and music industries.</p>
<p>My personal intention is to administer to this information, and help with the massive linking work that is associated with it. What I am asking is the time to do so, and an open perspective to what is deemed as notable, and historical. William H. Wilkins III- 07.22.05- 1:24 pm/est historical. William H. Wilkins III- 07.22.05- 1:24 pm/est</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any proof of this company's holdings being notable or famous? The founders? The current owner? Wikipedia is not for creating a presence, on;ly reporting on existing presences. The fact the that you claim to have "special relationships" with "historical figures" doesn't help. names might.</li>

<li>The original issue was that, to the original poster, the article appeared to be an original work of fiction. Some further research indicated that the article is in fact a <i>very</i> detailed plot summary of a published work. While plot summaries are nice (although they should be tagged with spoiler warnings), there is a limit to how much detail is really necessary. Those editors who have voted for a "<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html#Smerge" title="User:R. fiend">smerge</a>" or something similar are those who feel that the level of detail you have given is somewhat excessive. ...

<li>No you are incorrect. That is 184 PAGES. <i>Page 19 of 184 results containing "kristopher kubicki" (0.13 seconds)</i> 144.118.196.165 20:14, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that's the case, then where's the link to get to the other 165 pages of results? This is just like getting to the end of the line on Google's search. Microsoft merely phrases this bit of info on its search page awkwardly. <i>There are 184 results.</i> 18 pages of 10 results each plus 1 page of 4 results equals 184. If there <i>were</i> 184 pages of results, that would indicate that there are around 1,840 results, not 2,235.

The external links do not serve as references for this term — they instead all point at ways to get around a "paranoid administrator". Full disclosure: I am a professional system administrator and would consider the tactics mentioned in the article "amateurish", not "paranoid". N.B.: this might be a case of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBite_4d6a.html" title="WP:Bite">WP:Bite</a>; this appears to be the first substantive edit by Bob2000 (<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob2000_43a2.html" title="User talk:Bob2000">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bob2000_c4fe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bob2000">contribs</a>).</p>

<p>Well, please hastily proceed to deletion then! But this is a case of the <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBite_4d6a.html" title="WP:Bite">bites</a> indeed. I did look up and read lengthy instructions on what not to post before deciding to put this definition, and found no trace of "original research" as a no-no. Prior to submitting a new article, there isn't much warning about that except on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. May I suggest that "soapbox" is not a well-understood term in the meaning with which it is used?</p>
<p>I agree with the original research label, but not with the POV label. As a professional computer &amp; networking security expert, it appears to me that the patterns described in the article are certainly <i>well-spread</i> and <i>based on observation</i>--even if "paranoid" may not exactly be the right term to sum it up. I grant you that this article is far from perfect, but professional systems administrators like you would certainly have been able to amend it. I think there is room for a consensus to build around this concept.</p>
<p>While I understand and respect that Wikipedia's opinion is different on this matter, for me an enclopedia's role, as was the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A9die.html" title="Encyclopédie">Encyclopédie</a>, is not only to bring consensual knowledge, but also to publish original works of reason. I'm a bit disappointed.</p>

<dd>I think you've hit on one of the exact problems that led to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I think it's POV. You don't. But you coined the term the article is about, so how can anyone but you make the call? Maybe giving you control of the article's content is an okay situation — until you go away for awhile, and then the article goes stale, or somebody <i>else</i> comes along and claims that <i>they</i> invented the term "paranoid administrator" and <i>they</i> know what it means.... Please don't take this personally: if others can't do the same research you can, then it's not something that can make a Wikipedia article. Perhaps someone can point you at a wiki for original works. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyHarris_636a.html" title="User:TreyHarris">TreyHarris</a> 16:46, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>keep There is no "widespread" support for AJAX either in the scope of the industry. AJAX was coined by Garrett for himself, so that invalidates your second argument. This is not simply "my" view, this is a view that has been expressed by many in the industry. JAXASS has been created out of the animosity of those supporters for REAL innovation with this technology instead of simply renaming the former technology something else. The current JAXASS call for opinions describes client-side support for standard messaging and WSE-n. I did create my own account and haven't posted anonymously. Just because you don't like this idea, or you have some affinity for AJAX doesn't mean that you should be able to squash information about opposing technologies. Your affinity to AJAX is proved by your own blog title "ASP, XML, AJAX, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, DOM. Marketing. 24SevenOffice", and several blog posts: <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/04/c-wrapper-for-ajax.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/04/c-wrapper-for-ajax.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/04/free-ajax-based-crm-invoice-system.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/04/free-ajax-based-crm-invoice-system.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/01/web-applications-in-2005-case-study.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/01/web-applications-in-2005-case-study.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005_03_01_sleepyhead81_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005_03_01_sleepyhead81_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/05/xmlhttprequest-and-domdocument-cross.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/05/xmlhttprequest-and-domdocument-cross.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/05/dhtml-spell-checker.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/05/dhtml-spell-checker.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, and the list goes on: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ajax&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sitesearch=sleepyhead81.blogspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ajax&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sitesearch=sleepyhead81.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> Your opinion on this matter doesn't qualify you to make decisions on what opposing technologies are allowed to exist in wikipedia, and which do not.

<li>So if I am against Ajax and make up a new acronym on my blog it should be added to wikipedia? That is the key argument here. If JAXASS is added then every guy can coine these little acronyms and theories and have them added to Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not unless it culminates into a real technology. I have three very influential Microsoft MVP's who have joined me in creating the initial call for opinions on JAXASS to replace AJAX. The difference between simply coming up with an acronym and coming up with an acronym for a competing technology is completely different. In the same line of argument, if I'm against Ruby, and I can make the argument that it doesn't have widespread support, should I just go around making calls for deletion of any wikipedia article discussing Ruby? There was no widespread support for the Betamax videocassette, but you can find information about it on Wikipedia, and its a product none the less. This is not the forum for you to voice your opinion on a technology by deleting every bit of information you find on it. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a></li>

<li>Wikipedia is not a vehicle for breaking news or for dissemination of emerging new truths. It is not Wired's "memes on the rise" section. It is an encyclopedia. As such, it a vehicle for presenting generally accepted facts. Articles on controversial or disputed topics are accepted <i>when there is a substantial body of people that accept them.</i> We would <b>not</b> have accepted an article on the Copernican world system <b>when it was first proposed.</b> Only when it became clear that there was <b>widespread belief in</b> the Copernican world system, then the existence of this belief would <b>then</b> be an encyclopedic fact, to be reported neutrally along with the more-accepted Ptolemaic system.

<li><b>comment</b> While I don't purport JAXASS to be a meme on the rise, I would point out that your argument falls flat when comparing against other topics such as <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crazy_Frog_305d.html" title="Crazy Frog">Crazy Frog</a>. Someone else also pointed out that <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> has its own topic. This is far from receiving <i>widespread belief</i>. Alternatively, I point you to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Davidian_0995.html" title="Branch Davidian">Branch Davidian</a> which has no widespread beliefs, but still retains its status in wikipedia. Instead, it has a warning stating that its neutrality is disputed. This seems to lean much more toward a neutral point of view than to simply delete the topic based on the bias of several AJAX-zealots and sockpuppets who were asked to defend AJAX against the competing specification presented with JAXASS. Your insistence on what is immodest is a matter of opinion. JAXASS is not an emerging truth as the technologies surrounding JAXASS have been available since 1998. If you consider a 7-year old technology to be emerging, you are mistaken.</li>

<li><b>comment</b>I understand the apprehension at the existence of this topic in the encyclopedia. Several arguments revolve around the technology being vaporware or in its infancy. Those issues have been addressed by pointing out other vaporware topics listed in wikipedia. Others have argued that the idea isn't widespread enough to exist in the online encyclopedia. I argue once again that other projects such as <a href="../../../j/a/v/JavaOS_59dc.html" title="JavaOS">JavaOS</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singularity_%28operating_system%29.html" title="Singularity (operating system)">Singularity (operating_system)</a> exist on Wikipedia that aren't widespread because it doesn't exist. One could argue that while JavaOS is vaporware, the Java language is not. Or that while the C# operating system doesn't exist, it's technological foundations do. Is that not the case with JAXASS? The technical foundations exist, but the concept is still being developed -- just as many other wikipedia-listed topics are. This topic is being hotly contested, in my opinion by a COS (call-for-sockpuppets). Its also being slightly contested because its a direct competitor of AJAX which is obviously well-liked by those of you voting for deletion. While I can sympathize with your plight, the widespread propaganda flair-up of one technology does not negate the need for clarification of another.</li>

</dd>
<dd>How can you suggest comprehensive coverage without inclusion of terms so consequential to the industry. 50 years from now, when someone looks back at wikipedia, how can they get the full picture without inclusion of this term?</dd>
<dd>Alternatively, lets define encyclopedic from the very system we are debating on:
<dl>
<dd><i>Encyclopedia</i> - An encyclopedia (alternatively encyclopaedia/encyclopædia) is a written [compendium] of [knowledge].</dd>
<dd><i>compendium</i> - A compendium is a comprehensive compilation of a body of knowledge. A compendium usually contains principal heads, or general principles, of a larger work or system.</dd>
<dd><i>knowledge</i> - Knowledge is the awareness and understanding of facts, truths or information gained in the form of experience or learning (a posteriori), or through introspection (a priori). Knowledge is an appreciation of the possession of interconnected details which, in isolation, are of lesser value.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Based on this, your own definition of encyclopedia claims to be comprehensive - containing the full body of knowledge. And by knowledge, we are to include something such as JAXASS, which, in isolation is of lesser value <i>in <b>your</b> opinion</i>.</dd>
<dd>This is no different than the work of [Galileo]. This is a hotly contested and widely controversial topic. Many refuse to have it published as it goes against the core of what you believe in -- despite having truth and backhand support from many true technological intellectuals. And now you hold a 5-day inquisition where I'm forced to try to defend myself simply because I published a truth that you don't care to hear. As cardinals in the inquisition, you would have been threatening [Galileo] with torture until he begged for forgiveness and recanted his findings.</dd>
<dd>You state this isn't <i>encyclopedic</i>, but I say wikipedia isn't encyclopedic without [JAXASS] as a topic that will continue to expand in the next few months and years to come.</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> And the fact that AJAX was defined a month after being posted on a blog, and before widespread adoption of the word was in place doesn't bother you? There was no hot contestation of that term as it was placed on wikipedia. The original idea wasn't posted on wikipedia. The original idea was conceived locally between several technology professionals, manifested on my blog, and only then brought to the forefront in [wikipedia]. I'm not proposing a new solution here, the solution is already proposed on my blog. This topic is here, just as any other piece of knowledge, to make wikipedia comprehensive.

Anyone can be sued for anything. That's both a good and bad concept of many legal systems. I could sue wikipedia for censorship and harrasment based on this very topic, and I believe many of the points I've made give those charges good grounding. I wont do it. I'd prefer to just show how assinine many of you are by proving you wrong over the next few months. Based on that, sure, I could be sued too, but that doesn't give it grounds and that isn't a reason for deletion from wikipedia.

<li><b>comment</b> If I'm trollbait, how come I reeled YOU in, considering how you read way too much into my posts. I don't think you should be sued, but I think you are unnecessarily putting yourself into a position where you could be. Your accusation of sock puppeteering is hard to support, considering I haven't used an alternate identity to vote twice on this page: rather, it is to protect myself against possible reprisal by you. You've never threatened such agaisnt anybody, but you seem that unstable to me. On the other hand, your accusation of page vandalism is entirely baseless but not entirely unexpected, and, in my opinion, is yet something else to consider when wikipedia considers not only removing your inane article, but also banning you, which may well follow. Friendly advice dude: you are NOT going to win.
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Fair enough. I wish you luck, but if I "don't win", neither does the community that won't be able to find information out about JAXASS from wikipedia. In that aspect, you are right, I don't win, and neither does anyone else if this topic is deleted.</li>

<li><b>comment</b>. Wikipedia may not be a democracy, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_Votes_for_deletion#Discussion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_Votes_for_deletion#Discussion" rel="nofollow">"The votes are a means to gauge consensus"</a>, and the consensus is indisputably and overwhelmingly for deletion. Especially considering that you are incorrect in asserting that "all issues....have been addressed". For instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV" rel="nofollow">"NPOV is absolute and non-negotiable"</a>. In order to assure a neutral point of view, in my opinion you would have to significantly rewrite the article. Bear in mind, this just seems to be the one objection you haven't attempted to refute. You've addressed most of the other objections, but obviously not to anybody's satisfaction but your own. I don't even think you'd find consensus for a rewrite, but that might be one compromise approach you could pursue.
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b>. This from the same guy who vandalized the page and then tried to put it back as he found it? A neutral point of view is definitely possible with this topic should we start discussing the changes rather than deleting information simply because you like another technology better. I said it before (see below) and I'll say it again, I'm willing to come up with a neutral solution that better suits the needs of those around, but I'm not willing to concede that deletion is the appropriate response to this topic. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b>. NPOV has to do with articles themselves. You don't like what I have to say, so you attack me. It's a microcosm of your whole JAXASS concept. Can we expect a Wikipedia article from you about every single thing you dislike? Where does it stop?
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I haven't attacked anyone or what they have to say. This article isn't JUST about my not liking <a href="../../../a/j/a/AJAX_a34a.html" title="AJAX">AJAX</a>. The fact that this is how the technology started was important to the article about the technology so I included it. Due to criticism from this procedure, I've parred that aspect of the technology down on the page. And, no, I don't expect you to see an article about everyone's opinion -- that's what blogs and rant pages are for. However, when that criticism becomes a competing technology, it is noteworthy. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> To me it seems like you are trying real hard to seem reasonable and say the right things, but your actions contradict your words. Your tendency for insisting on having the last word, for instance, to me indicates that you will not be able to adhere to NPOV, try as you might.
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I make no appologies for defending the topic, nor for stating what needs to be said when false accusations are made. If that requires me to respond to every comment provided in this delete request, so be it.--<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Case in point. Nobody's making "accusations". This, and your sweeping characterization of same as "false" continue to demonstrate your seeming inability to adopt NPOV
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> The very nature of attaching possessive pronouns to negative connotation with myself, rather than the article, acting as the anticedent is accusatory by its very definition. If you believed otherwise, your second observation in the foregoing comment would not have been necessary. I have no objection to the accusations provided they are accompanied with outright claim and admittance so long as my recriminations are also indulged. Backhanded aggression doesn't help your argument, however. You continue to make my point that this process, at least for this topic, is close if not spot-on absurd. I can defend the merrits of the topic all day, but remarks such as, "to me indicates that you will not be able to adhere to NPOV" continue to lean towards clarvoyance which is definitely out of my area of expertise. If we could get this discussion away from your psychological assessments about my future behavior, and back to the topic at hand, I think you'll find that I'm extremely reasonable with regard to how the article is prsented. I've already made some modification based on comments here. While I can promise nothing about personality disorders you attribute to me, I will be more than happy to continue the pattern of effective and constructive modification in regards to the article. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a></li>

<li><b>comment</b> Which if your ever-so astute mind would pay attention, I speedily removed. If you look at the talk page for JAXASS, you'll see why. You continue to be wrong and grasp at straws. You've reverted to playing a guess-who's-who game rather than debate your ideas for deleting this topic. You still fail to make a valid point. I would also point out that before I even started this topic on wikipedia, I looked up <a href="../../../a/j/a/AJAX_a34a.html" title="AJAX">AJAX</a> and saw someone placed an external link to my blog before I decided to post my own article about the topic. While I didn't add that blog post to the links section initially, I later returned and modified this entry so it looked cleaner. If you'll note in the AJAX history since my AJAX=FRAUD blog came out, there have been several posts to that page that made the same argument I did. Such as "ajax is not a new approach"-[User:12.33.211.29], "what this link said" -[User:219.95.215.178], "Definitelly not new to us, we have used in various interactive tasks including server-push (experimental implementation of publisher subscribe)." - [User:63.166.226.84], etc. I suppose you would attribute all of those to me as well. But once again, you'd be wrong. I find it funny that you are even acting in this capacity to ask that a topic be deleted when you have overzealously used Wikipedia as your own advertising platform -- adding links to 247 office everywhere that you possibly could. Wikipedia is not your personal opportunity to put up ads for your company. <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a> 00:16, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> The article needs a <b>lot</b> of work, but it should exist. Mark it with a "Current Events" tag. Edit it yourself if you feel that a biased POV is being introduced. Perhaps this article and other articles like AJAX need to be merged into an article about the ongoing development of this sort of software (I don't know what term to use, and I don't care, because VFD pages are about the merits of the article as an encyclopia entry, <b>not</b> the viability of the subject matter of the article). If we delete this article, what happens when a user out there in the world comes to Wikipedia looking for information on this topic, which he or she encountered in some other context? Users are developing a reasonable expectation of finding reliable information about a wide range of topics here. When no article exists for a topic, they end up disappointed. We should seek not to disappoint. I say keep this article, but bring it up to standard. Deleting is so permanent. If you wonder what my credentials are to support this opinion, I have a BA in History and am an U.S. Army officer engaged in the defense of freedom (location immaterial) that makes it possible for projects like Wikipedia to exist. I would like to see some of the <b>delete</b> proponents state their bona fides so that we can evaluate how much weight to give their opinion on this structure-of-the-Wikipedia discussion (as compared to the propensity to discuss the relative merits of JAXASS, JAVA, et.al.).

In the spirit of NPOV, I'll keep my comment down here although I highly disagree with your agressive edits.

<li><b>Delete</b> I feel I need to explain the structure of English cricket. At the top level, there is the County Championship. This is equivilent to the Premiership. There are 18 counties. In addition, there is a minor counties championship, perhaps equivilent to football's lower professional leagues. Very few players in minor counties cricket are professional. Then, below that, is league cricket. These are Saturday afternoon cricketers. This is where Stockport is. Now, there is no promotion between these levels. Therefore, Stockport cricket club can <i>never</i> become any more notable than they are today. I understand that the previous keep was on account of people not really understanding <i>quite</i> how insignificant this club is... <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">smoddy</a> 13:05, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was not under the impression that Wikipedia as a whole used any specific "approach to writing articles". Nor do I believe that arguments such as "there are more notable things without articles" is a valid reason to delete any article.

<li>Tony has pointed out the verifiability of such clubs. It is trivial to make the articles NPOV. Uppland has noted that the clubs typically have a great deal of longevity, including the one in question. If those qualities are not enough to create an assumption of noteworthiness that must be overcome in order for me to agree with deletion, I don't know what qualities would be. Also, if people went through and re-nominated every article that finished VfD as "no consensus" (or worse, <i>deleted the article anyway</i> as you did with this one), VfD would be an even more aggravating place to spend time than it is now. I hope you're not really suggesting that articles be nominated time after time until they reach consensus. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 23:35, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, about half-notable clubs. This article can never be verified, because no sources exist. The club will never become even remotely notable. This isn't just a "lower division" club.

<li>Indeed it does appear to be in Cheshire rather than Lancs. However I count about 56 clubs in Chesh. plus 12 unafilliated clubs. There are 53 traditional counties in England and Wales, so we're saying that you've just requested about 3000 rather mundane and difficult to verify articles, whilst bearing in mind that <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire_County_Cricket_Club_814a.html" title="Cheshire County Cricket Club">Cheshire County Cricket Club</a> itself doesn't have one yet. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 20:47, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Although I have edited this article, and although nearly all the edits made have been in good faith, I am of the opinion that it cannot be upgraded to a good-quality article. Specifically, this article has the following inherent problems.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a collection of lists</a>: This is, perforce, a list, and can never be made much else. The list can never be exhaustive, nor really more than randomly selective.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>: To the extent that this topic is notable, it should contain instances of first or notable use and/or other information suitable to a dictionary.</p>
<p>Information should be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a>: nearly all the information in these lists (my edtis included) are unsourced. To the extent that the information can be verified from common experience, it is not <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotable_b7f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Notable">notable</a>.</p>
<p>A huge number of the entries have been, and remain a <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">soapbox</a>, causing <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">POV</a> problems.

<p>Accordingly, I believe that deletion is the best solution, but I would be happy to be proven wrong and see a proposal for turning this into an encyclopedic article or an appropriate <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transwiki.html" title="Transwiki">transwiki</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A West</a> 14:33, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Graham wrote two books on the programming language Lisp and created a store (in lisp) which he subsequently sold to Yahoo! (I believe they then switched to another application written in C, giving the reason that they couldn't find enough experienced Lisp programmers, but I'm unable to find references). He writes rants, but nobody in the industry or academia seems to take take them seriously (Lisp, or rather Scheme, is usually used only to teach programming. Most of the research is done with typed functional languages like ML and Haskell, and most of the "real work" is done with established imperative languages). He says that he will create a language called Arc and it will be the best thing ever, but he has yet to produce anything.</dd>

<p>There does not appear to be a notable concept by this name, as far as I can gather. The term is used a few times on pages indexed by Google, but they nearly all mean a different thing to what is described here. The only place is <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/artsandhumanities/story/0,12241,1360185,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/artsandhumanities/story/0,12241,1360185,00.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, but I would suggest their assertion that "a decryption matrix [is] a common device in codebreaking" is an error. There would seem to be no evidence of this concept outside that page, and I've never come across it in the literature. There was a previous VfD to keep, but that was based on the belief that this was a genuine concept, which would appear not to be the case. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 16:01, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I stopped at the local tech bookstore and abused their resources in order to peruse the most authoritative books I could find. I'd already leafed through <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Schneier_5bb3.html" title="Bruce Schneier">Applied Cryptography</a> at work, of course, but it doesn't deal with attacks against crypto except from the standpoint of assuring the security of a given algorithm. So, I paged through 4 or 5 of the books that were more of the accademic sort and less of the "teach yourself how to use a crypto library in 10 seconds". I'm crypto-savvy, but no expert, so it's possble that I missed something, but I found no references in the index or ToC to this term. I paged through the sections that looked most promissing in one or two of the texts as well. Unless someone can come up with a sound definition that actually parses well, I'm all for deleting. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 21:25, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s>Keep and cleanup</s>. The definition is wrong (a matrix of the form described is sometimes used in cryptanalysis but this is not termed the decryption matrix). However this is a real term used in decryption, specifically with respect to the <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hill_cipher.html" title="Hill cipher">Hill cipher</a>, a family of cryptographic algorithms based on invertible matrices.

<li>Yes, you would normally use the term "decryption matrix" in the context of the Hill cipher, but that's not what this article is discussing at all. You could, I suppose, write a new article from scratch that defines a decryption matrix with respect to the Hill cipher, but it's not a particularly special or separate concept from the Hill cipher itself, and wouldn't ever be much of an article. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 18:10, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete,</b> the definition is entirely bogus.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I am a conlanger and support efforts to make conlanging more widely known, Wikipedia is not the place for this content. Instead, individual conlangs should be documented in personal sites and linked to from Wikipedia. (I also assert that articles such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scream_bf00.html" title="The Scream">The Scream</a> should be combined with the articles related to their creators, unless the artist in question is sufficiently prolific to make it difficult to find information in that format.)</li>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scream_bf00.html" title="The Scream">The Scream</a> is a prime example of why we shouldn't combine them with the author; you don't need to know who painted <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scream_bf00.html" title="The Scream">The Scream</a> to be familiar with the painting, and there are many reinterpretations of the painting that stand independent of the original artist.

<dd>I still think that the article is OK here, as it only shows a summary of the summary of the summary of the Grammar of Aingeljã. Anyone who finds it interesting can learn more at the official website. However, in order to guarantee that it isn't deleted, I can rewrite the contents of the article, if the majority of Wikipedians votes so. But I think that, as far as this conlang exists today and anybody can study it or read about it somewhere else, there's no reason to delete it here. I'm an enthusiastic Wikipedian user and I'd be completely disappointed with Wikipedia if this article, and those about other artistic conlangs, were deleted. Don't get confused about an <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_auxiliary_language.html" title="International auxiliary language">auxilanguage</a> like <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>, which tries to help the communication between people, and an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_languages.html" title="Artistic languages">artlang</a>, which is a personal work of art, modest and humble after all.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. As a conlanger, and much as I would like to make public the art of conlanging to the greatest extent possible, I really don't see the need for grammatical treatises and descriptions of individual conlangs here on the Wikipedia.</s> There is already a good Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">Artistic language</a>, which should serve as a central locus for this particular art form. Though I disagree with the terminology "professional" v. "amateur" (I really don't think Syldavian counts as a professional conlang, as it's merely part of a corpus of literature), there is quite a long list of conlangs there. I think it vèry meet and right for conlangers to link to their own pages or to some other conlang oriented source, if they wish to do so. I wouldn't create a Wikipedia article for any of my conlangs, and if I found one, I'ld delete it for the reasons stated. -- Specific to the query below, "I really don't understand why you don't like my article about Aingeljã" I don't think the problem has to do with style or contents of the article itself. The problem is that the Wikipedia isn't the appropriate location for the article. A conlang related Wiki would be more appropriate, and that article could easily by linked to from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">Artistic language</a>.

<dd>As pieces of art, they deserve articles in the same situation as any other pieces of art. There's no reason to not include an article just because it's a conlang. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 21:53, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm certainly not against this in principle. My position isn't really that this conlang or that does not <b>deserve</b> an article, the question is really whether it <b>warrants</b> an article. Wikipedia describes itself as striving to offer the internet public what they could otherwise get in a paper encyclopedia but is also kept up to the minute. Generally speaking, authoritative encyclopedias don't cover fictional worlds and similar works of art (unless they are famous). It can (and should) certainly cover the art of conlanging or conculturing; I think it's quite sufficient, given the purpose and scope of the project, to link to an external article about a conlang or conculture. Elemtilas
<dl>
<dd>But that's a lousy description of what Wikipedia is. Wikipedia offers the public a depth and richness that no paper encyclopedia reaches. <a href="../../../k/r/y/Krypto.html" title="Krypto">Krypto</a> is an article that no general paper encyclopedia could afford to spend the paper on, but that doesn't mean it should be deleted. We have the space and the power to be far more comprehensive than a paper encyclopedia and we historically have been far more comprehensive than a paper encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 21:21, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Lousy as that description may be, it is condensed from the article <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>!

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> -- having found and read the deletion policies, I have to reconsider my opinion. I still don't think most conlangs warrant individual articles, but they are works of art and as such should not necessarily be removed simply because some people don't get the artform or can't think of anything better than personal attacks against the artists that create languages. Anyone who wants to create such an article on a conlang should be responsible enough to really consider whether this piece of artwork warrants an individual and unique article of its own. If possible, this article should be merged with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_languages.html" title="Constructed languages">Constructed languages</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_languages.html" title="Artistic languages">Artistic languages</a>.

<p>I listed a couple of the pages individually but I don't have the time or inclination to do them all. This sort of sub-listing of yearly events is totally unnecessary, especially considering the fact that a very small number of 'events' are actually listed. I would recommend of the deletion of this list and, at the very list, a redirect of all of the 'years in archaeology' articles to the article of the corresponding year. For example <a href="../../../1/7/0/1707_in_archaeology.html" title="1707 in archaeology">1707 in archaeology</a> could be redirected to <a href="../../../1/7/0/1707.html" title="1707">1707</a>. -<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 21:36, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I remember when we had many such stubby and redlink heavy "years in" articles, many of which have grown considerably., but apparently we havn't had many editors interested in the history of archaeology yet. It's a valid topic with much room for expansion. If it is decided to delete this, I strongly reccomend consolodating the existing information somewhere, perhaps into an article entitled "Chronology of archaeology" or something similar, and then <b>redirect</b> existing articles there. If no one cares to consolodate, I'd say leaving our current stublets is mostly harmless. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 18:11, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Treating archaeology as solely a science is to open a big old taxonomic can of worms and merging it with those articles would not be acceptable to me. The field does not entirely constitute a true science as, for example, experiments/excavtions are not reproducable, once a site has been dug and interpreted it can't be re-dug and re-interpreted by someone else. Expanding <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_years_in_archaeology.html" title="List of years in archaeology">List of years in archaeology</a> would be a demanding task but it could happen slowly if those of us who are writing archaeology articles remember to copy paste paras into the relevant year article. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 10:36, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>strong Keep</b>. Merging isn't sensible: archaeology isn't science. Why not have this article?

Whyever delete it just because there aren't many events in it yet? A valid topic with room to expand indeed. Where else would one find a list of archaeological events of 1952? Give me a week or so and I'll dig out an archaeology journal from the 1950s and expand the article. If we do merge, and people like me add tons of stuff to it, someone will suggest splitting again.

<p><b>Delete</b> Cathedral City is a brand name for a cheddar cheese, see <a href="http://www.dairycrest.co.uk/opb/cheese/cathedralcity.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.dairycrest.co.uk/opb/cheese/cathedralcity.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.dairycrest.co.uk/opb/cheese/cathedralcity.shtml</a></p>
<p>Despite its manufacturer's hype, there are many many brands of cheddar, and this particular brand has no particular reason to be included and described as a "type" of cheese. Its not. If there was more content on this page, or some prospect of there being so, it might be a more reasonable entry.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 20:06, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is Mark Joyner, the topic of this entry. Allow me to comment on a few things. 1. Mr. Johnson, I'm flattered and appreciative of your support. If you could provide a link to your site or some other way of identifying yourself it might be helpful to folks who are suspicious that you may be me posting under a pseudonym for the purpose of self-promotion. 2. Amazon best-sellers. First, whether or not I wrote a book that was a #1 best-seller may not be the best gauge of the worthiness of my entry here. Next, the number of Google references is certainly not a valid metric for determining whether or not a book was ever once a #1 best-seller (nor is it's current rank). However, if you wish to verify that it was a #1 best-seller I suggest checking with Amazon. It was a very well-publicized campaign and there are many a witness to the fact that it beat out Rudy's book (if only for two days). What was important was that it was all done with grass-roots marketing. The fact that Amazon just pre-ordered 3,000 copies of my upcoming book might give you an indication of the faith they have in my marketing abilities. 3. Self-promotion. While I would love to have references to my books in here, what's really important to me is that Dave mentioned the Mark Joyner Constructs. If nothing but that project were mentioned here I would be delighted. The intent of that project is to change the world consciousness in a way that prevent humanity's self-destruction - a far more important topic than my books about sales and marketing, and far more interesting than dissecting the facts. I do hope those ideas remain here. 4. Accuracy. As the topic of the post I can vouch that what Dave has said is true. Again, for the Amazon case I'd recommend contacting them directly. I'm not sure if they maintain an archive of the past best-seller lists (it's updated every hour), but that would be the best objective 3rd party to settle the matter. -- Thanks again, Dave for your support regardless of the outcome. I hope I can see hanging out in my community. [<a href="http://www.markjoyner.name" class="external text" title="http://www.markjoyner.name" rel="nofollow">Mark Joyner</a>]</li>

This stub has been linked to the New Haven listing to gain notoriety and has been unjustly been listed under "notable new haveners."

<p>This is not a vanity page. Richards is a well-known artist and filmmaker both within the New Haven community, as well as within the East Village underground scene and the London art scene. His work has been shown in different galleries in the US, UK and Europe, including a UK national gallery, the Walker. He's had a film in a major film festival, the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival in 2003. All of this information can be verified easily by Googling his name. It seems to me that this James Burns has some sort of personal issue with Mr. Richards and is dealing with it in this way.</p>

The boyfriend, Billy Childish, went on to found the art movement. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:36, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>They don't seem to be/have been notable, even an another group with the same name has released 2 albums and is in AMG <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=VELVETEENS&amp;uid=MIW040507231921&amp;sql=11:dylvad7kt8w8~T0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=VELVETEENS&amp;uid=MIW040507231921&amp;sql=11:dylvad7kt8w8~T0" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="../../../f/e/y/User%7EFeydey_5fa7.html" title="User:Feydey">feydey</a> 23:42, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I don't see why they can't be included. They released two albums (info added to page), played shows as far away from W&amp;M as at least DC. Would it be a fair compromise if I made a page for the other band?</p>
<p>Matter of fact, I'm trying to figure out if that second album (Art of Compromise) was infact the W&amp;M Velveteens or the OH Velveteens. Please don't delete until I've gotten to the bottom of this. Rbeas 24 July 2005</p>
<p>OK PROOF. Art of Compromise was the W&amp;M Group, not the OH group: I followed the above link to the OH group, and found that the AoC album was attributed to them. Read the OH bio here: <a href="http://music.channel.aol.com/artist/main.adp?tab=bio&amp;artistid=199715" class="external free" title="http://music.channel.aol.com/artist/main.adp?tab=bio&amp;artistid=199715" rel="nofollow">http://music.channel.aol.com/artist/main.adp?tab=bio&amp;artistid=199715</a> Now, read the W&amp;M bio here: <a href="http://www.scp.org/e-mail/2000/No_024.html" class="external free" title="http://www.scp.org/e-mail/2000/No_024.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scp.org/e-mail/2000/No_024.html</a></p>
<p>Now, read the album credits on the AoC album here: <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1132306,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1132306,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1132306,00.html</a></p>
<p>The credits go to members of the W&amp;M band, NOT the OH band. I have also listened to previews of each song at the AllMusic site, and the style matches the Viva album (which I own). Definitely not the "acoustic pop" of the OH group. A further article on the W&amp;M Group: <a href="http://www.fcnp.com/issues/0/028/story04.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.fcnp.com/issues/0/028/story04.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fcnp.com/issues/0/028/story04.htm</a> Rbeas 24 July 2005</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> — From what I've read of them, they just appear to be a minor backup band who never had a hit song and played <i>ska</i>: something of a minor musical trend related to reggae.
