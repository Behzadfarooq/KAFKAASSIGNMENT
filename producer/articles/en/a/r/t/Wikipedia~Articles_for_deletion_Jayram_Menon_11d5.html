<li><b>Do not Delete</b> I think the spirit of wikipedia is lost if you guys decide at random to eliminate pages purely based on your understanding of this matter. I am from Mauritius. I have heard of this individual and group. Fairly notable amongst the investment circles. <a href="../../../0/s/i/User%7E0SIRIS_c0b9.html" title="User:0SIRIS">0SIRIS</a> 07:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)<br /></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I tend to agree with <a href="../../../0/s/i/User%7E0SIRIS_c0b9.html" title="User:0SIRIS">0SIRIS</a>. Shouln't we try to verify through some independent sources before concluding that this article must be deleted?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, yeah, in a perfect world. The problem here is that there are literally millions of articles on Wikipedia. And a lot of them shouldn't be there. Hoaxes have a nasty habit of staying up for months. The creator of the article, by default, should be expert on the subject enough to provide evidence of notability. Random passers by like myself should not be expected to spend plane fare to Mauritius to verify the truth of an article. So, the policy is of necessity "guilty until proven innocent." The AFD process is an attempt to deal with this. You attest he's notable, but... You don't provide any backup sources that we can check. Which investment circles are you talking about? Where is the evidence of notablity? We need more. Sorry. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 19:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Above and beyond that, this is exactly the kind of article that a scam artist would create as part of an attempt to build substance for a fictional company that exists to bilk people out of their money. Standards for inclusion therefore need to be particularly high. "You can trust me! Look at my Wikipedia bio!" - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 20:14, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Strange theory "gulity until proven innocent" - isnt it supposed to be "innocent until proven guilty". Anyways its upto the author to validate. Maybe <a href="../../../0/s/i/User%7E0SIRIS_c0b9.html" title="User:0SIRIS">0SIRIS</a> can throw some light. I have come across this venture cap company at Mauritius having made investments in Brazil. The company is not ficticious otherwise agencies like SEC, EDGAR and FSC will not maintain their information. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJAnne_adde.html" title="User:JAnne">JAnne</a> 07:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> In a court of law, Innocent until proven guilty. In Wikipedia, it's the other way around. I could say "George W. Bush is actually Grover Cleveland after a DNA reformat by space aliens. Prove me wrong!" It's the author's responsibility to provide sources for information, not the readers. If there are no sources, the article can't stay. End of story. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 15:25, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I tend agree with some of you on lack of verifiability on google - however do take cognizance that in the case with many "Indian" names, the right spelling could be a combination of either Jayram, Jairam, Jayaram. This person is known in banking &amp; investment circles in India as Jay Menon. Anyways, that is my opinion &amp; I wonder if it at all matters. I have read a few comments by other wikipedians. There seems to be a group of wikipedians who are more keen to delete out of a preconceived consensus. That might also explain the repeated PROD &amp; AFD attempts by the same group of wiki admins <a href="../../../0/s/i/User%7E0SIRIS_c0b9.html" title="User:0SIRIS">0SIRIS</a> 17:32, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> 0SIRIS, you already stated your opinion above, you shouldn't be doing so a second time. I searched under all the variations of Jay Menon that you mentioned and only turned up 19 Google hits. Hardly notable. If he is notable, and more importantly verifiable, someone needs to supply the references. See the policy <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>. In a nutshell "Information on Wikipedia must be reliable and verifiable. Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources. Articles should cite these sources whenever possible. Any unsourced material may be challenged and removed." This AfD has been open since July 28 and nobody has been able to supply any verifiable information about Jay Menon. <a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> 17:29, 9 August 2006 (UTC)btball</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> your statement on verifiability is Contoversial! I did a google on +Jay +Menon +Venture +Capital and got around 20,900 hits. Now we all know that not all may relate to this individual. However that's different from the 19 that you have been quoting. So there is a contradiction on your own statement. Now when I tried +Jayaram +Menon +Investor I got around 298 hits. The "source" of verifiability was initiated by you, which doesn't hold ground. However a portion of your comment does makes sense &amp; on that point I agree with you that the author should have stated facts and cited sources. <a href="../../../0/s/i/User%7E0SIRIS_c0b9.html" title="User:0SIRIS">0SIRIS</a> 17:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The Google search I used was "Jay Menon" (and the other variations. When I filter out Wikipedia with -Wikipedia I only come up with 19 that appear that they could possibly be this Jay Menon. If someone can provide verifiable information about why Jay Menon is notable, I'll be glad to change my opinion from <b>Delete</b> to <b>Keep</b> but I've already spent a lot of time personally searching for verifiable information about his notability and haven't succeeded.

<dd><b>Comment</b> A Google search on +Jay +Menon +Venture +Capital turns up all sorts of stuff that has 2 or 3 of those words, but not the rest. It's not a valid search. I want to be polite here, but, please, put up or shut up. <s>Don't say "I got X results from Google search Y". Post links to actual pages that verify notability.</s> "Well known in financial circles" is a meaningless statement.
