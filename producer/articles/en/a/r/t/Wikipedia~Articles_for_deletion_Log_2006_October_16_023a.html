<li>The <i>NYT</i> links need registration. (No, this doesn't automatically disqualify them, but it is irritating or worse.)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and rewrite. NPOV is a MAJOR problem. This article is 100% autobiograhpical, but he's somewhat notable. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1949935/maindetails" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1949935/maindetails" rel="nofollow">IMDB has an entry</a>, though its paltry. However, a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Brent+Murray+Photography" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Brent+Murray+Photography" rel="nofollow">google search</a> turns up MANY pages that do not include self-created pages. He does seem to be the guy he claims. Still, by the standard that "if no one who doesn't know you is inspired to write about you, you are probably not notable" then, well, maybe he's not notable. His body of work is impressive, and the article can be brought up to standard if someone were so inspired. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, IMDb is not really authoritative, information can be submitted by anyone who registers (i.e. possibly Murrary himself) and IMDb doesn't maintain the standards and quality checks that Wikipedia does. The Google search is pretty underwhelming; only two sites apart from his own turn up: <i>lightstalkers.org</i>, which seems to be nothing more than a CV hosting service, and <i>modelmayhem.com</i>, which is the same thing. Both these sites merely host information supplied by the photographer himself. Conducting my own search I found a hit for a site from which his member name has been deleted and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/dining/asimov-bio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/dining/asimov-bio.html" rel="nofollow">one credited photo from a brief NY Times article</a>, plus one or two others. There's also this hit (with a link to an article that requires registration): "<i>Ms. McNally joined The Times in 2004 as director of photography. ... And special thanks to Brent Murray of our Web site who painstakingly inserted visuals ...</i>" that makes Murray sound like a fairly low-level employee, though more might have been revealed if I had registered. I suppose. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 13:23, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> In its most current iteration, the article appears to be unbiased, and the NYT articles references are indeed legit.

<li><b>Questions</b>: I'm still puzzled. There are two lists of links. The first has two links: one to Murray's own site and the other to what appears to be a page supplied by him to some networking (?) site. The second mostly has links to pages in the NYT that are said to show photos by him; of the two that aren't NYT, one shows nothing by him and the other shows a competent but completely humdrum publicity mugshot. Talk of "multiple publications" suggests to me a list of books, or at least major magazine features. Are there any? Any news stories about him? Any exhibitions by him? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> -- Sorry, I should have been clearer -- he has multiple commercial publications of individual photographs, most of which do seem to be related in one way or another to the NYTimes. All links in "Photographs reproduced" do include a shot by him (Margo Jefferson on the Random House site and Ben Brantley (credited in the alt text) on the BBC's, and breaking the list out in that way was my attempt to clarify that the links were not, strictly speaking, as had previously been indicated, "References." I'm not saying he's <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Avedon_62d1.html" title="Richard Avedon">Richard Avedon</a>, but he does appear to be a working photographer of some established professional notability. That the page started with very definite vanity and autobiography issues seems to have been overcome, although it still needs stronger sourcing and, as noted above, will bear watching. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 07:16, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well done. I appreciate your work on this and your position. But meanwhile, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">this</a> does say that photographers should have been published and have <i>received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.</i> True, this is a mere guideline, but I thought guidelines are, if not observed, then bent or broken only for good reason. On the evidence adduced so far, BM seems an unremarkable photographer. If his work (for the NYT or elsewhere) had won comment in some newspaper, that would be a different matter. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:51, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with Robertissimo's standard is that we have not consistently applied this to other AfD discussions. Brent Murray's self article still fails the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> guideline that has been consistently applied to other AfD discussions that I've monitored. Yes Murray can show that his photographs have been published, but, as Hoary points out, these do not consitute 'multiple independent reviews or awards.' The article still does not contain verifiable references that were not self-generated. Many, many photographers have had work published by the NY Times -- will this be a new standard? As I've said before, I think Murray will someday be notable, but, unless we want to lower the standards for everyone else that we've deleted, he is not notable today. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 14:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Firstly allow me to state that this subject meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. She has gone on a national concert tour in the U.S.A. The evidence is in this <a href="http://www.antoniabennett.com/venues.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.antoniabennett.com/venues.htm" rel="nofollow">webpage</a>. However, I am not sure if the <i>David Award</i> for entertainment is a major award, but if it is, then she deserves an article of her own. On top of this, she was also a guest at the White House with President Bush, Tony Bennett, Robert Redford, and Tina Turner. If one is a guest at the White House, does that automatically make the subject notable? The article also has a few references and this makes it an even stronger candidate for its inclusion. Finally, the potential of this article to be expanded is strong as well. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 01:43, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Cape Cod Online article was again primarily about Tony Bennett, with a minor paragraph at the end about how his daughter came on stage during the performance to sing two songs. <a href="http://www.capecodonline.com/cctimes/edits/cctblogs/reviews/archives/000987.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.capecodonline.com/cctimes/edits/cctblogs/reviews/archives/000987.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I 100% agree with the person who wrote "according to Frank Sinatra her father is the greatest singing legend of all time, she has been singing for over 20 years, she is all over Google. I saw her perform on the Today show and The Regis &amp; Kelly Show. If you look on google you will see she sings all over the country. Amazon sells the CD she did with Tom Wopat and another website states her new CD is coming out soon. Plus, she is very young to have accomplished all this! I believe the Today show, The Regis &amp; Kelly Show, The White House, New York Times, Tony Bennett, Tom Wopat, etc. are all not crazy for supporting her</li>
<li><b>DELETE*</b>: she's piggybacking on her father's fame. he just had a CD out, and didnt include her , not in a single song!!!, that should tell us why she hasnt made it in the bussiness. she has no talent , imagine even thought she is been signing with her father since she's 4, that means she has been at this for over 30 years and hasnt made it . she only comes up in google searches when she is in some sort of function in which her father is either a guest or a host. no credit of her own. i strongly recommend deletion of this entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Witchcat74 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Witchcat74_a8fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Witchcat74">contribs</a>) 23:47, October 17, 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

A quick google search shows it to be quite well reviewed in Utah publications, and an newspaper article here and there mentioning it (<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20050909/ai_n15372075" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20050909/ai_n15372075" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>). It has <i>some</i> national notability since it is (allegedly) a knock off of a resturant called Casa Bonita in Colorado (as mentioned in the <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_H._Miller_f4c8.html" title="Larry H. Miller">Larry H. Miller</a> article). IMHO there should be enough notablity to make this verifiable and technically eligible, assuming somebody has the interest to rewrite the article more descriptive, and discuss the Casa Bonita issue. Personally, even though I am familiar with the place, I can't find the motivation. And for the record, Andrew, its not nearly as awesome as it sounds. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 20:49, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hey, welcome to Wikipedia, and keep editing. But seriously, a "couple of hundred viewers" is well below notable levels. A couple of hundred-thousand or a couple of million might be better. You should also check out <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> as well, since a subject's notability must be verifiable by outside sources.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> Welcome1 speaks the truth when he says the videos have had a "couple hundred" views. However, that's really nothing by Youtube standards (some of that lonelygirl15 crap has well over a million views), and even some short random videos have millions of views too (a kitten falling asleep has 1.7 million), and the most popular videos have 10mil+ (all-time high as far as I can tell is 34 million).

<li><b>Comment</b> If we can have a <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launch_title.html" title="Launch title">launch title</a> article, which lists all the first games for consoles, then why can't we devote a page to the <i>last</i> games of each console? There are so many other lists filled with semi-obscure information on the site that I can't see how this one isn't valid too. Phediuk 20:44, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Quite a few of those should be deleted. Plus, your logic could be used to justify any article. "We have a game on the first and last games for consoles, so why can't we devote a page to the <i>ninth</i> game of each console?" GassyGuy 23:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> The reason we shouldn't have this article is because there's no <i>significance</i> to the last game for a platform. The <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launch_title.html" title="Launch title">launch title</a> article asserts the significance of these games by saying "Because they provide first impressions of the console's features and technical abilities, they are extremely important in the video game industry, and many launch titles have been killer games." <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 03:31, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. The last games released for consoles typically give us a look at the maximum potential of those consoles (as they are released at a time when developers have mastered a system's hardware), and also show us the extent of the support/lifespan of that console. In that respect, they are significant. Phediuk 14:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If this article is about the life cycle of a console, then it should be about the life cycle of a console and the last game released for that console is irrelevant. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 23:17, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Expand</b> The problem as it stands now is that it's so small.

<li><b>Keep</b> Extremely useful, as it's a great way to show and compare the commercial "lifespan" of each system.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. What I meant by that is the <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launch_title.html" title="Launch title">launch title</a> for a console is a big deal. It's probably chosen because it showcases the capabilities of the new hardware, and there is often a lot of buzz surrounding them and their release is highly anticipated. Not so with the last game for a platform. I doubt a lot of production companies have "Yay, we're last!" parties. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 03:31, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe they aren't throwing parties, but the last games let us see how long and extensively a console's life cycle is, and they mark the end of support for a given console (marking the transition to the next generation of consoles.)

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom; worst-case, <b>merge</b> per Bwithh. "Interesting" is a highly subjective but non-encyclopedic criterion, which is much more indicative of triviality than anything. As for "useful", which is also rather subjective, beyond the mere assertion that it is I don't buy that this is any more useful than any other trivia or indiscriminate material. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:42, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The "verifiable" problem is easily solved through sourcing, which is the only problem with this lsit right now. As for significance, my other comments sum up my view nicely: "the last games let us see how long and extensively a console's life cycle is, and they mark the end of support for a given console (marking the transition to the next generation of consoles.) In that respect, they are significant and are deserving of recognition." Phediuk 22:19, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (or <b>merge</b>). The mere fact that something is potentially <i>interesting</i> does not mean that it belongs in an encyclopedia. Unlike lists of launch titles, lists of last titles can be extremely hard to verify, and may even become inaccurate without anyone noticing if a minor geographically-restricted release occurs after an entry for a console has been added. In short, unmaintainable. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 09:16, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, failing that <b>Merge</b> into respective console articles. These are valuable factoid when discussing the consoles in question; I'm not sure if needs an article if we're just listing the <i>very last</i> releases. Would be a very interesting article if it listed <i>some</i> of the very last releases, as well as the <i>conditions</i> that transpired (<i>Sunday Funday</i> is an unlicenced game, what's the last <i>licenced</i> release for NES? What was that homebrew game again that was released for Jaguar years later and sold in US and profits went to charity, if my memory doesn't fail me?) but even then, these factoids are <i>probably</i> best if they're stowed in the individual machine articles. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Those look like trivial references to me; they certainly aren't enough to base a biography on.

<li><b>reply</b> <i>I apologize in advance. This post turned out much longer than I intended. Still, if interested read on</i>. Checked out the references. Still pretty sketchy. The problem we need to address is twofold. 1) Certain professions are inherantly more notable than others and 2) That issue notwithstanding, the basic test is "How is this XXXXX more notable than the average XXXXX". With problem 1), we have the situation that a field hockey umpire is more in the public eye than say, a housepainter; but certainly less so than say a politician. So if her only notability is as a Field Hockey umpire, than she'd better have done something SPECTACULARLY notable. She might meet point 2)'s requirements, but does she meet point 1)'s? She has been acknowledged as a World Cup referee, which certainly makes her quite notable within her profession, but does her very profession make her notable enough? These references are pretty trivial. They establish 1) She exists and 2) She's a ref and 3) She's a good ref. Going back to the housepainter analogy; perhaps (hypothetically) a housepainter is given a contract to paint, say, the <a href="../../../e/i/f/Eiffel_Tower_5c34.html" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>. Wow, what an honor. Perhaps even his local paper writes an article about him. Perhaps, even Le Monde makes a passing note: Monsieur Jean DuMont, housepainter, was chosen to paint the Eiffel Tower. SO, we have established 1) Jean DuMont exists, and 2) he's a painter and 3) He's a good painter. The problem is, so what? In order to be a notable profession, it must be the kind of thing that is in the public eye to the point that discourse and debate is common and readily found. Photographers, atheletes, politicians, authors, etc. etc. are all people who's work is part of the public discourse. It is analyzed by thousands of people all the time. There are public evaluations, public criticisms, public reviews of their work. It's debated, it's argued about, it's analyzed... <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Unitas_e19b.html" title="Johnny Unitas">Johnny Unitas</a> was a great quarteback because.... <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Van_Gogh_ee92.html" title="Vincent Van Gogh">Vincent Van Gogh</a> was a landmark painter because.... <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_North_f577.html" title="Lord North">Lord North</a> was a terrible Prime Minister because... See, there is an inherant notability to the profession. No one has ever said "Jean Dumont is a great housepainter because..." and had this debate in the public forum. Likewise, no one is going to say "<a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Garnett_2b1c.html" title="Sarah Garnett">Sarah Garnett</a> is the world's best Umpire because..." Well, some people might say it, but such a discourse will NOT occur within the public forum (academia, journalism, etc.) Thus, even though true, it's still probably not notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:01, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>reply</b> Yes, but is it good enough for WikiPedia. Does she meet the primary notability criteria? That is, does she appear as a non-trivial subject of several reputable third party reference?

<li><b>reply to reply</b> - In other words, she basically needs to pass a notability criterion - we need to be able to say something like "Sarah Garnett is notable because she umpired the world cup final of a major sport". Well, we can say that. It appears to me that she easily meets the criteria of notability for Wikipedia, and it's clearly verifiable that she achieves that mark. To use the things listed on the notability criterion guidelines page (guidelines, mind, not policy): <i>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.</i> Check. <i>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activites that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States.</i> She has done the equivalent of this as an official, and more, so check. She also passes the <i>Verifiability</i>, <i>expandability</i> and <i>100 year</i> tests as listed on that page. The fact that she fails one of the tests (as not being been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works) seems to be more than outweighed by th five criteria which she does meet. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:13, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply to the reply to the reply</b> An excellent coherant arguement. Let me respond. We need to be able to say more than she umpired the World Cup. We also need to be able to say that Umpiring the World Cup is in itself notable. If it is notable, it is by definition NONTRIVIAL. If it is non-trivial, then non-trivial references exist regarding World Cup umpiring. Are people who are world cup umpires the subject of non-trivial mentions in national press? Do umpiring journals review their work? DOes the umpire critic of the New York Times feature her in a review? Has she been the subject of scholarly journals of how to umpire correctly? Don't dismiss the non-trivial aspect of the notability guideline so off-handed. It is the <b>key</b> part of the entire guideline. Non-triviality ensures that verifiability is not the sole criteria for inclusion. I have a buddy (this is true) lets call John Doe (not his real name). John Doe recieved an award from President Bush as one of the top 50 teachers in the U.S. He went to the White House, stood in a line, and got an award from Bush citing him as one of the best of his profession. I have a picture and everything. The local newspaper did a neat little article on it. Yet, he doesn't merit a Wikipedia article because there is no NONTRIVIAL mention of him. No one reviews his work in the public discourse. We know he won the award. Yet, he does not belong to a profession(High School Teacher), the performance of which is a matter of debate in the public record. If his profession is not notable, then he cannot be notable for having that profession, EVEN if he is regarded as one of the best. Likewise, being a the best umpire is not notable because being an umpire in any fashion is not notable. Using the sportspeople/athlete/competitor analogy is faulty because she wasn't a competitor. She was an umpire. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 05:35, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The behavior of the author of the article (Umpire99) in response to this AfD tempted me to vote neutral, or at least pass altogether, but setting that aside, I'd say she's notable enough in her field, and her field is an olympic sport. I have a hard time with arguments that an olympic sport is non-notable. (It's not the housepainter-and-the-eiffel-tower analogy. There is no olympic housepainting competition. As for conflict of interest, the case made was that the article proclaimed her "New Zealand's Female Umpire of the Year." The article claims that she was named as such, rather than that she is such or self-procliams as such. That is evidence of notability, not vanity. There is a difference.) There's no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problem. There is at least ehough verifiable info for a stub, mabye more. There is no clear consensus she's nonnotable, and there is abundant evidnce of notability to a large enough group of people. Given that, I must say keep. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubreyEllenShomo_7ada.html" title="User:AubreyEllenShomo">AubreyEllenShomo</a> 19:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>reply</b> There's also not an Olympic umpiring competition. There's an Olympic field hockey competition. She wasn't a competitor; she was an umpire. MANY people are involved in olympic competitions; what about the guy who mowed the lawn on the field... The one who painted the lines on the field... The issue is not that she was involved in the Olympics. The issue is that the thing the article claims her to be notable for (an umpire). Simply winning an award, or having a newspaper article noting the award, does not embody NON-TRIVIAL coverage. Unless we can find abundant evidence in the press of her performance as an umpire, there is not enough to build an article on. One of the key issues in the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">Notablity guidelines</a>, says, and I quote "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)". She has, under this standard, one single coverage: She was once named NZ Umpire of the Year. That, in and of itself, is not enough to build an article around. If you had some sources that commented on her technique or her contributions to the field of umpiring, it would make her more notable, since we could put that in the article. A one sentance article doesn't seem very notable to me. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 01:53, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I would still say delete as non-notable, but I do not recommend bringing high school articles to AfD, since it is unlikely to get consensus (for elementary and middle schools, it is less certain) and is more disruptive than keeping articles on schools that are non-notable, in my opinion. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:26, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> We have near-complete consensus that high school articles will be retained. In its current state, the article demonstrates that it more than meets the minimums needed to justify retention. Referring to "odd formatting that is not in accordance with <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a>" is a spectacularly poor reason to delete an article. This is yet another demonstration of the fact that this was an article that needed editing not deletion; AfD is a rather blunt and disruptive instrument to achive changes that could have been done in a far more productive manner. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 16:15, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I disagree that there is a "near-complete consensus that high school articles will be retained" and I disagree with similar comments. Those who think that they are not notable have simply refrained from nominating them for deletion and have even declined to recommend that they be deleted when they are nominated by someone else. It would be wonderful if there were more instances of people putting the project ahead of their own feelings. It has not been that long since the heyday of high school AfD nominations and a huge number of articles were kept because no consensus was reached rather than a because there was a consensus to keep the article. Not infrequently, the majority recommended to delete the article but most were saved because of the high threshold needed for deletion. A few even reached consensus to delete, but that was admittedly rare. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 22:17, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, Ben, you have also claimed that Conservative Underground will become notable when Sicko comes out, (also related to the Stephenson controversy). If you are using future mention in an upcoming film to prove notablility here, to be consistent, you would also have to apply the same standard to the Conservative Underground article, which at the time of the AfD, you did not. I believed you even mentioned at that time that CU would eventually become notable because of this film, and could then have an article on Wiki. So by your own previous arguments, this article should be recreated when and if Sicko makes him notable. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 20:19, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nope, just my say-so. You can decide if you want to be embarrassed by having removed an article for a notable (but politically embarrassing for right wingers) individual who becomes even more notable upon the release of this film or not. Like all Michael Moore films, the documentary jumps from story to story to build a theme. Andy is one of those stories.

<li><b>comment</b> I still support a keep for this article, but the whitewash being attempted here is NOT helping the cause. Merely yelling that he is worthy is NOT the way to get the article kept. Even if hundreds of people came down on the side of this subject's sainthood, it does NOT make the subject worthy. CITE SOURCES. NATIONAL MEDIA. RESPECTED THIRD PARTY INFO. That sort of thing. Now I did my part finding stuff on a guy I frankly couldn't give two s&amp;!#$ about. If all you people are SO hell bent on getting the article kept, do the research, cite respected sources, rewrite the article, and make it up to standard. Otherwise, just let it go. All you are going to do is cause the admins here to delete and protect the article from ever being recreated, which would not serve your purposes. Also, WikiPedia is built on community concensus. Become an active part of the community if you want your opinions to be recognized. Merely getting 100 random anonymous people to spam this AfD with requests to keep will NOT make it happen. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even I have had times where I have not been entirely neutral about topics. And that's where another thing about having an online encyclopedia that anyone can edit comes in. Other people can have a say in it and balance out things. Compromise is important here. As far as your accusations go, I would suggest you drop them as they are unprovable and inflammatory. They will result in nothing but back and forth sniping and bad feelings. Jayron32 and others have improved the article considerably since it was nominated for deletion.

<p>I stand by my "Strong Keep", but I believe now more than ever the article badly needs a NPOV, as well as some locks to dissuade right and left-wingers (and their sockpuppets) from vandalizing it. It's also worth mentioning that a friend and supporter of his, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Rivers_Pitt_dbe2.html" title="William Rivers Pitt">William Rivers Pitt</a>, publicly called into question the operation and circumstances of his death. Stephenson's SOS candidacy, the HBO documentary and the presence of his name and activism in notable news sources convinces me that this should still be kept. But some drastic measures need to be in place so that this page (and perhaps other political pages as well) is protected from extremist vandals, whether they frequent DU, FR or any other blog or message board. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildOfTheMoon83_928b.html" title="User:ChildOfTheMoon83">ChildOfTheMoon83</a> 03:07, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As a journalist, I thought the situation that Stephenson was experiencing with regard to those who hassled him on his deathbed was curious enough to devote an entire article on it See <a href="http://www.coastalpost.com/05/06/01.html" class="external free" title="http://www.coastalpost.com/05/06/01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.coastalpost.com/05/06/01.html</a> I personally spoke with Peter Angelos and he confirmed that he used his influence to help make Stephenson's cutting edge pancreas operation at Johns Hopkins Med Center a reality. I think that Andy Stephenson was and will always be one of the voices for truth, at a time when the mainstream media would not know truth if it came up and bit them on their butt. If Vince Foster has a wikipedia entry, and he is only mourned at this point by his family, then Andy Stephenson should have an entry - he is mourned by his family of thousands of voting activists across the country. When I originall y posted the story at my newspaper, I truly believed that the right wing cabal had influenced PayPal to withhold the needed funds. Since then I have learned that that version of PayPal did that to many of its subscribers - they withheld monies probably just to have the interest on the funds. EBay has since acquired PayPal and it now operates in a more legitimate manner. Currently Stephenson will be honored with mention in a HBO documentary on the election process in the day of electronic machinery. He is also someone that Dorothy Faddiman focuses on in her documentary "Stealing America". The Coastal Post comes out once a month in hard copy that is sent to 18,000 subscribers in Marin County, California. It also is on the web. I own all copy that I write, once it is out and on the newstand.

Articles are not kept on the merits of the relative goodness of the subject, ONLY on the relative <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> of the information in the article. <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idi_Amin_4bbc.html" title="Idi Amin">Idi Amin</a> is not missed by many people, while my Grandmother was really one of the nicest people I have ever met. No one would claim that my grandmother needs an article more than does Idi Amin. Simply argueing that because Foster was not well liked, while Andy Stephenson was a true patriot does NOT have any bearing on whether one should be kept and the other deleted. A quick perusal of the Vince Foster article indicates that it is HEAVILY referenced to NATIONAL MEDIA sources. Now, if you will note, I have voted and am still voting keep. I may even (if I have the time) try to improve the article. But to all of you people who claim to know and care about Andy Stephenson (and honestly, I could give a flying f^(&amp; about him) if you want to keep the article, FIND REFERNCES and IMPROVE THE ARTICLE so it will meet the already well-established standards. You could do no better than to look at the Vince Foster article and seeing how it is done there, since that is an EXCELLENTLY SOURCED article. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Coincidentally, a different anon editor invoked the Foster article on my talk page today. I, too, pointed out the vast divide in the quality of the sourcing between the articles. Part of the problem is that the controversy surrounding Andy was largely played out on blogs, which are, at best, sometimes allowed as primary sources only. The few secondary sources (I'm thinking of the Ferrari article), are not accurate, in my opinion, and based upon posts of hers that I read at the time. How do you reliably source such a thing? I don't think you can. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 04:01, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> This is one of the WORST bad faith nominations I've ever seen. HBO's 'Hacking Democracy', which prominently features Andy Stephenson debuts Nov 2. <a href="http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/hackingdemocracy/synopsis.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/hackingdemocracy/synopsis.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> That ALONE established notability. Also, the nominator's justification is fallicious on two counts, and should be ruled as such. Andy was not primarily known as 'journalist' as the nominator claimed, but as an activist. The nominator has also failed to defend his claim that <i>"notability requirements are in place is to give privacy to friends and family of the deceased."</i> If that were true NO individual who died prematurely and/or tragically would have the circumstances of their death discussed. No info surrounding the deaths of Curt Cobain, Polly Klaas, Jerry Garcia or HUNDREDS of other persons could be discussed if Wiki were to follow this anomalous and aberrant line of reasoning. <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 06:38, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> He is non-notable. You cite the HBO synopsis of the Bev Harris HBO program. Stephenson is mentioned once alongside the non-notable Susan Bernecker, Kathleen Wynne (Cleveland), Hugh Thompson (Security Innovations), Ion Sancho and Harri Hursti. All of whom are MORE notable than Stephenson and also lack the notability to be in Wikipedia (all red lines at the time of this post). Second, the logic you've applied is backward. The Notability Standard, which Stephenson fails, is in place to protect non-notable people from the public spotlight. All the persons you mentioned are Notable. Stephenson is not. And third, to be notable as a journalist one must have received multiple awards for journalism. To be notable in general, he needs multiple writeups in major publications for multiple events. He does not have that. He is in the paper for one thing: Black Box Voting. Most of the articles (i.e. the Guardian) are opinion pieces. The hard news items are almost exclusively local writeups about the single topic of black box voting. His obit seems excusively local. That does not make him notable enough for Wikipedia inclusion. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Box_Voting_5359.html" title="Black Box Voting">Black Box Voting</a> has an article in Wikipedia and anything relevant about Stephenson can be included there.

<dd>I've never claimed any such thing nor is your false choice ever been supported. I said <i>One of the reasons that notability requirements are in place is to give privacy to friends and family of the deceased.</i> That's it. It's a simple truth. Stephenson is non-notable. Being a non-notable person affords him and his family a level of privacy from scurilous charges about fraud and fake deaths being repeated on Wikipedia. Further, the notability requirements of Wikipedia should keep him completely anonymous except for perhaps a passing reference in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Box_Voting_5359.html" title="Black Box Voting">Black Box Voting</a>.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 09:40, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is an AfD. This is about whether this article is encyclopedic and notable by Wikipedia's standards. There is no standard by which we can judge whether this is a "good faith" or "bad faith" nomination, nor <i>should</i> we, because Wikipedia requests that we <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">avoid personal attacks</a>. I'm noticing a distinct lack of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> in this discussion, and the closing admin will likely note that as well. This is not about Tbeatty, Crockspot, or anyone else and their political affiliations. That is irrelevant to the discussion at hand, and if you feel they are conducting a purge of articles based off of their PoV, this is not the place to address that. Those involved have repeatedly been admonished to take their dispute through the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">standard resolution process</a> and have persisted in carrying on said dispute on this AfD's page.

<li><b>Second</b> I would like to reiterate Rosicrusians point. The notability of the subject is INDEPENDANT of the political activism, political positions, rudeness, bad faith, or any other fact about any editor here or anywhere else. Either he is notable or he is not. Provide evidence to support your view, and leave it at that. Opinion or evidence of perceived wrongdoing by another editor does NOT have ANY bearing on the article at hand or this AfD and should be left to other venues at WikiPedia, such as talk pages or RfCs.

<li><b>Delete</b>, the article doesn't demonstrate a level of notability. The material the person has written <i>may</i> be relevant in some articles, and the person <i>may</i> be worth mentioning <i>in short</i> somewhere, but I don't believe the subject warrants an article of its own.<br />
First of all, this deletion debate's journey started with the wrong foot - every time someone posts "hey, everybody, vote for/against deletion" in some forum, the whole debate gets rickety. Consider this from my point of view: I'm uncaffeinated enough to not be able to read the above discussions; AfD is supposed to be a simple place to follow. A pre-emptive hug of consolation to whoever admin has to close this mess!<br />
That said, I need to evaluate the current state of the article: Okay, so here we have a journalist... who has done some mudslinging at voting machines... and failed to get elected to an office... and died. In my opinion, that doesn't yet pass the "more important than average professor" gut feeling, <i>even</i> if you have media mentions and like. There's lots of journalists in this world, there's lots of prominent electronic voting critics. There's a whole bunch of also-ran election candidates, who have consistently been deemed nonnotable (for that merit alone, barring other claims of fame) in Wikipedia. Lacking these, this is more of a merge material or something completely forgettable. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

Look, if you'll check my history you'll find that I've started more than my share of AfDs, and though you <i>won't</i> see it in my history I've been responsible for quite a few <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletions</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">successful prods</a>. I don't like seeing garbage cluttering the encyclopedia. I'm all for uncontroversial deletions. But when there's any doubt, as there certainly is here, I have a very strong bias in favor of <b>keep</b>; it doesn't really hurt anything to leave the article in place and I am <i>certain</i> that a number of people, learning about Stephenson from other sources, have visited Wikipedia to get more information on him. The activities of Stephenson during his life and the major Internet controversy surrounding his last days are more than sufficient to make him notable. Yeah, his politics were kind of silly and his "research" into voting methods highly questionable, but politics does not belong here. I reiterate my opinion that this article should clearly be <b>kept</b>. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 18:06, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I actually agree with you about the politics, that's why I put this up for deletion. There is no reason to bring the internet controversy to wikipedia and that is what was happening. Black Box Voting is notable and he certainly is a part of that. But a human interest writeup in Seattle Weekly is hardly noteworthy as meeting the inclusion criteria for WP and that's my problem with this entry. As you have seen from the multiple SPA writeups, this article has become a memorial to an otherwise non-notable person. I listed the six or so other people on the upcoming HBO show that are also non-notable (as is the show) but the topic IS notable and that is where they deserve mention.

<li><b>Comment</b> He spent years travelling around the country as an activist and specialist or expert on security flaws of black box voting. He was written up and quoted in numerous newspaper of international circulation. He testified at numerous hearings on machine certification. The campaign against him by right-wing blogs was documented in newspapers. This is all besides many thousands of internet mentions in sites concerned with verified voting.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:32, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The "campaign against him by right-wing blogs" that "was documented in newspapers" is the part I have a problem with. Ferrari's claims in a newspaper are completely different than Ferrari's claims on blogs. She was documenting what was going on in real time on the blogs, but months later, she suddenly is telling newspapers completely contradictory information. The info in the newspaper article cannot be independently verified, but it can be debunked by Ferrari's own statements on blogs. Of course, blogs are not reliable sources, though her statements on them <i>might</i> be usable as primary sources. The article as it looks right now is not too bad, and I am ALMOST inclined to switch to a keep, but I cannot be assured that the smear campaign that existed when this article was first nominated will not return, therefore, I am holding firm on my delete vote. If you want to look at a pretty good archive of all the blog activity during the event, check out the <a href="http://www.scamdy.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.scamdy.com/" rel="nofollow">www.scamdy.com</a> forums.

These sources establish the notability of the "Black Box Voting" organization, and clearly establish both Andy Stephenson and Bev Harris as co-equally notable in the topic as well. The fact that Ms. Harris does not have an article yet does not mean she is not notable; indeed I am certain it will be remedied soon. What more burden of verifiability do you place on this subject? These are not just Op-Ed pieces or articles by friends of the subject. RELIABLE sources cite his work in the field, and The Guardian even uses the word "expert" specifically to refer to him... --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:55, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

He won't meet the "widely recognized contribution that is part of the <i>enduring historical record</i> in their specific field" test, because the contribution, which may or may not enter the enduring historical record was Black Box Voting's, not his, and he did not lead the organization. A failed candidacy is not a basis of notability by Wikipedia standards. He fails the "<i>primary subject</i> of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person" test by not being a primary subject of anything in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> except his obituary. (The result on this test could change in the future, but not by blog posts about him.) He doesn't meet the "achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" test because the reliable sources continued to need to explain who he is (mostly associate director of BBV) every time they mention him.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The fact the Bev was the director and he was the associate director in no way prevents him having an article in relation to his activities in the organization. Scott Palmer is Dennis Hastert's assistant and he has his own article. Stephenson has well established notability in his own right. If he is in the news, the fact that he was for a time part of the Black Box Voting organization does not somehow transfer all his notability to that organization and prevent an article about him. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:26, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The term "smear campaign" is ambiguous in these discussions. To some it means that Freepers and others alleged that he was not sick, didn't have cancer, didn't need the money for an operation, and that he was just looking for money for personal use in general. Scamdy reports calls to the hospital and to the supposed surgeon, who could not legally release any info to outsiders in any event. The Scamdy website is self documenting with posts made blogs denying that he legitimately needed money for an operation and that he was gravely ill. It is also described in the Seattle paper articles. To others "smear campaign" means the claim made in 2005 that the aforementioned right-wing campaign caused his death by preventing the hospital getting the money in time for an operation to be done around March 10, which is not well documented. He had an operation toward the end of May and subsequently died. This was apparently disputed for some time. What part of that is POV?<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:41, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response to wwwolf's comments</b> I think wwwolf has made one of the best delete arguements here, but I would like to counter it with some points. 1) He seems to figure prominently in the upcoming HBO documentary "Hacking Democracy" He is not the sole subject; but its not a biopic, it is about the entire topic, and other sites attest to his recognized expertise in that topic. 2) Several sources have specifically cited him for his work, and quote him specifically with regards to his work, or even call him an expert (The Guardian reference, for one example). He meets primary notability criteria: He's referenced in several reputable sources in a non-trivial way. 3) His notability is not necessarily as a journalist <i>per se</i> but as an activist. As an activist, he is certainly significantly more notable than the average activist. His appearence in several reputable sources in a non-trivial manner attests to that --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:33, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Correct, with obvious discussion and disagreement above, plus solitiations of outsiders to come here, this will stay open until a closing admin decides 1) which arguments from Wikipedia policy are stronger and 2) who they are going to choose to disenfranchise as not being an established editor. Plus, AFD runs for five days (plus however longer it takes the admins to get to it and decide the right answer - obvious closes generally close close to on time, things like this usually take longer). Then after that, somebody will decide the admin got the closure wrong, and it will go to deletion review.

<p>I don't...know...what to say, really. These are pure indiscriminate lists; many, many, many, many fictional works have monkey or ape characters.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see anything wrong with monkeys+apes (or any of the other fictional animal lists). They are informative to people. Many lists on here aren't complete (and probably never will be), so that's no excuse or reason to afd it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I found this page really useful when looking for a thing I forgot about His Dark Materials.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If the monkeys themselves are notable enough to have articles, why would a list of these articles be inappropriate? If the monkeys aren't notable, delete the monkey articles, but if there are a large number of notable fictional monkeys, the list could be useful for someone who needs some examples of how monkeys are portrayed in fiction, but doesn't necessarily need every single fictional monkey.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I have found several of these "List of fictional..." things very useful for some recent writing work I have done, and more than just amusing trivia. I do not consider them unencyclopedic, and I don't see the urgent need for completeness as a criterion for maintaining them. Just my opinion...

<li><b>Merge</b> preferred but <b>Keep</b> in any event. I don't think there needs to be separate lists, but I don't see this as being terribly widespread. Useful? I have no idea ... but certainly more useful than other lists I've seen kept around here like "films with hidden things" or whatever. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Do Not Merge</b>, unless you're going to merge "List of fictional dogs" with "List of fictional cats".

<li>Listings on Moddb and Steam are pretty trivial. The GameSpy ones and other things listed above are questionable as well as to whether they can be considered reliable publications.

<li>What I was trying to say was that Moddb listings are trivial, but it takes a pretty well established mod in order to make the Steam page; I think you'd be hard pressed to call <i>any</i> of those mods unsuccessful. Hell, TS has more servers up at any time than most other 3rd party HL/HL2 mods, including The Battlegrounds (1 and 2), Firearms, Dystopia, and Hostile Intent. Not only that, TS was pretty innovative in its design. How many multiplayer games implement slow-motion? The game is not as popular as it once was, but you can't delete it just because people don't pay attention to the article anymore.

<li>TS was (as far as I can tell) the first game to implement slow-motion in a multiplayer context. It also has a larger and more configurable array of weapons then any game before it, because it broke the Half-Life engine's builtin 30-odd weapon limit. It's also notable because many of the community members who have contributed to the game have also contributed to games like Hostile Intent, Dystopia, Digital Paintball, and even Counter-Strike. It's been featured in some Spanish and Portugese PC gaming magazines, but we're having trouble finding scans of the articles, because our forums were reset a couple years ago. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVino_130d.html" title="User:Vino">Vino</a> 14:28, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article documents these (rather silly) claims by Chick Publications; it does not make the claims itself. "Original thought", "patent nonsense", and "religion attack" might apply if this was the first location at which they're being published, but it isn't - the article has 84 links because it's trying (and succeeding!) at sourcing all of its information. The article may be a bit crufty, but I'm afraid that I haven't yet seen a proper argument for deletion. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 09:09, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article states, in boldface, in its very first sentence that the claims "are widely disputed". The article is citing primary sources for the claims, but isn't citing any sources <i>for the disputes and the rebuttals</i>. For the article not to be original research, it has to be people in the rest of the world, not Wikipedia editors directly, disputing these claims. Remember that original research includes novel syntheses of data. Collecting a set of claims made by a person or an organization that one disputes the accuracy of onesself is a novel synthesis. Listing a set of claims that someone outside of Wikipedia has <i>already</i> researched, collected together, and rebutted, is not a novel synthesis.
<p>If you want to show a good reason to keep the article, and counter the nomination, show that there's more to cite here than just the primary source material of the claims themselves — show that the disputes and rebuttals can be amply and reliably sourced, too.

<p>The article makes no claim of notability or importance. The number of branches or members is not given, just its mission. No media mentions are given, either.

Also, several answers.com pages (the site is a mirror of Wikipedia and other content) show up because it has a "Blank is mentioned in these AnswerPages:" function where "blank" is a word or phrase that is used in the Wikipedia article. The only useful result in English is <a href="http://www.nusa.org.au/clubs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nusa.org.au/clubs.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, but there is no indication that this other organization is in any way related to the one in the article. Some of the Korean results appear to be pages of links, while a couple may have useful information. Given that it is an organization that is supposedly in South Korean college campuses (South Korea is highly "wired"), I would expect and extensive Internet presence if the organization was notable.

<li>I'm glad you found that information, but these are not regions of Republika Srpska. The reliefweb document mentions several regions: Banja Luka, Eastern Herzegovina, Prijedor, Zvornik and Doboj (Eastern Herzegovina is of course an informal geographical region). UNHCR's map shows regions of Banja Luka, Doboj, Bijeljina, Vlasenica, Sokolac, Srbinje and Trebinje - note that there is no Prijedor or Zvornik region. Note at the bottom explains it: <i>Regions in RS are specified according to competence areas of Local Refugees Committees</i> - so these are competence areas of local refugees committees, and not regions of Republika Srpska. Unece's document apparently speaks of regions used internally by RS institute of statistics. There is a map of RS showing regions at the website of the <a href="http://www.rzs.rs.ba/English.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rzs.rs.ba/English.htm" rel="nofollow">Institute of Statistics of Republika Srpska</a> (bottom right), but again, these are regions internally used by the institute, and not regions of Republika Srpska. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 06:39, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - Nonsense, original research. I inquired about this many months ago and asked the person who first invented these regions in Wikipedia to supply his source. It turned out to be an amateur expat French-Bosnian site. The government in Republika Srpska is centralized and does not feature any administrative subdivisions. What UNHCR thinks about this is quite beside the point. (And oh yes, what French-Bosnian expats think about this is beside the point, too.) UNHCR simply organized their own local chapters in a way that best fits their operations. How is that freaking relevant for Wikipedia? I am sure that cattle growers in USA or milk producers in Germany subdivide the territory according to their measures yet that does not mean we should have an article "Regions of Germany" positing that "Germany consists of Alpenmilch and Friesisch regions" and let alone a map implying that these regions are some sort of equivalent to the German states (like the map of RS regions suggesting that they are some sort of equivalent of cantons in the Federation). --<a href="../../../d/z/o/User%7EDzordzm_8fa2.html" title="User:Dzordzm">Dzordzm</a> 12:47, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>A slightly tentative nomination this. The article is by Kc62301 whose article <a href="../../../k/c/6/User%7EKc62301_Relationship_rules_6729.html" title="User:Kc62301/Relationship rules">User:Kc62301/Relationship rules</a> was userfied by the decision of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ground_rules_relationships_d85f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ground rules relationships">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ground rules relationships</a>. On a cursory read, the same objections apply to jealousy coping: however high its quality, it is still an <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original essay</a>. Also it verges too far into how-to guide territory. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 08:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete and userfy</b> - same reasoning as others stated in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ground_rules_relationships_d85f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ground rules relationships">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ground rules relationships</a>. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 11:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> When the author of an encyclopedia article has a large number of sources from which to draw, the author must select some sources and omit other sources to meet the space constraints of the article. Any encyclopedia article that tries to cover a few different areas of a large topic, and has to select sources for each area, can be considered an original essay. The issue of NOR is whether or not (1) the information comes from verifiable sources, and (2) the information is presented in the same way as in the original sources, and (3) the combination of sources cited does not lead to a new idea or theory. All major ideas in this article come from previously published, verifiable, and reliable sources. The information cited is presented with the same interpretation as presented by the original authors of the cited references. The article reviews several aspects of coping with jealousy, but does not offer a new idea for coping with jealousy or a new theory about coping with jealousy. It just reviews different aspects in separate sections. So the argument for original research seems ungrounded. The How-To argument seems a more understandable argument. But, when it comes to jealousy, the scientists who study it are interested in the question of how to deal with it. How to deal with jealousy is a valid research question in the field of relationship psychology. If an article reviews research conducted by experts on how to deal with jealousy, the findings will come close to sounding like a how-to guide. But it remains a review of a valid research topic. So I disagree with this being a justification for deletion. User:kc62301 16:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and userfy</b>. This is an essay. Advice and/or essays don't belong in the mainspace, no matter how good. They're not encyclopedic. Besides, advice usually intrinsically fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. (I am not qualified to speak to that in this case.) Even if it is neutral, and documents any contreversy, cites studies which differ and disagree, etc, it must be encyclopedic and notable. Parts of this content may work in <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jealousy.html" title="Jealousy">Jealousy</a>, but that would be more up to Kc62301 to make the adjustments and include them in an encyclopedic manner, rather than as an essay. As such, I cannot recommend a merge. I must recommend delete and userfy.

<li>There may be broad agreement, but I'm not willing to prod all of these, hope for the best, and then have to do an AfD anyway if one person removed the tag. Also, I don't really want to go ahead with the transwiki until I have the delete decision in hand. That's a lot of work.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not even wiktionary has the swadesh lists independent from each other. They group them and even have language family comparison pages. Would that be more encyclopedic? It would then be more than a list of words and could even be accompanied by analysis. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 18:11, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The point is that it needs to be more than lists of words and lexical data.

<dd>See wiktionary's <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Swadesh_lists_for_Slavic_languages" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Swadesh_lists_for_Slavic_languages" rel="nofollow">Slavic table</a>. Now if they put it in IPA, it would demonstrate very clearly the differences and similarities between the different languages. This is the point of Swadesh lists. If we made a wikipedia page for different language family swadesh lists, then this deletion wouldn't be nearly as controversial. Language comparison isn't inappropriate for an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. These are not incipient dictionaries, but limited (207 words) samples of languages using a widespread standard. As <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroquant_ee33.html" title="User:Croquant">Croquant</a> notes, these are subpages of articles, and are encyclopedic in nature: they are language samples. And is the fact that I'm a professional linguist relevant to mention here? It's what we'd put in an encyclopedia of the world's languages, and is 'very ill suited to moving to a dictionary', which is something quite different.--<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 17:42, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's odd that you'd say they're ill-suited to moving to a dictionary, when Wiktionary has already some of these lists itself. I don't understand what noting that they are subpages has to do with anything; that doesn't make it encyclopedic. Note how the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> article is now, with a prominent pointer to the Swadesh list on Wiktionary. It is more appropriate there. These are still lists of lexical data, for which consensus already exists against inclusion, and which is not encyclopedic. Wikipedia is a <i>general</i> encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 19:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, whether wiktionary has them or not is not really the point. Dictionaries are open-ended volumes which give a range of meanings, instances of use, parts of speech etc. Word lists are not there for people to learn the definitions of certain words, but as a basis of linguistic comparison, which is not the purpose of dictionaries. Language pages have a variety of samples of the language itself, and cover areas such as phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, so I do not understand why lexis should be moved elsewhere. The very strength of the Swadesh lists is that they are standardised. But rather than putting them within the article itself, because of their size it is better to have them as subpages. So I think the Swadesh lists are better kept within Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 07:43, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a strawman argument. You need to familiarize yourself with Wiktionary, (see <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Appendices" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Appendices">wikt:Category:Appendices</a>), for a start, before you propound on the purpose of dictionaries: we're not concerned about those, but about <i>Wiktionary</i>. Rather than asserting that they are inappropriate dictionary articles (you'll want to see <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Requests_for_deletion" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wiktionary:Requests_for_deletion">wikt:Wiktionary:Requests for deletion</a> to make that argument), please assert why they <i>are</i> encyclopedic. If you assert that is because they are language comparison (which still doesn't explain why it's encyclopedic), this doesn't make sense: these are stand-alone word lists, and they don't engage in comparison. The irony being that Wiktionary's Swadesh lists do make comparisons. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I don't know much about wiktionary. But my point, to summarise what I put above, is that Swadesh lists are composed of a small amount of lexical data, which is appropriate to demonstrate the lexis of the language, just as it is appropriate to have data on other linguistic areas. And in some cases it might be good to have combined Swadseh lists to demonstrate a language family: an argument could be made for that. --<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 09:28, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point should <b>not</b> be the relevance of Swadesh list pages <i>per se</i> in an encyclopedia, but there relevance in the whole set of an encyclopedia article dealing with a language. Due to editorial constraints, such an article may be built from various parts&#160;: main page and sub- or related pages. You can't fairly separate sub- or related pages from the main part of the article. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroquant_ee33.html" title="User:Croquant">Croquant</a> 08:10, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think that this is a joke, why would you want to delete useful information off this website, it is suppose to be a website with information on it for people to see why in gods name would you want to delete it just because it isnt as important as premier league players etc... what harm is it doing? I took time making these profiles for other peoples benefit and your just going to delete it, its not right, if that is the attitude then why dont we just delete of every team that has never played at professional level. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStew_jones_e0ce.html" title="User:Stew jones">Stew jones</a> 00:52, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep/Comment</b> I'm usually in favor of keeping malls like this one that are the largest or otherwise major draws in their region (in this case, the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delmarva.html" title="Delmarva">Delmarva</a> peninsula.) Though I can't help but think that after looking at the (poorly-written) original version, that the creation of this article was spurred by the recently posted <a href="http://www.labelscar.com/maryland/salisbury-mall" class="external text" title="http://www.labelscar.com/maryland/salisbury-mall" rel="nofollow">Salisbury Mall photo gallery</a> at <a href="http://www.labelscar.com" class="external text" title="http://www.labelscar.com" rel="nofollow">labelscar.com</a>, a website which has essays about various malls across North America. It may be interesting to see how many malls without articles now get one after they get a mention on labelscar... <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 15:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hey, it's Jason from Labelscar. I found this page via the referral traffic to my site. While I have on occasion edited existing mall entries to include my research or added the external link to the specific mall page on the Labelscar site (which is non-commercial), I have never created ANY Wikipedia page from scratch, including mall pages. In this particular case, neither Ross or I have ever even visited this particular mall and it does not (nor will it) contain an external link to Labelscar. The article about the nearby Salisbury Mall was also not written by us or associated with us, nor did we post the external link from that page pointing to our site. Otherwise, my site generally speaks for my opinion: I think that major, enclosed shopping malls are a notable part of an area's local makeup and Wikipedia entries about them are valuable. However this particular entry includes very little information, and unless it is fleshed out further then I do not see much reason to keep it either.--DanAbnrml9 9:01, 18 October 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Whoever thinks that shopping centers, even this one, aren't notable should thoughtfully reconsider. While Wikipedia is not the yellow pages, shopping malls are an important piece of our collective history and culture. Whether you like them or dislike them notwithstanding, they have proven themselves functionally and have a continued following. In addition, they function more than just systems of utilitarian commerce. In fact, many people do find them interesting as reflections of their own style of architecture, their varied retail presence, relative locations in our cities, and even their varying physical conditions. I would argue that in general, shopping mall articles belong in a reference encyclopedia if, for nothing else, to provide an index of these important historical agents of our collective history, our pieces of Americana. We must continue to be very careful in filtering content so that we don't become an irrelevant collective source of information. .--Rosster 14:04, 19 October 2006</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with Rosster above, but I conclude that in trying to avoid being an irrelevant collective source of information, one of the viable steps is not listing every shopping mall in the world. No indication that this is a notable mall. This appears to be hobbycruft, as such it will probably be far happier on a lovingly-tended private web page. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorporal_Tunnel_bf12.html" title="User:Corporal Tunnel">Corporal Tunnel</a> 01:52, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Expert keep</b>: The term "mobbing" (in the context of social science, not animals) usually refers to "bullying" or "workplace bullying" or "workplace harassment". <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinz_Leymann_48a2.html" title="Heinz Leymann">Heinz Leymann</a> was the originator of workplace bullying research. He was the one who introduced the term "mobbing" (in the meaning of bullying; <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konrad_Lorenz_9562.html" title="Konrad Lorenz">Konrad Lorenz</a>'s meaning of the term "bullying" is quite unknown in the German-speaking area) in the German language (and consequently in several other European languages, such as Italian, Croatian). In Europe he is definitly famous. He has published several books and articles. Some of them were translated. To sum it up: Heinz Leymann had a very important impact as far as I know from the Swedish and Austrian perspective. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESampi_Europa_96d0.html" title="User:Sampi Europa">Sampi/€</a> 14:02, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I do wish people would keep personal preferences out of Afds. Whether he's a quality player or not is neither here nor there.

<dd>195.93.21.1, his ability level is not and never has been a factor in this debate.

<dd>I disagree about the notability factor. He is famous in Israel for qualifying the squad for their first ever European U-21 championship tournament and is the youngest cap ever for the under-21 side. He is literally part of the history of Israeli football and that is what makes him notable. Much more than the big headlines his transfer made in Israel. <a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENYC2TLV_c0fe.html" title="User:NYC2TLV">NYC2TLV</a> 22:25, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually, it very much does. Provenances of sources is important.

<li>Possibly not the best place to do so, but initially I wanted to raise the suggestion that we be more flexible when proposing club articles for deletion. If there is an article on a club, even sub level 10, but which already contains a significant amount of information within it, including links to other wiki articles, our focus should be on reasons to <i>keep</i> the article not why to deleted it. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> policy says a club is notable if <i>"The club... has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the club... itself"'</i>, so if one can find a multiple of mentions of the club on articles from independant websites, then the article should be retained.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In this instance, however, the article is not that detailed. I can find little mention of the club other than in football databases and similar online encyclopedic sites.

<li>you lot are like a bunch of old women god whats the big problem&#160;? I made an article about Parley Sports F.C and none of you can say that it's has proof of notability, why dont you contact the Dorset F.A or even the Dorset Premier League for Parley Sports history, the information i added was taken from the Bournemouth Daily Echo can't you phone them to confirm notability. And also I no we are not a top level 10 club but we used to be as you will see in are history we resigned from that League in 2000. <b>Check Are Hits Out On Google</b> for a small village team that used to play in the 'Dorset Premier League' thats pretty good, and as your see the first search result to be found is <b>Parley Sports FC - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</b>. So that means most people will use WIKIPEDIA to search history about it. And you want to 'Delete IT' you want to take a look at other pages that are just as bad as are's with nothing on them at all. You look throught the 'Dorset Premier League' pages of teams for this season and see how many have history about them selfs, not many i'll thing your find!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.29.92.124 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.29.92.124_8519.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.29.92.124">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the google evidence works AGAINST your arguement. In order to be valid subject matter for a Wikipedia article, then the subject needs to have notability outside of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is NOT a means to gain notability; it only documents subjects that have notability verified by reliable third party sources. If a WikiPedia article turns up as the first hit on Google, it is usually a red flag that the WikiPedia article (and NOT an outside source as required by the WikiPedia policy against <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>) is the only major place to find this information. As such, it should be deleted. If you have evidence to the contrary, then IMPROVE THE ARTICLE. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">Calling experienced editors names</a> or complaining that the club should be kept without providing hard facts will not work in your favor. Also, proof of existance is NOT proof of notability. The fact that a single local newspaper wrote about them does not mean that anyone outside of the immediate area has even heard of this club. If they have, then PROVIDE REFERENCES to show that the club is widely known and regarded outside of the immediate Bournmouth/Dorset area. If there is no such evidence, the article is not notable. Even if they were the best level-15 club, that makes them like the 500th best club in England. Again, my Church softball team is pretty good. But it's not the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> or even the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toledo_Mud_Hens_7294.html" title="Toledo Mud Hens">Toledo Mud Hens</a>. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:14, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"If article X then article Y." is a fallacious argument. Each subject should be assessed on its merits. The best approach, I suggest, is to go through each article and research the subject. Find out what sources exist. If you find good sources, add them to the article (as references or as further reading) in order to improve it and in order to let other editors build upon your work. If you cannot find enough material of suitable provenance and depth to satisfy the notability criteria, <i>then</i> think about deletion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:15, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorset_Premier_Football_League_0154.html" title="Dorset Premier Football League">Dorset Premier Football League</a> used to be one level below the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex_League_68c7.html" title="Wessex League">Wessex League</a> back when the latter was only one division. When the Wessex League essentially absorbed the Hampshire League, the DPL was placed below the 2nd level of the WL, at the same level as Wessex Div 3 (now called Div 2). That's why the DPL clubs have articles, along with a number of other level 11 leagues: <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex_County_League_eadd.html" title="Sussex County League">Sussex County League</a> Div 3, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Western_League_5b24.html" title="South Western League">South Western League</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devon_County_League_c73f.html" title="Devon County League">Devon County League</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Midlands_League_75d1.html" title="Central Midlands League">Central Midlands League</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spartan_South_Midlands_Football_League_94f5.html" title="Spartan South Midlands Football League">Spartan South Midlands Football League</a> Div 2. These leagues are among the strongest at level 11 (indeed, the CML has applied for level 10 status and the SWL and DCL are merging to form a level 10 league next season). Club pages in a garbage level 11 league like the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northampton_Town_League_e5c2.html" title="Northampton Town League">Northampton Town League</a> are questionable, but club pages in the previously mentioned leagues I think should stay because these leagues consistently supply promotion candidates and <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Vase_c23f.html" title="FA Vase">FA Vase</a> entrants. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 01:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Addition</b> - It's worth noting that Parley Sports played in the DPL for <a href="http://www.fchd.info/PARLEYSP.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.fchd.info/PARLEYSP.HTM" rel="nofollow">four decades</a>, but have more recently run into hard times necessitating a move down to more regional leagues.

<li><b>Reply</b> It's also the problem that nearly every football club in England is under the auspices of a single governing body. This includes over 700 teams within the top 11 levels of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> alone. Levels 12+ include (i did an approximate count) 450 leagues. Assuming, even conservatively, 15 teams per league, that results in 6750 teams in these divisions, meaning we have well in excess of 7500 teams, probably closer to 8000 teams. That doesn't even count Sunday leagues. SOME standard has to be applied. By analogy, the U.S. has a rather extensive Baseball structure running under the auspices of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_League_Baseball_a0e6.html" title="Minor League Baseball">Minor League Baseball</a>. There are also thousands of smaller amateur and semi-pro leagues. Counting ONLY Major and Minor leagues (down to rookie leagues), and including equivalent independant leagues, there are about 400 teams. Assuming that as a reasonable number of potentially notable teams, that matches well to levels 10+ in the football league system. It is unreasonable that the 700th best football team in England recieves notable press coverage beyond, say, a mere note of game scores in a local paper. This team USED TO be as good as the 700th best team. Its currently about the 3000th best team. That <i>can't</i> be notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not necessarily advocating a keep, but there will be tougher calls than Parsley Sports in the future - clubs who spend a number of years at level 9, but then drop to level 13...what do you do then? (see: <a href="../../../t/u/f/Tuffley_Rovers_F.C._3e8b.html" title="Tuffley Rovers F.C.">Tuffley Rovers</a>, which was kept) I'm not the biggest fan of the baseball analogy because the US sports structure, legally, practically, and culturally, especially in baseball is completely different from England's. Minor league teams are essentially independently-owned reserve/youth teams and outside the minor league structure, there is no smooth decline in talent like there is from the Football League to the Conference, for example. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 06:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> This is in response to the writings of LUIGI909 and 86.29.94.218(anon) above. NO ONE doubts that this football club exists. NO ONE is denying it, or other facts, such as where they play, what league they are in, what their history is, etc. etc. The question is whether such facts warrant that the club is notable. Word of mouth contacts with people involved in the organization, or with local newspapers, or anything else, does NOT establish notability. Please read <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WIkipedia's guidelines on notability</a> BEFORE you comment on this article. The primary notability criterion is: Does this subject receive 1)<b>significant coverage</b> in 2) <b>several</b> 3) <b>non-trivial sources</b> as 4) <b>a primary focus</b> of the writing. So far, this subject fails on all grounds. We have no evidence of coverage beyond a single newspaper, and no evidence that the coverage is more than scores and results of games. Passing mention in a sports section does not qualify. Do we have articles that review their performance? Have books been written on their history? Are they the subject of ANY critical analysis? If they are, then PROVIDE THE SOURCES. Simply saying "I think the local paper wrote an article on them a few years ago" isn't good enough. Provide book titles and authors, website URLs, newspaper dates and by-lines; give us something to work with. If the ONLY way we can get more information about the subject is to call someone, then they aren't notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 19:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Fancruft as a word should be banned from every Wikipedian's vocabulary. There is no rule anywhere in Wikipedia about "fancruft", and moreover, people simply use it as a term for things they don't like. I've seen it used to describe everything from Naruto articles to information about the Salvation Army. An article shouldn't exist if it violates guidelines such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, not if a few Wikipedians declare it "cruft," especially as "cruft" is an entirely subjective term.

<li><b>Totaly agree</b> I have been saying the same thing for a long time. Fanrfut seems to have become a reason to justify the removal of anything. It's just a junky piece of slang, made up for wikipedia which is misused. There is no policy anywhere about it. <i>Delete as fanfut</i> is the same thing as <i>Delete as boring</i> or <i>Delete because I don't like it." It's nonsense and for some reason everyone go alontg with it and uses it. Adding to the above, It's not just in fiction either. Ive seen people calling articles about the goverment cruft because it was an obscure branch. Think of a better reason people. Cruft is nonsense.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Sorry, I seldom reply to stuff like this, but I felt the need in this case. You can see the writing on the wall, can you? And you can argue about the shortcomings of Wikipedia, and your perceived lack of guidance. How about using that energy to provide the information you've been directed to time and time again. Reference published market share charts. How about licensing documentation? You think it's notable in St. Cloud, does anyone else? Has that been established? Covered in referential media?

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> I have been aware of the concerns (mostly relating to conflicts of interest) in the GUIDELINES regarding "Vanity". The truth is that I started a while ago by adding the KNSI page. Considering that most of the media in St Cloud, MN is absent I followed the model of similar format stations in Minneapolis and started to write articles about the St Cloud live shows. First was the top rated show and then our show. For some reason Dan Ochsners was deleted but this one was not. I have since been building on it in as much of a NPOV as I could. And, you have to admit that had I not said so elsewhere you would have had difficulty realizing that the articles were originated by the subject. Which leads me to the following:
<blockquote>
<p>If you have published elsewhere on a subject, we welcome you to contribute to articles on the subject for Wikipedia. However, every Wikipedia article is expected to cover its subject in a neutral, fair, and comprehensive way in order to advance knowledge of the subject as a whole.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>
Can you honestly say that this is not "neutral, fair, and comprehensive"? Is it or is it not advancing knowledge of the subject?</li>
</ul>
<p>Verifiability...Everything in the articles has been on the air, on the station's website, on the personal blogs or on the show's websites. I take it from the myopic prism used to push to delete everything regarding this station's shows and hosts that this is not sufficient for 'verifiability'...however as of yet noone has offered anything as a response. In other words, there is no guidance whatsoever from the veteran editors...just a 'delete, we're right, no exception' mentality.</p>
<p>When I have a question about ANYTHING I check Wikipedia first. I have never come up empty...except when dealing with matters within St Cloud. While the policy of "notability" and "verifiable" are very good standards, there seems to be a conflict with that in some of the projects I have seen on Wikipedia (e.g. requesting pages for all state legislators, articles completing timelines). These projects imply a desire of comprehensiveness to some degree. Those things said, these articles seem to fall into line with the comprehensive drive of other projects. Verifiability? Yes, difficult. So, to me, it seems the question here calls for a balance between Verfiability and/or Notability vs Comprehensive and leading resource. And one more point to the idea of Comprehensive Resource: many other Wikias also imply a similar drive...things like Lyrics library, etc. Notability? Come live in St Cloud and see if KNSI and their local talent are not notable? What is comforting in Wikipedia (as a resource) is that it seems practicaly anything of public knowledge is able to be found. The fact that a common person within a certain field WOULD likely search for a topic, in my interpretation of notability, is the driving philosophy behind 'notability'. If I am wrong, then I ask for Rulings that demonstrate this error of interpretation.<a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">tony garcia</a> 02:04, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> second <i>Keep</i> opinion by same editor stricken. Please only state <i>Keep</i> or <i>Delete</i> once a discussion. It is bad wiki-etiquette to do otherwise. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, information has to be verifiable from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> to appear on Wikipedia; i.e. it has to be possible that it can be vetted for accuracy. Something that happens "on air" on a radio show is not going to pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> unless there is a transcript, archived program, etc that is readily available for people to verify. Blogs are generally considered by many editors to not be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> because they are self-published and usually have no external checks on accuracy. A station's website may be seen as a reliable source, or may not because it is a primary source and may not be neutral. Personally I opined delete because I don't see any evidence of greater notability. It has nothing to do with the size of the station or the size of St. Cloud... I live in a much bigger city and I would readily opine delete for any local radio programming in my city (including the shows I listen to frequently) unless it could be demonstrated that multiple, verifiable, external sources exist and have been devoted to the show (newspapers, nationally circulated magazines, coverage by non-local news organizations on television or the web). I just don't see that here.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why would a blogger not be a cretable source according to Wiki, yet a creditable source according to CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, and other news orginizations on multiple ocassions? Wiki's deffition of blogger includes this statement: The impact of this story gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media. Would it not stand to reason that Blogs can be used as trustworthy sources?<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Pete Arnold</a> 17:34, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I can't comment on CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, etc. as I don't work for any of those companies. They have their own views on blogging... and besides, they are news media. Wikipedia is not, it is an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Self-published_sources_as_secondary_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Self-published sources as secondary sources</a> guideline is pretty clear when it states "...personal websites, blogs, and other self-published or vanity publications should not be used as secondary sources." They simply are not a reliable source. blogs might be on the bleeding edge of information dissemination, but Wikipedia is a reactive media, not a proactive media. It is an encyclopedia, not a news site; the purpose is not to "disseminate news". If a blog is the primary or only source for information, it can't be seen as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. If a blog is simply reprinting what has been said elsewhere, then Wikipedia should be using the source feeding the blog (provided it is a reliable source of course) and not the blog. Blogs generally have huge verifiability &amp; POV problems.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:54, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Ambiguous nature of Wiki's rules not only allows editors to make judgement calls, but allows preferencial treatment of some articles, and exclusion of others based on editorial opinion. If rules are going to be cited as criteria to be meet inorder to be allouable in Wiki, then Ambiguous or not, of something meets those criteria, it would be expected to be kept. Race to the Right meets the notability guidelines by having 1. A large fan base and 2. name recoginition. The entires on the contributiers to Race to the Right (Tony Garcia and Pete Arnold) show what makes Race to the Right what it is. <a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Pete Arnold</a> 20:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think it has been demonstrated that the radio show has a large fan base or name recognition. All you've provided is the contention that the personal blog of the show's host gets 360 or so hits a week, which isn't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> to begin with, and doesn't establish the fan base of the radio show. Name recognition has also not been established. Where is the evidence of that? Finally, even if notability is verifiably proven for the show, Tony Garcia &amp; Pete Arnold are not notable by association. They both need to meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines or a very copelling reason needs to be given to ignore the guidelines in this case. This has not been done at this point. It's also interesting to note that the only <i>Keep</i> opinions rendered so far are by people associated with the show.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 00:35, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi. My name is Derek, and I listen to this show in ocasionally St. Cloud. I think Isotope sounds like he realy wants this gone even though Race to the right is on the air and does have an audience. I am also insulted by the thought of St. cloud being a small town. If short articles in wikipedia exist for other radio shows, there is no reason for this one to be deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.13.234.55 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.13.234.55_ed8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.13.234.55">contribs</a>) 15:10, 19 October 2006.</small> <small>— 70.13.234.55 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.13.234.55_ed8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.13.234.55">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p><b>Delete</b> this article seems to be a person just promoting himself. The popularity of the show is not only un<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, but is actually diminished in my view by the length of the article. A national syndicated radio host who is actually 'popular', Sean Hannity, has an entry roughly similar in size to a sunday afternoon radio show on an AM station in a small market in a small market state.

<li>Keep. If the article it is linked to is about a real topic--it is--then placing the glossary here simply extends the article without overrunning the size limitations. I do not see why this is a problem. I think that calling it names like "a weasel way out" is simply foisting a denigrating lexicon onto the attempt at coherence for the article--not an argument so much as failure to have an argument and resorting to abuse. I do not mean that to be insulting, I am just saying it is the old ad hominem trap that we all fall into from time to time. The article itself is about a very complicated text and the glossary serves the purpose of supporting it well.</li>

<p>This is just an observation--I am still going through this stuff and some of it is mind-numbingly off the wall--but to some extent this entire section comprises a real treasure--at least it will be in a generation or two. It chronicles many aspects of pop cutlure. Albeit not very well in some cases but if we had this sort of collection of articles on say, 13th century England, it would be highly valued. I am just saying, before completely deleting all of any article, ask yourself what would it signify to a reader who will not be born for another 20 years. So, careful with the broad strokes. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 02:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hardly any of these terms are of value to non-players (in which case the main article should cover them anyway), and even those that are can be better understood from the manual/guide/review/game/llama/etc. Let's make it very simple: if these terms are extremely notable give them their own articles; if not, mention them in the main article; if not notable enough even for that, <i>get them off the <s>plane</s> wiki</i>. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 02:01, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Inaccurate/misleading or at least unsourced/unproven claim that a common language phrasing is a specific kind of scientific jargon. The quote shown in the article does not prove anything about jargon (and presents a poor and misleading interpretation of the quote), only that the writer is using a common English term, "pet". The external link leads to a newspaper article (about an</b></i> <b>artist</b>s theory about a particular aspect of the <i>history of art</i>) which only uses the term in the headline. "Pet theory" is used to mean "especially favourite/cherished" theory but the term "pet" can be used in the same way for other contexts. E.g. as this dictionary definition puts it:"<i><a href="http://dictionary.laborlawtalk.com/Pet" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.laborlawtalk.com/Pet" rel="nofollow">pet: , a. Petted; indulged; admired; cherished; as, a pet child; a pet lamb; a pet theory; a pet animal.Some young lady's pet curate.</a></i>". At best, the term could be a bit of scientific slang i.e. a dictionary definition (but again there is no proof of this given). The previous afd (ended in no consensus in May 2005... article has not improved substantially since then) revolved around the dicdef issue: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pet_theory_922c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pet theory">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pet theory</a> . <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:09, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Remove</b> Many people might object to being listed as a porn star, so it is absolutely essential that any name on the list be backed up by reliable sources. If one of the articles that is Wikilinked to is deleted for any reason, the source references no longer exist, but the name would remain in the list. A category would not have this problem. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 21:20, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Redundant to the cat. Yes, lists serve a different purpose than catagories, largely in that they can be expanded to include additional information about each entry. That hasn't happened here, though, making this information a less-maintainable duplicate of the category. Even if someone were to sit down and write a blurb about each and every entry on the list (of which there are very many, making it an unlikely event), we would be left with something so huge as to be of extremely limited usefulness. As such, I am&#160;!voting delete on the grounds that this adds nothing useful to the encyclopedia. Also it is entirely unsourced. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 20:04, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I take it you're meaning "moot point" in the American sense rather than the entirely different British sense? Not really, since this is Wikipedia and we can add to articles at any time. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 23:43, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. You are correct; I've been living in the States for a few years now. Hehe. At any rate, I'm not sure that encouraging the creation of redlinks in a list like this would be a desirable, as it would attract articles on even less notable pornstars than we already see every day at AfD. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 00:19, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I nominate this article to be deleted because it does not pass wikipedia's notability critereon in regards to works of fiction. The article is entirely a plot summary or description of a fictional setting, whereas wikipedia fiction notability guidelines require there to be some sort of encylopedic content connecting the fiction to the real world (for example "kuat drive yards was contraversial amongst the star wars fan fiction community, who thought that the space ships should have been created by the force, this led to a large letter writing protest targetting lucas arts"). As I believe there is not one scentence any person could write in this article that is not a plot summary, biography or description of a fictional place, I nominate it for deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Laimerpramer (<a href="../../../l/a/i/User_talk%7ELaimerpramer_9ea6.html" title="User talk:Laimerpramer">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Laimerpramer_00f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Laimerpramer">contribs</a>).</small></p>

There are very few performer of this fetish, also people out of her field would most certainly be interested in her because of its strangeness.

Creditable indepedent sources are not a requirement in WP:PORNBIO because producing a film in itself is creditable.

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe the reasons why WP:PORNBIO does not mention WP:V in the same manner is because the method of proving WP:V with pornographic actresses can be confirmed simply through videos and films. One can confirm that she uses the practice of extreme fetishes with piercings and weights by watching her videos. I have not found other actresses which share a similar practice. WP:PORNBIO is good for this reason. In the event of rare fetishes esp in case of a European performer it can be difficult to find other sources which mention this performer. However, she is very popular on forums and underground articles such as the ones cited. I think we should be hopeful that this article will be a vital part of Wikipedia and wait to see whether or not WP:PORNBIO passes or not because according to the proposed guidelines she is a definite keep. Also people should check other languages to see if she is mentioned. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 13:34, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I am not well-versed in Christian music. The article really doesn't make much of a claim for notability, but they do have several albums listed - anybody know if they are major label releases? GassyGuy 07:41, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Opinion</b> I am fairly knowledgeable about Christian rock, having heard a lot of it growing up. These were only major label releases as far as the Christian market was concerned - these guys spent a number of years on <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_Records_5fdc.html" title="Word Records">Word Records</a>, which is the biggest fish in that pond (example - Word Records also has <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Grant_018d.html" title="Amy Grant">Amy Grant</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_W._Smith_dd4b.html" title="Michael W.

This band is still around; I saw them perform in 1987 and 2000, and actually thought their 2000 performance was better. I understand there is a movement underway to document the history of the rock and punk subgenres of Christian music and their influence, I hope for posterity's sake this entry won't be deleted.

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b> This article comes across as an advertising platform for the benefit of a specific university group and an associated conference. Much or even most of the content should be removed as insufficiently notable for the weight given to it. Barely any mention is given to the "seminal work" which coined the term compared with the Loughborough content, and there is a lack of broader discourse references. Having said that, I think the term does have currency in geography, and I would support a keep based on a rewrite addressing the issues. If there is serious copyright infringement too, than the rewrite needs to be even more comprehensive. If it doesn't occur, than I vote <b>weak delete</b> <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd go along with the above: either rewrite substantially, to get rid of the "world cities research begins and ends in Loughborough" "undue weight" (if not rampant self-promotion) issues, or else rescope and rename it as a GaWC article, and start <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_city.html" title="World city">world city</a> and/or <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_city.html" title="Global city">global city</a> from a clean slate. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 22:14, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The concept is notable, and the term 'global city' is thrown around a lot in economics, political science, geography and international studies. However, I agree with Bwithh and Krm that there needs to be some changes; I'm not convinced that Loughborough University has a monopoly on the concept so I believe the article should be a bit more comprehensive, offering different ways of conceptualizing what precisely constitutes a global city by looking to other sources outside GaWC. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:17, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>(ec)I don't believe anyone's arguing for original research, just toning down the rewriting of the history of the concept to make it entirely about GaWC.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - The problem with this article is that the term "global city" is a very important one in terms of usage in human geography, (development) economics and wider social sciences. To this degree, it is important that Wikipedia has an article about the terminology. However, it is an incredibly POV term and its usage naturally sees individuals wanting to "big up" their city - a look at the page's history illustrates countless edits to this degree. GaWC are the only electronic source that attempt to actually define the term, and thus can provide a definitive list of "global cities". It would be nice if there were other sources so that this article could take a more generalised approach, but they do not seem to be readily available, and hence why the article has taken its present form of regurgitated information from the source. Changes could be made, but it is essential that the article remains <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV"><b>neutral</b></a>, and this cannot be done unless based on external sources. <b><a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi"><span style="color:#CC0018">DJR</span></a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../d/j/r/User_talk%7EDjr_xi_f6e8.html" title="User talk:Djr xi"><span style="color: navy"><b>T</b></span></a>)</small> 10:48, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

If you want to expand an article you are welcome to do it without any polls. But you should write new sections only basing on verified sources. In other way it will be original research.

The title itself is an NPOV violation, as are the opening paragraphs, both of which treat the "forgery" as settled fact, even though the UK still insists to this day the documents were accurate. In any case, the article is largely a laundry list of data points that don't provide any direct evidence to back up its accusations, and are in some cases self-contradictory. I believe Wikipedia should have an article about the yellowcake incident, but this article is so hopelessly one-sided that I think it's best that it get an official <b>delete</b> consensus so that a new one can be built from scratch; any attempt at major editing to this one will just lead to POV-based rv wars. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 18:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is absurd. This is not what AFD is for. First, try editing the article in the normal process. You say you'll get hopeless POV battles, but you haven't tried. Are you saying here that others are POV, or yourself? If other's that's pretty much the ultimate violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> considering you haven't discussed it at all over there. If it is a POV-battle, then you take it to RFC or to mediation. This is simply not a valid delete reason, and the nomination is an end-run around standard Wikipedia procedure. You have <b>not</b> placed a POV tag on the article. You have <b>not</b> made a single edit on the talk page. You have <b>not</b> specified a single POV complaint other than the title, which is now changed (it was verfiably a forgery anyway, so that wasn't even a good reason). Also, if we're AFD'ing things for NPOV, how long do you expect your own personal re-write to last before it gets AFD'd? What exactly are your credentials that you think AFD should "endorse" <b>you</b> personally for a re-write, as seems to be your rationale? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 04:02, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oops. I guess it is not controversial so far as Bush and most opponents of his policies are concerned. Who does that leave still denying it is a forgery? Any evidence the British still claim the documents are genuine, despite the reported anachronisms? The <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butler_Review_bb12.html" title="Butler Review">Butler Review</a> by the British on prewar intelligence says "the forged documents were not available to the British Government at the time its assessment was made.” So it seems hard to find any government still claiming the documents were authentic. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 04:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> One point is that forgery is a crime, and without either a conviction or a confession from the individual alleged to have committed the forgery it's best just in the legal sense to avoid the word "forgery". Some American government droid saying the paper is a forgery is not proof that it is. A sworn confession from the specific individual who put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) might be. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic">Charlene.fic</a> 12:39, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> (but clean-up, or even rewrite as per Aaron). As the article says, certain documents "proving" that Saddam Hussein's regime tried to purchase yellowcake from Niger turned out to be forged. Hence the current name is appropriate.<br />
OTOH, the article should make it clearer that there is other evidence for that attempted purchase which has not been discredited. (For one presentation of some of that evidence, see <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2148995" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2148995" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2150433/" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2150433/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li>Would you mind listing a <i>specific</i> NPOV violation on the talk page over there. It's one thing to assert that they can't be neutral. But you haven't even taken the effort to point one out. These supposed hopeless POV problems don't leap off the page at me, so specifiying a few for discussion before condemning the article is not too much to ask I think. As to OR, I see many citations to mainstream news sources, so identifying a few parts which are OR would also be helpful. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 05:05, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep:</b> I hate deleting an article for NPOV violations. The better course is nearly always to edit it into shape. Although GRBerry sounds convincing. I'm willing to help in recrafting it. There are some complications here:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Yellowcake forgery was a forgery, and that's not POV, that's just fact.</li>
<li>Some statements were made by the Bush administration saying that Bush's comments on yellowcake from Africa shouldn't have been put in the State of the Union speech (those White House statements need to be exactly sourced, I don't think they are in the article, but I do think they came from the White House spokesman). Despite the fact that the Bush administration said it made a mistake, there's plenty of evidence on the record indicating no such mistake was made and Bush's comment in the State of the Union message was accurate. This is a confusing situation and the article, because of constant POV pushing within it, just makes it more confusing.</li>
<li>The Butler report does reject the idea that the yellowcake forgery was what British intelligence relied on. That needs to be high up in the story, now it's near the bottom.</li>
<li>The article has a statement casting doubt on the Butler report. No original research, please. Just cite someone else casting doubt -- and then be ready for cited statements in support of the integrity of the Butler commission.</li>
<li>The larger point about Saddam's regime and yellowcake is whether or not he was trying to get it. There needs to be a statement up high saying that there are assertions that he was trying to get it and those assertions are independent of the forgery. Perhaps this whole article should be merged into a larger article about that. In the long run, the yellowcake forgery may not be notable enough for an article of its own, although I think it is at this point (and probably for as long as we're in Iraq).<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:52, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per the NPOV issue. I would like to say keep but I would be kidding myself to believe after surviving an AfD that the editors holding the article in its current form will simply allow it to be rewritten in a less POV manner, then it wouldnt serve its purpose would it? I think this should be added possibly to other articles however covering reasons given by the administration for gonig to war, or broken up and inserted into the appropriate larger articles, but its current state is misleading and I have seen too many articles on AfD with promises to fix NPOV violations just to have those same authors not change the article because "it passed AfD, so its fine" --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:20, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure what to do here. The article should definitely be moved and at least partially rewritten but I'm not convinced that deleting and recreating is the best approach. Perhaps a straw poll on renaming on the articles talk page would have been the better approach? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 15:26, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I renamed it for npov; trivial to fix so certainly not an AFD issue. But, the topic is absolutely without question notable. This nomination borders on the absurd. Extremely well-cited. Could use some polishing, which would be a much more constructive use of time than debating an AFD on a clearly notable topic. Nominator even concedes notability, with "promise" to re-write his own version. Umm, that's a new use for AFD. States it is hopeleslly POV, but has not even placed a POV tag on the page, and <b>has not even made a single edit to the talk page</b>.

<dd>We will not be able to write an article about the <b>"Niger Uranium Documents"</b> for <i>decades</i>, until those documents are declassified. We can and should have an article about some of those documents, because there is plenty of information on the public record. The documents in question (1) came from Italian intelligence, (2) stated that Saddam's regime had tried to buy yellowcake from Niger and (3) were later exposed as forgeries. Hence <b>"Yellowcake forgeries"</b> is an accurate title. That some people attempt to tar all the intelligence regarding Saddam's attempts to acquire Nukes with the forgery brush is not an argument for deleting this article.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for that link, csloat. Can we put that in the article?</dd>
<dd>I see my preceding comment wasn't clear enough. Western intelligence agencies have lots of "Niger Uranium Documents", only a few of which have become public. It is impossible to write a good article about those that are still secret, but we can write one about the ones which are now public — which were forgeries about yellowcake. (BTW, I've seen speculation that the forgeries were a simple but lucrative confidence trick, inspired perhaps by <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigerian_419_scam.html" title="Nigerian 419 scam">nearby confidence tricksters</a>.)

<dd>Agreed, this stuff should be in the article. I'm not sure what other "Niger uranium documents" you're referring to; unless we want an article about the history of uranium transactions from Niger but that really isn't what this article was ever about. It's about documents that show that Iraq tried to purchase uranium from Niger in the leadup to the Iraq war, that were cited as evidence that Saddam sought such uranium. Since Saddam didn't seek such uranium, no such documents exist, and the ones that do exist are obvious forgeries. There are no other classified documents that I am aware of on this matter. (It is true Saddam sought such purchases in 1981, and there are probably documents about that, but that was never what this article was about). There is a little side show about the Butler Report that some conservatives apparently still harp on about, but the consensus of opinion among experts looking seriously at this issue appears to be that it is a bunch of hooey. Certainly I haven't heard of anyone suggesting that there are other Niger uranium documents lurking somewhere that show that Saddam was actually seeking uranium from Niger all along.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 06:58, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the point is to demonstrate how greatly the organization has grown, then why isn't a sentence that says "In 2000, the Salvation Army had 400 chapters, whereas in 1900 they had only 50" sufficient? <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 01:41, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I vote to <b>keep</b> this article - I found it very interesting, though incomplete. Very worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. I'm sure people in some of the communities where there was a Salvation Army meeting place in 1900 would be interested to know this. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetepetepete_d533.html" title="User:Petepetepete">Petepetepete</a> 12:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> My comments are not "adverse" or antagonistic; this being a discussion/debate, I'm trying to demonstrate that this article does not meet the criteria for inclusion, partially by pointing out that the objections you and Petepetepete have raised are not valid reasons for inclusion. Discussion is the point of AfD. If you think that the article does meet the criteria, then it shouldn't be a problem for you to argue as such. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 02:09, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Counting Google hits is not research. Actually reading the pages that Google turns up is research. You did a search.

<li>The thing is, I'm not familiar with the art world, so it's hard for me to say which of these sites counts as non-trivial. There's been some discussion of this on the article's talk page, and no one there is certain the subject is notable enough either. I'm not saying the article should definitely be deleted, just that no one who's edited the article (other than the subject herself) is sure that this belongs here and we'd like to get a few more perspectives. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedRollerskate_20f6.html" title="User:RedRollerskate">RedRollerskate</a> 19:11, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

An artist called "Amy Banker" is quoted in a local Portland, Oregon newspaper article about choosing interesting Christmas presents was the most substantive I could find. She may be of some note in the artworld circles though. I'll try to see if any of the book references in the article are online. In any case, the article needs a lot of cutting down and editing if kept - currently it is a badly formatted resume. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:07, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>A non-trivial source is something that provides in-depth information on the subject, and is more than a simple directory listing.

I say Weak Delete because I see a value in such articles, however the article's topic is not an exceptional case, so either the guidelines must be changed or this article must be deleted.

<li>Somebody at an IP address registered to Learning By Grace, a company owned by Mimi Rothchild, originated the original wiki entry that was deleted as advertising. This one was edited to reflect Mimi's well documented history with charter schools in Pennsylvania. Mimi is not worthy of a Wikipedia entry and hopefully she has learned from this that Wikipedia is not a venue for self promotion. I support the nomination for deletion.--IAATM 20:36, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At least one article on Ms. Rothchild has already been deleted. Both that one and this new one were originally written in the style of an advertisement, and thus were inappropriate. This one has been edited by several people to both tone down the advertising and to include reference to Ms. Rothschild's involvement with the controversial Einstein charter school, an important part of Ms. Rothschild's history in the cyber-education field. The information about Einstein was verifible and cited credible references. If there is to be an article on Ms. Rothchild (and I can see the argument either way), it must be written in a neutral point of view, the information must be verifiable, and it must not be a veiled advertisement for Ms. Rothchild's current projects. People who wish to make changes to this article are encouraged to use the talk page for the article to work out their differences. Stargirl7 21:02, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, if you remove all of the advertising from the current version, there's not much left:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"Mimi Rothschild is a child’s rights advocate" - not verified or supported.</p>
<p>"has authored a total of seven books on children’s education including Cyberspace for Kids" - I'll accept this.</p>
<p>"is the founder of several, distinguished online homeschooling academies" - <i>distingushed</i> is clearly advertising, the rest is OK.</p>
<p>"all created to assist homeschooling families with their every educational need" - advertising.</p>
<p>"Mimi Rothschild has helped change the face of education" - unsupported opinion. "using her own homeschooling experiences with her eight children; both Mimi Rothschild and her husband have reshaped the homeschooling experience for families all over the world" - again, advertising and unsupported.</p>
<p>"The Jubilee Academy, The Grace Academy, and The MorningStar Academy are all online homeschooling academies" - this is fine.</p>
<p>"that offer homeschooling parents innovative tools to educate their children in the home environment." - as do any other online schools; this description of an online school is better put on a page about online schools.</p>
<p>"The homeschooling academies that are overseen by Rothschild offer courses that are rooted in the Christian faith and the teachings of Christ." - advertising, though it could be modified to work.</p>
<p>"With a firm focus on the child’s individual development, courses are structured to address the unique needs of every child. Each course provides the child with the opportunity to improve their socialization skills, better their ethics, and to openly learn about the world in a real world setting." - advertising, plus veering away from being about Ms Rothschild herself.</p>
<p>"The MorningStar Academy offers 140 courses and courses focus on subjects such as English, Mathematics, Science, Art, Music, Technology, Health, History, Global Languages, Bible Studies, and more. Each course is created to meet the needs of the child that has attained a particular grade level of proficiency, and all of the homeschooling courses offered at The MorningStar Academy are structured to meet the needs of homeschoolers at particular grade levels, from elementary to high school levels." - again, this is more about the school itself rather than Ms. Rothchild, and generally is typical of all such schools.</p>
<p>"Included with the course enrollment, homeschooling families are offered an array of educational services including a 180-week lesson plan, educational transcripts, regular progress reports, access to a video library, and academic counselors are readily available to assist homeschooling parents with questions and concerns. The Grace Academy follows suit and offers courses for children that are kindergarten level to high school level. Meanwhile, the Jubilee Academy online differs from the Morningstar Academy only in the fact that it offers homeschooling parents the opportunity to start their homeschoolers early with a pre-school program. Further, each of the academies offers CD Rom based lessons for homeschoolers, a course catalog for children of every age, interactive Internet activities, and avenues of digital and paperless learning." - this is pure advertising, and again is about the schools rather than Ms. Rothschild.</p>
<p>Taking out the advertising, you are left with: "Mimi Rothschild has authored a total of seven books on children’s education including Cyberspace for Kids and is the founder of several online homeschooling academies. The Jubilee Academy, The Grace Academy, and The MorningStar Academy are all online homeschooling academies." (This is of course leaving aside the question of whether Ms. Rothschild's involvement with Einstein should be included.) I believe this article should be either deleted as advertising, or modified to include only verifiable information about Ms. Rothschild. (Note that this article was "speedy-deleted" once as advertising, but was re-posted.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it was speedy deleted the first time, and then Mimi (or her representative) decided to repost the advertisement. Since it was apparent at that point that we were playing whack-a-mole, several people decided to edit the article instead so that it was an accurate representation on Mimi Rothschild's contribution to cyber-schooling. You'll note that the article Mimi (or her representatives) object to is written in a neutral POV, and includes citations to other reputable sources for all included issues. The only version that has any business being on the wiki is the latest stargirl7 version. I and others are willing to agree to a delete just to make Mimi go away. However, what we won't stand for is her willful misrepresentation of her own history, thereby potentially misleading unknowing people that are researching her current cyber school operations. Anybody thinking about spending $2000 a year with her business has a right to know all the facts, not just the facts Mimi wants to advance.--71.161.45.242 00:49, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That is me above - thought I was signed in. --IAATM 00:51, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At a minimum Ms. Rothschild satisfies the "Google Test" - 79,000 results, first 10 results are all for the person in question, and, excluding the Answers.Com mirror of Wikipedia, all are different domains and different content. On the other hand, all that the most recent stargirl17 edit really tells you is what Rothschild's most basic and verifiable claims are, plus stuff about the Einstein controversy -- all of which can also be learned from scanning the first 10 entries on Google; the top result is anti-Rothschild, and the next down (after Wikipedia) is Rothschild's own site. I'm very slightly in favor of keeping the article, but given the amount of reverting going on, I'm not sure whether any kind of a stable page can be achieved -- and while she might be important enough for a short article, she's not important enough for everyone to keep worrying about it.

<li>So, to sum up the comments so far, I don't see anyone arguing that the article should definately be kept. It's pretty much all "delete"s or weak "keep"s, so current consensus seems to be "delete". Anyone want to chime in and make a stronger case for keeping this one?

<dd>Eight people in one year? That's less than a pittance. Besides, ignoring the original creator and the AfD, there's an anonymous IP (who probably is or knows the OP, in all likelihood), plus a bot, a spelling fix, AWB, and <i>one</i> person who made an actual contribution to the article (who has roughly 35 mainspace edits). Eight editors in one year? Twently edits in a year?

<dd>A pre-university school is most commonly known as a high school, although there are exceptions, such as a <a href="../../../c/e/g/CEGEP_3a45.html" title="CEGEP">CEGEP</a>. If the school is actually a tertiary or post-secondary institution, then we should remember that most such institutions are notable. I left the {{subst:adw|NAME OF ARTICLE}} messages on the talk pages because the nominator had chosen not to. Remember that <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> states: "It is generally considered civil to notify the good-faith creator and any main contributors of the article that you are nominating the article." Some comments refer to this school as a business. The context suggests that it is a not-for-profit charitable organization, but I have been unable to confirm this. That having been said, I feel that the term "crazy" is offensive and inappropriate, and I would ask the person who used that term to withdraw it. I think that the material that <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> found ought to be mentioned in the article. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 04:37, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having done some original research (I know we're not supposed to do that) and called around, I've found no evidence that LC International School has been accredited. Unaccredited schools are not normally notable. This appears to be a for-profit business of dubious notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> We have my brother's high school on Wikipedia. What's the diff. Actually, someone should have left the original Linda Christas alone as well. Too many editors who have emotional problems at Wikipedia. Another example, someone is going out of their way to put the word FUCK on Pat Boone's site, and reference to Amway. But the same person deletes that Pat Boone is President of the University Board at Pepperdine, and holds a chair at Linda Christas in honor of the black and blind concert Pianist John William Boone. I mean, the editor likes Fuck and Amway, but not Pepperdine University and Linda Christas. He's done it about ten times. Doesn't say much for the judgement of the editors. I'm going to put it in again. See if you see it when you check. I assume that the REAL editors of Wikipedia might agree that Pepperdine is a bit more notable that Fuck. Well, maybe not.Oppieangel2000</li>

<li><b>Keep It</b> I think people are missing the point here. Linda Christas is a three country school. Wikipedia has one horse town schools in the Encyclopedia, so what is the problem with Linda Christas other than it's a good place for kids. Also, people need to understand that the web site for all three Linda Christas schools is listed under just Linda Christas, not Linda Christas International. The International designation is relatively recent because of their success in China. So ANY hit you get with a Linda Christas search and there are lots of them is good for Linda Christas International. Also, I agree with one of the comments above. The people like The Taoist, and the Miles Williams of the world are really crazy. If those kinds of people win something like this, we are lost.<small>— 71.142.236.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.142.236.117_94c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.142.236.117">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The negative material I see on Google regarding Linda Christas has nothing to do with anyone or anybody who knows anything about Linda Christas. That's what's happening here. The negative posts are from people who a reasonable person would listen to and then do the exact opposite thing. A Taoist and a Racist. I mean, Linda Christas was accused of racism. Take a look at the faces on their Board. If one can call this school racist, then the KKK is not.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, this school is worthy of being on Wikipedia. If one is counting socks, maybe not. But if one is really wanting to have something worthwhile on the data base then, for heavens sake, girls, back off. Linda Christas has been supported on D.C. Radio. New York City Radio (Public service radio - not high pressure sales radio). It has a record of ZERO BBB complaints unsatisfied. I mean this school is attacked everywhere it tries to help kids, and help kids they do (without one penny of our tax money). One lady wrote a letter complaining that she didn't like the name of the School and if they didn't change it, she was going to file with the BBB. I mean really!!!!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I ask you, why would you delete this school when if you just read the stuff that is said that is negative about Linda Christas you will see that none of the people complaining have a single child in the school. They just like to complain, as so many Americans do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Linda Christas is an elite school with some of the best minds and personalities in the world supporting it. Captain Jim Lovell (Apollo 13) is considering accepting a seat on the Linda Christas Advisory Committee, and NONE of the celebrities or scientists or authors that currently are on the Committee are paid a dime to contribute their leadership to the school. Again, if you girls are salvageable, there is no doubt about the merits of Linda Christas. This article needs to stay. ShirleyDobbins

Wouldn't we say by extension then that Linda Christs is deserving of at least a small space. For example, the Pat Boone listing is several times the length of the proposed Linda Christas site. I say keep the site, and if necessary have some portions re-written although it seems pretty objective to me as it is.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Are you guys serious that you want to get all the trash from trashy people and put that in Linda Christas' write-up. Why??? The people who have written on the net anything negative about Linda Christas know nothing about the school. Just read the comments. It would be like including the 3000 unanswered BBB complaints that IBM currently has on file. Why not put that in the IBM article???? Because the complaints against IBM are generally made because there was a loose wire somewhere, and not necessarily in the equipment. If you go to legitimate sources for complaints like the BBB....maybe. But IBM's 3000 unanswered complaints ARE with the BBB. So now with Linda Christas that has had ONE BBB complaint in nine years, and that one not even from a family who had a student in the school, that's what you are going to use to characterize this school???

<li><b>Comment</b> I see that all attempts to correct the unfounded assumptions being made by the reviewers here are being deleted. For example, the gossip with no substantiation or checking with Linda Christas is being allowed. But, anyone offering substantitive actual experience with the school is evidently not worthy of consideration.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am also a student at Linda Christas, and the student body is becoming amazed at the low level of research that passes for objectivity here. At least Opal was willing to give you guys a chance to correct these mistakes that you have been making. But, evidently Wikipedia is not interested in facts, just gossip. So be it. I sure am not going to recommend that anybody look to you guys for reliable information if a school like mine can be banned from being listed. I'm suprised you have Harvard listed. But you do. Also, Altamont Kindergarten. Now there's a notable school for you. I'll drop by to see if they even know you've got them. CYRIL LEE

<p><b>Comment</b> Yes, I understand. However, this policy is like saying that if I call you a crook, then you must find a party who doesn't know you to deny the charge. I don't see how a rule of this kind can possibly end up with other than the grimmest innacuracies. You can see this kind of thing in action on this talk page. Only persons who don't seem to have the slightest idea about Linda Christas can be quoted, and all of them are certainly light years away from center. Dr. Mason Ridge Drraymondridge</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I can see why you might feel that way. Yes, some people on this page feel that Linda Christas is not legitimate. I'm one of them. I could be wrong, so could everyone else. I think there are two issues in play here, each of them with different places they should be played out. If you don't like the <i>policy</i> of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, then you need to go here: <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_715d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources">Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources</a>. We'll call that page #1. If you feel the policy is not being used correctly on this page, then this is the page to discuss it. We'll call this page #2. If you have complaints about the policy not being used correctly and complain about them at page #1, then no one will pay attention (wrong place). If you have complaints about the policy itself, and post about it in page #2, you will look like someone that <i>only cares about this one article and no others</i>. Wikipedians really hate that.

<dd>Yes, I see your point here. But, I have no desire to begin a parliamentarian discussion of Roberts Rules. I just think that if the policies lead you to exclude a person or entity I know to be at the forefront of educational practice, if not theory, that is a disservice to anyone who might appreciate a look at the present with a bias (in a positive sense) toward the future. In that situation, only traditional organizations and theories will have an opportunity to meet with favor here, and in this age of speed and dynamic change, Wikipedia will become less desirable as a source than many of the established encyclopedias. (The yearly Americana is normally obsolete upon publication. That's one reason that Google and Metacrawler are consulted BEFORE Wikipedia. They understand the need for virtual change. Unless Wikipedia can overcome its own inertia, I'm afraid it will rapidly become massively redundant.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Said differently, accuracy is one thing;being the best is another. I had hoped (and still hope) that Wikipedia can maneuver out from under the weight of encyclopedic "tradition" and truly become the dynamic venture that was its original vision. To that end I am certainly willing to contribute to Wikipedia. I am, however, going to allow this issue with Linda Christas to be a litmus test for me. If with all the input now posted on the net, and with the trade references and reputations of the persons supporting Linda Christas, the rules of inclusion/exclusion have already grown so cumbersome (not to say Jurassic) at Wikipedia so as to exclude Linda Christas, Wikipedia has moved beyond my personal exclusion "Event Horizon." On the other hand, if obstacles to the publication of the newest and most eagerly awaited societal changes can be reflected in something approaching real time by Wikipedia, without a planetary eruption when "traditional" long term sources are not available, Wikipedia will indeed be the FIRST knowledge source ever to surpass the glories of a search engine by virtue of its scholarship. If you wish, I am willing to interview the principals at this school, and re-create something for you to look at. But, from my perspective what they have already provided to the Wikipedia authorities, seems sufficient to maintain their listing. I can certainly corroborate some of it myself. (For example, I have met and entertained Efrem Zimbalist Jr. on several occasions. He is a very family oriented individual who loved and respected his father and mother very much. With his work at the Curtis Institute (which I do not see mentioned on his listing with Wikipedia, and his acceptance of a chair with Linda Christas, I frankly don't understand how Wikipedia can exclude these facts.

<dl>
<dd>If this institution is indeed noteable for "[being] at the forefront of educational practice, if not theory" then surely you can cite some <a href="../../../r/_/_/WP%7ER_3abc.html" title="WP:R">reliable</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources to substantiate that claim. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 05:33, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Again, you've provided absolutely no way for anyone to verify your claim. You say Christas was in "Curious Parent" magazine. Is this it: <a href="http://www.curiousparents.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.curiousparents.com/" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>&#160;? If so, it's very small. Which issue has an article about Christas in it? If Efrem Zimbalist is involved, why is his picture on the website a 50 year old headshot (He's 88 years old now)? Why not a picture of him with a staff member or student? Over and over again, all we get are testimonials ("Linda Christas saved my life!") and unsupported assertions ("Linda Christas is on the cutting edge of educational edge cutting!") You act offended that we aren't taking your word for it. Well, we're not supposed to. Wikipedia articles are considered guilty until proven innocent, and no evidence <i>that has not provably come from outside of the Linda Christas organization</i> has appeared. If you could get one of the celebrities listed as an endorser to come forward <i>without any Christas employee acting as a go between</i> and discuss their support of the organization, it would help, but it would probably not get the article all the way. Celebrity endorsements are not enough by themselves. Oh, and by the way, I often lose track of things here and there, but I never ever forget my own first name. You've been going back and forth between Raymond and Mason. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 07:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my substantial travels, I have seen Linda Christas mentioned in several newspapers, albeit not the New York Times. One newspaper was in the Los Angeles area (Los Cerritos Community News), and the other when I was traveling in Oregon (Argus Newspapers) I have also heard Linda Christas mentioned on public radio at least in Watertown, New York (Their fund raising auction in 2005. Linda Christas had donated a scholarship to them to auction off.) And, as mentioned, you can find articles about the school in Curious Parent Magazine. Further, some public high school districts have recently been picking up the Linda Christas rules for selecting extracurricular eactivities, Dedham High School District, for example.</dd>

<dd>Keep in mind that Linda Christas is not a traditional school with a traditional campus, There are no buildings for the tax payers to support with the name Linda Christas over the doors. And, no reporters COVERING Linda Christas FOOTBALL. Linda Christas receives no tax money, nor tax favored money. They have approximately 4000 students internationally. I personally know two of the students currently studying to attend U.S. Universities next year who live in south east China (If it would help, I can ask their permission for you to contact them for verification.) You can contact any of the people on the Advisory Committee to ascertain the existence of the school if you wish. Surely, we are not going to be so petty as to deny that the MOST convincing and important material about Linda Christas, they have already published for the world to see.) Certainly that must count for something. If I asked the writer above to substantiate his or her existence, surely if Dr. Gregory Huckabee, former high ranking officer in the Adjutant Corps were willing to verify the fine work he/she (the writer above) were doing, wouldn't that be superior to his/her name being registered in a box score in the Baltimore Sun? Or are we so convinced that the traditional means of doing everything is what we want for Wikipedia. Dr. Shroeder P.S. I know Dr. Mason R. Ridge by reputation only.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not one of the Linda Christas Advisory Committee receives a penny for lending their names to LC for verification purposes. It is simply a pro bono arrangement all around. The only thing that the members of the Advisory Committee are guilty of is being impressed enough with LC to be willing to link their names and reputations with Linda Christas.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Let me ask a question here: Let's take for our example the pioneering surgeon, Dr. Ronald Allison (put his name into the Google search engine) who sits on the Linda Christas Advisory Committee without pay. Is Wikipedia saying that BEFORE Dr. Allison knew enough about Linda Christas to agree to serve on the Advisory Committee without pay, he would have been a personage Wikipedia would have accepted for verification of its (LC's) existence. However, since Dr. Allison was evidently impressed enough to have his name linked with Linda Christas he is now disqualified? Does that go for the rest of the people who purposely allowed their names to be used for verification as well?.... though again NONE of the members of the Advisory Committee are paid a nickel for their efforts on behalf of the School. Is Wikipedia taking the position that if a celebrity or noted personality goes out of their way for FREE to help an organization, Wikipedia disqualifies that person or persons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Said differently, I am getting the impression that, since Linda Christas' intent was to recruit noted, responsible people to be on their Advisory Committee, so that parents could verify the quality of the Linda Christas offerings, this very act of getting the person on the Committee disqualifies that person from verifying that the School exists. So, let's say Captain Jim Lovell joins the Committee as he might, he's considering it, but like the others, wanted, of course, to investigate before committing. Now, BEFORE Captain Lovell completes his study of the School to decide if he can support its programs, before he has done that, Wikipedia will accept Captain Lovell's judgment in terms of verifying Linda Christas' existence. But, if he actually becomes enthused about LC and accepts a seat on the Committee, then he is disqualified according to the Wikipedia rules?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's really difficult for me to see the logic in that case. It would be like verifying that George Bush is still physically functional by disqualifying his Cabinet, and then asking the guard in the White House lobby for verification. Can this be? Can Wikipedia really have such a policy, and remain respected???</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am just wanting to understand who in the world an organization might call upon to know enough about it to be favorably impressed, BUT NOT TOO FAVORABLY impressed, i.e. a level of impression that is sufficient for them NOT to want to help that organization, and yet having enough information to satisfy Wikipedia rules.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I submit the names of the Linda Christas Advisory Committee for verification of LC's standing. There isn't a high school in the Nation with a more impressive board. Look at the boards of ANY of the high schools in your area or that have been previously listed on Wikipedia without fanfare. Other boards don't even come close, and yet, Wikipedia seems ready to reject what in effect is one of the finest assemblies of celebrity and doctoral talent for any high school in America. I hope I am somehow wrong here. I challenge anyone to try to find a better Advisory Group for a high school!! If LC is not listed by Wikipedia at the end of this discussion, I would say that the illogic of that decision would disqualify Wikipedia, at least in my mind, from ever being taken seriously. In that case, I would actually advise LC to stay away from Wikipedia. It would be a disgrace to BE listed if the logic I am hearing is accurate.I JUST DON'T BELIEVE WIKIPEDIA EDITORS ARE CARELESS OR ARBITRARY ENOUGH TO MAKE A DECISION OF THAT KIND. Please prove me right!BettyCharette</dd>

<dd>(Can we get a sock check on BettyCharette?) You're referring to a list that appears only on the website. There is no public reciprocal acknowledgement from <i>any</i> of the big names on it. I've only been able to establish contact with one member of the list so far, but they have neither confirmed nor denied anything yet. What the high schools in a particular area do is not in doubt. What Linda Christas does <i>is</i> in doubt. All information about its doings has come through the organization itself.

<li><b>Keep It</b>: You guys are not even attempting to think this through. To have those people pictured on the Internet WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION would cost Linda Christas millions in law suits, and it would be all over the newspaper. Where is the logic here. (Remember Barbara Streisand sued an environmnetalist for 16 million for just taking a photo of her house and putting it on the net.) This seems to be a bit like the inquisition. I mean any thoughtful person it seems to me would understand the reality of public images, and how much money some of these people command just for an appearance. For images to be placed without permission would be financial suicide, not to mention the national press panning Linda Christas forever. I give up people. At this time, I really don't believe anything any commentator would say would persuade you of the illogic of what you are saying here.

She's actually a fairly important character in the book she appears in. Frankly, I'd rather see most of these merged into a List of Redwall Characters. I don't think they each need their own article. However, at the moment they all seem to have their own stub articles.

<p><b>Idea</b> I've been thinking about the Redwall articles for a while. The <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redwall.html" title="Redwall">Redwall</a> series is a massive series of books written by one Brian Jacques. There are nearly 30 books in or related to the series (this includes a cookbook, and several illustrated picture-books). It is a hugely popular series among people my age (I was 6 when the first book came out in 1986) and younger. There are movie and tv-series spin-offs from this. They are aimed at older children.</p>
<p>Right now the treatment of Redwall on Wikipedia is a little disorganized and haphazard. There is a article on the series as a whole; articles on each and every book in the series and on most of the companion books; articles on each of the important characters from the books; and articles on each major location in the fictional universe. I don't believe there is a wikiproject to coordinate the treatment of these articles.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't think that having isolated articles on each character is a good way to go about doing this. Like I said earlier, I think a good idea would be to merge these articles and consolidate them in list form. Currently my thinking is a main List of Redwall Characters with sections for each book. As the information is moved from the characters individual article to the appropriate section of the list the character article should be turned into a re-direct. I was thinking cut-and-paste moves for the information as the history of who wrote the stuff would remain at the re-direct page and history merging sounds like something only an administrator can do and it seems like it would be a pain in the butt for the administrator stuck doing it. Characters would be listed in the book in which they first appeared, with notes refering the reader to the proper section for subsequent books. Books would be listed in order of their writing, as they don't necessarily follow chronological order.</p>
<p>This would leave a lot of re-directs, but the information would be consolidated in one place and would be easier for readers to find and comprehend and easier for editors to maintain.</p>
<p>I can get started on this later tonight, but if I'm going to do this it would be counter-productive to delete this or any of the character articles at this time. Moreover, I can't do it all by myself as I haven't read the books that come after <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triss.html" title="Triss">Triss</a>.</p>
<p>I'll propose a wikiproject to clean these up at the main series article and see if I can get some help from other interested parties. Anyway, those are my thoughts at the moment. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 14:35, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have been using Wikipedia for many many things for several years. When I have a question about ANYTHING I check Wikipedia first. While the policy of "notability" and "verifiable" are very good standards there seems to me a conflict with that in some of the projects I have seen on Wikipedia (e.g. requesting pages for all state legislators, articles completing timelines). These projects imply a desire of comprehensiveness to some degree. Those things said, these articles seem to fall into line with the comprehensive drive of other projects. Verifiability? Yes, difficult. So, to me, it seems the question here calls for a balance between Verfiability and/or Notability vs Comprehensive and leading resource. And one more point to the idea of Comprehensive Resource: many other Wikias also imply a similar drive...things like Lyrics library, etc.<a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">tony garcia</a> 00:58, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have read the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> often. And please consider the following quotes from that page.
<blockquote>
<p>This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious). However, it is the opinion of many, but not all, Wikipedians that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies)...<b>This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.</b>(empahsis in original)</p>
</blockquote>
Quite honestly from my hours and hours of reading all of the policies and guidelines and discussions on other articles I have realized that the areas being argued for deletion are grey areas. Misinterpretations of intentions (like with Charlene below) and reading 'guidelines' as concrete policies seem to drive most of the discussions throughout. This whole process has been very enlightening (both positively and negatively). In the end I beleive the only real question is about Verifiability. The other justifications for deletion seem to be poorly relying upon selective interpretation. <i>On a different note</i>...I want to thank Isotope and XP for being less hostile and more helpful than most every other discussion I have read or participated in.--<a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">tony garcia</a> 20:14, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, thanks and please know that it is nothing personal against you, your show, or Pete.

<li><b>Comment</b> I take offense to the insinuation that I am advertising anything. 1) I gain nothing by trying to add all of the live talent from the station into Wikipedia. 2) I believe I have upfront about my relation to the page and my reasonings have nothing to do with self-promotion. My intentions were simple (and have been discussed at various other discussions). I found a philosophy of comprehensiveness within Wikipedia (which is the reason I use Wikipedia) and began adding the stations of Leighton Broadcasting and its local talent into Wikipedia. That is it. Not for advertising, not for anything else. When I use Wikipedia to find things as menial as television schedules from the 80's (which helped me in an interview, btw, a few months ago) I thought I would contribute by completing what I know about St Cloud's radio scene. I would suggest you go and read more of the Wikipedia guidelines and policies about making the charge of "vanity"...as it absolutely does not describe my purposes.<a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">tony garcia</a> 20:14, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello, it's user:chandrannair again. It is true that I have come into the fray to defend Ivy Goh Nair from speedy deletion and that her last page was actually uploaded by me. I think if you want to apply the "vanity" label because one person edits the other and vice versa, it would only be fair to examine each case on its own merit. Both user:ivygohnair and user:chandrannair are established figures in the field that is being discussed: ie Singapore literature and writing; secondly, it should be considered in their favour that they have used their own names and not fictitious names as user names; If this had been the case, the problem wouldn't have arisen. Therefore I think there is much merit in User: Edward Wakelin remarks above and that an author's conflict of interest is by itself not a basis for deletion. In our case, "conflict of interest" is hardly applicable as we are both extremely qualified to comment on each other's professional skills as well as the professional skills of any other Singaporean writer or poet. I think the main criterion that should be applied is whether Ivy Goh Nair is notable in Wikipedia standards, whether the material is original (which it shouldn't be) and whether there are reliable and verifiable sources. I have cited various sources which are both reliable and verifiable (the two reviews in a Singaporean and an international newspaper) which clearly states that Ivy Goh Nair had significantly contributed to the history of Singapore, by her book "Singapore Accent". The article does not contain any "original" matter as such.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that in the end, justice will prevail and "ivy goh nair" will not be deleted. If it is, it would be only fair that the reasons for such a deletion should be clearly spelled out by Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Hello, this is user:ivygohnair. I agree with everything user:chandrannair has said above. I would just like to add (in order to dispell the notion that all I do is to edit chandrannair and vice versa) that the editing that I have done (in a fairly short period) has been quite considerable for a sixty year old like me who is not as agile as younger folks on the internet. I have added substantially to the Introduction to Singapore literature and have edited some other writer's pages. I have the intention of editing pages for other older notables in the field, like Goh Poh Seng, Robert Yeo, Lee Tzu Pheng,and Kirpal Singh (which do not exist yet in Wikipedia) and I have already written to some of them (yes they are all my friends, ("conflict of interest"?) to send me their bios) I also intend to add to Arthur Yap's and Edwin Thumboo's exisitng pages. Yes, I know (knew) them too, and each one of these notables would probably edit for user:chandrannair and user:ivygohnair, if only they were internet savy&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Hey, it's me again: user: ivygohnair: Before I hit the sack, a thought just occured to me which I must absolutely share with you. If we follow some of the arguments of certain wikipedia editors above, Sylvia Plath would have been accused of "conflict of interest" if she had written about her husband, Ted Hughes and vice versa. Good Nite.</p>

<p>Hey, It's me again, sorry! Us seniors have too much time on our hands and won't sit on them. BTW I have been spending time reading up on some of the rules of Wikepedia. My impression is that most of them are guidelines and there should be some flexibility in their application. This is surely in the spirit of freedom of Wikipedia (which btw I think is a GREAT idea). There are clear-cut vanity cases, I am sure, where friends put friends up who are not notable. And the rule about not "knowing" the person you are editing should be a general guideline to prevent these cases. Now having said that, how on earth would you avoid the fact that a writer from Singapore (which is such a small country) would probably know another Singaporean writer he is editing? I just finished editing a page on <a href="../../../g/o/h/Goh_Poh_Seng_2942.html" title="Goh Poh Seng">Goh Poh Seng</a>. I know Poh Seng personally from way back, so can you apply the "knowlege" guideline on me? Similiarly, when I first stumbled on Wikipedia, I was immediately struck by the gap that exists regarding older writers who do not seem to be well represented. My mission was to try and redress this and User: Chandrannair was just one of the notables I was going to edit. Should I be prevented from editing him, just because I know him intimately? Where is there a conflict of interest if the material uploaded fulfilled Wikipedia standards? Similiarly, when my page was threatened with immediate removal, should not User: Chandrannair who was also an expert in the matter intervene to try and save the page, just because he knows me&#160;? Aren't there many cases in history when sons and daughters write biographies of the parents; and wives and husbands of their spouses? Thanks for listening to me. I guess I better sign off properly now.<a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvygohnair_89c5.html" title="User:Ivygohnair">Ivygohnair</a> 16:03, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>–New to all this in wikipedia... I think the mood to delete is harsh.

<p>The following is a comment I made on User: Utcursch discussion page.

Believe me neither my hubby nor I are believers in the caste system, otherwise he would not have married me! But having said that I was puzzled that a "friendly" (as you describe yourself) admin would vote "not notable enough" (without giving any explanation whatsoever) for a book which was favourably reviewed by both the local and international press and caused quite a stir when it was first published because it was one of the first books considered "critical" of Singapore.Ivygohnair 17:34, 20 October 2006 (UTC)"<a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvygohnair_89c5.html" title="User:Ivygohnair">Ivygohnair</a> 07:27, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that some users think that this debate should go on even after the above withdrawal request. User Utcursch (please see the discussion/talk page of his user page) is one of them and not only that, he tries to rally admins and other users to his cause by extending the debate to the <b>Wikipedia talki: SGpedians</b> forum which is peopled mostly by younger Singaporeans who may not have been born when my book was written. I therefore reproduce below his post on my user talk page and my reply:</p>
<p>"Dear Ms. Ivy Goh Nair, I indeed hate the caste system very much (I'm neither Dalit nor Brahmin -- I am anti-caste person). But that was not the reason I voted "Delete" at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ivy Goh Nair. Had that been the reason, I would have probably moved many other articles to deletion: C. Sankaran Nair, Chandran Nair, Kavalappara Narayanan Nair etc.(have you never heard of the phrase "going for the soft belly?":-)81.249.80.83 08:41, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Writing a book doesn't make a personal notable enough for Wikipedia. The fact that Ivy Goh Nair was written by your husband makes it less verifiable (please see Wikipedia:Autobiography). The only criteria for voting delete was non-notability -- please have a look at Wikipedia:Notability (people). I don't claim that I have excellent knowledge about journalism and literature in Singapore, but Wikipedia:Search engine test indicates that you're not notable enough to have an article on Wikipedia: [1][2]. Most of the few search results that I got are from personal sites such as eurekster.com, ivygohnair.tk, brinkster.com etc.</p>
<p>I have dropped a note at Wikipedia talk:SGpedians' notice board -- the discussion page for Wikipedians from Singapore and Wikipedians who are writing about Singapore-related topics. I have invited them to to have a look at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ivy Goh Nair. Just in case the article gets deleted, I will suggest that the content of the article be merged to User:Ivygohnair (see Wikipedia:Userfication).</p>
<p>I hope that this issue doesn't discourage you from contributing to Wikipedia. Please don't take this as an insult. Everyday, Wikipedia gets lots of articles about various people, all of whom may not be notable enough (emphasis on "enough"). Thanks. utcursch | talk 08:26, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey</p>
<p>I don't know why this debate is persisting as the request has been made to redraw the article by the editors themselves. By the way, Chandran Nair did not write the book. The book was a collection of columns, I wrote for the business times under the pseudonym of B J WU. All this is verifiable! It shows how prejudiced, false and ingnorant your assumptions are. As an admin, I am asking you to restore the favourable comment that was deleted by someone just before we made the decision to withdraw the article. Let's see whether you will do that instead of searching for needles in a haystack to use against people you seem to have a grudge against. I read up Wikipedia rules and while admins are greatly appreciated for the work they do for the site (I am sure you yourself have done a lot) they have an even greater reponsiblity to be fair and even handed . . . . ."Ivygohnair 06:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvygohnair_89c5.html" title="User:Ivygohnair">Ivygohnair</a> 07:08, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Could you make your argument without quoting from policy pages? Really, most of what you said, I don't even see the relationship to this list anyway.

<dd>Nope, lists are very much an important part of any encyclopedia, be it <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_dd89.html" title="List of Presidents of the United States">US presidents</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_monarchs_of_the_Kingdom_of_England_c020.html" title="List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England">English Monarchs</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_engagements_of_World_War_II_d9c6.html" title="List of military engagements of World War II">Battles in WW2</a>, as they are helpful ways to organize valuable information. Yes, it is certainly possible to come up with worthless lists like List of red-headed stepchildren or list of people who have slept in the Lincoln Bedroom, but this is not clearly one of them. The <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine.html" title="Search engine">search engine</a> article is useful, there's no arguing with that. Having information on notable search engines is also useful. Therefore, a list of those search engine is hardly not encyclopedic on its face. In fact, I think it's something that is useful to Wikipedia, as merely having information without the organization to access it effectively is hardly desirable. That is perhaps the most persuasive argument in keeping lists, at least to me. Obviously, YMMV, but I do think you chose poorly in nominating this article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:31, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> WP is not a list, means WP is not merely a list.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many hundred lists in WP, some with annotation, it can serve as a very useful index to the material. People use lists as finding aids: "I'm not sure what its called exactly, but if I can look at a list I'll pick it out"</p>
<p>A list is effective because it focuses subjects. This can be done in a more complicated way with categories, but this may be overkill for this subject.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> - I had a go at the article; trying to imposing some structure, wikify and qualifying some of the claims originally stated as facts. Two issues here as far as citing goes - firstly is it so used by a significant number of people worldwide (whether or not it works), I agree a single self-interested source is poor choice to verify and fails to meet <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">WP:Reliable sources</a> criteria (unlike a national newspaper citing numbers for example). Secondly is the issue whether its claims can be verified (again by reliable sources). We have <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodletting.html" title="Bloodletting">Bloodletting</a> as a historical article on the development of modern medicine, yet it provides no citations to confirm it was of any benefit. So I tend to feel alternative medicine topics are acceptable if notable by usage (rather than speculative wishful thinking claims of a clinic or practitioner), and claims of action need be carefully edited to NPOV unless convincing evidence. This article for now fails to verify that yoga practioners do really try to manage overt thyroid disease, and on this basis I currently vote for delete (unless CAM practioners can rapidly improve on the article). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 22:59, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It may indeed be used, and if so it is worth a mention - but the main point is not whether it works, or whether it is quackery or good medicine, but whether it merits an article in its own right. As a sentence in Medical uses of yoga (or just in <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a>, and as another in the section on diseases under <a href="../../../t/h/y/Thyroid.html" title="Thyroid">Thyroid</a>, maybe, but not on its own. We don't have an article on ACE inhibitors for reducing hypertension (or at least I hope we don't!). We have one on <a href="../../../a/c/e/ACE_inhibitors_b0d5.html" title="ACE inhibitors">ACE inhibitors</a> which refers among other things to their role in BP control; we have one on <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypertension.html" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a> which mentions ACE inhibitors as one possible control measure.

<dd>Whether bloodletting has a place in modern medicine is beside the point. It was historically an important technique and it is worthy of an encyclopaedia article regardless of whether or not it is still used and regardless of whether or not it works. Yoga for Thyroid Disease should indeed be deleted - but because it's insignificant, not because it is rubbish. <a href="../../../g/n/u/User%7EGnusmas_e8c5.html" title="User:Gnusmas">Gnusmas</a> 12:47, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Precisely my point (although perhaps not as clear as I had intended) - issue is not if works or not (any such claims need be cited and in NPOV terms), but whether article should be deleted comes down to whether it is in significant use or not - here in UK, I agree insignificant. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:32, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think "obscure but correct" versus "obscure and rubbish" makes a difference.

<dd>Yes, the guidelines do say that, but I'm actually really allergic to gray area judgment calls like we're getting into here.

<li><b>Keep</b> This satisfies both the letter and spirit of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The group received non-trivial coverage from multiple independent sources (though, this could be better illustrated in the article, than it is). An international tour clearly qualifies them. The nom seems to have a problem with the fact that its Hooters that sponsored it. Who cares who the sponsor is? Also, I echo the point, that notability is by nature *not* transitory. Once somebody acheives it, it can not fade. Also, lets keep in mind <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Williams_0e5f.html" title="Tracy Williams">Tracy Williams</a> was the most prominent member of this group, and she is easily notable, for her prior involvement in <a href="../../../p/2E/y/P.Y.T._%28band%29_8eb6.html" title="P.Y.T. (band)">P.Y.T. (band)</a>, which predates UC3. They key item here, is that nobody is using Wikipedia to gain national or international exposure.

<li>Comment: The nominator's only reasoning for nominating Williams was her being a member of UC3. I request you specifically address her involvement in PYT, and her resultant notability that *predates* UC3. This wasn't addressed, and its not clear to me, if the nominator was aware of this at the time of nomination. I think this was a very bad use of combined nominations, as these two articles are quite unique (though, I of course, support keeping both). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for drawing my attention to PYT. In my initial opinion, this group should also be considered a good candidate for deletion discussion as a non-encyclopedically notable music group.

<dd>Based on your comments above, it seems you never heard of PYT, until I told you about them (e.g you "thanked" me for bring them to your attention). This is only possible, if you didn't read the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Williams_0e5f.html" title="Tracy Williams">Tracy Williams</a> article before nominating it (since PYT is half the content of the very small article). Can you please clarify if you actually read <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Williams_0e5f.html" title="Tracy Williams">Tracy Williams</a> before you nominated, or not? Anyway, if you wish to nominate PYT as well (as you threatened), I strongly urge you to fully read the entire article in advance. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:20, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's no other article which deals with a subject even close to this one, and 13,500 google hits is not to be sneezed at. Every example noted has a link in the references section. Cancerward 23:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no references section in the article. There's an external links section. External links are not references. Two of the linked-to articles, on Toshiba and Compaq notebooks, talk about various specific models of notebook PCs overheating and <i>possibly</i> shutting down. The causes of overheating aren't even the same across both, and none of them describe a syndrome, let alone call it "random shutdown syndrome". In fact, that phrase occurs nowehere on either of the articles. A third article, on Dell notebooks, similarly mentions no syndrome, and is a collection of pseudonymous comments, added to a product review, about what will cause that particular model of notebook to overheat — again with different causes to the other two brands.
<p>The first external link listed, discussed by the fifth page linked to, appears to be the single-idea web site whose single idea this article is propounding, to which the other links are being added in what we might call "<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Random External Link Syndrome</a>". It is a collection of pseudonymous web loggers posting "my MacBook shut down!" comments, with no indication that there's any fact checking or peer review going on, no indication of that a consistent syndrome has even been identified, and lots of comments on the level of "Any ideas as to the problem? It seems as if my RAM is affected or something.", which hardly makes this an adequate source for an encyclopaedia article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:01, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, the Toshiba, Compaq, Apple, and Dell problems referred to in the external links are occurring for the same reasons -- poor design causing overheating followed by shutdown. The article title may be a "neologism" but perhaps there was no phrase to describe it until recently. As for the Dell article, it's difficult to find an "official looking" article about the problem if Dell won't admit to it. Perhaps <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hs=Erx&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=inspiron+overheating+site%3Adell.com&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hs=Erx&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=inspiron+overheating+site%3Adell.com&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>provides some better link ideas.

<ul>
<li>Glibly describing the causes as "poor design" is the only way in which the reasons can be said to be the same. In truth, they are quite different, and entirely disconnected. And the Apple web site makes no mention of a syndrome. What we have here is not a documented syndrome, but a pile of external links to an arbitrary list of articles about notebook PCs failing, most of which are anecdotal at best, in support of a novel synthesis of these data and a conclusion that is being drawn for the first time here in Wikipedia, in contravention of our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. A documented syndrome would have someone, outside of Wikipedia, already documenting it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:21, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The topic may be real -- you've certainly documented a rash of disconnected laptop shutdowns -- but a neologism is still a neologism. Until a third party uses this term I have no evidence of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, so I have to <strike>move to <b>merge to <a href="../../../l/a/p/Laptop.html" title="Laptop">laptop</a> and delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlba_9e53.html" title="User:Alba">Alba</a> 04:18, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</strike> Vote changed due to evidence: see below. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlba_9e53.html" title="User:Alba">Alba</a> 15:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is a third-party reference to this phrase in print, in the computer journal "Tech &amp; U" on 10 August 2006, page 14 (courtesy Factiva). Plus the PC Magazine/eWeek/extremetech.com references (basically the same article by Scott Ferguson linked to) -- don't know if these have appeared in print though. Cancerward 05:28, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The PC Magazine article supports <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacBook_b11e.html#Problems" title="MacBook">MacBook#Problems</a>, since it discusses just one specific make of personal computer. It doesn't support creating a whole article about a supposed, and completely undocumented, syndrome. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:21, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In that case, you have a documented case for <b>merging to <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacBook_b11e.html" title="MacBook">MacBook</a> and redirecting</b>.

(2) Non-notability <i>is</i> a valid deletion criterion, otherwise we wouldn't have guidelines like <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:04, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Primary schools / Middle Schools which theis is are generally not notable, generally it is only high schools that are listed.
