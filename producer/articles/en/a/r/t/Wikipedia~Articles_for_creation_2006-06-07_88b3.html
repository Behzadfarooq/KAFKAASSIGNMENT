<p>Hubcap existed from 1993 - 1996 in Chicago, Illinois. The band was composed of Andy Zboralski, Billy Smith (Traitors, Haymarket Riot), and Jay Ryan (Dianogah, The Bird Machine). Hubcap existed in the early emo/punk scene of the mid 90s and played shows with Braid, Brainiac, Shellac, The Amps, and Silkworm. The band leaned towards the sounds of Chicago's Cheer Accident and Shellac while having an affinity for Capn'Jazz and early Trenchmouth. Jay Ryan is a prominent member of the Wayne Montana fan club, and he still trades emails with Wayne to this very day.</p>

<p>St. Joseph's school is a very real school in the San Mateo County of California. It celebrated it's 122 year in 2005. Supposedly aliens once came to this school and abduccted a few students in 1902, and scientists have tried to prove it wrong. So far, no scientist has ever proven this actual event false. Many other funny things have happened at this school, for example, in 1904, a kid named Simon James Alexander Ragsdale III stole a "whipping stick" from one of the nuns, and tried to whipp the nuns until she surrendered, and agreed to never give homework or "whippings" to any other student again. Also, in 1992, and kid named Jon Pulvkinaje, from the, what is now known as, the Chzec Republic, stole a ruler from the nuns and held-up the local bank, pretending the ruler was a gun, and having it tucked behind his shirt. Overall, St. Joseph's school is a very holy and beautiful place.</p>

<p><b>A Directory For Skype</b></p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://www.skype-directory.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.skype-directory.com/" rel="nofollow">Skype Directory</a> is a <a href="http://www.joomla.org" class="external text" title="http://www.joomla.org" rel="nofollow">Joomla</a> based website offering Skype Users the opportunity to list their business or themselves in a central, web searchable database for free. The site hopes to become the largest independent, user driven Skype directory online and has launched before Skype's own rumoured Business-to-Business directory. While other such efforts have been proposed or put forth such as <a href="http://www.jyve.com" class="external text" title="http://www.jyve.com" rel="nofollow">Jyve Community</a> or the Turkish based <a href="http://biz.konush.net" class="external text" title="http://biz.konush.net" rel="nofollow">Skype Buisness Directory</a>, these efforts have been either small or relatively closed requiring sign up. In comparison Skype-Directory.com has managed to gain over 550 registrations in its first week of operation. The closest alternative directory took 2 years to grow to over 500 entries. This is possibly due to it's primary text based approach. It is not a community like Jyve but like an online version of your conventional business and residential phone directory.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Future Plans</b></p>
<p>The Skype Directory site promises future enhancements such as a person's Skype presence being displayed, categorised business page with businesses grouped by sector and industry, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Thai translations, a separate B2B directory and perhaps personalised features. At the time of this writing it seems as though the site is well on its way. At the time of this writing is unclear when Skype's own business directory will launch or what form it will take and whether or not it will be free. Just as unclear is how popular Skype-Directory.com is however just as there is room for more than one search engine there likely will remain a niché for independent directories of Skype Users.</p>
<p>"Alternatives" <a href="http://www.jyve.com" class="external text" title="http://www.jyve.com" rel="nofollow">Jyve Community</a> Is fairly large and covers the home, residential or personal area with various interests but it is a community requiring registration.</p>
<p><a href="http://biz.konush.net" class="external text" title="http://biz.konush.net" rel="nofollow">Skype Buisness Directory</a> Is a similar directory but appears to be weighted towards Turkish businesses since it is based in Turkey also it's growth rate has be very fairly slow, taking two years to gain 500+ entries.</p>
<p><a href="http://skypepages.ca" class="external text" title="http://skypepages.ca" rel="nofollow">Canadian Skype Directory</a> This has been around for some time but due to its closed nature it is hard to tell how popular it is or how many total entries are in it.</p>

<p>The days of simple roller coasters with a few small hills are long gone. Today's coasters are bigger and scarier than ever, many having loops. Early-day looping coasters had circular loops. At the top of the loop the carts began to slow down and at the end of the loop they were going too fast. The development of the clothoid loop solved this problem.</p>
<p>By decreasing the loop's radius at the top, the speed is increased enough to keep passengers pressed into their seats. At the same time, the radius at the bottom of the loop is increased so that the curve isn't sharp enough to hurt people. The result is a loop that is more elliptical than circular.</p>

<p><b>The Puerto Rican Volunteers Corp</b> (<i>Instituto de Voluntarios de Puerto Rico</i> in Spanish) was a militia composed of private citizens, principally instituted for the defense of <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>'s periphery from pirate incursions and foreign invasion. In principle, the volunteers were characterized by their unwavering loyalty to the Spanish Crown and Empire, and as such were subject to compulsory membership in the <i>Partido Incondicional Español</i> (The Spanish Unconditional Party). However, upon its creation in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1812.html" title="1812">1812</a> the <i>Partido Incondicional</i> was exclusive to all but peninsular-born Spaniards (<a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsulares.html" title="Peninsulares">peninsulares</a>), and it was only towards the second half of the century that its rolls were opened to insular-born subjects of Spanish descent (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Criollo.html" title="Criollo">criollos</a>). The Volunteer Corp did not fight as a group during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish-American_War_1510.html" title="Spanish-American War">Spanish-American War</a> of <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>, nor did the majority of its approx. 8,000 members assist the regular Spanish Army in its <i>pro forma</i> defense of the island. The Corps's conduct during the war was due not to rebellion among the ranks but rather to recalcitrance: a low <i>esprit de corp</i> followed the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_General_51a1.html" title="Governor General">Governor General</a> of Puerto Rico's order to have all Volunteers integrated into the Regular Army without regard to any official rank or distinction they might have held in the Corp. Volunteers, by then consisting largely of the island's mercantile and <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacendado.html" title="Hacendado">hacendado</a> elite (<i>vide</i> Pedro Arzuaga Beraza, Rafael Janer y Soler, Pompeyo O. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxuach.html" title="Marxuach">Marxuach</a>, Dimas de Ramery y Zuzuarregui, Narciso Vall-Llovera Feliú), recoiled at the perceived "injustice" and "indignity" of having to fight alongside men recruited from the lowest rungs of Spanish colonial society. Other–though perhaps less quantifiable–factors contributing to Volunteer inaction were the signal winds of change sweeping over the remnants of Spain's once vast imperial possessions; the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortes.html" title="Cortes">Cortes</a>'s belated attempts at establishing an autonomist insular government in 1897; Spain's bloody and ineffectual efforts at ending the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Years%27_War_d938.html" title="Ten Years' War">Ten Years' War</a>; and the U.S.'s undisguised expansionist aims, combined with the contagion of assimilationist and insurrectionist groups operating both from the island and the U.S.</p>

<p>What is CDMA? “CDMA or Code Division Multiple Access is an advanced technology that permits high-volume communications in a small area, with limited interference from other traffic. It was originally designed for military communications applications in rear areas.”</p>
<p>CDMA TECHNOLOGIES The world is demanding more from wireless communication technologies than ever before as more people around the world are subscribing to wireless. Add in exciting Third-Generation (3G) wireless data services and applications - such as wireless email, web, digital picture taking/sending, assisted-GPS position location applications, video and audio streaming and TV broadcasting - and wireless networks are doing much more than just a few years ago. This is where CDMA technology fits in. CDMA consistently provides better capacity for voice and data communications than other commercial mobile technologies, allowing more subscribers to connect at any given time, and it is the common platform on which 3G technologies are built. CDMA is a "spread spectrum" technology, allowing many users to occupy the same time and frequency allocations in a given band/space. As its name implies, CDMA assigns unique codes to each communication to differentiate it from others in the same spectrum. In a world of finite spectrum resources, CDMA enables many more people to share the airwaves at the same time than do alternative technologies</p>
<p>CDMA MONITORING SYSTEM Purpose: CDMA Monitoring System "SCL-5020 C" (further system) is intended to ensure interception of voice conversation and service information in CDMA (IS-95A, IS-95B, CDMA 2000-1x) cellular network. System Type: To prevent detection of the system's operation and avoid interference to the operation of cellular network the System works as a passive equipment intercepting data directly from the air. System Basic Function: The system is able to monitor 4 base stations simultaneously working at the different frequency and Pilot-PN</p>
<p>The system should be able to ensure the following functions: •Automatic search for used CDMA cellular network frequency and logic channels. •Evaluate base station signal quality and level. •Fix and record information sent in service channels. •Record and playback audio information (messages). •Determine subscriber's real phone number or ESN during his registration in the network and call. •Determine real calling phone number (if mobile phone subscriber has caller ID function). •Monitor and record incoming SMS. •Determine time of the beginning of conversation &amp; also determine duration of conversation. •Ensure search of target subscriber according to air number.

<p>The strut-and-tie method is used in the design of reinforced concrete members in <i>discontinuity regions</i> (a.k.a D-Regions) where force flow is in violation of St. Venant's Principle. That is, shear lag exists and design is not governed by flexure. The cracked concrete section is visualized as a truss consisting of compression struts, ties, and nodal zones. Longitudinal steel reinforcement is placed in the ties while stirrups are used to confine the concrete struts.</p>
<p>The strut-and-tie method was heavily promoted in the 80's by <b>Schlaich</b> et al. for its intuitive approach for design in D-Regions.

<p>Almost nothing is known of Byrhtferth's life except that he was a monk who lived at Ramsey Abbey most of his life. Most of his writing is beleived to have been produced sometime between 988 to perhaps as late as 1015 or 1016 but these dates are not certain.</p>
<p>At least two of his works are known to still exist, <i>Computus</i> and <i>Enchiridion</i>. <i>Computus</i> is a work concerning various aspects of time and the natural world. <i>Enchiridion</i> is a work integrating computus and numerology written in Latin and Old English. Addtionally, two biographies are attributed to him, <i>The Life of Oswald</i>, founder of Ramsey Abbey and <i>The Life of Ecgwini</i>.</p>

<p>Ministerstyre, literally "minister rule", is a crime recognized by Swedish law. It is when a government official gives orders to an unrelated government office, using their position to pressure them into taking action. There have been allegations that the raid on The Pirate Bay was prompted by a member of the Swedish government who gave orders to the police while under pressure from US agencies like the MPAA, although the Swedish police deny them.</p>

<p>Few people can match the experiences that keyboardist Dzijan Emin has had as a musician. Times are hard for musicians, who are expected to be proficient and versatile in a variety of genres. Those who are proficient—and available—can be seen playing with different people in various musical contexts. Examples are drummer Antonio Sanchez and bassist Christian McBride, whose services are elicited by people from genres other than jazz.</p>
<p>A working professional from the age of 9, when he began playing folk music in his father's band, Emin is probably best known for his collaboration with Bodan Arsovski, as a member of his Ezgija Orchestra. As part of the Skopje, Macedonia club scene, Emin and his band mates started playing in various garage jazz bands and cover rock bands. Later they started playing and recording with older artists including Vlatko Stefanovski, Bodan Arsovski, Kiril Dzajkovski, Dragan Soldatovic Labish, Arhangel, Last Expedition and Nikola Kodzobashia. As classically trained musicians they are also part of the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra and Opera.</p>
<p>All of this has contributed to their colorful musical expression in the form of Project Zlust and DNO. Its six members come from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, reflecting the great diversity to be found in the Balkans. Zlust was founded in 1998, releasing their self-titled EP in 2000. Since then, they've released two albums under the name of Project Zlust — Live, and the soundtrack for How I Killed a Saint), DNO-Tishina. They have also recorded music for TV documentaries including The Children of 1948, and The Painter. In 2004, they played on their former professor Nikola Kodjabashia's The Reveries Of The Solitary Walker, which was voted album of the week on Radio BBC 1. This year, they have worked on scores for two films, composed by Kiril, Bal-Can-Can and The Great Water. The band DNO is another project they have been pursuing alongside Zlust, which took them in the direction of art-rock music. The presence of renowned producer Malcolm Burn (Iggy Pop, Peter Gabriel, Bob Dylan, Emmy Lou Harris, Daniel Lanois) helped significantly in the success of their debut album.</p>

<p>Association des Scouts de Madagascar</p>
<p>La moitié de la population de Madagascar a moins de 20 ans. Pourtant, les propositions d’activités parascolaires encadrées et structurées sont bien peu nombreuses. Les «&#160;Antily&#160;», cousins malgaches des Scouts de France, développent à travers des actions concrètes compétences et esprit de citoyenneté.</p>
<p>Acquérir des compétences Qu’il soit scolarisé ou non, chaque jeune a un souci majeur&#160;: son insertion économique. Comment subvenir à ses besoins vitaux demain&#160;? L’immense majorité des enfants ne dépasse pas trois années de scolarisation complètes. Il leur faut donc chercher d’autres moyens de se former. En mettant en place des projets adaptés à leur âge, les Antily développent leurs capacités d’organisation, les initient aux travaux manuels et leur permettent de prendre confiance en eux.</p>
<p>Apprendre à se respecter Se respecter, c’est commencer par prendre soin de son corps par l’éducation à l’hygiène et la sensibilisation aux questions de santé. Dans un pays où les jeunes sont confrontés aux problèmes de malnutrition, aux risques liés à la consommation de drogue, d’alcool (le rhum n'est guère plus cher que l’eau potable&#160;!), où le Sida commence à faire des ravages, c’est une priorité.</p>
<p>Mieux vivre ensemble La population malgache est composée de 18 ethnies. Si le malgache est la langue commune, l’histoire n’est pas exempte de conflits qui peuvent laisser des traces douloureuses. Les Antily, qui touchent près de 10 000 jeunes garçons sur l’ensemble de la «&#160;Grande île&#160;», offrent un lieu de rencontre, pour une meilleure connaissance mutuelle et d’actions communes.</p>
<p>Solidaire et citoyen dès l’enfance À travers des projets axés sur l’idée de développement communautaire (construction d’abris bus, réfection d’une ruelle, animations auprès d’enfants ou de personnes âgées, saynètes permettant d’aborder des questions de santé publique comme le Sida, lutte contre le déboisement), les Antily inculquent aux jeunes le sens de la solidarité et de l’engagement citoyen.</p>
<pre>
 Préparer l’avenir par la protection de l’environnement 
</pre>
<p>Si Madagascar dispose d’une richesse écologique extraordinaire, la déforestation met en péril l’avenir de la «&#160;Grande île&#160;». Les Antily mènent de nombreuses actions sous forme de projets d’actions communautaires en faveur de la protection de l’environnement. Objectif&#160;: agir et sensibiliser autour de soi au problème d’environnement.</p>

<p>In Sabbath and festive meals bread and salt are necessarily served at the beginning of a meal. Eating bread is based on Scriptual prescription while addition of salt is inferred from Jewish tradition. The only exception to it is a Passover week when matsa (heb. מצה) serves a substitute for bread.</p>

<p>Virginia Capers won the Tony Award for her portrayal of Mama in the musical Raisin. She was the first Black woman to win a Tony on Broadway as Best Actress in a Musical without having to share the award with a white woman. Her entire acting career extended fifty years. She had one child, a son--Glenn Capers. She attended Howard University and as a protest to Sororities and Fraternaties started the GDB (God Dam Black) Society because she was darker then a brown paper bag. This was at a time when the color of your skin equated to the level of education you go after. She was asked to leave Howard. Virginia Capers attended Julliard school of Music. In her Senior year she was asked to leave because she became pregnant. The Music School of Julliard no longer has a record of her attendance but her son has her music theory books frothe school. This was a time when a woman's pregnancy was an embarassment to a profound acaddemic establishment. Her classmates went on to do "Carmen Jones", a Black musical film in the fifties. Virginia Capers and Leontine Price were both students at Julliard and both singing opera in the same classes and studied voice from Florence Ward Kimball. They would compete as two of the best singers at the school.</p>
<p>Virginia Capers spoke Yiddish, French, German, and Italian. She learned the classical languages at Julliard School of Music. In the history of the school she is the first Broadway award-winning Student even though she is not recognized for her merit. Later in her life in the '80s she was given an honorary Doctorate Degree in Music from the University of Western Music.</p>
<p>Virginia Capers moved to Los Angeles to do "Showboat" at the Civic Light Opera produced by Edward Lestor. From there on her life as a film actress began with "The Untouchables." She was the first Black actress in the TV Show as a secretary. Then she replaced the male house servant on "My Three Sons" for the last show of the season. Virginia Capers' professional career did extend in Europe singing in night clubs from France to Israel at the Doe Re Me theater in the fifties.</p>
<p>Virginia Capers was a religious woman. Near the end of her life she discovered that God was not only in a church but in the Land and that there was more truth in the powers of God from a Druid view point. She sat in Sedona Arizona saying, "I did not know how spiritual this place is and that the powers of spiritual god could be found in nature and not just in Man and woman." She repeated it over and over.</p>
<p>The bench where she sat is still at Cathedral Rock, and her picture sitting there is on the website at <a href="http://www.acoracle.org" class="external free" title="http://www.acoracle.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.acoracle.org</a></p>
<p>Her spirituality grew near the end of her life and she found a peace at one with creation. She became a member of the A Coracle Foundation and believed that individuals in the arts and the service of healing and community leaders should all go on spiritual pilgrimages to renew their souls. Virgina Capers worked until her heart failed on May 4, 2004. She was a true trail blazer. Her son wrote his personal views about his mother on his website. <a href="http://www.acoracle.com/wheremymotherdre.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.acoracle.com/wheremymotherdre.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acoracle.com/wheremymotherdre.htm</a> You can hear her voice sing one of the most important songs she sang with all mankind in mind.</p>

<p><b>Johann Heermann</b> (<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_11.html" title="October 11">11 October</a> <a href="../../../1/5/8/1585.html" title="1585">1585</a> - <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">17 February</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a>), <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet.html" title="Poet">poet</a> and <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">hymn</a>-writer. Heermann was born in Raudten (modern day Rudna) in <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silesia.html" title="Silesia">Silesia</a>, the fourth son of a middle-class <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> family. None of his elder siblings had survived beyond childhood, so when the infant Heermann became very ill, his mother prayed that, if he survived, she would pay for him to study at university. He attended the local school in Raudten, and when his teacher Johannes Baumann left the school to become the local <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastor.html" title="Pastor">pastor</a> in <a href="../../../1/5/9/1597.html" title="1597">1597</a>, Heermann’s parents took him to Wohlau (now Wołów, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>), where he lived and studied with Jakob Fuchs, a doctor and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apothecary.html" title="Apothecary">apothecary</a>. At school in Wohlau, he was taught by Georg Gigas, son of Johann Gigas, composer of two popular hymns of the time. After a year he became ill yet again, and his parents brought him home. After recovering, he returned to school in Raudten. At the house of a teacher, Gregorius Fiebing, he began his first poetry at the age of seventeen.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/0/1602.html" title="1602">1602</a>, he moved to Fraustadt (now Wschowa, Poland), where he lived and worked with the theologian Valerius Herberger, who employed him as <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanuensis.html" title="Amanuensis">amanuensis</a> and tutor to his son Zacharias. Here, Heermann’s skills as a poet were recognized and encouraged. Despite Herberger’s influence, he stayed only a year in Fraustadt, moving on to study at the <a href="../../../g/y/m/Gymnasium_%28school%29.html" title="Gymnasium (school)">Gymnasium</a> Elisabethanum in <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breslau.html" title="Breslau">Breslau</a>, then to the Gymnasium in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brieg.html" title="Brieg">Brieg</a> in Autumn <a href="../../../1/6/0/1604.html" title="1604">1604</a>, where he had the opportunity to give speeches and recite his poetry.</p>
<p>He decided to go to university in <a href="../../../1/6/0/1607.html" title="1607">1607</a>, but was persuaded by his patron, Wenzel von Rothkirch, to stay with him, teaching his two sons and accompanying them on a trip around Europe. Heermann agreed, using his spare time to study in the ducal library and that of the university <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rector.html" title="Rector">rector</a>. He was also able to publish small collections of speeches and poems, and came in contact with Matthäus Zuber, a talented poet who had also been made <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet_laureate.html" title="Poet laureate">poet laureate</a>. Heermann, too, aspired to this, achieving laureation on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_8.html" title="October 8">8 October</a> <a href="../../../1/6/0/1608.html" title="1608">1608</a> in Brieg.</p>
<p>Over Easter <a href="../../../1/6/0/1609.html" title="1609">1609</a> he traveled via <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leipzig.html" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jena.html" title="Jena">Jena</a> to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strasbourg.html" title="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, where they matriculated at the university, attending theology lectures and meeting the professors of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> and law. The following year, he contracted an eye infection after publishing a book of epigrams, and returned home on doctor’s advice. He had a nightmare journey home, arriving even less healthy than when he left. Soon after his return, he was ordained and appointed <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacon</a> to the <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheran.html" title="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> congregation in Köben (modern-day Chobienia, Poland), where the incumbent pastor was old and in poor health. He began work on <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_Day_49bb.html" title="Ascension Day">Ascension Day</a> <a href="../../../1/6/1/1611.html" title="1611">1611</a>, and a few days later the pastor died, with Heermann taking on his duties on a temporary basis, despite having only been there for a week. He was put in permanent charge that same Autumn, and also married Dorothea Feige, the daughter of the mayor of Raudten.</p>
<p>After a successful start to his career in Köben, the plague arrived in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1613.html" title="1613">1613</a>, then in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1616.html" title="1616">1616</a> a fire swept through the town. This naturally upset Heermann, who was also sad because he was childless. His wife Dorothea died on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">13 September</a> <a href="../../../1/6/1/1617.html" title="1617">1617</a>. He married again in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1618.html" title="1618">1618</a>, this time to Anna Teichmann, daughter of a merchant; they had four children: Samuel, Euphrosina, Johann and Ephraim.</p>
<p>Heermann fell ill once again in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1623.html" title="1623">1623</a> and never really recovered, his nose and air passages having become infected. The effects of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty_Years%E2%80%99_War_f1db.html" title="Thirty Years’ War">Thirty Years’ War</a> struck soon afterwards, and Köben was plundered by <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troops.html" title="Troops">troops</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1632.html" title="1632">1632</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/3/1633.html" title="1633">1633</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/3/1634.html" title="1634">1634</a> and <a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a>, and Heermann lost his worldly possessions several times. In 1634, his illness prevented him from preaching altogether, and he no longer read out his sermons in church. On doctor’s advice, he moved across the border to Poland, to Lissa (now Leszno), where he died on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">17 February</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1647.html" title="1647">1647</a>.</p>
<p>‘’’Works’’’ Heermann started out writing Latin poetry, with his ‘’Flores ex Otfridi Evangeliorum vireto’’ being published in <a href="../../../1/6/0/1609.html" title="1609">1609</a>. The poems contained in this collection are Latin poems based on passages from the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospels.html" title="Gospels">Gospels</a>, yet for each Latin poem, one or two lines of German poetry were added, showing that Heermann had an early desire to write poetry in German too. Later works also belonged to the tradition of versifying passages from the Gospels, such as ‘’Andächtiger Kirchenseuftzer’’ (<a href="../../../1/6/1/1616.html" title="1616">1616</a>), ‘’Exercitium pietatis’’ (<a href="../../../1/6/3/1630.html" title="1630">1630</a>) - a revised version of ‘’Flores’’ – ‘’Verbessertes Schliessglöcklein’’ (<a href="../../../1/6/3/1632.html" title="1632">1632</a>) – a revised version of the ‘’Kirchenseuftzer’’, and ‘’Sontags- und Festevangelia’’ (<a href="../../../1/6/3/1636.html" title="1636">1636</a>). Impetus for this process of revision came from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Opitz_d708.html" title="Martin Opitz">Martin Opitz</a>’s ‘’Buch von der deutschen Poeterey’’ (<a href="../../../1/6/2/1624.html" title="1624">1624</a>), which acted both as a defence of German poetry and a set of guidelines on how German poetry should be composed. Johann Heermann can be regarded as one of the first German poets to write according to the rules set out in Opitz’s tract.</p>
<p>As well as poetry based on the Gospels, Heermann also wrote poetry influenced by works of devotional literature, especially those by Valerius Herberger, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Moller_edf7.html" title="Martin Moller">Martin Moller</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Arndt_acbb.html" title="Johann Arndt">Johann Arndt</a>. These works were often themselves influenced by earlier, pre-Reformation texts by the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Fathers_d0f6.html" title="Church Fathers">Church Fathers</a>, especially <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_of_Clairvaux_2c64.html" title="Bernard of Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustine_of_Hippo_c35d.html" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/s/Anselm_of_Canterbury_7924.html" title="Anselm of Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>. Heermann’s most influential work of devotional poetry was ‘’Devoti musica cordis’’ (<a href="../../../1/6/3/1630.html" title="1630">1630</a>), ‘music for a devout heart’, which combined hymns based on texts of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Fathers_d0f6.html" title="Church Fathers">Church Fathers</a> and writers such as <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moller.html" title="Moller">Moller</a> with hymns Heermann himself had composed. In addition to works of poetry, he also published collections of sermons.</p>

<p>Being inenergetic requires the use of no excess braincells. This allows the inenergetic person to slow their brain down to minimum usage, cooling the body to a comfortable temperature. A fan can further the cooling sensation and a commode and a fridge at arms length are vital resources for inenergetic individuals. A possible side affect of being inenergetic is that the individual may swell to a larger size due to excess food resources. It is not recommended that one stays in an inenergetic state for long periods of time.</p>

<p>A small town lying 4 kilometres north of Daylesford, Hepburn Springs is often thought a mere suburb of its larger, southern neighbour. Originally Spring Creek, the township became known as Hepburn Springs only in the mid twentieth century. Home of the internationally renowned Mineral Springs and Spa Resort, Hepburn has long been sought out for its natural beauty and tranquil surrounds.</p>
<p>With a rich European history, most notably with regards to the high numbers of Swiss Italian immigrants that flooded the Hepburn region during the gold rush of the nineteeth century, a rich cultural identity has stayed with the contemporary community, celebrated annually with the local Swiss Italian Festa. Indeed, one of the more enduring progenies of the Swiss Italian culture is the famous bullboar sausage, named so because of its bull and pig ingredients.</p>
<p>Home of the mighty Burras, the local football team, Hepburn was flung into national limelight in mid 2001 when an altercation at a home game led to a full sacle donneybrook, resulting in the expulsion of Hepburn from the central highlands football league for the remainder of the season.</p>

<p>Lepke is the title of a 1974 movie starring Tony Curtis. It tells the true story of Jewish-American gangster Louis "Lepke" Buchalter and his rise to power in the New York Underworld during the 1930s. The role of Lepke is played by Curtis.</p>
<p>The story begins in Brooklyn in 1912, when young Lepke (played by Barry Miller) is arrested for trying to steal a pair of shoes from a store. He is sentenced to reform school. Lepke's mother has abandoned him and moved to Colorado, leaving him on his own.</p>
<p>Flash forward to 1923. Lepke (now grown and played by Curtis) has been released from prison and has moved into his boyhood home in his old neighbourhood. He joins the gang of Little Augie Ogden, a boss whose gang specializes in strike breaking and protection rackets. When the gang pays a visit to a sweatshop whose employees are underpaid, Ogden orders the workers to leave. Mr. Stern, the owner, pleads with Ogden to give him more time to get the money together in order to pay off the gangsters. Lepke refuses to listen to the old man's pleas and shoves him out a window to his death.</p>
<p>Ogden's gang includes up-and-coming gangsters Lucky Luciano (played by Vic Tayback) and Albert Anastasia (played by Gianni Russo). Lepke thinks Ogden is going too soft and decides to bump him off. Outside a nightclub, a car pulls up to Ogden and a girl in his company. The door flys open and Lepke, armed with a tommygun, pumps Ogden full of lead. Lepke then proceeds to bump off the witnesses who saw the killing, including the nightclub's doorman, rival gangster Legs Diamond and the prostitute who was in Ogden's company.</p>

<p><b>Krazy Kards</b> are independantly made fantasy wrestling cards based from the <b>Champions of the Galaxy wrestling game system</b> created by <i>Tom Filsinger</i>. == <b>Krazy Kards</b> have been around since 2000 and are still pushing the envelope on the fantasy wrestling game cards. We currently produce cutting edge full color professional wrestling game cards. Our game cards have even helped pave the way for some design changes to the way the official COTG game cards are produced.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Krazy Kards</b> were the project of two creative guys, writer Keith Vella and artist Kevin Knipe. They were looking to add their own stamp or spin to the ever growing popular Champions of the Galaxy game. They started creating characters and artwork with their own style of the game cards back in 1999 and had a complete set created for the new year back in 2000. Many game players from the Champions of the Galaxy embraced the new cards, characters and their fantasy wrestling federation called the <b>NAWC</b> a.k.a <i>(New Age Wrestling Council)</i>. After about a year of selling and marketing these sets word got out and we eventually met Tom Filisinger at a Galacticon convention in Jamestown New York in the summer of 2001. Tom loved some of our creative designs, ideas and artwork for our game cards and eventually hired Kevin Knipe the very next year to due a freelance project for him. His first project was to produce the first ever color card for the Champions of the Galaxy. This was a big deal since there was never any other official full color cards created for the Champions of the Galaxy until the summer of 2002. Wolf was the character and it was released at Galacticon 2002. The card was uniquely designed in full color and unlike the previous COTG cards at the time this card posted more game player details of the character and had a photo of the character on the card back which was also a first. This make the cards more enjoyable when playing other game players without have to flip over their cards to view the character art. The card was a hit and Tom has used Kevin many times as a freelance artist to create many new color cards and continues to produce new cards for him currently.</p>
<hr />
<p>After Tom Filisinger gave us full permission to use his game system with our independantly created Krazy Kard wrestling cards. We went on to create nine complete sets over the years. Our sets continue to sell well and we now have our own game following. Many people collect our sets because of the great artwork. Still others collect for the characters and the storylines to use in their own federations. We have improved the artwork and print quality over the years and sales of our sets have increased and some of the artwork is highly collectable now since all cards are serial numbered and printed in very low print runs making these sets and cards extremely rare to own. Values will only increase especially in the future as the older sets are no longer available.</p>

<p><b>Daniel Kinnear</b></p>
<p>Born on the 20th of Feburary, 1989, Daniel resides in Burnside in South Australia, Australia, is a year 12 student with interests in dance music, tennis, cars, movies, home entertainment, and women. He enjoys chilling with Trent, playing PSP (PlayStation Portable), driving, listening to dance music (especially Paul Van Dyk, Ferry Corsten, Stunt, DJ Tiesto, Darude, and The Prodigy). Daniel used to listen primarily to hip-hop, such as 50 Cent and G-Unit, but now considers this music to be somewhat hollow and has since moved to an even more hollow taste in music, but which is more enjoyable.</p>
<p>His career as a bikini waxer begun in early 2006, and is going on strong (Daniel only waxes women he considers to be model material). Daniel is known in Burnside as "The Burnside Pimp" for his involvement in pimping ho's in the area. This success in this industry ensures that he will, within the next five years, be setting up a nightclub similar to Heaven or The Village, although no-one will visit these clubs once Mr. Kinnear's ultimate dance club is in operation due to its awesomeness.</p>

<p>A Dockominium is created when a marina converts or sells individual wetslips to individual owners. Traditionally, marinas are in the business of renting or leasing space. A comparison would be the conversion of a rental apartment to a Condominium. An association is created that monitors the maintenance and operation of the marina. Each individual owner is responsible for paying monthly, quarterly, or annual association dues, and for their own property taxes assessed on the wetslip. Dockominium conversions are a popular trend taking place in the marina industry in high demand areas focusing on the luxury markets.</p>

CHMA in short, stands for Catholic High Music Awards. This idea was basically formed during 2004. Obviously, this award is only for Catholic High School(Singapore) students who are musically or artistically inclined, but it must have something to do with music.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Primary malignant bone tumors are rare. Four types make up the majority. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) - a pleomorphic sarcoma of storiform pattern without differentiation Osteosarcoma - similar to malignant fibrous histiocytoma with differentiation to osteoid production Chondrosarcoma - cellular cartilaginous lesion with abundant binucleate cells, myxoid areas, and pushing borders Ewing's sarcoma - small, blue-round cell neoplasm</p>
<p><br />
System(s) affected: Musculoskeletal</p>
<p>Genetics: Ewing's sarcoma has 11/22 chromosomal translocation and EW5-FLI-1 fusion protein Osteosarcomas shows loss of retinoblastoma and p53 suppressor genes and amplification of the genes C-myc, mdm-2, SAS, and cyclin-dependent kinase</p>
<p><br />
Incidence/Prevalence in USA: Rare: 5000 bone and soft tissue sarcomas per year, a practicing orthopedic surgeon may see one primary malignant tumor of bone in every five years of practice. Ewing's sarcoma is less common in blacks.</p>
<p>Predominant age: MFH - teens and elderly Osteogenic sarcoma - teens and early twenties Chondrosarcoma - very young and very old Ewing's sarcoma - children, teens, and early twenties</p>
<p><br />
Predominant sex: Male = Female</p>
<p><br />
CAUSES:</p>
<p>Generally unknown</p>
<p>MFH often follows irradiation or arises in old bone infarct</p>
<p>Osteosarcoma has association with loss of suppressor retinoblastoma and p53 genes</p>
<p>Chondrosarcoma may arise in pre-existing enchondroma or exostosis</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ICD-9-CM: 170.9 Malignant neoplasm of bone and articular cartilage, site unspecified</p>

<p>The Mockingbird Nightmare are a four piece indie rock band based in the heart of the English countryside in Kent. Their sole intention is to play original, atmospheric and thought provoking progressive post-hardcore with a schizoid indie edge. With a sound that has been compared to At The Drive-In, Christie Front Drive, Sonic Youth and Fugazi, this 4-piece are at the vanguard of the new English post-hardcore revolution.<br />
<br />
Originally conceived as a solo project for the vocalist/guitarist Rob Stubbings (having played shows as Fire &amp; Verse), the music quickly evolved from its catchy indie rock beginnings to something more profound. After enlisting the drum skills of close friend Paul Smith, the band expanded to include friends Paul Jarvis on guitar and Stephen Franklin on bass. Using influences ranging from 70s progressive rock to 90s emo the band initially played under the moniker Gloryscene. After releasing their debut EP, "Distance Makes the Heart Scream Louder", the band became disillusioned with the London club circuit and retreated to the Kent countryside to reinvigorate and reinvent themselves. The 15 month hiatus resulted in music that is monolithic, atmospheric, experimental while still retaining the undertones of catchy indie rock that brought them to the fore in the first place.<br />
<br />
The new incarnation of the band uses diverse influences ranging from bands such as Mineral, Rush, The Mars Volta, Vanilla, Gentle Giant, Mew, Split Lip, while retaining an essence of freshness and experitmentalism not seen in the UK scene.<br />
<br />
Having played notable shows including the Rocksound/Fierce Panda "Club Fandango" nights, the band were approached by New Jersey based independent record label Engineer Records to appear on a 3-way split. The 9 track CD will be released in the latter part of 2006, while the band continue to play gigs and festivals and attracting positive reviews and further interest from record labels.</p>

<p>Barium 137 is a form of gamma radiation that has been used in nuclear fission. Its half life has been determined to be about 2.55 minutes. Students at Dobbs Ferry High School in Mr. Mallon's 11th grade IB Physics class have used this substance to practice finding the half-lives of different substances. Some students who partook in this experiment were Matt "Gilheim" Belloise, Cheese "BNT" Bentert, Matthew "Traffic Town" Goldberg, and Matthew "Puggy Scoops" Ferrari (Mets ARE GOING DOWN!!!!).</p>

<p>Kauila is Hawaiian and can refer to either a dark colored hardwood or to a mythical turtle hatched from an egg of the same color.</p>
<p>The wood was treasured as metals were very scarce in Hawaii and the hardness of the wood made it useful. Kauila trees are now almost extinct.</p>
<p>Kauila, the turtle, could turn herself into a little girl and would play with the children of Punalu'u on the Big Island. She could also bring fresh water, explaining the fresh water springs underneath the surf.</p>

<p>A Bemoose is an ex-Chav turned Emo, and they are considered a part of the youth culture in the English country. They are usually found amongst areas such as shopping centres and public places as they like to be around people and the community. Although not as well knon as the common 'Chav' or 'Ned'(Latin: Multos Irata)they are still noticed in the lesser communities around South Eastern England. One town, Northampton, is infamous for the Bemoose community spreading to other areas such as Daventry and Corby.</p>
<p>A typical Bemoose will appear to be a mix of 'Emo' and 'Chav', however it has been confirmed that variation occurs within the species. Your average Bemoose usually sports a navy or dark coloured tracksuit bottom accompanied with a black tweed jacket. The jacket can be accessorized with various badges with slogans across them. On the head, a Nike cap is tuned to the moon and thick silver 'bling' draped across their necks. A mismatching striped sock is worn on either foot and the tracksuit bottoms are tucked in the 'Chav' way. Usually mistaken from a long distance as a Chav, they become depressed at the fact that their Chav traits have not entirely vanished and proceed to slit their wrists with a sharp razor blade. This has been occurring across Wellingborough specifically, and locals are beginning to be anxious about traces of blood appearing along benches and walls.</p>
<p>Typically, they enjoy listening to a combination of two vastly differentated genres of music, Rap and Rock. This taste of music has been dubbed Ra-ck in their community and it is symbolised as a mosh sign accompanied with a fist (done with the other hand). Typical examples of Ra-ck music is: 50 Cent, Nirvana, Blazin' Squad, and My Chemical Romance. The attitude of Bemoosi (plural) towards other members of the public is often positive and normal. However, it has been reported that in an extreme case of violent attitude executed by a certain Bemoose (Phoebe Mau) to a police constable in early 2006, she had managed to lodge a small Argos ballpoint pen halfway into the police constable's shoulder. This resulted in an Anti-Social Behavioural Order (ASBO) and two nights spent in a guarded police cell, and a negative view upon the community. It is now hard, because of the incident, for Bemooses to blend in the public scene without being looked upon with scorn.</p>
<p>One of their infamous sayings is a joke, indirectly referring to a certain well known Bemoose within the youth culture. The joke is as follows: What do you call a Scottish Djoka? They are ever so tasty!</p>
<p>A blood filled sausage!</p>
<p>Note: The Djoka is in fact, a Serbian slang word for Penis. The answer is a pun, because 'Blood Filled Sausage' is a delicacy in Scotland, called a 'Haggis'. It can also refer to the male sex organ in English slang.</p>

<p>Layton Elliott, poet, songwriter and musician, was born in Longview, Washington during a snowstorm in 1955. Described as a 'world-class poet' when he was only 19, he spent the next 30 years writing poems about life, love, and death. The best of these poems have been published in the book entitled "The Collected Poems of Layton Elliott"; a few unpublished poems are available on the official website at <a href="http://www.laytonelliott.com" class="external free" title="http://www.laytonelliott.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.laytonelliott.com</a>.</p>
<p>Layton Elliott's works include a poem about the death of Spock ("Perpetual Trek") and a poem about the fall of the western timber industry ("Phantom of the Westmill"). A book is currently in the works that will contain poems on the commercial fishing industry amongst other topics.</p>

<p>The Ven. Gelongma Karma Khechog Palmo, daughter of Francis Edwin Houlston and Nellie Diana Swan, was born in Derby, England, on the 5th of February, 1911 and given the name of Freda Marie. Educated at the Parkfields Cedars Schools in Derby, she later obtained an M.A. degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at St. Hugh's College, Oxford University. It was here that she met her husband, an Indian aristocrat of the Bedi family, direct descendant of the Sikh dynasty of Gurus initiated by Guru Baba Nanak. Her life in India, since she settled there in 1934, has been a busy and varied one. Apart from bringing up two sons and a daughter (who are now all married - the second son, Kabir Bedi, is a well-known film star) she was professor of English at Srinagar in Kashmir; editor of the magazine "Social Welfare" of the Ministry of Welfare; on the administrative staff of the United Nations Social Services Planning Commission to Burma; advisor on Tibetan Refugees to the Ministry of External Affairs. She also won the National Prize for a book of Children's Verse which was translated into Urdu, in 1957. After coming into contact with Buddhism in Burma, she became a pupil of the Vice President of the World Fellowship of Buddhists, Ven. Dayadaw U Thittila Aggamahapandita, in 1953. Acting in an official capacity, she attended the Buddha Jayanti (2500th Anniversary) in New Delhi in 1956, as well as Buddhist conferences in Bangkok, Sarnath and Malaysia. Since 1958 she has been devoted to the service of the Tibetan refugees in India, particularly the lamas and nuns. She founded: Friends of Buddhism (1953 - 1962) in New Delhi Tibetan Friendship Group (1960 - continuing) Young Lama's Home School, Dalhousie, India (1961 - 1965), Mahayana Monastic House (1965 - continuing), Mahayana Buddhist Nunnery, Tilokpur )1963 - continuing). In 1953 she took personal vows of a Brahmacarya and in 1958 the Eight Precepts Upasika Vows. After taking the Bodhisattva Vow from his Holiness Gyalwa Karmapa, head of the Karyudpa Order of Tibetan Buddhism, in 1963, she left home and accepted the ordination of a Buddhist nun from him on August 1st, 1966. In 1972, at Hong Kong, she became the first Tibetan Buddhist nun in many centuries to receive the Bhikkhuni Ordination - hence the title of Gelongma. Since then she has undertaken several tours to the West, each of them covering wider ground: to Britain and the Continent, the U.S.A. and Canada. She visited the centres set up by the Kargyudpa Rinpoches (Precious Ones), Ven. Chogyam Trungpa and Akong Tulku at Samyê-Ling in Scotland and in the U.S.A., lecturing and giving religious instructions and initiations. Many groups invited her to give talks and she met leading thinkers, such as Prof. Huston Smith author of "The Religions of Man", the poet Allen Ginsberg, John Giorni's group in New York, Dr. Pilgrim, and others. In 1974-75, she accompanied His Holiness Karmapa and a group of his followers on a further extensive tour, which lasted five months and covered the United States, Canada and Europe. Many new centres were opened as a consequence of this and enormous interest was stimulated amongst searchers after a better way of life. The tour ended with a visit to the Pope in Rome. Sister Palmo, as she is affectionately called by her followers in the West (to the Tibetan refugees she is simply known as "Mummy") came to South Africa in 1972 and, as always, left a stream of admiring friends behind. She has promised to return this year, abut the end of September, bringing with her a Tibetan Lama, the Ven. Ayang Rinpoche, as well as an attendant monk and nun. They will tour for six weeks, visiting the main centres and giving lectures and meditation instructions to interested groups and people. Short stops in Rhodesia and Zambia are also envisaged.</p>
<p>[1] This Curriculum Vitae was prepared and printed in Cape Town, for the 1974 visit of Sister Palmo to South Africa. Instead of updating the document I have decided to leave it in its archival form - and perhaps elsewhere, eventually create and more fully representative biography.</p>

<p>Buck Enterprises started out a Christian ska band formed in 1994 as BUCK (Building Up Christ's Kingdom). After some member changes and a change in style the band's name was changed to Buck Enterprises. Buck Enterprises is a six-piece “rock with horns” band. They was captivating listeners with the two-piece horn section to the traditional core of a modern rock/ska band. One review said Buck Enterprises was “hard-hitting, intelligent rock band with smooth melodies and thought-provoking lyrics” making their sound unlike any other band and exciting. Album "Business As Usual" was put out in May of 2001. On Business as Usual the band had covered a Beatles song, "Got to Get You into My Life". Buck Enterprises later released an album that consists of well known praise and worship songs redone in Ska form. Buck Enterprises in 2001 toured with the teen group(Teen Mania) Acquire the Fire doing concerts reaching thousands of people every week!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-07_88b3.html" title="Edit section: Ecdybase">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ecdybase</span></h2>
<p>The " Ecdysone Handbook " was originally created by René Lafont and Ian D. Wilson and published in 1992 by the Chromatographic Society (Nottingham, U.K.). Its aim was to provide general data on all natural ecdysteroids described so far. Each data sheet contained (whenever available) spectroscopic (UV, IR, MS and NMR) and chromatographic data together with a few selected general references. As the ecdysteroid family continued to increase, a second enlarged edition was published in 1996, but the number of compounds is still growing (more than 300 compounds were described at the onset of year 2000). Owing to the limited number of people interested by such a Handbook, a printed version is no longer justified, and moreover the problem of updating content was a major one. This led to the idea of developing a new concept, making a proper use of modern communication tools. A decision was taken to transform the Handbook in a database made freely available on the web to anyone interested in ecdysteroids. Between that decision and the realization, more than two years have elapsed, and the project has involved several additional key contributors. First, Frédéric Marion-Poll (INRA, Versailles) collaborated with several students (from the INA-PG, Paris) to design the general organization of the database, defining the different fields and their links. Then came the enormous work of converting the original MacIntosh data (Pagemaker® files) to the present "Ecdybase". Juraj Harmatha (Academy of Sciences, Prague) and his son Tomas mainly did this conversion. The last part of the work was the design of the web interface done by Tomas Harmatha (Cybersales, a.s.) to create data files rather similar to the data sheets of the Handbook. Owing to compatibility problems, all figures had to be redrawn (by J. H.), but in counterpart this provided an opportunity to correct several mistakes from the previous paper editions. The Ecdybase also includes data on the biological activity of ecdysteroids (when available), added by Laurence Dinan (University of Exeter, U.K.). The "Ecdybase" as presently available, is still considered by the authors as a developing resource, which can be continuously improved and extended with the help of all other ecdysonists. Forms are available for the electronic submission of additional data for new ecdysteroids or for providing more information on already known ones. In the future, functions will be improved and allow e.g. a search of all compounds present in a given animal or plant species. More references will be added, although we do not plan to include physiological data (especially for the most common compound, 20-hydroxyecdysone; the literature is too vast). We shall mainly restrict references to occurrence and to technical aspects. Of course, all suggestions are welcome: to add new information or to correct remaining errors.</p>

<p>Henry Holt was George Washington's bastard half brother. He killed Chief Moonachie of the Paramus tribe in 1795, thus bringing peace to New Jersey for 500 years.</p>
<p>During the War of 1812, an elderly Holt was captured by the British and forced to become a Cabin Boy. A movie by Chris Elliot was later inspired by these events.</p>
<p>Holt died in 1813 due to an advanced case of Chicken Pox. On his deathbead, he created a book publishing company bearing his name, using the magic found in Chief Moonachie's thighbone. The printing press was manned by Noam Chomsky and a duck. The first book printed was 'I Hate The Rain' by Pappy Dogboy. It went on to become the bestselling novel of the 19th century.</p>

<p>The National Homeland Defense Foundation, founded in 2004, is based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. A feeder grant from El Pomar Foundation, also based in Colorado Springs, provided the initial funding for NHDF. Its President and CEO, William T. Harris III, is a vereran U.S. diplomat who was the political advisor to the Commander of NORAD-USNORTHCOM, as well as the State Department advisor to the Bush Administration for the Afghanistan War.</p>
<p>The National Homeland Defense Foundation runs the $1.25 million Military Family Assistance Project, which provides emergency funding to Colorado military families that have spouses deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. $700,000 have been distributed as of June, 2006, and the program will shortly be expanded to Montana.</p>
<p>NHDF also runs the Homeland Defense Symposium, which takes place annually at the Broadmoor. The Symposium was founded in the belief that the War on Terror will continue for many years, and that the military cannot win such a conflict alone. To that end, NHDF seeks to engage Federal, State and local governments, academia, first responders, corporate America and the media, in policy-level conversations that take critical looks at the relevant issues of the day.</p>

<p>Bruce Fitzhugh is an american songwriter, guitarist, singer and former member of legendary metal band Living Sacrifice. He now runs Zambooie, a clothing label. He had been called "The Godfather Of Christian Metal" by some has wrriten articles about the subject in HM Magazine.</p>
<p>This should be deleted, but he isnotable for being the primary songwriter in a notable band such as Living Sacrifice. He meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,[1] reported in notable and verifiable sources.</li>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable). ---Solid State Records</li>
<li>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...). www.hmmgazine.com, that tennesean article</li>
<li>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</li>
<li>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</li>
<li>Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award. -nominated for Dove award</li>
<li>Has won or placed in a major music competition.</li>
<li>Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.)</li>
<li>Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network.</li>
<li>Has been the subject of a half hour or hour broadcast on a national radio network.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact is since he was PART of a notable band, and now RUNS a notable company, he dserves his own article. I'll be updating wiht biographical info as soon as i get it</p>

<p>Following the launch of this book and the creation of the website <a href="http://www.nige54.com" class="external text" title="http://www.nige54.com" rel="nofollow">www.nige54.com</a>, Nige 54 knew that there was a niche for a no holds barred monthly column that informed both men and women about the latest dating issues. As a result he created <a href="http://www.nige54.com/column" class="external text" title="http://www.nige54.com/column" rel="nofollow"><i>the column</i></a> which is 'the only column where you will find the answers to ALL of the questions in relation to dating, relationships &amp; of course, babes!'</p>
<p>With <i>the column</i> becoming such an instant hit, Nige 54's dating advice was soon in demand and in early 2005 he became a regular columnist for the new online mens magazine <a href="http://www.autobabes.com.au" class="external text" title="http://www.autobabes.com.au" rel="nofollow"><i>Autobabes</i></a> Here he writes a column entitled <i>The Ultimate Advice</i> which has become a landmark feature of each issue.</p>
<p>Writing for <i>Autobabes</i> gave Nige 54 a wider marketplace to promote his talents and in November 2005 he was invited to appear on <a href="http://www.seven.com.au/sunrise" class="external text" title="http://www.seven.com.au/sunrise" rel="nofollow"><i>Sunrise</i></a> to discuss 'How To Pick Up At The <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cup_8497.html" title="Melbourne Cup">Melbourne Cup</a>' which instantly became one of this show's most entertaining segments in recent memory.</p>
<p>Nige 54's national TV appearance on <i>Sunrise</i> received such an overwhelming response that Nige 54 officially launched his Dating Coach business and soon became Australia's Leading Dating Coach where his consultations combine the best attraction, seduction &amp; dating strategies for men while assisting women to improve their dating and relationship skills.</p>
<p>As such Nige 54 was invited to appear on <a href="http://www.fox.com.au/shows/latedateshow" class="external text" title="http://www.fox.com.au/shows/latedateshow" rel="nofollow"><i>The Late Date Show</i></a> broadcast nationally throughout Australia on the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austereo.html" title="Austereo">Austereo</a> network. Here, Nige 54 became <i>The Late Date Show's</i> resident Dating Expert answering listeners calls and offering his ground breaking, sometimes controversial but always entertaining dating tips and advice to people across Australia.</p>

<p>Fire Bellied Toads are reccognized mainly for their unique underbellies, which are marked with blotches of colors ranging from a bright yellow to a distinct red. Their warty skin is usually dark green or lime green, but can be brown. If threatened, the toad flips over onto its back to reveal the vivid coloring that scares off preditors, and secretes a poison out of its skin glands. The males tend to have coarser skin than the females and have pads on the end of their thumbs so they can hold on to the female while breeding. They croak, which is a characteristic od males only, and may have thicker forearms than females. Five years is the average age of sexual maturity. The air temperature dropping is a signal for the Fire Bellied Toads to breed. The male then jumps onto the female's back. The female usually lays 70-200 eggs, which hatch in 3 to 6 days.</p>

<p>Cray is the leader of the Woren Tribe (sometimes also called Worent or Furen, language depending)in the video game Breath of Fire IV. With a powerful conviction, and a temper to match, he's the powerhouse of the game. Excelling in physical strength and stamina, he makes a good frontline character. His main downside is his speed and lack of magic strength, but he does use several useful support spells such as Protect and Speed.</p>
<p>Cray originally set out, joined by his friend Nina, to search for Nina's sister, Elina. While traveling through a desert, they were "attacked" by the Sand Dragon, and their Sand Speeder (A kind of hoverjet) veered off-course and crashed (Note: The Sand Dragon attacked them to purposely sent them towards another character, Ryu). Nina set out by herself to find spare parts in a nearby town while Cray remained behind to guard the damaged ship from thieves. By the time Nina met back up with Cray, she had two other traveling companions, Ryu and Ershin. Together, the four of them set out, unable to find parts for their speeder, to try and continue their search for Elina.</p>
<p>[SPOILER]Later in their travels, and with two more party members, it was revealed by Nina that Cray was in love with Nina's sister, Elina. By the time the party found Elina, she was turned into an artificial "Endless", a "god". Using the sword "Dragonslayer", Cray was asked by Elina to end her life so she would not suffer anymore, and Cray agreed to.[/SPOILER]</p>

<p>The Battle of Tit was a ferocious, yet relatively short battle that took place in Brest, France in 1902. It all began when when French and German troops were attending the play, "The Rape of the Lock". After the play, fifty-seven French and German troops went to the local tavern. Although the exact reason for the skirmish is unknown, as both countries have attempted to cover it up, it is believed that after many drinks, a group of soldiers began reenacting a scene in which a lock of hair is "raped", or cut, from the maiden's head. It seems that the French soldier attempting to cut the lock of hair slipped, cutting the breast of a waitress. Violence ensued, and the soldiers destroyed the tavern, set if afire, and the fifty-seven soldiers, and some civilians, took their fight to the streets. All but seventeen of the soldiers were killed, including thirty-one French soldiers and nine German soldiers.</p>

<p>David has a long musical history that began by chance when a friend gave him his first pair of drum sticks.</p>
<p>"I'll never forget that day" he says." I was hanging out over at a friend's house. We helped his older brother clean up his bedroom. I found an old pair of Ludwig drum sticks, 1S model to be exact. My buddy's brother said I could have them for helping clean up. I started banging on a nearby chair to a Beach Boys record...they all said, 'wow, you sound pretty good!' I was 14."</p>
<p>"My best friend, Jamey Brzezinski, had an electric guitar and amp. We formed this band (just the two of us), and would jam together every day after school. I took a plastic bucket and wrapped waxed paper around it with a rubber band...that was my snare drum. Then I had a plastic trash can for a tom tom, and last but not least, a fire place shovel for a ride cymbal. I think the first tune we played together was "Route 66", by the Rolling Stones. This all took place in the summer before 9th grade. By the time we were back in school that fall, we had a keyboard player in the band, Jack Blair. I still didn't have a real drum set, nevertheless, we still got together to work up tunes."</p>
<p>"By this time, I was on my parents pretty heavily to get me a drum kit. Jamey and I would hit all the music stores in town after school and on weekends. After a couple of months, the store owners would see us coming a mile away...they would stop us and say, 'no, no touching the G...Damn, instruments!' So, I was finishing my first 9th grade quarter, and to my dismay discovered that I was flunking Algebra! My mom flipped out and said that unless I brought my grade up to a B, I wouldn't be seeing any drums for a long time. That meant I had to get an A for the 2nd quarter. I went up to the teacher and requested that he let me sit up in front. I explained that I needed to get an A for the next quarter, or I wouldn't get my drums. I don't know who said it, but it's true...you really do appreciate things that you have to work for. I passed that class with flying colors."</p>
<p>"For my 15th birthday, my dad took me to Wallach's Music City and bought me a red sparkle drum kit. I think it was a "Crown" kit...made in Japan. I'll never forget, I got it home and had no idea how to integrate the bass drum. That weekend, I took my new kit over to Jack's house and we played our material for the first time on real gear! I think I just played 4-on-the-floor to all the beats I knew with my hands. Later that year we did our first real gig. It was at the Arrow View Jr. High assembly. We called ourselves, 'Young Blood.' It's amazing to think of how much we accomplished in a short period of time... everyone was self taught (except for the keyboard player). We started playing all the school dances and parties. We even had a manager...basically, a guy who thought we were cool and had his own car."</p>
<p>"That ride lasted until the beginning of my Junior year in high school. Then, as fate would have it, I was asked to jam with an 'older bunch of guys'... they were in their early twenties. I was torn between friendship and a chance to really stretch my wings. It was tough, but I left my first band, and joined a band that would change my life up to this very day! We called ourselves the 'Mobile Home.' We were quite ahead of our time as we had three guitar players that all sang. As it goes with bands, one of the guitar players didn't like having to share the lime light with two other guys. His name was Eric Fields. We went to school together... he's who actually referred me to the other guys. Well, Eric had an older brother named Barry who played bass. Barry's best friend (who happened to play guitar and sing) was a young <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Hagar_ee02.html" title="Sammy Hagar">Sammy Hagar</a>. Barry had told Sammy that Eric wasn't happy with the band, and Sam asked Barry to take him over to our rehearsal."</p>
<p>"I recall Sammy being dressed really cool and really digging our music. Afterwards the leader, Jesse Llamas, told the rest of us that Sammy wanted to take Eric's place. Even at that young age, I had the balls to ask if this Sammy guy was any good...'what can he do?' Well, the next day we all jammed a couple of Cream songs...Sammy played the solo to "Sunshine Of Your Love" note for note. We've been friends and gigging together ever since. After the Mobile Home broke up, Sam and I formed several bands together. I was out of high school by then but still too young to play in bars. In those days you could actually play hip rock music and make decent bread in bars. It was the early seventies in Southern California. My older brother let me use his I.D., and Sam and I landed our first night club gig. The band was called The Justice Bros....the club was called "The Night Club!" We jammed our asses off, playing as loud and as much Rock as we wanted."</p>
<p>"That band eventually moved up to the San Francisco Bay Area. From there, Sammy heard from a mutual friend that Ronnie Montrose was looking for a singer. Sammy auditioned and became the lead singer and co-songwriter for Ronnie Montrose's new band..."Montrose!" During that time I was becoming disillusioned with the Rock scene, and wanted to delve more into Funk and R&amp;B. I did so for a couple of years and by doing that I really began to understand how the rhythm section worked, and developed a lot more independence on my drum kit. Finally, I moved back to Southern California, playing in several Rock and R&amp;B groups."</p>
<p>"I finally decided to take a chance on this young rock group called Free &amp; Easy..later to be renamed TOYS. Funny, all this time before I had been playing with the older guys, and now I was was the oldest guy in the band! This time around I was really playing Rock with a newly found confidence and savvy, having come full circle so to speak. Sammy and I always stayed in touch as friends, and during my stint with Toys, Sammy checked us out now and again, and actually helped produce a couple of our demos. I was getting valuable composing and recording experience. It is so important to realize that even though some things may seem insignificant or temporary in one's career, they all lead to forming the overall picture. Sammy took notice that I had really progressed as a Rock drummer, and asked me to join his solo band in 1980. From that re-connection with Sam, I went on to record all the Geffen albums for Sammy up until and during his stint with Van Halen."</p>
<p>David and Sammy have played together on and off for over 30 years. In fact, there is no drummer Sammy has spent more time touring and recording with than David. According to Sammy, after he and Van Halen parted ways, David was the natural choice. Even during Sammy's time in Van Halen, he asked David to play drums on his non-Van Halen music, including his solo record, I Never Said Goodbye, and his 'Best Of' record, Unboxed. Additionally, Sammy recruited David and Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony to form his "party" band down in Cabo San Lucas, aptly named "Los Tres Gusanos" ("the 3 worms" in Spanish). According to all involved, Los Tres Gusanos will never die, and rumours abound that they may resurface in Cabo in the future.</p>
