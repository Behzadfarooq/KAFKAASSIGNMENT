<p><b>Strong do not delete.</b> This game has its own community and it is being actively developed. It is prominent as the most openly developed free software MMORPG.

The installation disks of some very popular GNU/Linux distributions (e.g. <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debian.html" title="Debian">Debian</a>) include Crossfire. --Zinoviev 12:52, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough, maybe I should explain what I meant by "unsourced". <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> dictates that <i>"Software is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the software's author(s)"</i>. There's no evidence in the article of sources that are independent from the software or its creator. If you can find some magazine articles, news reports etc., that mention the software, then add them to the article and I will be happy to change my vote. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 13:15, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In an interview on RPG Codex, S.C.O.U.R.G.E. developer's Gabor says he "enjoyed" Crossfire, and compares the "headquarters" level to a Crossfire's town (<a href="http://www.rpgcodex.com/content.php?id=111" class="external free" title="http://www.rpgcodex.com/content.php?id=111" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpgcodex.com/content.php?id=111</a>)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> No <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to demonstrate notability, above sources are passing mentions only or 'review' by allowing visitors to rank the game themselves - IE completely unusable. <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> does cite Linux distributions as acceptable for WP articles, however this seems to have been disputed over for some time now and current discussion on the talk page makes it seem that this aspect of the proposed guideline has not got community support. Whether that really is the case or not, an aspect of a proposed guideline which is disputed is a pretty weak nail to hang an article on.

<li>Yeah, but still, since inclusion in the dists is so very vague as a yardstick of notability, what's a <i>better</i> alternative? Discussed in publications <i>and</i> having been included in a number of Linux dists for a long period of time <i>and</i> still, apparently, doing somewhat well? You know, the spirit of our notability criteria is not "has this thing been discussed in print?" It's "is this thing widely known?"...

<dd>The game has a passing mention in the Linux Journal, and it really is a passing mention (part of which is also referencing Happy Penguin, itself simply confirming that CF actually exists). Every link listed (and that I've found googling) stack up to nothing more than "CF is a rogue-like MMORPG that exists". What we're left with is that:</dd>

<ul>
<li>CF may be well-known in the appropriate circles.</li>
<li>CF has been distributed and live for a number of years.</li>
<li>It may be the earliest example of its type.</li>
<li>Other games have been spawned from it.</li>

<dd>None of which is going to provide sources to build an article, none of which strikes me as a case for keeping this 3 year old stub. If nothing good has been shaken out of the tree now, three years into its existence, then I'd say it was a good time to pull down the shutters. If <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimonin.html" title="Daimonin">Daimonin</a> can be sourced, some info on CF could be included in a development section there. "CF exists" and "D evolved from CF", cited, would be enough to anchor it there. That'd pretty much say everything that's here anyway and hopefully get D's article rolling. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 01:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> First, Crossfire is older than heaven (it has historical weight) and has been included in major Linux distributions for, ungh, just about as long as I can remember (which is to say, it was there when I started using Linux, circa 1996). My memory is a bit hazy there, but that's not the point - the point is that this is <i>old</i> and <i>widely known</i>. <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/by_inst" class="external text" title="http://popcon.debian.org/by_inst" rel="nofollow">rank #8637 in Popcon</a> isn't very awful either. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Being described by a Linux publication and being part of a Linux distribution is notable. It would help a lot of the "oldest" claim could be substantiated. -<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:11, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Agreeing with Mgm above that being described in a Linux publication and being part of Linux distributions is notable.
