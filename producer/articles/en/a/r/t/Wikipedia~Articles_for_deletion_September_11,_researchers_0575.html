<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Aside from all the abusive <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks by voters so far, the page provides a good overview of various authors who have written on the subject. Whether or not you agree with what they have to say (or have even bothered to read it) they are notable. They have written books which have sold many thousands of copies and have been endorsed by many prominent activists, professors, organizations, etc. If you don't think the page is properly titled, then that's an issue for "pages to be moved," not vfd. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 10:14, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It seems you’re making yet another ad hominem attack. (And here I thought that “conspiracy theorists” were the ones who made logical fallacies.) Repeating your opinion does not make it any more a "reality," and like I said if you think there's a problem with the title then the move process can take care of that. And BTW, I was not arguing "vehemently."

<li>Stating that a group of people argue vehemently is an ad hominem attack? I think you don't understand the meaning. Regardless, your response doesn't address the point. As with my comment below, to do this article appropriately to include all viewpoints would result in an immense article. The list, as it stands now, is all people who do not agree with official conclusions. Thus, the content is more appropriate for the 9/11 conspiracy theories page. Please observe that I haven't voted to delete the content; merely merge it. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:11, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Calling people "conspirowackos" is ad hominem. So is calling them "conspiracy believers." Everyone believes that 9/11 was due to a conspiracy - the only debate is who was doing the conspiring. Responding to an argument by saying that people "argue vehemently" is a non sequitur. I apologize for not making it more clear which of your fallacies I was referring to. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 04:22, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your levity is appreciated, Durin, even if not refreshing, given the gravity of the tragedy at issue. Of course, adding researchers who have tried in vain to keep alive the Bush administration's deceptive and disproven conspiracy theories, linking Iraq to 9/11 and to stockpiles of WMDs, would be very much welcome (short of spamming); bring 'em on, to coin a phrase. Merging into an article including the term conspiracy is patently absurd, however. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 23:27, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Generally the term "September 11th researchers" has been used to mean researchers who believe there was complicity by the Bush Administration in 9/11, but if you would like to change your vote and include some of the more notable researchers hired by the government to uphold the official conspiracy theory (that a cabal of Muslim zealots living in caves in Afghanistan hatched a successful plot to defeat the world's most powerful air -defense system using box-cutters) then I would not object. The article could easily include a section for those researchers who believe there was U.S. government complicity and one for those who don't. That's what Wikipedia is all about - <i>presenting</i> both sides of an issue and letting the readers decide for themselves. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 20:18, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If I were to include the people as I suggested, per the current way in which the page is laid out, the page would greatly exceed recommended article length. My suggestion was intentionally tongue in cheek, and should have been read as such. The list of people researching 9/11 is immense, too much so for Wikipedia to have an article titled as this one. The article thus is inherently going to be biased towards conspiracy theories. As such, it deserves to be merged. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:11, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was well aware that that you were being rhetorical. I simply decided to call your bluff. I am quite serious about what I said though, so long as like Ombudsman said, you don't spam the article with hundreds of insignificant individuals. It should only include the most notable researchers from each side - with two categories - those researchers who believe there was U.S. government complicity in 9/11 and those who don't.</li>

<li>Then we should also be analyzing the significance of the people who are currently in the article if we go that direction. Before doing that, some metric needs to be established for how to count as significant. Anyone can publish a book; there are lots of companies that will enable you to publish, so that is not enough of a metric. Referring to WP:MUSIC #3 as a possible guideline, then we'd need two or more books from a major publisher by the author. The list of government investigators is <i>very</i> long, but their qualifications and notability are no less than most of the people currently on this list. Regardless of what you or I think, it's very clear from the current vote that this article will be merged; currently 9 merge 4 keep. If the article passes VfD as 'keep', then we can discuss metrics. Failing that, I'll refrain from commenting further. My vote for <i>merge</i> stands.
