<li><b>Delete</b> Term is not yet adequately defined by the industry to merit an encyclopedia article. Too many of the references described the term as needing definition.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As full disclosure, it happens that the term "business logic" figures prominently in the very project that I'm working now, and its use is fully consistent with this article (it's the part of the code that deals with how we make money). So if it's patent nonsense and complete bollocks then that implies I am wasting my time.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b>: I will fix it up if given some time. I just came to this page a few minutes ago by doing a query (i.e., I was looking for it specifically).

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> If this is <a href="../../../n/o/n/WP%7ENONSENSE_9fee.html" title="WP:NONSENSE">WP:NONSENSE</a> then so are most of the Wikipedia articles on ideas in social science, pop music, works of art, psychological theories, religions, and political philosophies, among many other areas. The <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_rules.html" title="Business rules">business rules</a> page actually has a good definition of business logic: "Software packages automate Business rules using Business logic." Are you proposing that we delete the business rules article too? It's also clear from the business logic article that business logic models some of the behavior of traditional business processes such as "accounts, loans, itineraries, etc." What is nonsensical about that? I do think the introductory comments equating business logic to other kinds of functional logic are misleading, though. I suggest rewriting the top section, and I'd suggest adding links to the corresponding articles on those particular business processes (accounting, etc.), for those of you who don't understand what these business processes are about. Understanding the business process being modelled is crucial to understanding the business logic. BTW, you only need to thumb through a computer book section to see dozens of examples of business logic, so one can hardly argue that it's a new and untried idea. The proponents have also uncovered a large number of references. The term (as with its companion term, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_rules.html" title="Business rules">business rules</a>, which is less well defined than business logic but is not being challenged) in wide use. I get nearly 9 million hits on Google! There are obviously vast numbers of people who think the phrase is very important, even if some people around here happen to be put off by it. Even if it had no semantic meaning whatsoever it would still warrant an article as an important social phenomenon. Indeed the topic is quite a bit more important than the topic of the average Wikipedia article. If you still think the idea is vague, feel free to add a "criticism" section and say so, assuming you have appropriate sources for such a claim. Donagle 09:43, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The onus of proof is not an proving <i>vagueness</i>, but on proving <i>meaning</i>. You seem to be talking around the subject of a definition rather that attempting to actually define 'Business Logic'. Could you briefly describe what you believe the term means?--<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergie_42a9.html" title="User:Fergie">Fergie</a> 10:19, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What part of the definition in the introduction is unclear? Do you understand that business automation software has to manipulate data that relate to the money-making activity of that business? that manipulation can be directed from various user interfaces? that it is good engineering to separate the manipulation from the interfaces for that reason? I want to make the article clearer, but people blithely dismissing this extensively documented term as "dilbert-esque" (whatever that means) doesn't help. <i>Dilbert</i> may portray people who deal with business organization as idiots, but that doesn't make it true, and in any case the term is used by the <i>developers</i> as well. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 17:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Dilbert-esque refers to writing that sounds impressive but actually means nothing, and is used (in the archetype at least) by IT consultants to bamboozle tech-illiterate business owners. My comments referred specifically to this version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_logic&amp;oldid=63260213" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_logic&amp;oldid=63260213" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, which opened with this gem: <b>Business logic is business logspecific capabilities or processing which that software system embodies</b>. None of that was explained or cross-linked to anything else. If that means anything at all, it doesn't to me, and I'd consider myself at least as smart and well read as the average Wikipedia reader. To be fair, the article has been explanded and improved since.

<li>Cool. Let's be clear: the ideal situation is a <b>better</b> article, not <b>no</b> article. As it stood, it was a bad article. The threat of deletion has spurred appropriate editors into action. That's how the system should work, so I'm pleased. My only concern now is that the article should probably reflect that the term has multiple meanings, and though widely used, can mean different things in different industries and/or in different situations. Perhaps it should even be said that some people consider the term vague and meaningless.

<li><b><strike>Delete</strike></b> <b>Keep</b>. Business Logic is a term with no meaning. Although purported to be software terminology, it does not represent a concrete concept of system engineering or database theory. Arguably Business Logic is noteable <i>precisely because</i> it is in (occasional) use yet represents no defined concept (that is to say it is <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert.html" title="Dilbert">dilbert</a>-esque). I have observed that most attempts to retrospectively assign a concept to Business Logic tend to gravitate towards describing an <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstraction_layer.html" title="Abstraction layer">abstraction layer</a>, yet do not specify a meaningful difference between the two. Other efforts to give meaning to 'business logic' are clearly far too vague or merely <a href="../../../n/o/n/WP%7ENONSENSE_9fee.html" title="WP:NONSENSE">WP:NONSENSE</a>--<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergie_42a9.html" title="User:Fergie">Fergie</a> 10:08, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see any reason to get rid of this article now that it's been rewritten. I hear the term used in serious software engineering contexts all the time, and in the documentation/interface of development tools (for instance, is you use <a href="../../../x/d/o/XDoclet_1e9b.html" title="XDoclet">XDoclet</a> to generate an message-driven <a href="../../../e/j/b/EJB_cd58.html" title="EJB">EJB</a>, it places a todo comment stub saying "do business logic here" in the onMessage method). Even if the above user's disdain for the term is founded (er, tl;dr), it doesn't mean the term doesn't merit an article. If he wants to cite sources calling the term out as fluff, then it can be added to the article to educate people; removing the article would just make people <i>more</i> ignorant... -<a href="../../../d/i/v/User%7EDividedByNegativeZero_aca4.html" title="User:DividedByNegativeZero">VJ</a> 20:18, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps too little emphasis has been put on concrete examples? One of the most prominent is calculation of taxation. Performing a sale in many cases requires a complex calculation of taxes owed to a number of parties. Not correctly performing this calculation may result in transactions that are illegal. The logic used to calculate sales taxes is not directly related to the amount of the sale or any method used to store information about the sale. A detailed description of the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process.html" title="Business process">business process</a> of sales tax calculation encapsulates the business logic of the transaction. The business process goes into further detail about what laws apply and what tax goes where and when, but the business logic for sales tax calculation is apart from the process for sales tax payment. That is what makes the business logic so valuable. All it does is specify how required rules are calculated. This may involve a complex formula including the location, time, agents, and content of the transaction. Before business logic became commonly used software for business transactions was monolithic such that any change to the business process or the the software such as the database that stored transaction amounts required the business logic to be rewritten at great cost. -- <a href="../../../m/0/l/User%7EM0llusk_26b6.html" title="User:M0llusk">M0llusk</a> 18:05, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: There really should be an article about this term in an encyclopedia, since it is used quite often in software engineering. This term might be difficult to describe but this article makes a good job. And maybe it will be improved. There is no need to delete an article because someone does not like the term that is decribed by the article. -- jvd 15:00, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: Maybe it was useful as a threat to goad people into improving a poorly written article, but I find the continued proposals to delete this article very disturbing. Are we supposed to be like the rewriters of history in Orwell's 1984 and pretend the idea of business logic does not exist? Wikipedia is full of articles on ideas that are utter nonsense, quite contradictory, evil, or so hopelessly vague that they couldn't possibly be properly described. That's because human society is full of such ideas. Many such ideas are important to many people. Where these ideas are important, they deserve a Wikipedia article. They also deserve to be criticized. Too many articles on Wikipedia seem to be written by fans of the bad idea described and give short shrift to criticism. The proper response is to insist that cited criticism be included in the article, often prominently, and to insist that all important definitions of an idea, not just the definition preferred by most fans of the idea, should be discussed.CatNoir 16:51, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
