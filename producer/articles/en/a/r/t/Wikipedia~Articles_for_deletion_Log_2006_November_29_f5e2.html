<li><b>Keep</b>. Most opinions here are based simply on a hatred of an inclusion of streets in Wikipedia. Note Fred McGarry's comment above. However, clearly streets can be notable content, as there are many articles on streets on Wikidpedia.Therefore, arguments based on that motivation are invalid. If we don't want to include Stewart Avenue, it should be because it does not warrant an article, not because we dont't like articles on these topics. This appears to be a main thoroughfare, that would be comparable to major streets in any other city. I think this can be either merged or renamed to Stewart Avenue, Bethpage, and would do it the most justice. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 15:28, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s><b>Comment</b>: 5% for third party candidates is not unusual (or notable, for that matter) in races where there is not a competitive major party challenger. I'm all for a generous definition of notability while an election is under way: People need a real-time reference. But after it's over, if the subject of an article's only claim to notability is that they lost an election, and not even a close one -- how does that article serve the readers of Wikipedia? Who is possibly going to look it up, and to what end? 5% of Maine voters is more than enough to overwhelm "rough consensus" here, but not enough to warrant what would be, in effect, a memorial. If this article is going to be kept, then we need clearer guidelines that will be applied across the board to protect the articles of similarly non-notable candidates that get deleted every day in the absence of a Wiki-literate fan club. Otherwise, a keep decision would enforce an arbitrary bias. -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 18:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

<li><b>Delete/Merge to stub as per nom</b> There is no substantive claim made in the article that this book is encyclopedically notable. There are numerous authors and books - most of them academic - on the history of the English language, the effect of new media on language, styles of internet communication etc etc etc out here. Not every one of these is encyclopedically notable. Wikipedia is not a book catalogue and having a listing on online bookstores is certainly not evidence of notability. What needs to be shown is that this book is regarded as "smarter than the average bear", so to speak. Amazon.com sales ranking is currently above <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0415186854/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/103-4867583-8232610" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0415186854/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/103-4867583-8232610" rel="nofollow">1.02 million</a>. This does not rule out that the book is influential, but the Amazon listing is not a persuasive argument in favour of such an assertion. No prejudice against merging <i>some</i> of this content to a stub for Naomi S. Baron, although whether she passes <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> is a matter for later debate (Baron does not have the profile of say, the British linguist <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Crystal_c2a8.html" title="David Crystal">David Crystal</a>). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 06:35, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, it's important to remember that database listings such as Amazon's are not reliable sources. Yes, they confirm that the book exists but beyond that they are of no use since the book description is most likely written by the publisher (not reliable because of conflict of interest).

<p>Its been three years since this article was started, and after all that time we've yet to receive any reliable sources for this article.

Of the two external links provided, one is for Encyclopedia Gothica (not reliable) and the latter is a BBC article which does nothing to support the existence of this neologism.

<li>Umm, it's a proposed criteria, and the point is that it is failing to muster consensus. There is no regular deletion criteria that says lack of citations is grounds for deletion. If there was, the majority of Wikipedia would be up for AfD. The closest existing regular deletion criteria I can find to support those who want to delete this, is that unverifiable articles should be deleted. Since this term has 10,200 Ghits, it may be verifiable. If someone wants to argue otherwise, I'm all ears. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 13:06, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Unverifiability is a criterion for deletion. Simple lack of sources is not currently a guideline for deletion. If I'm wrong, then cite the guideline that explicity says this and I'll change my vote. If you want to argue that Mansonite is unverifiable, you should do so, and lay off the spurious argument that lack of sources is a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 02:43, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

The behaviour/stereotype described in the article is not limited to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> fans, either.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yes, Encyclopedia Gothica may qualify as a "questionable source" (although I'm uncertain; it seems to have an editor independent of the content creators and to require a minimum standard from its articles, but as to what fact-checking processes they employ it is hard to tell), but I feel this particular source would still be usable on this article despite these reservations, due to the exception for subjects "where professional sources offer shallow coverage". I don't think there are many professional quality sources on attitudes between different subsections of the goth subculture. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 14:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The entire article is obvious fascist propaganda copied from the official site (very likely, buy the very same person who created that site). There is <i>no</i> notability to speak of: the name will show on google searches only once outside of the wiki article (twice, if you count a post on a "Stormfront White Nationalist Community" thread...). The Romanian-language version of the name gives... no links whatsoever. It looks like they are only gathering followers in this manner, and wikipedia should not be helping them achieve the notability needed for them to have a wiki article... I mean, if you ask for someone to balance the text, but you would have to find someone who has heard of them or cares about them enough to criticize them. I could just as well create my own couple of "Vanguards", and start wiki articles on them. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 01:59, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is clearly a recognised 'style' in Australia. The article in its current form is very stubby though and a merge with either of the above articles seems appropriate. The 'dictionary article' rationale doesn't really bear close scrutiny, the article is much more than a definition. Popularity is discussed, the relationships of the parts are examined and we are told how the buildings were adapted, that's encyclopedic in my book (if too stubby for an article on it's own). If it's significantly expanded in the next seven days (more than just adding a photo though) then I'm a <b>keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - appears not to be OR for Wikipedia, but an in-joke among mathematicians. The article has a reference to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> so it's not completely made up just for here; and the table is interesting information not available in this format anywhere else, which is always a plus for me. But we lost <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Pigs_Day_96e8.html" title="Yellow Pigs Day">Yellow Pigs Day</a>, so I don't suppose we'll save this one either. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 06:27, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This article has been around for a long time and is interesting. I've greatly expanded it with what seems like "original research" to someone who hasn't actually read the <i>policy</i> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. All "research" is taken from known sources and compiled, just as any encyclopedia article would be. If people want to use a stricter definition of OR and scale this back, that's fine. If people want to contribute <i>specific criticisms</i> about the tone or layout of the article, those criticisms can be addressed. But the actual reasons given for deletion are perplexing. Are Bacon numbers used in any fashion other than "in jest"? Why not delete that article, too, or any of the thousands of other articles chronicling humorous phenomena? And I've yet to see someone describe how this is OR or what the sources lack in terms of reliability. The sources are <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDb_27b2.html" title="IMDb">IMDb</a>, the Erdős Number Project, and the like, which are very reliable, and the references as to notability are the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Telegraph_eab7.html" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> and <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boing_Boing_1638.html" title="Boing Boing">Boing Boing</a>, not exactly obscure sources themselves. Please, base your recommendations on actual <b>policy</b> and actual <b>facts</b>, not on a knee-jerk reaction to an article about a phenomenon unfamiliar to you. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 06:49, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>A few mentions of a joke does not equal "notability". Only a few people are mentioned in the articles, and so the choice of who else to include is original research. Maybe it should get a few sentences in <a href="../../../e/r/d/Erd%C5%91s_number.html" title="Erdős number">Erdős number</a>, though I still doubt that it's any more than a minor joke that got a bit of press coverage. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">T</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SPUI_0b50.html" title="Special:Contributions/SPUI">C</a>) 07:20, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The choice of whom else to include is made by the definition of the term. Synthesizing primary and secondary sources is not OR; it's what writing an encyclopedia is all about. Again, it's hard to see what part of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> this supposedly violates. And clearly if notability were the main concern, it would have been mentioned in the initial AfD call. The concerns were NOR and RS, and the article satisfies both of these. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 08:06, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Although the sources may be reliable I think this I see no signifcant support for this being a notable widely used neologism. Yes, it is out there but I would say fairly non-notable. No dispute about the various Erdos-bacon numbers just about the notablility of the subject. Gets 334 ghits with many wikipedia mirrors. Kind of weak. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 00:45, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This article is reliably sourced. However, this topic isn't notable nor encyclopedic. This is the equivalent of something made up in school one day for math professors, one of which happened to convince someone to write about the subject. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 10:53, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Made up in school one day by some professor who then convinced someone to publish it</i> is often notable - <b>convinced someone to publish it</b> is the most obvious sign of notability. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:19, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you implying that everything published is notable? <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 19:29, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm stating that the argument you present is flawed. I'm not sure that's there's a generic criterion for notability (nor is lack of notability a generic criterion for deletion) ~ but <i>published</i> isn't something that can be tossed aside when asserting non-notability with no real evidence. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:54, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you're saying that if something is published it is assumed notable until proven otherwise? That's a rather naive assumption. I've seen tons of published things that aren't notable or encyclopedic enough for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 20:11, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not suggesting you <i>assume</i> anything. Instead of assuming notability, why not evaluate it? I'm only suggesting <i>being published</i> is an indicator of notability, and one that can't be easily thrown aside (especially when no real argument of non-notability is made) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:20, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It's located in Europe, where 100 years isn't that much, historically speaking. Certainly not enough to call it "obvious" without any supporting sources.

<dd>I said nothing about any sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> Getting "some votes" would be a rather extreme loosening of notability guidelines.

<dd>No that won't solve the issue...and that is strange logic seeing as nobody has presented lack of material as an argument. It's the nature of the material, and adding more doesn't make it better...quite the opposite in fact. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 07:04, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, check user pages of yours, mine and Spawn Man - somewhere there they mentioned lack of material! I have added details to every flashback episode. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilvaStorm_8c93.html" title="User:SilvaStorm">SilvaStorm</a></dd>

<dd>No, you're confusing lack of material with uselessness, (from before you added the details in any case anyway...). As I said before, every episode has a flashback, so you may as well see the list of episodes list. Whatever the case, the article is fan cruft &amp; its contents can be seen in any of the episode articles... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 03:17, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Author and lawyer, doesn't seem to quite meet notability requirements. Tagged as unreferenced for over a month with no edits whatsoever, but really the lack of references makes it difficult for me to see notability. Google and Amazon don't turn up much. Also nominating <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lonely_Crowd_2893.html" title="The Lonely Crowd">The Lonely Crowd</a></i>, the article on his book that reads like a book review and has also been untouched for a while.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, potentially endless.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think the benefits of the category outweighs the benefits of a long, messy list in this case.

Although there are pages about this game on IGN, GameSpy and other websites, they are nothing more than the basic information about the game, such as a small description and some details. GameSpy hasn't even given it a GameSpy Score. WP:SOFTWARE explicitly states:
<blockquote>
<p><i>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, user guides, television documentaries, and full-length magazine reviews <b>except for the following</b>:<br />
- Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the author or manufacturer talks about the software, and advertising for the software. Newspaper stories that do not credit a reporter or a news service and simply present company news in an uncritical or positive way may be treated as press releases unless there is evidence to the contrary.<br />
- <b>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report version releases without comment, price listings in product catalogues, or listings on software download sites.</b></i></p>

ZDoom was listed as one of those ports, but was not the focus of the article, making that coverage trivial. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">he shoots</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">he scores!</a>)</font> 16:43, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's not what trivial means here. Trivial means something like an entry in a directory, not an article specifically about a handful of programs <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 20:29, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Unless they actually make comment on the thing, then it's trivial. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonkoldyk_16c0.html" title="User:Simonkoldyk">Simonkoldyk</a> 00:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have the entire article right here. It's a small sidebar column that's mostly about how Doom source ports make the game look better. Here's what they say about ZDoom:
<blockquote>
<p>"ZDoom. <a href="http://zdoom.notgod.com/" class="external free" title="http://zdoom.notgod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://zdoom.notgod.com/</a> Includes console, jumping optional OpenGL support, and support for 'dehacked' mods like the Aliens TC"</p>
</blockquote>
Basically nothing we don't already know about the port. This is nothing more than a trivial mention. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">he shoots</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">he scores!</a>)</font> 08:43, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> There are no claims of notability and appears mostly to be spam. Relatively little content.

To those who want this kept I would more explictly say as others have: Clean it up, establish notability, improve references, remove the spam/features section.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok...new here. My first contrib. I guess I am confused about what is definable as orginal research, even after reading the description. As pointed out, the term has been used in many publications- mostly role playing games- therefore, it is an accpeted term- it is the (my) definition that should be at issue.. But then you see my conundrum is that role playing games are made up from the imagination in most cases. I fail to see how a term in a made-up RPG can ever be accepted...but obviously, according to wikipedia's rules, that is allowed. I also have personal issues understanding the policy, since it seems that for something to be an 'accepted term' either someone on wiki has to have heard of it, or it can be googled or something. If those are the rules, those are the rules- I'm not complaining- just fail to completely understand the rationality. Let's say I write a book, and completely make up a new word. If I can reference it in a book, apparently that makes it 'wiki-able'- is what i am understanding. That makes me want to dig up that old book of sniglets from the 80's....would sniglets be rejected, if referenced from a publication? They are clearly made-up words. This is an honest question- not trying to be a smart-aleck. I don't have any vested interest in this term being on the wiki, except that some people actually follow these philosophies, and call themselves that. It is an underground subculture of sorts- a sort of modern-day religion that is very new...but since it is not referenceable, yet in books or the net, I will concede that my contrib meets OR as defined....my mistake, which i realize in hindsight. However, again since i am new here, I thought I was just *starting a page, that other people would come along in and add the GURPS defs, et al. No big deal- delete if you feel the need.Romshadow 02:09, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> the problem with your definition is that it is pretty limited to your ideas, and you did not demonstrate those ideas as shared by anyone else. That may be valid content for many places on the Web, but Wikipedia is not the place for original thought. That is expressed in <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. To take your sniglet example, I don't know what they are, but if they're in a book somewhere, it's at least possible that said content would be worthy of an article (though if the book isn't all that notable, it might be best just to have the book, and not all the possible things within it). However, you shouldn't create sniglets for Wikipedia. It's like Jedi Knights. Wikipedia isn't the place for George Lucas, or anybody else to write stories about them. Now we can write about the stories with Jedi Knights in them, and have completely valid articles. Do you see the difference? In this case, you seem to have produced thoughts on Technomancers, but haven't related them to any real-world content. My suggestion if you want this article, would be to discuss them in say, the terms of the RPGs they appear in, and the other stories where they are present. If somehow, it became real-world important, then you could have something like <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_census_phenomenon.html" title="Jedi census phenomenon">Jedi census phenomenon</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:26, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's all true, although the point that's been raised a couple of times here is that this list is somewhat original research-y.

<dd>With respect, I disagree. If literature theorists 1, 2 and 3 all argue that some of the contents of this list are legitimate deus ex machinas, then all that remains is to hunt up citations for that and call that part of the list verifiable (what to do with said verifiable list is anyone's guess, but it's verifiable at least). If, however, the only reason that a particular deux ex machina is included here is because an editor acting on their own behalf felt that it was one, then it's Original Research. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:48, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I am saying that every high school automatically qualifies. At least, that's what I've noticed the policy to be in a bunch of these AfD debates.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm having a bit of trouble finding good info on the school at the moment since I'm at work and I have limited access. At the moment I would recommend that we <b>wait</b> a while to see if anyone comes along with some notable alumni or events to spruce the article up.

<dd>Being banned by a country's IPS can be ONE of the reasons why a website may be notable. Another reason is that the website ranks in the top 30,000 according to Alexa. Another reason why his website is notable is that it seems all Wikipedias who edit on the subject of Islam know about this website. If all of them know and almost all do, his website is notable enough. Everything else combined makes him and his website notable. As I said, people who want this page to be deleted belong to the group that disagrees with his opinions. And again if he has caused so much discussion on Wikipedia, he's DEFINITELY notable. In summary Ali Sina is much more popular than the average college professor and hence is notable.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 04:11, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>He passes the "Search engine" test: His name comes up <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22ali+sina%22+-%22Bu+Ali+Sina%22+-%22Bou+Ali+Sina%22+-site%3Afaithfreedom.org+-site%3Ahumanists.net%2Falisina%2F+-site%3Awikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22ali+sina%22+-%22Bu+Ali+Sina%22+-%22Bou+Ali+Sina%22+-site%3Afaithfreedom.org+-site%3Ahumanists.net%2Falisina%2F+-site%3Awikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">80,000 times</a>, not counting the results on his own websites and this one. Search engine popularity is one method of the Alternate tests of Notability (see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>).</li>

The sheer hatred and bigotry that he engenders in others makes him notable and also make it wise of him to be somewhat untracable: his Pseudonymity is not grounds for deletion.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think that the issue of "notability" doesn't apply since there are tons of articles on wiki about fictional Pokemon and Star Wars characters and planets. As for the soapbox issue: If there is edit-warring or inappropriate editing going on in the article, it can be dealt with according to wiki guidelines and policy. It has been long-established that POV issues <i>in</i> the article are not the basis for an article's deletion. I agree that there is some suspicious/bad faith nom stuff going on, all the argument's put forth center on his views etc, it wouldn't surprise me if the delete votes belong to people who share an opposition to his views like Matt57 said. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 13:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>&#160;: Firstly because he's anonymous, secondly anyone can send an email to the pentagon/whitehouse/state department/president of the US or any other country for that matter and claim to have 'debated' when they get a reply. He's not-notable. A simple search on google trends for "Ali Sina" will verify this <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=Ali+Sina&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/trends?q=Ali+Sina&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, and since some people want to link this AfD with the Zakir Naik Article, just take a look at the people searching for Zakir Naik compared to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Ballmer_1410.html" title="Steve Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=Steve+Ballmer%2C+Zakir+Naik&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/trends?q=Steve+Ballmer%2C+Zakir+Naik&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.

<dd>That protection wouldnt do anything. These controversial topics are forever undergoing revert wars. Its ridiculous to give vandalism powers to anyone new who comes to Wikipedia. Just one example is Mak82kyd, who started to vandalize both of these articles (I will say that because of him, these articles were nominated for deletion, because he reverted the Deletion requester's good edits on Zakir Naik so much so that he nominated them for Deletion - this is the truth behind these two Deletion requests). Mak82hyd also voted twice for the deletion of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Sina_7a6a.html" title="Ali Sina">Ali Sina</a> - his writing style is similiar and his IP is similiar to what he has used before. At one point, he proceeded to delete huge amounts of information on <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Sina_7a6a.html" title="Ali Sina">Ali Sina</a> while saying he didnt know he had deleted stuff. Currently, Wikipedia has no policies at all for dealing with vandals who jump into Wikipedia and start destroying articles with their own agendas. There is no mechanism to protect such articles from editors who wont stop taking part in revert wars. The 3RR rule does little. This is equivalent to allowing someone to terrorize Wikipedia. Its stupid to give such powers to vandals. There's a real need for a new kind of protection.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 03:47, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree 100%. There are, however, mechanisms to get vandals and even counterproductive editors banned for longer periods of time but they take a while. The reason they take so long is to be fair, however it is clear to me that certain spaces in wikipedia need a stronger sheriff that is less concerned with fairness and more concerned with order. Editors would need to tread lightly in these designated areas. I think it may be more productive to bring these articles to the arbiration commitee than to afd, even though it may be a burdensome process. These afds are likely to result in nothing.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 18:26, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry to say that I'm one of the people considered to be edit-warring on this page, but I don't think that is just in that I've always attempted to add things and not delete.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say that Prechter is not notable, since he has had an article dedicated to him on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, and all the following make significant reference to him (I can add several articles from the Financial Times as well - he is also notable in Europe)</p>

<p>The trouble with this article is that Rgfolsom (Robert Folsom), who confirms that he works for Prechter, refuses to let this material into the article. I don't know how to make Folsom not revert this material - perhaps it is impossible. But I think that the article should be kept, if material from reputable publications is allowed. Of course if only material straight from Prechter is allowed, then the article should be deleted.</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Smallbones. Edit warring is not a deletion grounds. I tend to agree that promotional links should not be included. If it can be confirmed (the link given is broken) that the man had a NYT best seller and was mentioned on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, he seems to be at least borderline notable as a stock analyst. If the man's predictions got this much commentary, he almost surely merits an article.

<blockquote>
<p><i>Prechter has authored or edited 14 books, including Conquer the Crash, a New York Times bestseller.[1] He has also published monthly financial commentary in the Elliott Wave Theorist since 1979.[2] In recent years Prechter has supported the study of socionomics, a theory about the dynamics of human social behavior.

<dd>[1] is a blocked website (you have to register to read the review) ... BTW, is having one of his 14 books on the list for only one week sufficient for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>?</dd>
<dd>[2] is a reference to his self-published monthly newsletter, <i>Elliott Wave Theorist</i> - hardly a 3rd party claim of notability; it's just support for the assertion that he's been writing his own tip-sheet for almost 30 years.</dd>
<dd>[3] is a reference to his book, published by his own company, New Classics Library - again, very <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>.</dd>

<dd>If someone should include Real Citations (with ISBNs) for that list of books he has authored, we'd see that they are self-published as well ... I could write a dozen books and start my own company to publish them ... does that mean that if I can get a periodical with a Wikipedia article to write a review of one of them, then I can have a biographical article, too?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So far, the only 3rd party references for him (including those mentioned above by <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmallbones_ca2c.html" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a>) appear to demonstrate that his <i>noteriety</i> (not the same thing as <i>notability</i>) stems from his failures as a stock prognosticator.

<p>Looks like I'll be the first editor who actually bothers to quote the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> guidelines. That article says, "People who satisfy at least one of the items below may merit their own Wikipedia articles," and I will show that Prechter is a public figure who meets several of the "items" in the guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</i></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "Business books take a bearish turn," a <i>USA Today</i> article on Aug 23, 2002, p. B3. Since 1987, Prechter has been mentioned by name 71 times in <i>USA Today</i>.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "2 Theorists Split On Elliott Wave," a <i>New York Times</i> article on Feb. 6, 1989, p. D6. Since 1981, Prechter has been mentioned by name 25 times in the <i>New York Times</i>.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "3600 on the Dow?," a <i>Barron's</i> front page article on Jan. 5, 1987. Since 1996, Prechter has been mentioned by name 34 times in <i>Barron's</i>/<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "Storm Warning! How Social Mood Drives Markets," a <i>Futures</i> magazine cover article, Nov. 2004.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "Why Bears Growl," a <i>Kiplinger Personal Finance</i> article, October 2005, p. 46.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "Bob Prechter Interview," <i>The Technical Analyst</i> cover article, July/August 2006 issue.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><i>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to the false claim that Prechter's books are all self-published, <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471988499.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471988499.html" rel="nofollow">Elliott Wave Principle</a>, <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471979546.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471979546.html" rel="nofollow">At the Crest of the Tidal Wave</a>, and <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470870907.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470870907.html" rel="nofollow">Conquer the Crash</a> were published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, a large and reputable publishing house. Click on the links, the reviews are quoted on the Wiley pages.</p>
<p>Challenging the bestseller status of Conquer the Crash is silly. I'll remove the link that requires a subscription, but I also provided the page number in the citation for the NYT Book Review, which is for the actual list of best sellers <b>with Conquer the Crash listed</b>. It wasn't just on the best sellers lists for one week, either -- it was on the Wall Street Journal's bestseller list for 2 1/2 months, 12 July 2002 through 27 Sept. 2002. (Look it up online if you're a WSJ subscriber, otherwise you can hoof it the nearest library if you're motivated enough to check my facts.)</p>
<p>Prechter was also published in a scholarly journal, "Unconscious herding behavior as the psychological basis of financial market trends and patterns." <i>Journal of Behavioral Finance</i>, 2 (3), 2001, pp. 120-125.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Search Engine Test -- Does a search for the subject produce a large number of distinguishable hits on Google…</i></li>
</ul>
<p>A Google search for "Robert Prechter" brings more than 60,000 results -- and those EXCLUDE results from elliottwave.com, socionomics.net, and socionomics.org. What's more, some 28,000 of the Google search results are non-English language, so Prechter has wide international notability.</p>
<p>Finally, for the record, my edits to Prechter's bio have NOT included ANY links to Prechter's products or commercial web site. This claim is rubbish, as anyone who checks the list of my contributions will plainly see.</p>
<p>This AFD is unnecessary and a waste of time. Prechter clearly meets Wikipedia's notability criteria. Before this AFD, I had politely said I was willing to find and include additional third-party sources for the Prechter bio.

<p>You instigated an AFD on notability that has been steamrolled by the weight of the facts in every relevant Wikipedia criterion, including a few I didn’t even address -- such as the “widely recognized” and “professor” tests. You also made demonstrably phony claims about me using the article as a soapbox.</p>
<p>Yet in the face of this… you patronize me about Guidelines vs. Policy, the meaning of “may,” and where else to put all the evidence I offer? Oh my.</p>

<dd>The guy's marketing hype works overboard and lures in suckers by the day. He was ONCE good, in the 1980's when the waves were "easier" to read. Not any more. But the hype keeps luring suckers in. Despite having admitted that he's called 1998 to 2006 completely wrong (recent Elliott Wave Threorist said this period "has not been tradable using my tools"), the marketing machine works overboard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Traders Big 5 Flash service has produced such atrocious results that EWI hid them once people realised they were listed on their website. And they neglect to mention that this service has turned over 4 analysts in a year. But the marketing hyperbole continues: <i>Whichever category you belong to, you probably don't have time to scan the markets for high-probability trading opportunities all day long, day after day, all through the year. That's what Flash does for you.</i> In my opinion, even <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a> would find such bending of the truth stranger than fiction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I think the WP article, with it's fair criticism section, does a public service. There are few places on the internet where the other view can be heard. If Prechter's analysis was any good, the results should speak for themselves. Don't take my word for it, ask EWI for some statistics to prove the results that are achieved. They will probably decline and point to a trading contest win ... from nearly 25 years ago.

This editor also made false claims about "links to the subject's publications," plus other reckless accusations; and, given what we can all read <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.75.93.131.html" title="User talk:72.75.93.131">here</a>, there is strong reason to believe that this AFD process should not have happened at all.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Even so, I have since added reputable third-party citations to the Prechter bio. In this AFD discussion I've shown that Prechter surpasses the standards explained in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, and the evidence I've presented on this page has not been challenged; it's also self-evident that the opinions expressed to "keep" the article already go beyond the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html#Rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">rough consensus</a> standard.

<p>I honestly don't know if this guy is a notable producer, but the article looks like junk imported from MySpace, and the author has ignored a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JMGUSA&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89518796" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JMGUSA&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89518796" rel="nofollow">suggestion</a> to clean up the article, and is removing cleanup tags.

<li>Not really sure where you got that idea that this is junk imported from myspace... If you did a little research or had any sort of background in the music industry you would clearly know that this page is not merely "Junk". The page is completely factual and contains no personal views of any kind. Not really sure what you need to see in order for this to be a relevant article, in which you would not bad mouth because of lack of knowledge in his industry. A little more information would be helpful for people wanting to improve the quality of articles on Wiki. JMGUSA 07:47, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you had read what I wrote at your talkpage several days ago ("If you think the page deserves a chance to stay, you really need to make an effort to make it look and read like a Wikipedia article, and, most importantly, to provide independent [third-party] sources [such as reviews] that demonstrate the significance of the subject.") and acted on it, I might not have made this nomination, but you have elected to ignore it completely. The fact is that the article looks like promotional junk and the only links it has are an "official" website and a MySpace webpage (also "official"). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Upp◦land</a> 08:10, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although the article is relatively long, there's nothing there to justify inclusion. Their album "releases" are small (500 or 1000 copies...), I can find no mention of their concerts from a reliable source, the links provided are either self-publications on myspace/youtube or reviews from non-notable people, google gives no independent coverage of the band, and the article was a spa's first edit. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 14:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
It seems like the issue here is not the band's legitimacy, but that the links and sources aren't ones that some would consider "notable". I have added a link to a brief review of the band's Cornerstone Festival performance. Cornerstone is an annual festival which had an attendance of over 10,000 last year. Foxhole was featured on Mono Vs. Stereo Records' national release "The Revolution Will Begin In The Blink Of An Eye". <a href="http://www.monovsstereo.com/releases.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.monovsstereo.com/releases.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.monovsstereo.com/releases.asp</a> Also noteworthy is that that several of the Foxhole's "sister" bands have Wikipedia pages, including Anathallo and Saxon Shore. These bands have shared members, stages, and labels. They also cater to a similar audience. This seems to set a precedent. In February 2005, <b>We the Wintering Tree</b> made CMJ's Top 20, and subsequently the album has been in regular rotation on college radio. A quick google search of the album title will demonstrate this. Post-rock, as a genre, is characteristically "non-notable". Aside from <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slint.html" title="Slint">Slint</a>, very few bands listed in the Post-rock groups category are, by most standards of music, of little national, international, and certainly historical repute. Pressings are typically small, but they nevertheless make an impact. The same can be said of Foxhole. This is evidenced, I think, by the range and scope of praise in the reviews listed, which stretch to international lengths. Futureproofaudiolab 16:37, 29 November 2006 (UTC)Futureproofaudiolab</p>

If nothing else, the band has been covered consistently in a publication (Buzzgrinder Electronic Magazine) that is dedicated to the indie rock subculture. The band's record label, Burnt Toast Vinyl, features releases from many other notable artists, including Sufjan Stevens, whose recent release Illinois has sold over 200,000 copies.Futureproofaudiolab 18:18, 29 November 2006 (UTC)Futureproofaudiolab</p>
<p>PROS: On label (Burnt Toast Vinyl, of Philadelphia) with major players. Performed at many major festivals. Opened for many major acts (Unwed Sailor, Denison Witmer, Danielson Famile, Saxon Shore). Charted on CMJ Top 100 for a period in 2005. Listed on many "best of" lists, esp. those concerned with instrumental or avant-grade music. Song featured on Etnies (major skate shoe company) 2006 Tour DVD, of which there are TENS OF THOUSANDS of copies. One member of band, Gregory Belt Leppert, is very lauded graphic designer, having designed many award-winning and huge-selling album covers (Relient K's "Mmhmm," for example) as well as numerous other artworks in various markets.</p>
<p>CONS: Albums not platinum--but who was "Britney Spears" before some label auditioned her and marketed her and sold millions of copies? She had less to her name than Foxhole. No mention of concerts from reliable source--but Foxhole is a recording-focused band, though they've played over 100 concerts. Silver Jews played NO concerts for many many years. Should they be deleted?Kaffehaus 19:50, 29 November 2006 (UTC)Kaffehaus</p>
<p><br />
<b>PER THE GUIDELINES FOR ARTICLE VALIDATION REGARDING BANDS</b><br />
Foxhole meets the following criteria:<br /></p>
<p>2.) Foxhole HAS CHARTED on Top 100 of CMJ's new adds, quite a few times in 2005, actually. Email the guys at Nice Promo for more details on that.<br /></p>
<p>5.) Foxhole is on a noteworthy indie label, with a roster of significant artists (have included Denison Witmer, Saxon Shore, Unwed Sailor, and others).<br /></p>
<p>7.) Foxhole is has helped forge the sound of the Louisville/Nashville post-rock scene over the past five years; hear Of Asaph, Commonwealth, Telavet, The Ascent of Everest, and others for proof.<br /></p>
<p>10.) Foxhole has appeared on a "soundtrack," of sorts, for the widely-distributed DVD from Etnies shoe company in 2006.</p>
<p><br />

<dd>2. I'm not sure what CMJ is, but unless it is a "national music chart" (along the lines of Billboard) it doesn't satisfy this crit.</dd>
<dd><s>5. The crit specifies that the band must have "<b>released two or more albums</b> on a major label". As far as I can tell, this hasn't happened.</s></dd>
<dd>7. Unverified claim. Cite some sources and we can decide for ourselves.</dd>

<dd>If you can provide <i>sources</i> showing how the band meets the criteria, it will be a different story.

<li><b>Addendum</b> - RE Futureproofaudiolab's reasoning:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. This crit requires "<b>multiple</b> non trivial published works".</dd>
<dd>2. As with the CMJ case, I'm not sure if Paul Hinojo's Top 10 qualifies as a "national music chart".</dd>
<dd>3. I'm not quite sure how Hinojo's notability would affect the band in question.</dd>
<dd>Allow me to quickly say that I really admire the dedication of the two folks trying to save the article. However, it might be better to concentrate on other issues right now, and work on the Foxhole article when the band achieves notability. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertbcole_d850.html" title="User talk:Robertbcole">→</a><a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robertbcole_0dd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robertbcole">←</a> 21:43, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per above: For starters, Foxhole has released one album on BTV, a second ("We the Wintering Tree") is soon to be reissued on the same label, and a third is in production as we speak. Email btv@burnttoastvinyl.com for verification.Kaffehaus 22:02, 29 November 2006 (UTC)kaffehaus</p>
<p><b>Also:</b> CMJ is College Music Journal, a significant chart that is held in high regard by the entire music industry. See <a href="http://www.cmj.com" class="external free" title="http://www.cmj.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cmj.com</a> for more on that... No online record of the charting exists but I am in contact with CMJ to get that "proof" for you sticklers.Kaffehaus 22:05, 29 November 2006 (UTC)kaffehaus</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - Based on the wording in the article, it appears as if Foxhole joined the label after their last album was released. This should be clarified. As to CMJ, as I understand it, the journal pubulishes charts sent in from local radio stations that pay membership fees. I'm still not sure these charts qualify under the critrion. Please keep in mind that I'm not trying to be a jerk; I actually tend to lean towards inclusion. However, I also want to make sure that WP does not turn into a directory of every garage band on earth. It looks like Foxhole is quite a bit more than a garage band, but I'd still like to see the sources <i>in the article</i>. In the end, a well cited article is a better article which is something we all can appreciate. If you can get some sources, I'd be more than willing to help with wikifying the article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertbcole_d850.html" title="User talk:Robertbcole">→</a><a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robertbcole_0dd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robertbcole">←</a> 22:24, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Changing Position to <b>Keep</b>. Works for me. Some might take issue with calling BTV a major label, but given the fact that they have records for <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denison_Witmer_4469.html" title="Denison Witmer">Denison Witmer</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxon_Shore_%28band%29_0413.html" title="Saxon Shore (band)">Saxon Shore</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/w/Unwed_Sailor_aedf.html" title="Unwed Sailor">Unwed Sailor</a> I'm satisfied that crit 5 is satisfied.

<ul>
<li><b>Weakest of all possible keeps</b> - Burnt Vinyl is hardly a major label (some would even say that it has yet to make "significant"); while CMJ is a significant trade magazine catering to the college radio crowd (I know - I was in the business for eleven years), I must point out that the "importance" of a CMJ chart is questionable at best considering that recordings can make it <i>without official release</i>. One particularly emphatic college program director can skew the results). The definitive standard in the United States is <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_%28magazine%29.html" title="Billboard (magazine)">Billboard</a></i>, with <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Cashbox.html" title="Cashbox">Cashbox</a></i> almost alongside it until <i>Cashbox</i> went under about a decade ago. That said, if the individuals put the same amount of effort into the article as they did here, we wouldn't have this conversation in the first place. <b>Don't put your sources and notability here - put it in the article</b> and leave no doubt that an encyclopedic article about Foxhole belongs here - right now, the article doesn't show that. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 23:24, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If every bit of aforemention information (some of which, admittably, is <b>not</b> notable) were cited in the article as grounds for inclusion, then I'm afraid that Wikipedia wouldn't be the better for it. Indeed, it would appear as if the article were trying to over-argue for its importance, esp. when most of the post-rock already listed on Wikipedia include very little pertinent information, be it regarding charts, interviews, write-ups, soundtracks, etc. Hence, in the interest of keeping Wikipedia from hosting more questionable information, I'm ready and willing to have the article taken down. It may be only a few months before the criteria is met, but until then, as previously mentioned, there are more important things to worry about. All the same, if other post-rock groups' present listings on Wikipedia are any indication as to what makes for a suitable article, then it's very difficult to see what distinguishes such articles from the current foxhole listing. Crepelife 3.17, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is the the bulk of the articles on relatively new musical acts do not meet the requirements for inclusion in Wikipedia. That's why it seems to have about eight AfD's for music articles each day. Please don't mistake the true purpose of the AfD: to weed out the articles that don't belong here and to enhance those that should be here but do not quite make standard. The good fight is being fought here, but the suggestions need to be incorporated into the article for it to stand on its own. Sometimes just presenting the complete picture instead of overselling will be enough to get the acceptance of the article started. But please don't take it personally, either: sooner or later, virtually every editor has his/her creation go through the process (I had three deleted in one day, unfortunately). That's part of the territory... but don't give up. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 06:30, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't delete!! The four "masters" go to my school and are infact very well known for there work and have gained much recognition from the public. They have however, for the moment, retired from the sport, as they felt they have reached their current peak.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> Just because it isn't important to everyone doesn't mean it is not important to some. There are some articles on here specific to the USA that aren't important to people living in the UK but these articles are still not deleted? There is a notable amount of people affected by the issues in this article that find it important. Also the subject is becoming quite a legend around our area so Wikipedia and this article would be a valuable resource for anyone wanting to find out more about the subject. This is a similar thing to Robin Hood, he is a legend that perhaps only people living in the Nottinghamshire area would be interested in but I'm sure other people outside of the Sherwood area would be interested. The same should apply for this article. Burge <a href="../../../8/8/2E/User%7E88.106.70.211.html" title="User:88.106.70.211">88.106.70.211</a> 00:21, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - You're an avowed member of a trolling group -- i.e., a troll -- who nominates blogs for deletion under a set of pretenses that you invented yourself. This is relevant to your nominations, and to this discussion. I see included in your list of noms a high-traffic portal (i.e. Buzzflash) and a left-blog that won several awards (i.e. Sadly No). Therefore, anything you say must be taken in context. You'll present a bad-faith case for deletion, such that no neutral user can rely on your statements. But if it works and turns you on, you're welcome to play with Wiki rules as much as you like. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 07:58, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I was the nominator for the previous AFD. It came out in the discussion that this was the beginnings of a translation of the French Wikipedia article, and I withdrew the nomination, with the idea that we should wait and see what the whole article looks like. I am also somewhat dubious as to whether the final result will be useful to the English Wikipedia, but the translation is clearly not finished; in fact, it now appears that the translator was confused by my efforts to prod and then AFD the article, and has stopped. I think at the very least the article should be clearly marked as a translation in progress; it may also be time now to simply delete the stub and wait until some new translator gets interested. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 01:44, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>From Creator</b> - I tried to inform myself as best as possible before creating this page. I was not aware that the company needs to be "notable". There are a few minor articles published about us but having now read the rules, I realized that they may not be sufficient to show any notability. I want to mention also that I tried to stay neutral. This was not meant to be a sales point of any kind, it was more of an experiment for my first page on Wikipedia. I am a big user of Wikipedia and wanted to try a few things before starting to edit other pages. I'm sorry for any inconvinience and/or loss of time that this page might have brought on the mediators of Wikipedia. Thank you for your continued contribution to this great site. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristian.cl_ada9.html" title="User:Christian.cl">Christian Chenard-Lemire</a> 18:24, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. Don't get the idea that your article was terrible, because it wasn't. You should see some of the articles that people put up about their companies that don't even make a cursory effort to be neutral! Don't take this as a negative comment on your writing abilities, or your future career here on Wikipedia. As a general rule for notability, is that if the person/org has to add themselves, then they aren't notable. If they are really notable, someone else will add them of their own volition. Welcome to Wikipedia! Most of us make some mistakes the first few times, and we don't don't hold it against you. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhidauex_18a7.html" title="User:Phidauex">Phidauex</a> 18:37, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To the author of the original article: This is a personal view, but what I look for in a company article is evidence that the company is doing, or has done, something more than just carry out its business. Simply being in business is what all companies do, so isn't notable. But if you're the first company to do something important, or the best company at doing something, and can prove it, you belong here. You're in the longboard business, so what I would look for would be something like "every world champion longboarder for the past ten years has used our board", so long as this is for product-related reasons, not just by chance ( sponsorship doesn't count, of course ). <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhidauex_18a7.html" title="User:Phidauex">Phidauex</a> makes a good point when he says that if you're really notable, someone else will add you. Keep watching Wikipedia, and the day someone you've never heard of re-creates this article will be the day your company can say "we're a successful business". Good luck for the future. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:20, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>DO NOT DELETE: The original assertion that Mr. Green is the only author to ever publish a book in this field is correct and true. As such, this book is very notable in circles and industries relating to the cannabis breeding. Most people in the US do not understand, and therefor fear, said subject matter, but in many countries around the world Mr. Green's work is a standout and well-respected. I, myself, am a journalist for High Times magazine, based in Manhattan, and can atest that this author's works are used consistently for research directly related to articles we publish that are read by over 1 million people worldwide.<small>This comment unsigned by first ever edit anon user User:69.116.201.26</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> "The original assertion that Mr. Green is the only author to ever publish a book in this field is correct and true." A search for "cannabis cultivation" on amazon.com quickly shows that this claim is not correct. If the author or the books are notable, then it should be easy to demonstrate using references to reliable sources. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 23:05, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>DO NOT DELETE: Yes the original assertion was true. He is the only author to publish two books in those fields. If you have any experience with cannabis litrature then you would know that between 2003 and 2006 his books may have been the best selling cannabis books on Amazon, to my knowledge anyway, or should have been because they are well regarded, but Amazon is a poor choice of rating. Right now Jorge Cervantes has a new book which would be a better seller. The only other modern breeding publication would be from DJ Short, but he has not done a cultivation manual. I am not surprised that High Times references Greg Green. The author is notable and should stay.

I think there is room for an entry here on Wikipedia for Green, but the baloney hype needs to be screened out, otherwise it is just badly crafted self-promotion.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 20:58, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Two things are very strange. 69.116.201.26 is New York with claims to be affiliated with HT. So if Simonapro is banned and is 69.116.201.26 then that is a NY entry. As you can see the IP that was attributed to Simonapro was not in NY. So I do not see how an Afc could have linked the two. That seems very wrong to me. Secondly, the claim is that Greg Green is the only author to have dedicated book on cannabis breeding/genetics and another dedicated book on cannabis cultivation. For the life of me I have looked through my book collection and online, and the statement seems to be absolutely true as far as I can tell unless you can bring up an author who has done the same. It seems exclusive to Green. Also do you remember Green's work being reviewed or cited by HT mag?

<dd>The internet is not geographically constrained, a person of even limited intellegence can appear to come from many places at once. Simomapro got caught as a sock-puppet due to a lack of understanding about how to not get caught as a sock-puppet(no gunna say what the mistake was though). The check-user can be relied on.</dd>

<dd>Indeed it is easy with the resources to appear to come from more than one place.

<li>Can I suggest that discussion of Simonapro's sockpuppetry would be more appropriate at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Simonapro_ad86.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Simonapro">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Simonapro</a>, and <b>Comment</b> that Backlit's second point constitutes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and for that reason would not be appropriate for inclusion in the article. The problem is that nothing seems to have been published in reliable sources <i>about</i> Green or his books. Since the Green Candy Press site does not include biographical information about Green, verifiable article content is limited to mentioning that Green has published two books, and so the article will never get beyond a stub. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 20:32, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>First, xplane-the-company is a thought leader in data visualization, illustration. Their work keeps raising the bar in how communication problems are approached, how clients are involved in the process, and tools for being effective much faster than before. So they've demonstrated leadership in a craft, nearly redefining an industry.</li>
<li>Second, their Business 2.0 look is becoming one of the hallmark aesthetics of the dot com era, the way Art Deco was for the 1920s. I don't know if they see themselves this way, but I think they carved a chunk of art history for themselves. --Phil Wolff 22:15, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>keep</b> There is documentation (now linked) showing it's use beyond the class. It has been used on blogs across Canada and the United States [http:del.icio.us/tags/depletist]. Although the class had a a goal to alter peoples attitudes towards the environment, the word itself is simply filling a gap in the language. As various people and institutions are forming policies around their environmental practices, it is a useful word to describe actions, and to form policy around (it would be difficult to form laws around racism or sexism if those words did not exist).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chrisbraden (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chrisbraden_c278.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chrisbraden">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Chrisbraden (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chrisbraden_c278.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chrisbraden">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> It is not about being "hugging a tree" it is about getting people to care about the environment even if just a little, it is about sustainability, it is about stop messing with our planet because it's already in a deep mess that MAYBE we can do something about. It's a wake up call that being a depletist is NOT okay. Just as we have neologistic words such as "bling"--a slang, they've proven themselves to stick around. Even "racism" and "sexist" are nelogistic words as they were only created in the 20th century. Like Aisha285 and Chrisbraden have noted above, this word is a state of mind, it describes actions. It's an education for others. It's history in the making. For your proof that this word is spreading rapidly, you just have to google to see. What started as 0 hits has no become 498 hits in a matter of a <i>few</i> months. Please, it's absolutely essential that this word is kept. Please consider keeping it.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Shouldn't then by all the Neologism complaints, articles such as Truthiness, invented by Steven Colbert Earlier on this year be deleted as well? When exactly do you define a word has spread? Shall it be weeks? Months? Years? By subjective standpoints, there is no ‘after’ to any sort of spreading. The article does not push for any particular viewpoint, thus the arguments that it is a trying to turn wikipedia into a soapbox doesn't apply, it is simply a documentation of a word and it's emergement usage. The fact that it has been quoted on activist blogs <b>is not sufficient evidence</b> to determine it's neutrality.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Now, now, everybody. Lets look at the facts. This word is becoming the object of a healthy debate, and the Deletists do have a point, but to understand the positive ramifications of this word being recognized by a notable online encyclopedia that we all use will speak volumes when this word becomes common usage. All this KEEP and DELETE is interesting, but the raw facts are that this word seems to be being used by people, it seems it is spreading fast, it was created in part by a notable author and university professor. Really, so what if a bunch of university students contributed in the creation of a word? This word <i>should</i> carry the same weight as the word <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">Racist</a>. What is really being said by deleting this entry is that <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borat.html" title="Borat">Borat</a> holds more weight than a legitimate word that is a step in the right direction to creating a sustainable future. Delete if you must, but I would then question the motives of those who delete these entries.

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps this word <i>should</i> carry the same weight as the word <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">Racist</a>. However, the word <i>doesn't</i> carry the same weight as racist, and Wikipedia deals in "is," not in "should be." Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">not</a> a soapbox, it's an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia reports on what is in the world, not on what it would consider important to a world if it were making one. We're not making a world. We're making an encyclopedia about the world.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You will note that, on wikipedia, the word "Racist" actually redirects to the entry on "Racism", a much broader concept. As to Borat, as long as more people have heard of him than have heard of "depletist", he will - in terms of notability, which is a primary grounds for determining what does and does not belong on wikipedia - carry more weight.

<p>Sock puppetry</p>
<p>Aisha285, please be aware that sock puppetry - that is, creating and using multiple accounts in order to influence the result of a vote - violates Wikipedia policy. <b>There is ample circumstantial evidence in the AfD vote located at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Depletist (second nomination) to suggest that you are creating multiple accounts to influence the result of that vote</b>. If you have, in fact, done this, please revisit the AfD page to indicate which comments are your own posted under those multiple accounts. Thank you. --DachannienTalkContrib 18:15, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All I have to say about this, is that, I AM NOW BEING FALSELY ACCUSED. Please read this carefully:</p>
<p>I only put this page up to help people, not to create problems. People are also using Wikipedian terms against me such as "SPANK THIS AUTHOR" or "SALT" or "EXPUNGE." I am a new author, and my intentions have only been good. If you read the article about "Depletist" you would realize that the intentions are good ones. Hopefully this would make you realize that a person who has good interests like this, would not take steps to violate any Wikipedia rules. Creating multiple accounts is an obvious violation. Also, I should point out that I cannot sit here all day, I do have to make a living to survive daily. Anyhow, I would rather be out creating a better awareness of this word and movement, because this page shows that many people are not educated in this matter, (while of course, thankfully, some people are).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there have been many rude remarks made that I do believe to be quite unfair. I did not come to wikipedia to create hatred. I came here high spirited, and have been let down. Fortunately, I realize through this, that not everyone knows this word yet. Please help humanity in this positive movement forward. I am positive that one day "depletists and depletism" and the great events that have happened around it will be recognized by everyone and prevented. Even if this article is deleted, I still thank you Wikipedia. You have only given me more incentive to keep working hard in this endeavour.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This "PA knockoff" receives thousands of hits every week, is featured on joystiq on a weekly basis and is becoming a staple read for gaming enthusiasts across the web. Delete the entry if you really want, this page is doing no harm except to inform people about the comic. The comic recently surpassed 100 strips. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETrueplayer_b2bc.html" title="User talk:Trueplayer">Trueplayer</a> 16:02 <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">21 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a></li>

<dd>Thousands of hits is not enough: the Alexa <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=http%3A%2F%2Frpg-tv.com%2F&amp;url=http://www.rpg-tv.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=http%3A%2F%2Frpg-tv.com%2F&amp;url=http://www.rpg-tv.com/" rel="nofollow">ranking</a> is a puny 3,548,702. While Alexa has many problems, this indicates there is not much traffic to the webcomic; I'd also like to note that Penny Arcade, for example, is ranked at 1,706. Even if it had a lot of traffic, nothing in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> mentions that. Even if one is very generous and reads a few blog mentions on Joystiq as an instance of fulfilling the first criterion, where's the second substantial mention in the reliable independent source? And the number of strips has absolutely nothing to do with notability. --<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwern_64b9.html" title="User talk:Gwern">Gwern</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwern_077f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwern">(contribs)</a> 02:04 <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_22.html" title="November 22">22 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Look, everybody and his cousin has a webcomic now. The entry cost to make a webcomic is very, very low - much lower than that required to get a strip into print.

Not allowing someone to add non-encyclopedic material to an encyclopedia hardly seems to me the type of thing that's going to dampen their passion for life or the spirit in which their game is played.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not adequately referenced, and not notable.

<dd>I am concerned that an editor would be inclined to have such a subjective opinion without presenting any counter points to the contrary of what has been presented. Stating that you disagree is not notable nor verifiable. We need you to present evidence to support your claims or this situation may be used as an example to nominate many other notable articles for deletion. We must work together in the best interest of the Wikipedia community. To do otherwise is irresponsible and may draw vast consequences. As a contributing reader, I do not wish to waste time undoing such activity. We must avoid setting a negative precedence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You state "Obvious fans" yet site no reference or proof, this does not set a good example for new contributors as you are not practicing what you preach. You should also not express how contributions make you "feel" as it has little or nothing to do with the facts, rather is shows bias due to your acknowledgement in regards to how something makes you "feel". Again, we must be careful to act in the interest of the community and set a proper example, particularly when we are held to a higher level of accountability. As we can see below, a young and very impressionable student from AZ (as per his talk) has taken to your example and represents how he "feels" here in post. We must avoid such matters. His opinion is highly subjective and rather than discussing or making reference to his opinion, he surrenders himself to simply stating how he "feels" ("I'm just sick") without presenting any supporting evidence. Nor is he open to the possibility that his issue may be entirely due to the fact that his position is incorrect or his actions are not justified. Please note how he referenced your example directly "per above". This is a real world example of how acting irresponsible can have a negative effect and open the door for biased and subjective opinions. (Please also note that rather than expressing an opinion about how I "feel" I have taken the time to cite examples of what it is I am concerned about. We must act responsibly.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 76.16.70.153 (<a href="../../../7/6/2E/User_talk%7E76.16.70.153.html" title="User talk:76.16.70.153">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_76.16.70.153_d20e.html" title="Special:Contributions/76.16.70.153">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

Don't conclude they are a troll until they have shown complete inability or unwillingness to listen to reason or to moderate their position based upon the input of others. Even in that case, it is likely better to remain silent and let others conclude the obvious instead of calling someone a troll and creating even more mayhem.

Not only is this unfounded (he did give reasons beyond being sickened by it), but it <i>doesn't matter</i>. Before all of that nonsense, you basically blamed myself for <i>emotionally corrupting</i> this poor student. That's uncivil, and is the very definition of trolling.

<dd>Regarding the influencing of a young student. I never stated that you corrupted him in any way (we continue to see assumptions dominating reason and request for clarification), rather your example of casting how you felt over what your findings were based on facts, may have contributed to his post where he posted how he felt, rather than reference facts. You are clearly not giving me the benefit of the doubt as a first response. I am quite suprised to see an Administrator being presumptious to such a degree, that he/she would resort to name calling as a first response. You did not ask for me to elaborate or to clarify the intent of my post. What is uncivil sir, is not giving the beneift of the doubt, putting words into other peoples mouths, and resorting to name calling and threating bans because you don't agree with someone. I on the other hand offered to apologize if the intent of my post was misunderstood, apologized to you personal, and continue to behave in a very civil manner.</dd>

The Clan links were indeed sourced as they are all listed on the front page of Zdaemon.org, Zdaemon.org is listed on GameSpy and Wikipedia, thus all notable sources. Perhaps your edits were subjective in nature and required more research before deletion? Many people tend to delete links without first discussing them.

<p>Hello. I have a lot to say about the sewing dragon. Although it's existence is not readily proven, it is still a debatable myth. Why, look at bigfoot; sure, he is more widely known, but chances are he is fake. Every "myth" (quotations because sewing dragon exists!) needs a place to start. If the sewing dragon is deleted from wikipedia's archives, no one will ever be graced to learn about it, and by the time they do, November 27th of 2008 will have already passed. But please; it may be a hoax, it may be "nonsense", and for all you know, it could be real, just like bigfoot, so give the sewing dragon a chance. The sewing dragon would give you chance if he could. thank you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.192.35.70_d901.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.192.35.70">68.192.35.70</a> (talk)</small></p>

<p>If you are going to delete this myth, why don't you delete other dragons, like the Chinese or Aztec dragons? There isn't any proof of those two. Yet, people still choose to believe in them. The people who believe in the Sewing Dragon should have just the same chance to express their believes. The only reason why it hasn't popped out previously is because it was only spoken of in close circles. Wikipedia is now giving the dragon it's chance to spread.

<li>There are 18 episodes of this show, and the pilot episode. If this page is merged into KYTV then it would follow that all the other episodes would be documented in the same way, and putting the whole lot on one page is going to create a very long entry for KYTV. I wrote a lot of information for the other two pages and was planning to do the rest of the pages for Series 1 and 2 when I have time (Series 3 to follow later). I think the KYTV pages would be a lot more useful and interesting if they continue in the existing format, or something similar. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamminBen_b209.html" title="User:JamminBen">JamminBen</a> 12:11, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../k/y/t/KYTV_b3d6.html" title="KYTV">KYTV</a>, if necessary.

<li>I am still not in favour of a merge into KYTV. Given the current amount of info on the episode pages I think that merging WILL create an unnecessarily large article. It might be better to create a "list of KYTV episodes" page with descriptions for each. This would be more consistent with other TV shows. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamminBen_b209.html" title="User:JamminBen">JamminBen</a> 14:09, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, "no need for seperate articles". This is a free encyclopaedia where-by people share all knowledge that they have on just about everything known. The KYTV page has links on every episode, most red. Each show had its own set-up, its own guests, its own unique features and many people may be interested to know about elements of them without actually knowing where to start. It is down to those with some knowledge (eg. JamminBen) to reveal what it is we know. In time, infoboxes can be placed with all kinds of special features giving it a more sophisticated look. See the Only Fools &amp; Horses individual episode style. They have entries for most of their episodes and the information from a single show in OFAH is just as relevant and suitable as that for KYTV; the point is that many articles accross Wikipedia are far shorter with much lacking information and they seem to survive with no interruption. Another thing, if it is decided to merge, will that same person remove all the links on the KYTV page? If not, will it simply not not invite other editors who stumble accross it later to start again? Take a look at any world city, any well-known event, any large Wikipedia page and go back to its first edit; see how sometimes it took months and months before it expanded, see how many are still thriving now, with dozens of editors, disputed issues on Talk etc. Without the chance, such phenomena cannot come about and it is otherwise pointless even having a free encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../e/v/l/User%7EEvlekis_1e94.html" title="User:Evlekis">Evlekis</a> 08:59, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This article is notable because it was a significant case in which journalistic rights were violated. When Hugh Kane said he "spoke for the staff," he in turn silenced the other members on their views. This could damage the other journalists reputation in that it went against what a journalist could actually support.</li>

<p>Yes, this publication had a small life and distribution, but that is because of the journalistic sins committed by Hugh Kane. This article can easily show how journalistic sins can abruptly end a publication and cause several journalists to leave in disgrace.</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> this page and merge the contents into <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States_be7f.html" title="Illegal immigration to the United States">Illegal immigration to the United States</a>. The focus of this page is on legislation proposed for the 109th Congress which is soon to be concluded. In January the 110 congress forms and the debate must start anew, and most of the wording will have to be deleted from the page. Most of the information not related to legislation is already duplicated on the Illegal immigration to the United States page, or should be on that page. Why keep a page that must be overhauled every two years, it would be better to include a section on “Illegal immigration to the United States” and keep that up-to-date.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I have no problem with a detailed article regarding historical or current events. Articles regarding newsworthy historical issues are common and welcome. The article itself appears to be well footnoted (although I'd like to see more references at the bottom). As for the nom's suggestion that the new congress will change the debate, well...great. This article (or an improved version of it) could be a good first look at where this debate has come from and where it's currently at -- almost the definition of living history, yes? Lacking an AfD argument regarding verifiability or original research (neither of which seem to apply), I don't see what the problem is with this article. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 00:36, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Markeer. This debate has been in play since 2004, possible 2001 (see article), and will continue. Congressional cycling doesn't stop it. If there was a substantive break in the content, as opposed to new legislation, it would merit moving, not deleting this article.

<li><b>Very, Very Weak Keep</b> and {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}}; additional work needs to be done on the article to include some sort of information that demonstrates the magazines' importance. A noted journalist saying she read it is borderline, at best; the journalist, while well-known and fairly controversial, doesn't cover pornography, so it's the published personal opinion of someone, not a newsworthy item regarding the magazine itself. As for the magazine being sold and who its current owner is, that's an example of newsworthy information—but content about why, when, and how it was sold needs to be explained/documented in the article, not just in the external links. The point of an encyclopedia article is to provide information. The point of the references is to be able to verify that information, not direct readers elsewhere to obtain the information itself.—<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicer1_4905.html" title="User:Nicer1">Nicer1</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicer1_4645.html" title="User talk:Nicer1">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nicer1_eaf9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nicer1">contribs</a>) 21:56, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Spunk Loving Sluts is referenced far more in media coverage of Desmond, and should probably have its own article as well. As, presumably, should Mega Big Ones, Skinny and Wriggly, Double Sex Action and Mothers In Law, all of which I can find referenced in mainstream media seeking to do Richard Desmond down. <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_f7cd.html" title="WP:PORN">WP:PORN</a>, invoked here, must distinguish between coverage of Desmond and coverage of any one of his titles.

<p>The subject of this article appears to be non-notable with fewer than 1,000 ghits total. The page is unsourced and several attempts to source it have failed due to a lack of reliable sources. Furthermore, the page has become a magnet for disruption as one or more editors, and/or sockpuppets, have continously attempted to add unsourced defamatory material which could result legal liability for wikipedia. In short, there is simply no way that the presence of this article justifies the disruption and potential liability it represents. The best thing for the project is to delete this page. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics"><font color="green">Tropics</font></a> 19:15, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The link you listed provides a long, detailed article about Gracenote, but only 2 very brief mentions of Steve Scherf, one of which refers to him as a "helpful buddy". My motive is to remove an article with limited encyclopedic content.

<li><b>Delete</b> Doc asked me to take a peek, and nothing I see in the article at this time seems to justify inclusion.

<dd>Exactly. If we really and truly are doing something wrong under tort law and we could be liable, then it's a valid reason, regardless of the actual probability of a lawsuit occurring. If, however, there's merely a concern that maybe, possibly, we might be doing something wrong or that there might be a potential someone could accuse us of doing something wrong, then don't use that as a pre-emptive reason to try and fix something that verywell might not be broken. But, that whole debate is moot here, since there's ample reason for deletion regardless. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 23:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The only reason the man is notable is because he is in charge of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracenote.html" title="Gracenote">Gracenote</a>. This article about him was a very short stub until recent attempts to continue an edit war started on an article about his company. Let's keep the edit war confined to the article on Gracenote and the associated request for mediation. If the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracenote.html" title="Gracenote">Gracenote</a> edit war ever dies down and an acceptable version is hammered out, then perhaps we can see if he is notable for anything else besides Gracenote and if an article longer then 3 sentences can be written about him personally. ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 21:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Still, I lean primarily toward a deletion, since someone doing a Wikipedia search for him will find him in those articles anyway. As a final note, it might be interesting to observe that almost half of the unique Google hits (about 150 of the 330) relate to a specific news story, as evidenced in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22steve+scherf%22+-wikipedia+%22record+straight%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22steve+scherf%22+-wikipedia+%22record+straight%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this Google search</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 21:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">In 1995, Steve Scherf created an on-demand Internet based CD recognition service designed to recognize CDs being played on a PC. The service quickly became extremely popular amongst early Internet users who shared it with their friends, who in turn, submitted their own CDs to the service. Due to the viral nature of the online database, it quickly grew to include all kinds of music genres, including international CD submissions from 130 countries.... The service is now used in over 140 million devices globally, ranging from PC media players, portables as well as home and car stereos</td>

<li><b>Keep</b> - First, the subject of the article is far more notable than many subjects here on Wikipedia. Just for his creation of CDDB and the huge controversy surrounding it would be sufficient, but also his company Gracenote is a substantial current player in the digital music scene. Second, it doesn't bloody matter what the subject of the article wants. This isn't about his wishes. And he does not make any assertion of his own non-notability. Quite the opposite; He asserts that he is SO notable that the article would be a vandal target. If we cave in to this, what else will we cave in to?

They were almost certainly brought here by today's slashdot activity and may be attempting to interfere with the process of deletion out of malice. That an article may be a target for vandalism seems a very poor reason indeed for judging it noteworthy. This person does not appear exceptionally noteworthy otherwise.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The only vague assertion of notability comes from a computer company he is involved in, and a minor scandal about its sale. After existing for over 2 years, this "article" consists of <b>only 6 sentences</b>. Don't "clearly and obviously" notable subjects normally have more than 6 sentences, especially after that period of time? If he is so inherently controversial, where are the huge numbers of allegations and citations that such things involve?

<li>Thought experiment: Let's say two geographically remote, nondenominationl tiny churches of little worldly significance come together to form a group which they call Tiny Churches of North America. This group is established to restore the purity of the faith. It never gets any press coverage, never grows, and peters out after 20 years. Is it worthy of inclusion in the Wikipedia at the beginning of its existence? At the end? I'd say no on both counts.

<li>We're not talking about small non-demoninational churches uniting here, but a separation from a large and well-established body. This isn't just about the Westminster Presbyterians, or about Presbyterians. The same sort of separation is happening throughout American protestantism, and (at least in Anglican circles) worldwide. I'm arguing for keeping this article because it's illustrative of the larger phenomenon. (BTW, we do seem to have a large number of articles on various "Popes" who claim that they're the real Roman Catholic Church.

<li>Which large and well-established body did they separate from? As far as I can tell, they split off from another small group.

Re having churches "in five states of the Union": I see only four states listed on the <a href="http://www.wpcus.org/congregations.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.wpcus.org/congregations.asp" rel="nofollow">denomination's webpage</a>, but even then, since there are only five congregations total, that they are in four or five states doesn't seem particularly <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. As for the quote, I don't think two sentences that merely state the existence of the denomination qualifies as non-trivial coverage. What did the <i>British Church Newspaper</i> have to say? This is an American denomination; did any American publications take note of the WPCUS?

<dd>Quote: 'The WPCUS is concerned at the spread of liberal teaching (such as Federal Vision theology) within Presbyterianism in the USA. Federal Vision theology questions doctrines such as Justification by Faith, and the Perseverance of the Saints. In the event of various USA presbyterian groupings failing to deal firmly with such liberalizing trends, the WPCUS could well prove to be a new home for individual Presbyterian churches and minister who are unhappy with the stance taken by their own denominations.' As to your question regarding five states; we plan to have a congregation in Delaware in short order. As to your question on a substitution fund, sorry I meant to write Sustentation fund. It's a means of congregations joining together financially and there is an entire history of it's use from Charles the Second of England and its continued use.

<li><b>Keep:</b> I have studied the ferment and churn of British and North American Presbyterianism for almost 40 years. Splitting, formation, and merging of denominations of various sizes is an important part of that history. Many small groups have come existence for a brief time but have lasting influence upon the English speaking Presbyterian and Reformed landscape. For example, the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (RPCES) came into existence in 1965, and disappeared in 1982 when they were received in to the larger Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). The RPCES was itself a merger of elements from the Bible Presbyterian Church (BPC) and the Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America (RPCNA). Though the RPCES remained a denomination for only 17 years, it is indisputable they have a continuing influence upon the PCA. Their brief history is essential to understanding American Presbyterianism.<br />
I’m a minister of the denomination from which some of the WPCUS congregations come, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC). Yet, I recognize the WPCUS has taken an unique confessional position, reaffirming the original version not only of the Westminster Standards but also the original form of government and worship approved in England and Scotland in the 1640's. In this, they offer the possibility of union with other like minded groups on the basis of historic confessional Presbyterianism. Their similarity to older existing Scottish and Irish denominations also makes them notable. Whatever their future may be, their efforts should be noted by Wikipedia if it is to be a reliable and useful reference tool. Jglennferrell 17:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)J. Glenn Ferrell</li>

<dd><b>Keep:</b> Is this Notability thing fairly new? I've been editing on Wikipedia now and then for nearly two years, and have come across loads of instances of historical and present-day individual churches and church buildings (let alone denominations) having an article on Wikipedia, without anyone objecting. I'm starting to wonder whether there is a complete change of atmosphere on Wikipedia, with nowhere near the level of freedom there once was. It seems to be getting much more like government and corporations in the way people are trying to patrol/control it. Not the friendly place it once was! On looking at the Notability page I see that it is heavily disputed, and personally I often go to Wikipedia for information I can't find readily elsewhere. And where would Notability leave articles about long-forgotten people who were very well known in their day but who are only covered in books, not on the net! This is the sort of thing Wikipedia is ideal for. Give Wikipedia back to the people, and stop the stuffy academic types controlling it!</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is not paper, so there is room for many subjects that would not be covered in a traditional encyclopedia. However, Wikipedia is also not an indiscriminate collection of information, nor a directory, so some criteria for inclusion need to be met. Removal of articles on non-notable subjects is an important function. The existance of similar articles on non-notable subjects is not a reason to include any article. Although details are disputed, there seems to be a broad consensus (as reflected in the various notability guidelines) that coverage by multiple independent sources is a fundamental criterion for inclusion.

<li><b>Keep</b> - In answer to Whpq, this is a wrestling group corey got up from the group and built up himself. They used to hold shows in the schoolyard, however now they perform in a professional wrestling ring infront of crowds of over 100 people, quite a big name in North West British wrestling. Ad caknuck, Who said he jumps off a garage onto a mattrass? Tubezone, well, Amateur is incorrect, he has been professionally trained and is a professional himself. And if NN stands for No-Name, come up to the north west of England and ask them what RWL is. And underage? Incorrect, in England there is NO limits to become a wrestler unlike in USA/canada.

<li>While the validity of citing a game as a primary source is debatable, it's pretty much clear that citing an Action Replay code as a primary source is not acceptable. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 03:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with you on that. However, it does raise up another question- how far can software be used as a primary reference? The information is there, just difficult to get to (in this case, hidden levels). In my opinion, it's no different than using a difficult-to-access written source (such as an out-of-print book/magazine/newspaper). --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 03:36, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where an old text is not available in modern editions and not readily accessible via inter-library loans, then I would say that the primary source <i>wouldn't</i> be acceptable as a reference. For example, if I wanted to claim that a certain word was used on a certain page of a rare medieval manuscript, I could not reasonably cite that manuscript as a source -- I would need to cite some trustworthy work of scholarship that made the claim. Similarly, if it takes a gaming prodigy with superhuman reflexes to confirm a claim about a video game, then it would clearly be preferable to find a secondary source, such as a hintbook or a gaming magazine that has printed an article on secrets and tricks in the game in question, and cite that.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. This is another one of those strength of argument debates. It's important that merely pointing at "notability," and claiming that is existent can't exactly merit an article. Even more so, it is crucial to understand that if something doesn't have any coverage but made by a notable company, it belongs on the companies page. Unless, something can bring forth reason for a separate article, there is nothing for this to merit it's own article. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font><font color="red">sox</font></a> 16:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Commment</b>: Thanks. With reagards to your comments:
<dl>
<dd>I included the public school library listings to gauge how "Phd: Phantasy Degree" would fare against Wikipedia's threshold standards regarding availability in libraries {"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28books%29#Threshold_standards" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28books%29#Threshold_standards" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28books%29#Threshold_standards</a> ).</dd>
<dd>I think the problem of "Phd: Phantasy Degree" regarding plot summary has less to do with "original research", since the books themselves are the sources provided the author of the "Phd: Phantasy Degree" page included the ISBN number of said book. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources</a> . Based on your comment, your argument would have been "Phd: Phantasy Degree" has no impact or historical significance to speak of to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>I included to the "Dragon Hunter" deletion page to show that Doond's metholodogy regarding criterias for non-notability (google hits) is dubious at best but I suppose you know that already. Of course, if there was a "Phd: Phantasy Degree" article or review out there in a legitimate / reputable webiste...particularly a manhwa / manga / comic book / Korean pop culture website...then we wouldn't be having this discussion right now.</dd>

<dd>P.S.: Is it just me...or are we the only ones arguing about this?
<dl>
<dd>Quite possibly. I suspect many of the pages about this manga would be in Korean, and the rest hard to find because there are a lot of ways to spell the title. I'm very comfortable relying on publication by Tokyopop in deciding to keep. They are the equivalent of a DC or a Marvel, any of whose titles or characters I'd be comfortable including without objection. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:45, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a reader unfamiliar with the subject, it is not clear to me whether the article is a straightforward description of the primary source (the work being described), or whether it includes original thought (interpretation/analysis). A reliable secondary source is preferable.</li>
<li>With respect to WP:NOT, my argument is that the article does not contain real-world context or sourced analysis, does not mention the work's achievments, does not attempt to describe the work's impact or historical significance, and is only a description of the work's plot and characters.</li>
<li>I disagree that any publisher automatically confers notability. Wikipedia is not a directory (e.g., of otherwise non-notable works that have been published by notable publishers). Each article must stand on it's own. "The primary criterion for notability, that applies in all fields, is that an article's subject is notable if it has been the subject of non-trivial published works by multiple separate sources that are independent of that subject itself."

<dd>Well, I certainly argree this article needs improvement, however, I can't understand a call for deletion. You may not consider the publisher a factor in notability, but when it comes to comic books and manga I do. Why? Because it's obvious to me that almost anything a Marvel, DC, or Tokyopop does is notable. Just like anything J. K. Rowling or Steven King writes is notable. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:17, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are certainly entitled to your opinion, but you seem to be missing the point of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, particularly that "notabiity is not subjective." Works of very notable authors (such as the ones you mentioned) are almost guaranteed to receive independent coverage, and that coverage is what establishes notability. The only way to write a <a href="../../../g/a/3F/WP%7EGA__abdf.html" title="WP:GA?">good encyclopedia article</a> on any subject is to base that article on multiple independent sources. In this particular case, PhD (manhwa) is written from an <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html#What.27s_wrong_with_an_in-universe_perspective.3F" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">in-universe perspective</a>, and it will not be possible to rewrite from an out-of-universe perspective without reliance on third-party sources (that do not seem to exist). <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 21:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The idea that people write about something makes it notable is itself relying on a subjective judgement, so, no, I don't concur with your opinion since it seems inherently contradictory. You'd be much better off if you didn't try to make the argument that your reasoning wasn't subjective. Certainly not convincing in this case, where I'm saying notability comes through association (and you can't deny that people do write about Tokyopop or their other Manga). Now if you want to say "there should be some third party sources" well, that is itself a valid concern, though to me, I don't feel it is quite much of a problem. I believe it's important to look at the actual source first when it comes to things like the content of a book. The interpretation, impact, meaning, yes, that's third-party stuff (barring the rare director's commentary), but if you want to write about a book, you should be looking at the book. Or movie. Or TV series. This can be a fine line to walk, but hopefully you at least recognize the value of reading/viewing a given subject of an article. It's one thing to not expect people to come measure your shoe. It's another to not expect them to read a book. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The verifiable fact that multiple, independent, third-party sources have written about a subject in a non-trival way is not subjective. Your argument does not seem to be that the subject of PhD (manhwa) <i>is notable</i>, but rather seems to be that it <i>does not need to be notable</i>. This argument does not address the reason given for AfD nomination, nor is it consistent with Wikipedia policy or guideline. My opinion is unchanged: the article does not assert the notability of the subject and should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 23:14, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That something is based off verifiable facts does not make the idea or even the perception of those sources as valuable in determining anything any less subjective. Even saying "This needs to be notable" is itself a subjective argument. This does not mean you don't have a good point, it means you are ruining it by trying to insist you're not being subjective when you clearly are. And you're wrong about my argument. I'm saying that I believe it is notable based on its publisher, and to overcome that you'd have to make an argument as to why it is not. You haven't done so. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:10, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - Wow. Talk about irony. Anyway, the AP story linked to in the article is actually about another website.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Wikipedia's numerous critics will find bias no matter what, because that critics do.

<li>And what exactly is "critical" about Wikidumper anyway? It's not like they have an agenda of "look at all these <i>valid</i> and <i>well-sourced</i> articles that they've unjustly deleted"; they publish <i>just about everything</i> that <i>may</i> be deleted later (ranging from blatant BJAODN material to little-known topics). I'd be a little bit hesitant to lump them among critical sites; at best they're doing a service to the community, at worst they're just making people say "look at that ridiculous stuff they published - but good thing it looks like they deleted it." --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:49, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I get 15,700 google hits for "wikidumper", and three in google news. What are your search terms?

His comment about dissecting the frog implies he meant the process to be a joke. And wasting editor's time on an AfD, while not the most disruptive act possible, is nonetheless disruptive. —<a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb"><i>talk</i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb"><i>contribs</i></a></sup> 00:45, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>That makes alot of sense. This article is in very good Wiki-form. Having created several articles, I know the work that goes into it and nobody would go through all that trouble and then immediately send to AfD without having some agenda. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 01:02, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Swpb is right, in hindsight, it was a bad idea. I apologize for using up people's time on an AfD while misleading them.</li>
<li>That said, both the article and the AfD have been worked on by multiple other people, and have expanded quite a bit beyond my initial shady contributions. In order to not further waste the time they've consumed working on the article and AfD, hopefully the AfD can end as normally as possible. In addition, because it's the only thing I can undo at this point, I can strike my 'vote' if anyone asks (feel free to <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Interiot_1a91.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Interiot">email me</a>). Though, for what it's worth, my AfD reason was the more "valid"/more sincere of the two. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 18:57, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The main issue is notability and a google search for the term uship clearly establishes the notability of this company. better links have been placed in the article that establish the notability of this company. Article text can be fixed, but deletion is not necessary. Yes, I am biased because I wrote this article. But all this started after someone wrote the original text of the "criticisms" sections, which was described as a "waiver of liability" but is actually a negative point of view about the company, which is fine of course.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Well-established candy that has built significant name-recognition in the 30+ years since it was first introduced.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> per CSD:G11. Centurymusician, no one is saying you are a bad teacher, or a bad person. It's just that we think the article fails a few guidelines articles have to conform to. If you've taught people who've gone on to record CDs, joining orchestras or moms with freat kids, that's fantastic, but it doesn't mean there should be an article about you on Wikipedia.

<p>Reply I am one of 4,000,000 users of e-sword and I find it to be a very helpful program with no computer viruses. People pay money for software like this and Rick Meyers (the software author) gives it away for free -- no strings attached. How can a FREE program with 4 million users not be notable? User: openheaven November 24, 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>Reply: Likewise. I probably don't hold the same beliefs as Rick Meyers, but he has done an excellent job on this piece of software. It's worth keeping this article on Wikipedia. I don't understand the wish of <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> to delete this article. There's no real argument in the request. Is there some other agenda? --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxHund_1961.html" title="User:MaxHund">MaxHund</a> 06:47, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Reply: I can agree that in 2004 this program may not have been noteworthy enough to merit an article here, however I do not believe that is still the case. In the past two years E-sword has escalated in functionality and popularity to the point that it is now relatively uncontested as the most useful free offline Bible study resource for the PC. I found this article to be very informative, and it directed me toward several resources that quite improved the functionality of my copy of E-sword. I think an E-sword page here on wikipedia is every bit as relevant as pages about some old videogames such as Shadowcaster, or Mind_Walker. I think at the very least this program is not unimportant enough to merit deletion. Opusfalse 07:50, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I also have found e-Sword to be a useful program, and came to Wikipedia for an article which I hoped would tell me about possible alternatives/competitors, and maybe for some views of the quality of some of the modules. The article could be improved, particularly in this first point, but was surprised at the notion that the page might be deleted. Please keep it. Michael
<dl>
<dd>I haven't looked into the number of reviews of e-sword, but I would be extremely surprised if it did not clearly meet the guidelines for notability, as it has a well established group of users - the 4 million quoted above is just the start. For example, I have installed it on all of my family's computers, and several of my friends'. If it was only downloaded once (by me), and as there is no way to register or anything, who's counted all of them? Alister</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - E-Sword is notable as an extremely flexible and open framework for studying and comparing Bibles, concordances, and many other types of reference materials. It is rather unique in that it plays very well with many different file formats. Perhaps this could be brought out in the article more, but without making it sound like advertising copy.

<li><b>keep</b>. Being in that project myself, he is by far notable enough. Number of publication , combined with Professor rank at a university is enough. (Number depends on field, but I can think of no field in bio where 25 or so would not be enough, and he has twice that.) There seems to be a certain bias against academics if AfDs are placed even if they have status as high as this. The current WP:PROF discussions do not have the least consensus, and are simply not an accepted criterion in WP, especially in science.

<li>Thanks, DGG. I'm glad my effort may have helped and was probably appropriate. Elsewhere, I've (almost) been warned about WP:NOVOTE when I've mentioned this tactic.
