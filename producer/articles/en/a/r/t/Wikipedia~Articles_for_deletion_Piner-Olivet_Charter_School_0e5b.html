<li><b>keep</b> The criterion is <i>not</i> number of students. Some very small ones have been kept if there was anything much to say. This is an attempt at a real article, much fuller than yusual, and I would encourage such articles.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I created this account with my old account, even though I switched accounts. I am an alumni of this school, and when the article started, it was a strong school article, but had no sources about events, etc. Now, this article has been used just for student gossip and rumors between students. Like <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> stated, almost all information within this article is unsourced, and it looks like the information will stay unsourced because due to its small size, there are not a lot of reliable information to support the claims made by users and editors of this article. I've tired to fix up this article many times, but it has become pointless, due to constant reverting and the lack of reliable information. I think that this article doesn't help the Wikipedia community at all, and it would help if this article was deleted. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickyfuzz14_d028.html" title="User:Chickyfuzz14">Chickyfuzz14</a> 18:30, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Agree - Efforts have been made to mentor/guide editors of this article to follow Wikipedia guidelines and policy. However, the article continues to grow with non-encyclopedic, blog-like details, without references. It seems to be an open playground for current students. If the article is kept, all unreferenced material should be deleted. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 01:07, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I agree very much, but even if the result is keep, and all the unsourced information was deleted, there would 1. be no article, since there is almost no sourced information and 2. be reverting like crazy, unless the page was protected, but I don't think that is the answer. I know I have, including <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (I think) reverted unsourced information at one point, but the unsourced information just gets reverted again, and again. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickyfuzz14_d028.html" title="User:Chickyfuzz14">Chickyfuzz14</a> 18:49, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>From WP:SCHOOL: <i>"A school may be best handled in a separate article if it is the principal subject of multiple reliable independent non-trivial published works. If it is not, then it is likely that sufficient information to expand the article does not yet exist, and any verifiable information might best be merged and redirected to an article about the locality or school district in which the school resides."</i> Yeah, according to WP:SCHOOL, this should be merged, since there is only one article about bike riding privileges. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 05:50, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The bike riding isn't necessarily notable. The bike riding issue had been put into the article by a former student.

<dd>What is was (I was one of the students that got bike riding approved) was that when POCS was first created, bikes couldn't be rode to school due to a high schooler in Santa Rosa who got killed riding his bike to school the same year the school district was trying to get POCS approved to be built, so the city was all like, "We don't want another kid getting hit, so students can only walk." It still doesn't make sense to me, but w/e. And buses only go to a couple streets in the area, so most kids walk. So yeah, hope that clears up this debate....<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickyfuzz14_d028.html" title="User:Chickyfuzz14">Chickyfuzz14</a> 03:17, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. Large article doesn't matter. Content is what matters. A large article can be written bad, just because it is written bad, or has bad spelling/grammer.</dd>
<dd>2. Do any of those Google hits back up the claims made in this article, or satisfiy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>?</dd>
