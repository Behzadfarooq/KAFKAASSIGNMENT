<p>Non-notable Internet forum and website. Fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. This site is linked to from the official game website, but merely linking to it is trivial. It has also apparently won some obscure web awards, but none of them are well-known or notable. It is nowhere near as notable as a site such as Serebii.net, and that was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Serebii.net_%282nd_nomination%29_0715.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Serebii.net (2nd nomination)">deleted</a>. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 07:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability has nothing to do with being a certain size or level or activity, it's about being referenced in notable 3rd party sources - please read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 15:25, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Many of these mods are direct content transfered straight from CFC, where the authors of the mods first put out their work for the opinion of CFC members and have active threads for bug fixes, improvement ideas, etc. The <a href="../../../d/r/e/Galactic_Civilizations_II%7E_Dread_Lords_90a5.html" title="Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords">Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords</a> homepage has a similar page. --- <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahkuhnder_c9e4.html" title="User:Sahkuhnder">Sahkuhnder</a> 08:13, 03 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Response to your undated edit of your above comment: One of the awards you quickly dismiss as "obscure" is from the The International Association of WebMasters and Designers.

<li>Response to your Serebii.net reference: Your logic is again badly flawed. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Serebii.net" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Serebii.net" rel="nofollow">first nomination</a> for the deletion of the Serebii.net page was "no consensus". The ruling for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Serebii.net_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Serebii.net_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">second nomination</a> stated "There isn't a single word in this article, however, that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, though. Nothing has ever been written about this site in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable source</a>..." You claim CFC is "nowhere near as notable as a site such as Serebii.net". If notability has nothing to do with being a certain size or level or activity, as seems to be the standard used to dismiss many of the claims of CFC notability, and notability is solely based on external factors such as being written about and having external hosting of the site's content, then why would you make your ridiculous claim that Serebii.net is more notable than CFC? Based on what factors or criteria? Based on what evidence? If you make a claim you should be able to either back in up (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> seems important to Wikipedia), or else withdraw your incorrect and misleading statement. --- <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahkuhnder_c9e4.html" title="User:Sahkuhnder">Sahkuhnder</a> 21:25, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your response has flawed logic, i.e. - if we can't include them all we shouldn't include any??? Just because there is no need to include all 18,000 doesn't mean the largest and most active aren't enough of a cultural phenomenon to be worthy of inclusion in an Encyclopedia. --- <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahkuhnder_c9e4.html" title="User:Sahkuhnder">Sahkuhnder</a> 03:23, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Alexa test is only to add supportive evidence. A high Alexa rating alone neither signifies importance or actual legimate traffic (ie. link farms).

<li><b>Delete</b> No encyclopedic notability. Articles on fan sites are getting out of control. The way we're going, at some point for every article on a popular TV show, video game, pop star, cartoon series, we'll have a separate article on Wikipedia about the main fan website which reads "this fansite was founded in 200x and it pays tribute to X pop culture thingy and is linked to from X's main website by X's marketing guys", "it has 3 forums and 8 subforums. here is the list", "here are some fun stuff that the forum posters get up to and some running jokes we like - it's a subculture!". Wikipedia is not a web directory. Leave aside how many visitors the site is claiming to get - Does the website do anything encyclopedically notable? Does it have any impact on the wider culture? I mean even things like <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.html" title="Fark">Fark</a> and <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> have more of a notable impact than these fansites.

It's one of the biggest game fansites in the world. It's been, for better or for worse, a decently sized force on the internet. Obviously there are bigger, but if that were the only criteria for deletion, then we'd only have one page on wikipedia, "The Universe", and it would be rather too long for my tastes.

The article reads like an advertisement and frankly, none is needed. CFC stands on its own. I do not feel that a wikipedia article adds anything of value to Wikipedia itself nor detracts from CFC if the article were withdrawn. All that it is doing is taking up space, needlessly.

CFC is not a tyranny of whoever has the (temporary) last word or of a particular editor's politically correct agenda or personal opinion. Please see RockMFR's "fanatics" comment above for an example of an attitude that wouldn't be welcome at CFC. As JohnHSOG put it "CFC stands on its own.", and it stands taller without any association to a site of highly questionable accuracy and trustworthiness. --mossmonster 11:09, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

No real evidence of independent reviews or the distribution of the content by other sites. In other words, it doesn't meet the WP:WEB standards.

<li>Have you ever looked at the official Civ4 and GalCiv2 sites, as they are full of mods from CFC. Not only that but the bug hunting and game improvements/new game features that come from the CFC forums, as discussed by game developers that are members of CFC, get added directly into new game patches and game upgrades. There is lots of distribution of CFC content if you just look for it, and as CFC content improves and becomes part of the games themselves, every time the games themselves are independently reviewed a small piece of CFC content is reviewed as well. --- <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahkuhnder_c9e4.html" title="User:Sahkuhnder">Sahkuhnder</a> 03:06, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I haven't looked at them in the context of this AFD discussion. I have one bookmarked, the other I've looked at but not bookmarked. Mods aren't really that convincing, as they seem to me primarily the creation of the individual creator, not any particular fansite. The GOTMs being included or reviewed elsewhere would definitely be CFC specific content distributed/reviewed elsewhere. Of course, best practice if you are aware of such is to introduce citations or other references to the article, but we generally will evaluate evidence introduced here despite the WP:WEB requirement that the evidence be in the article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 17:44, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of course the content is the creation of the individual creator, no fansite creates anything on its own, but is just a repository of the work of many actual people. Mods may not be convincing to you, but to those of us who play the game they are huge, often to the point of creating what is very near to a whole new gaming experience. Do you know the amount of skill and time it takes to create a modpack? Does some content qualify as 'acceptable' while other content like mods just gets disregarded? Look at the massive number of people who download game mods(including scenarios/new units/custom maps/rule changes/etc.) before you say "mods aren't really that convincing". I read the rules and didn't see the part anywhere where some content counts and some content doesn't. It just seems very wrong that many people simply added their opinion without knowing how large and active CFC is, that it's linked by the offical games homepages, that the game designers are active members, that CFC helps debug the games, that new units, rules and features are discussed and added due to CFC, and that a great deal of CFC content is posted elsewhere for download by those of us who play the games. I guess all that acutal research would be too much work. Easier to just wallow in ignorance and smugly type "Delete - Non-notable/No external content/It's just a forum fansite/etc." without knowing the slightest bit about CFC or the influence it has on both the games and the players. --- <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahkuhnder_c9e4.html" title="User:Sahkuhnder">Sahkuhnder</a> 18:56, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are some mods for other games (for Civ? I dunno) that have articles here at Wikipedia, so a mod can be notable for an article all by itself. To me, mods aren't that convincing for a particular fansite because they aren't strongly enough tied to any that site. The same mod could have been posted to multiple sites, so which one should Wikipedia credit for its redistribution at another site? That is why I was looking for CFC specific content that was redistributed, because that would be solid evidence for keeping the CFC article, as opposed to an article on the mod or on some other site. As a side note, I think even if the article gets kept much of the current text fails to adhere to our policy requiring <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

Even without all that, it has a place in general internet history; being the inventor of the 'Democracy Game' and suspect as featuring the first 'Game of the Month', something which has been included in many other gaming forums. The off-topic forum on its own is worthy of being mentioned here, with deep philosophical and political discussions, as well as things like the 'Giant Radioactive Monkey'.

<li><s><b>Weak Keep</b>.</s> After Apolyton, Civfanatics is the only other civ site that I would consider (just barely) worthy of an article.

<li><b>Keep</b>: RockMFR, consider this. I worked on Civ4 (the primary game both CFC and Apolyton focus on) as a scenario designer. I worked on the sequel as well (both sites also focus on this). You want CFC/Apolyton content that is redistributed? Fine. My "Ages of Discovery" scenario was uploaded to both CFC and Apolyton as content of those sites. Now, the scenario 6 months later is spread across the web being redistributed. Also, this CFC and Apolyton content has been published in magazines (most notable July 2006 Strategy Gamer &amp; November 2006 Computer Games Weekly) with other CFC &amp; Apolyton exclusive content. Jon Shafer, Firaxis scenario designer, has released exclusive official content on both CFC &amp; Apolyton (WW1 &amp; South-East Asia scenarios) which are also now spread across the web. If you didn't jump to such a fast conclusion "Oh it's a fan-site delete it!" BEFORE looking up the facts first, you wouldn't look like such a fool now.

<li>RockMFR: I usually don't say it publically that I worked on the games, and it's not my place to cite my own work in an article such as this. That is not only delusional, but very arrogant. On the other hand it does mention "Fall from Heaven" and "SevoMod" which are actually more popular than my own. It also mentions the fact some mods got onto the game's main website too. Not forgetting the mention in the article that some mods got into Civ4 patches (try to tell my THAT'S not widely distributed and CFC custom content!). But aside from the mods, don't you think the site that invented Democracy Games, Inter-site Democracy Games, Never Ending Story and the Civ4 Hall Of Fame warrants notable status on that content alone? I do. WP mentions other inventors, why not this one? So it's a web community? Dale</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that this user has made quite a number of contributions on various issues since before this AfD was made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=164.107.92.120" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=164.107.92.120" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Firstly this means it seems unlikely it was RockMFR unless he's been editing anonymously too for a period of time. Secondly, it means this account isn't a Single Purpose Account, and unlikely to be a "meatpuppet", so even if it was RockMFR, it's a rather ineffective fake. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 23:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This account seems to have been blocked before for violating the rules. Doesn't that also fit perfectly for a puppet account that a coward is using to hide behind and do mischief as? Is it in any way hard to believe that this guy had been editing anonymously for a period of time? As long as he continued to get away with it why would he stop? It would be interesting to check the posting time/date stamps with this account and see how well they mesh with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RockMFR" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RockMFR" rel="nofollow">four accounts</a> RockMFR admits are him. I only glanced at them and already caught both accounts doing the exact the same, meatpuppet=Keep, RockMFR=Delete to the same obscure page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Black_Bitch" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Black_Bitch" rel="nofollow">Black Bitch</a>. Yeah, I'm sure this is just another coincidence too.
