<dd>Sometimes it takes more than 7 hours (time before nomination) for an article to be improved to "show notability". Also on you're user page you indicate you're from <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameron_Heights_Collegiate_Institute_5370.html" title="Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute">Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute</a> (also in Waterloo Region District), which you chose to enhance, rather than nominate. Please don't assume a school is non-notable, just because it's not yours. As things stand now, this one seems quite a bit more notable (though that could easily change). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 22:10, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As usual, it seems necessary to point out that there is nothing in the deletion criteria about notability. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 23:00, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's a speedy criterion for people who's article doesn't assert why they're notable. It's only logical to extend this to buildings and organizations. We're already deleting unremarkable bands. While a bad article <i>may</i> be improved, it's a fact that a lot of school articles remain hideous stubs with a complete lack of encyclopedic information (Wikipedia articles are not placeholders). The best way to avoid these discussions is to write articles which assert notability to those who don't think high schools are inherently notable. Listing notable alumni and well-known school sports teams is a good way to start on this. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:42, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is really no need to do this. If you feel the school article is a very small stub, and somehow that irritates you, then simply merge them up into the next level of school district etc until you have an article that satisfies your aesthetic. No deletion required. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 17:03, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is not my responsibility to improve articles that others have started and then dropped. It is my contention that if a school is important enough to write about, then bloody well include some important information. If it's not, then don't waste useful CPU cycles and server space. We ask this of all other articles; why are you so perversely opposed to maintaining the same standard for schools? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:19, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I think it's not so much a matter of the debate leaning to keep, it's that it was the nominator themselves who retracted it. If I or others "keepers" removed it, that would be bad, but if the nominator does it, I think that's widely accepted. But, if there's objection to removal (as there is now), then it should now stay. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:09, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If we didn't visit the AFD page, this article would have been deleted, and something of value would be lost. So visiting here, made a difference, as it often does.
