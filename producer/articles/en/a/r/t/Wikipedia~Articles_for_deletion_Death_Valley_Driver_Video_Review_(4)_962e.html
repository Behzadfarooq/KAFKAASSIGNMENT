<p>This article contains no third-party sources whatsoever. I requested on November 29 that reliable third-party sources be added, but none have been forthcoming, let alone multiple non-trivial sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> I will respcfully disagree with Centrx, being not all to familiar with all of the source material, I do know that there is verfiable content. If given some time I would be able to dig up the necessary sources or request undeletion. The mere fact that I have located independant translations of the newsletter, leads me to believe that the information is truly out there. A quick google search is showing me that some of the third part sites that did reference DVDVR seem to be no longer functioning and/or unavailable. <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 20:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

By acknowledging and taking the time to discuss its faults he has deemed it somewhat of note. Take of that what you will. That is already in the article but it was an argument successfully used for another AFD in which the only way to verify its notability was via the site of a movie director, before which there was no way to verify the notability of the particular item. Further more doing a search on the founder of the Newsletter's name pulls up links to many different websites and forums that link to and or repost the information in the Video reviews. Therefore further verifying its notability as far as in the minds of its intended audience, wrestling fans. To further this point other Columnists in the wrestling community read the reviews as well as post on the site.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> Are there any other websites out there that do VIDEO reviews on such a wide scale? I don't think so. Therefore this is unique, and therefore notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> either get sources up now, or remove it. Once it hits AFD there is no option to 'give me more time' to get sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> A quick search for Death Valley Driver puts the review site as the number one item on the list, even above any reference to the wrestling move bearing the same name. According to Alexa <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=deathvalleydriver.com" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=deathvalleydriver.com" rel="nofollow">right here</a> It has several thousand page views. I know that google and Alexa tests are not the be all end all but it is comparable to other sites with defined Notability. My main problem with the nomination is that from the time that it was first happened upon to when it was nominated was very quick. Not to mention the request to clarify which statements needed sourcing. As of this posting I am at work and cannot really acess many of the sites that would have the information you are looking for. <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 21:52, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only unique Google hits appear to be the website and this Wikipedia article. Any uniquely named website will show up as the first item on a search.
<ul>
<li>Death Valley Driver is also the name of a wrestling move that has been used in Professional wrestling for well over a decade. It is listed as part of the list of wrestling moves in the encylopedia. As for unique non website hits there are several that are listed as the Review is linked to several sites dedicated to professional wrestling gossip and insider news. Smarkschoice, Slashwrestling, wrestlingdownloads, heck they are even cited one the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Wrestling_Alliance_182e.html" title="National Wrestling Alliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a> news page right <a href="http://nwawrestling.com/nwanews/index.php?p=20" class="external text" title="http://nwawrestling.com/nwanews/index.php?p=20" rel="nofollow">here</a> , sited as a source for an about.com expert <a href="http://experts.about.com/q/Pro-Wrestling-1847/Proper-names-submission-holds.htm" class="external text" title="http://experts.about.com/q/Pro-Wrestling-1847/Proper-names-submission-holds.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> spanish translation of a moves list published by DVDR<a href="http://www.proz.com/kudoz/819886" class="external text" title="http://www.proz.com/kudoz/819886" rel="nofollow">here</a> Is there anything I am missing? <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 14:14, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If there are multiple reliable sources that cover this wrestling move non-trivially, then a separate article on it could be created, but that is not what the above article is about. (Also, the sources you mention do not meet that standard.) —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 17:46, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I think due to the nature of the wrestling business it is hard to discern what is fact and what is fiction leading to difficulties in getting verifiable sources. That being said being recognized by the NWA as a source for match reviews and the like, I believe that is about as good as we are going to get. I can attempt to pull up the archive.org of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Storm_c3c4.html" title="Lance Storm">Lance Storm</a>'s website where his column appears. Outside of that seeing as the fanzine would only appear as a wrestling interest item, which is already in and of it self a niche group that doesn't have the mainstream appeal of many other types of entertainment. With my shaky sources I have pulled together an entire grouping of people who are indeed interested in this newsletter and have trusted its opinions. I am not really an editor of this article, I've only done a few reverts here and there since I am not familiar with the actual newsletter and such. All I can offer is google searches. However I do think this AFD is lacking influence from the editors of Pro Wrestling Articles, that have a better grasp of the nuances of the newsletter and could probably speak on it better than I can. <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 18:50, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
