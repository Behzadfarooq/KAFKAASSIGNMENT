<dd>Hey I agree on having an article on Weebl and Bob but having each for every single episode? Basically all they contain are the scripts, if you're that into it, look at the damn cartoon, it's on the web for free and they are really SHORT and simple. Concerning the List of Simpsons episodes, I don't think I'm the only one to realise that's a completely different thing. How well known do you think the average Simpsons episode is compared to a Weebl and Bob episode?? Weebl and Bob gets 40 000 hits, which I think is enough for ONE (1) article, but flash artist Joseph Blanchette aka Legendary Frog gets 47000 hits and he almost didn't get a single entry (see listed AFD). Weebl and Bob are well known and deserve an article but not every single episode does. Also, I appreciate the work of Macromedia Flash Cartoon Collaberation but if they spend all their energy towards writing an episode list for Weebl and Bob I think they are greatly misguided. There are so many famous flash artists not represented in Wikipedia, please write about them instead. And if you do, please use the category "Flash artist" I made recently. But don't waste your time here! <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 01:35, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only valid reason to delete these would be non-notability, and and as you seem to agree, Weebl and Bob are notable. Also, there is not a sliding scale of notability. Either it is notable or it isn't. If it is notable, then it is allowed the same privileges of any other notable subject. How deeply it is fleshed out depends entirely on user interest and content volume. Weebl and Bob will never have the level of detail as The Simpsons, but that's mainly because there's just less subject matter. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_%28Weebl_and_Bob_episode%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_%28Weebl_and_Bob_episode%29" rel="nofollow">this example episode</a> shows, there is enough detail to be extracted from individual episodes to justify a separate article.</dd>

<dd>There IS a "sliding scale of notability". Just because it's barely big enough to get one entry doesn't mean you can all of a sudden have 40 new about the same subject. Also, if Donkey_(Weebl_and_Bob_episode) is the best example you've got, I feel sorry for you. Besides the script there is one line ("This episode is the origin of Donkey, as well as the origin of the popular phrase "How rare!""). ""The origin of the popular phrase "How rare""??!?<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 02:01, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not a policy (as explicitly stated on the top of the page, "This is not a policy or guideline"), that's an argument.

<li><b>Comment</b>. These articles are in violation of several of the guidelines defined in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Centralized_discussion/Television_episodes" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Centralized_discussion/Television_episodes" rel="nofollow">this document</a>] (specified as guidelines: "A consensus was reached to accept the guidelines below. --InShaneee 05:02, 16 February 2006 (UTC)"). Example: "Extensive quotation from episodes is a violation of copyright and unlikely to be fair use." "(elements best avoided:) A scene-by-scene synopsis. An overall plot summary is much better; the article should not attempt to be a replacement for watching the show itself, it should be about the show" The entire procedure defined in "Creating articles on television episodes" has not been followed. Under "Dealing with problem articles" it says short articles should be merged with the main article. It also says TV shows should generally not be listed for AfD; however, why I think some of the guidelines could be used for a flash show as well, it is obvious that a flash show is so much less notable than a TV show.<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 03:06, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
