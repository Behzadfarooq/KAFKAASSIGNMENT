<li>Careful, DurinsBane87. People can argue that timelines of, say, Star Trek is useless to people that don't like Star Trek. On that note, though... I do not think there is a good way to present the timeline of this canon with so few things to draw from...

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The first afd was based on the uncleanliness and lack of sourcing. Since then the article has proved it's self useful, and has been well sourced and kept free from garbage. The timeline features something that is nowhere else online, a comprehensive look at the different links between the different games. Also, it <i>is</i> useful to people who have never even heard of the games. All the important events in, and surrounding the games in the canon are listed here, in the correct order. No reason for deletion whatsoever. <b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 13:17, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Explain how this is informative to readers who have not played the games in the GTA series. Just because the article is useful does not mean it belongs on Wikipedia (see: <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>), and Wikipedia should not be the place for people to store information according to their own needs and discretion. If you want to compile a timeline, turn it into a guide and post it on <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com" class="external text" title="http://www.gamefaqs.com" rel="nofollow">GameFAQs</a> or <a href="http://www.strategywiki.net" class="external text" title="http://www.strategywiki.net" rel="nofollow">StrategyWiki</a>. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 15:17, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, it doesn't give full out character descriptions right there, but it does have links to many of them. From there the article states the important events in the series from a realistic standpoint, rather than just experiencing them in a game. It's not a plot summery. True it does include many aspects of one, but they usually include bits of character descriptions, even if this is as simple as '-this made John irate, causing him to-". This article is a great reference, for both players and non-players to see what actually happens in the game instead of writing it off as just 'drive around and kill people'. I don't want to make a huge thing out of this. True it's not the traditional article, but it is encyclopedic and helpful. It's been around awhile and I know people have turned to it, and done a lot of work on it. I think it should stay. <b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 20:37, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because a lot of work has been put into it doesn't mean it automatically belongs on Wikipedia. What you said is exactly what I pointed out: Wikipedia is not the place to store information according to what's useful to you. As it stands, the timeline is a list of trivial information that would not interest readers outside of the series, and is more appropriate on any of the sites already mentioned in this debate. Timelines are not exactly popular on Wikipedia, and some might argue that they're not encyclopedic. I'm not sure what you're replying to; you're supposedly acknowledging points I didn't make. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 21:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And you're putting words in my mouth because I never mentioned anything about this information being useful to me, therefore it belongs. Also, I'm not sure I agree with arguing what people will or will not find interesting. popularity is also not a basis for what is or isn't encyclopedic. <b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 21:22, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't specifically say the article was useful to you either. You're taking arguments too personally, and you're forming arguments that go against textbook Wikipedia policies. Popularity isn't a reason for an inappropriate article to remain on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 21:30, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Look, I'm not trying to make this a huge debate. I think that the article isn't violating policy, it is useful, it is encyclopedic, and should be kept. That's all. <b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 21:52, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For someone who has a Strong Keep stance, you don't seem to be familiar with Wikipedia policy at all. Perhaps you should familiarise yourself with Wikipedia standards before participating in deletion debates. Deletions are done through quality of arguments rather than votes, and your comment doesn't add much. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 22:14, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Completely unnecessary article for an encyclopedia. The content is difficult to verify, one of the external links listed in the section sources does not work and three of the links are to the same fansite, hardly reliable sources of information. Not to mention that the whole article is listcruft of the highest calibre and should probably make its way over to a gaming wiki. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimkovski_9be6.html" title="User:Timkovski">Timkovski</a> 13:55, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Clear violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate list of trivial information. The formatting of the article is irrelevant - if it stays, it needs cleanup. However, the timeline has little encyclopedic value outside of the series, and is a simply a collection of mission events. As the plots are summarised in each game article, there is little reason to make a timeline, and no other timeline has been made for any game or game series. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 15:17, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> but give somemone a chance to transwiki it to a gaming wiki. I think this passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (the games themselves can be used as primary sources, and guides likely exist for these games) and could be useful to someone not playing the game: since GTA is a popular example of violent video games I could certainly imagine someone wanting to catalogue the events that take place for a writeup. But that value is minimal and the article is far too specialized for an encyclopedia. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 22:48, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
