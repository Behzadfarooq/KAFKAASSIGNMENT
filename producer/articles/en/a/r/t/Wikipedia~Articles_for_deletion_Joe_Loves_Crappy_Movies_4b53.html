<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Taking the heavy meat weight into account, it's still 2-to-1 in favor of deletion with the 1 side having pretty poor arguments. "A college newspaper has published it a couple times" is pretty weak support for notability and I couldn't verify its truthfulness anyway.

<dd>WP:WEB is bogus in my opinion and shouldn't be a problem.

This page was created by a fan who was kind enough to take the time to make it, and keep it updated.

<dd>As I posted before, the specific reason that I feel this article needs to be deleted is because it does not appear to be notable outside of the webcomic community. The recent edits concerning its notability do nothing to dissuade me from this opinion as, aside from a mention of being published "several times" in a college newspaper, they only assert its prominence from other webcomic sites such as Comixpedia and DigitalStrips.com. Has it ever been published in a national publication? Highlighted on CNN? The New York Times? USA Today? Fish and Stream magazine? To illustrate the importance of this, there is not a wikipedia article for every professional international chess player. There are articles on <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry_Kasparov_1370.html" title="Garry Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a>, but not Alexander Riazantsev who may certainly be considered notable within the chess playing community, is certainly <i>not</i> internationally or even regionally notable.

<li><b>Keep!</b> Joe Dunn and more relevantly Joe Loves Crappy Movies are both highly visible parts of the webcomic community. One thing to note is that guest strips done by Joe Dunn are highly sought after and found on numerous sites and span all genres of webcomics... I know that's more relevant to Joe Dunn, but in the previous comments I believe its already been proven why the entry should stay.

<li><b>Keep</b> - If it were a book of chracters, would there be deletion? If it were Leonard Maltin, would it be deleted? JLCM provides not only entertainment but reviews of current movies with periodic departures into past themed topics aka the 10 on the 10th. The stub doesn't rave about how good this site is - only that such a site exists. Already, there is precedent set by other Wiki entries on traditional comics like Peanuts, and webcomics (Sluggy Freelance for instance). Why single out THIS one for deletion?

<li>Keep*- While saying that something is "only big in the webcomics community" MIGHT mean that it has little "relevance" outside of that community we should be aware of how large of a community webcomics attract.

<li>Keep*JLCM provides well thought out reviews and funny cartoons to go along with them. The idea of note worthiness is interesting and valid to keep Joe User's Homepage from being on WP. However, Joe Dunn is an established web cartoonist, with lots of support from his fan base. If a community is willing to come to the support of JLCM, then isn't that an indication that its worth keeping?72.128.31.117Prodigal72.128.31.117

<dd>Do you have a cite that it is well-known amongst people in the motion picture industry? My <b>only</b> qualm with this article is that, although nearly a dozen people have posted "keep" insisting that it is notable, no one seems to provide any evidence that Joe Loves Crappy Movies notability transcends the webcomic community as per the criteria listed in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Give me <i>some</i> evidence that one of the criterion listed there has been met and I'll switch my suggestion to <b>Keep</b>. The fact that other articles exist for webcomics that do not seem notable is not an argument for keeping this one; it's only an argument that there exist other candidates for deletion. <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 16:15, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. This one is a tough call, for me, but I'm thinking we may as well err on the side of caution. As SLF and badlydrawnjeff mentioned, this has been published in the Rutgers paper. The comic's <a href="http://topwebcomics.com/?searchterm=Joe+loves+crappy+movies" class="external text" title="http://topwebcomics.com/?searchterm=Joe+loves+crappy+movies" rel="nofollow">managed to do okay at topwebcomics.com</a>, so it must have a decent-sized following.
