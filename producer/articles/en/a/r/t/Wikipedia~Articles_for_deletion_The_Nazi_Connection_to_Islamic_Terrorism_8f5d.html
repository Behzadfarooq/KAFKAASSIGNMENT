<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>, no consensus to delete. This does not preclude renaming the article, which was suggested by a number of editors.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the subject, this was an astonishingly good-natured and friendly debate, with some good points made on all sides. Thanks to everybody. Some minor quibbles: some material was removed from the debate page, no doubt with the best of intentions, on the grounds that the material in question was not votes. This should not be done. This is a debate, not a merge tallying of votes, and every editor should easily be able to see what everybody else says. Another person, again with the best of intentions, removed an unsigned vote. Please don't do that. The closing administrator will examine all edits and the editing history of everyone involved in the debate (at least that's what I do) so whether votes are signed or not doesn't make any difference. As long as they're identifiable as good-faith votes they are counted.</p>
<p>Now this is probably a fairly controversial subject so I'll give a full accounting. Please be assured that I read all edits, in the order they were made, and no just those that remained on the main page after many of them were removed.</p>
<p>I get the following results: Delete (some with redirect): BrandonYusufToropov, SlimVirgin, Mpatel, Irishpunktom, Aaron Brenneman, Ian Pitchford, RyanFreisling, JamesMLane, Kizzle, Zoe, FayssalF, Farhansher, Aquillion, Mmmbeer, Commodore Sloat, Irmgard, El_C, EDM, Zero0000 (changed from keep), Calton, Larsoner, PhilipO, Sean Black, Ambi, JuanMuslim (changed from keep), Jkelly, Amren, Striver, Mirv, LeFlyMan (changed from keep), Anonymous Editor (mistakenly counted as keep)</p>
<p>Keep (some with move/rename): Cedar-Guardian, ObsidianOrder, Klonimus, Eliezer, Ulayiti, Skoosh, Fadix, Babajobu, Carioca, TShilo12, Zeno of Elea, AI, Germen, Briangotts, <s>Anonymous Editor,</s> CltFn, EricD, SoothingR, Karl Meier</p>
<p>Discarded: 81.131.216.145 (voted keep). Sadly this was two of only three edits from this IP so I was unable to ascertain its bona fides.</p>
<p>Please do check my results. This tallying, with checks on edit histories, took nearly two hours, and it is quite possible that I have made clerical errors. Please make comments and corrections on the talk page.</p>
<p>With <s>30</s> 31 in favor delete (some with replacement by redirect) and <s>19</s> 18 to keep (some with rename), I find no consensus to delete. By <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>, I am required to keep the article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:19, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have seen this book. It is a despicable litany of racist trash, intended to prove Arabs=Nazis by lies and distortions. Every page has a lie on it. Examples: al-Husayni met Eichmann in Palestine in 1937 (wrong); Palestinian soldiers use the Nazi salute (vomit). I hardly ever saw a more disgusting book. However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't have an article on it. After all, we have articles on <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>.

<li>Old Hajji did meet with Eichmann many times as testified in the . Indeed "He was one of Eichmann's best friends and had constantly incited him to accelerate the extermination measures" said Adolf Eichmann's deputy <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dieter_Wisliceny_a691.html" title="Dieter Wisliceny">Dieter Wisliceny</a> at the Nuremburg trials. And there is extensive discussion of this relationship during Eichmann's trial in israel.

<li>This illustrates my point. You can see from the Eichmann transcrips that he did <i>not</i> meet Husayni in 1937 like this book says several times. The book is a fraud. Wisliceny did not mention Husayni at the Nuremburg trials, either. Our article <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amin_al-Husayni_206d.html" title="Amin al-Husayni">Amin al-Husayni</a> is 100 times more accurate than this disgusting book. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 23:56, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the Mufti <i>didn't</i> actually meet Eichmann in 1937, it wasn't from lack of trying by both parties. Numerous sources make the same claim (see, for example, <a href="http://notendur.centrum.is/~snorrigb/mufti4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://notendur.centrum.is/~snorrigb/mufti4.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) which seem to rely on Joseph Schechtman's 1965 book "The Mufti and the Fuehrer." However, here's the statement of Dieter Wisliceny, Eichmann's deputy:</li>

<dd>In the autumn of 1937, Adolf Eichmann and Herbert Hagen, previously Sturmbannfuehrer in Paris, who at that time worked in the Jewish Department of the SD, arranged a journey to Palestine and Egypt. This trip was intended to include, incidentally, securing of general information on Zionist questions, and also a visit to the Grand Mufti, and Dr. Reichert was to have acted as intermediary in arranging it. But the visit did not materialize since the British authorities restricted the stay of Eichmann and Hagen to 48 hours, despite their tourist visas. In Cairo the two of them then had discussions with Arab nationalists - amongst them a journalist from Jerusalem who belonged to the circle of the Grand Mufti.</dd>

<dd>After the Mufti al-Husseini arrived in Germany, he paid a visit to Himmler. A short while thereafter the Grand Mufti visited the director of the Jewish Department at the Gestapo Bureau IV, Obersturmbannfuehrer Adolf Eichmann, in his office in Berlin, 116 Kurfuerstenstrasse. I no longer remember the exact date of the visit. Possibly it was the end of 1941 or the beginning of 1942."

<dd>I am glad to see sources in Wikipedia. However, I got 3 questions:
<ul>
<li>Why did those two Nazis tried to meet the guy in Jerusalem or Palestine instead somewhere else?</li>
<li>Does it mean that Palestinians were there in Palestine? 1937? Aren't they strangers?</li>
<li>If Nazis tried or really meat this infamous <i>big mufti</i>, than isn't a book about a pictured meeting between <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Rumsfeld_67a3.html" title="Donald Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> and the <i>other big mufti</i> (<a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>) would be more or less important? -- cheers <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Svest</a> 01:07, September 13, 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange">&#160;<sup><i>Wiki me up™</i></sup></font></a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, this books in completely non-notable... below 300,000 on Amazon charts... not that they they are representative, but, the author of this book is equally non-notable. I tend to be an inclusionist which is why I haven't voted delete, but one thing I am sure of is that this page better not turn any moreso into propagangda.

<li><b>Comment</b> (copied from gren's talk page): If it's a real book it should be kept. Only keeping the article will cause no harm at all (and will be beneficial), but I think it could be a problem if somebody starts to represent it as more than it is.

<li><b>Keep and rename</b>. When I first saw the article title, I was all, "Delete that puppy!" But when I realized that it is about a book of that name, an actual book purporting to be non-fiction, I chilled out. The topic may be offensive and the content of the book hateful BS, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be an article about it, especially if more wingnuts start citing it (a few already have) and other people need some non-wingnut source to describe the book and put it in context. So, the article has to be NPOV (which in this case, means explaining how contested its claims are and where the book is considered to be biased and inaccurate by most reputable scholars who have heard of it) even if the subject in question is not. In order to be sure that the POV book title does not harm the NPOV aspirations of Wikipedia, the article title should be appended with "(book)". --<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoosh_95d4.html" title="User:Skoosh">skoosh</a> <a href="../../../s/k/o/User_talk%7ESkoosh_c112.html" title="User talk:Skoosh">(háblame)</a> 11:42, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: As others have said, whether or not the book itself is racist or dishonest is utterly irrelevant to the question of whether we have an article on it. As for "confusion", the article states very clearly that it covers a book, rather than a phenomenon...but if others are concerned about this, then change to the new title with "(book)". There's that problem solved. As for Brandon's claim that it is "utterly non-notable", that's just bs: the author is a syndicated columnist and a writer for a very heavily trafficked political website.

<li>There is a sort of precedent, listed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Literature" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">here</a>. It says that "Books are notable if well-known, and should be listed under the author if not." Unfortunately, that still leaves it to us to determine what 'well-known' is. I'm a reasonably well-read person, so my standard is that if I haven't heard of it, it probably isn't well-known enough to deserve an encyclopedia entry. Remember, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a collection of random information; we shouldn't have every book at your local library or everything on the Newsmax reading list here. The 'well-known' standard for books should be fairly high... In particular, given that Wikipedia editors in general are probably fairly well-read, a book that 80% of our editors have never heard of is certainly not well-known. Therefore, outside a few special cases, I think the "have I heard of it" test is generally perfect for judging books. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 01:49, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Understandable... but, in an online environment hacks like Ali Sina become well known to us because we have to be engaged in debates about their legitimacy. This looks like it's going to be kept... and I have no problem if this is because wikipedia is developing an inclusionist policy... at least it's standardized. However, if I create a book article say one on something like, <i>Jews: How Zionists Orchestrated the Holocaust for World Pity and Won Israel</i>, or something along those lines that you see in trashy Arab magazines... I would not want that to be deleted if something like this can stay (supposing they have a much notoreity as Morse... which isn't too hard). I am just worried that this is going to cause policy fissures. If this is kept and then some of the other relatively non-notable books are deleted that shouldn't happen. I think we need firm policy on this because when it comes to books of religious contention each side has a tendecny to vote for their point of view on the issue. If you look at voting here (at least from the editors who work on Islamic articles) this breaks down right along the lines of their viewpoints on the issues. Those accused of always trying to demonize Islam want this kept and those accused by the former of apologetics have voted delete. This whole debate should be about notability standards and I fear it isn't... and we need standards. If this book can have a page then so can any Jerry Spinelli book which I'm sure all sell a lot more and are known by more people. I urge each editor here to created dialog for consistent book notability standards and not voting just because of your POV on a subject. Slim, Irish, BrandonYT, etc.. I'd hope you'd vote for the deletion of all vanity press... and Klonimus, Babajobu, Zeno, etc. I hope you'd not vote for deleting trash novels bashing other religions.
