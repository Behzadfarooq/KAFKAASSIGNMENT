<p>An underground rapper. Deep underground. So deep that the total sales of his top two selling records are less than 20,000 copies. Mostly self-published, too. An example of bootstrapping: label notable because it's run by this individual, who is notable because he was in a band, which is notable because it includes this individual. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's beyond me why you want to delete all One Be Lo related articles. First of all, the sales figures are out of date (so they should really be updated, but that's another issue). Secondly, this guy is a hugely respected rapper in underground hip hop (by both fans and critics). All of his albums, both solo and as part of Binary Star, have had fantastic reviews from reputable sources. For instance, just checking his <a href="http://www.myspace.com/onebelo" class="external text" title="http://www.myspace.com/onebelo" rel="nofollow">official Myspace page</a> will show you he has had over 300,000 hits - massive for an underground rapper. Apologies if that was incoherant as I'm quite tired, but there's no reason the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPowelldinho_1ecd.html" title="User:Powelldinho">Powelldinho</a> 23:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> No evidence of third party sources. External links are his site, his record label and two Myspace pages. Show me the notability please. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 23:39, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Not in my opinion, I never use reviews as a measure of notability. Anyone can send a CD to a magazine or website and get a review published. Reviews of CD are generally not reliable sources that we can create an article from. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 00:10, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree. If I were to start a band right now, release an LP with no promotion and sent it to the Onion or Vibe would I get a review published? Of course not, publications won't publish just any review, the subject has to be notable. That is why every single hip hop act doesn't get a review on rap reviews. With underground artists promotion is nearly impossible, artists in the undergound need these reviews. The reasons Guy are using to delete these articles is contradictory to the entire underground hip-hop movement, no artist will get high record sales or lots of media coverage when they are underground, this is part of the whole movement, not relying on high sales and controlling major labels for creative control. --HiphopisNOTdead 17:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well that's your opinion, but it still doesn't change the fact that at present there are no reliable sources for an article to be written from, so we shouldn't have an article. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 00:27, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The entry has value, he is a well respected artist. That may not equate into raw record sales but that is not always the best criterion to use when judging such things. 82.9.253.47 23:44, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree, he is a very well respected artist in the hip hop community, and any fan of underground hip hop will assert this. His albums with Binary Star have gotten positive reviews from many reputable sources and the same goes as One Be Lo, his latest album S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M. has gotten positive reviews from many different sources including rapreviews.com and scratch magazine (see his website for these links). Also the fact that he is "deep underground" has nothing to do with this, there are many "deeper" artists who have pages, it seems that this admin here would like to delete every single underground hip hop article there is, if this keeps up there won't even be an underground section. Binary Star's page is already gone, don't let One Be Lo's disappear too. Third party links from reputable sources are as follows: <a href="http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2001_01_masters.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2001_01_masters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2001_01_masters.html</a> , Review on Binary Star album Also on rapreviews.com note S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M.'s review (under One Be Lo) it states that the said album was released under Fat Beats Records, not Subterraneous Records. <a href="http://www.fatbeats.com/catalog/index.php?manufacturers_id=913&amp;elvis=c6ba68a3a0eb40f90d7e5649c629fe07" class="external free" title="http://www.fatbeats.com/catalog/index.php?manufacturers_id=913&amp;elvis=c6ba68a3a0eb40f90d7e5649c629fe07" rel="nofollow">http://www.fatbeats.com/catalog/index.php?manufacturers_id=913&amp;elvis=c6ba68a3a0eb40f90d7e5649c629fe07</a> This is One Be Lo's page at Fat Beats records, note other artists on this label. <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/16006" class="external free" title="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/16006" rel="nofollow">http://www.avclub.com/content/node/16006</a> review from the Onion (notable source eh?) once again note the label that this record is under.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> To use the language of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> A review is a "non-trivial published work", and the above reviews all satisfy the guidelines therein. Low sales alone are not sufficient grounds to deny notability. Notability is a specific policy criterion on Wikipedia that is intended to insure NPOV and verifiability. This article is both neutral and verifiable from multiple reliable sources. Low sales impact neither of these two criteria. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Daly_c5cb.html" title="User:Richard Daly">Richard Daly</a></li>

<dd>I tend to agree. Binary Star (band) has an album on Wikipedia with an article. A notable member with an album article as well.
