<li><b>Delete.</b> This belongs in Wikijoke. It's a non-notable neologism that was used as a joke by one columnist; it is not a real "syndrome."

The closing admin decided it was <b>Keep</b>, not <b>No Consensus</b> based on the discussion, the contributors and policy. This is not a vote. 10-7 is a meaningless term.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Google hits are not a very accurate gauge of notability; check print sources instead. A Nexis search of all available dates for newspaper articles mentioning this phrase comes up with a grand total of 13, 4 of them letters to the editor. Of the other nine, only one is actually an article about the "syndrome," but it is actually an excerpt of Krauthammer's joke article. Two of the other 8 articles are the same article. So we're down to 8 unique articles in newspapers that even mention the term, one of them being Krauthammer's joke piece and the other 7 all seem to be using the term to poke fun. I just don't see how this joke is notable at all.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 20:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're clearly a fan of selective reading. This is what else is on that page: "it is generally agreed that topics in most areas must exceed a certain threshhold of notability in order to have an article in Wikipedia. Several guidelines (see table on the right) have been created, or are under discussion, to define more precisely what these thresholds should be. Articles on non-notable subjects are frequently nominated for Proposed Deletion and Articles for Deletion, and are frequently deleted via those processes, as can be seen through precedents." So, yes, there is no specific official policy, but articles considered non-notable should be deleted. And if you really think the argument here is about "grinding axes" or inserting "PWN3D" tags, I would suggest that you may be participating here for the wrong reasons.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 19:59, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><del><b>Keep</b></del> <b>Strong Keep</b> - Well sourced article, and I have heard the term used by several radio hosts, and seen it on the internet many times, so certainly not non-notable. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 12:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC) <b>additional comment</b> I am revising my "vote" to a strong keep. Of all the neologisms on Wikipedia, this one is one of the better sourced. I don't understand the assumption that there are only seven articles mentioning this term, when there are several more than that actually cited in the article. While I believe this was nominated in good faith, since it was nominated by a disinterested third party, the editor who asked them to nominate it may have an axe to grind. This term is indeed widely in use among certain political persuasions, and if you don't believe that the syndrome exists, take a quick spin through Democratic Underground's General Discussions forum for confirmation through observation. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 21:02, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - it can easily be established. Read Krauthammer's article. He may have psychiatric credentials, but this article is clearly tongue in cheek. Do you think he really believes, as he writes, that "A plague is abroad in the land"? Or read this passage - "Until now, Bush Derangement Syndrome (BDS) had generally struck people with previously compromised intellectual immune systems. Hence its prevalence in Hollywood." Or this: "That's what has researchers so alarmed about Dean. He had none of the usual risk factors: Dean has never opined for a living, and has no detectable sense of humor. Even worse is the fact that he is now exhibiting symptoms of a related illness, Murdoch Derangement Syndrome (MDS), in which otherwise normal people believe that their minds are being controlled by a single, very clever Australian." Shall we start the Murdoch Derangement Syndrome article now too? Or let's use the closing lines as the clincher: "The sad news is that there is no cure. But there is hope. There are many fine researchers seeking that cure. Your donation to the BDS Foundation, no matter how small, can help. Mailing address: Republican National Committee, Washington DC, Attention: Psychiatric department. Just make sure your amount does not exceed $2,000 ($4,000 for a married couple)." Does anyone seriously believe the RNC has a "Psychiatric Department" with a "BDS Foundation"? Hope this information helps you with your vote&#160;:)--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:01, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The only real "source" for this seems to be Krauthammer himself. The two "expansions" on the term are hardly what I would call expansions - they just both make aside references to the fact that the term exists; they don't really add anything to Krauthammer's definition. The same goes for the non-Krauthammer external link. 642 unique Google hits doesn't really impress me, and I think it would be a pretty significant stretch to say this term is in common use. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 19:47, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Ive read through the article and seen Charles Krauthammer speak about BDS in several different forums, on Fox News and CSPAN. He appears quite serious to me. I think the part you mistake for a joke is his light hearted attempt to instruct Republicans, Independents and perhaps disaffected Democrats into "curing" BDS by donating to the GOP. That part, I would agree, was delivered in a half joking manner (Although I think he's quite serious about donating to Republicans). <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 00:39, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Half joking? So you're saying there is a GOP Psychiatric Department with a BDS Foundation? And you're saying that his other comments I quoted above are entirely serious? I'm sorry, no offense, but that seems nonsensical to me. Krauthammer may seriously believe that liberals are delusional - and some of them certainly are - but that entire article is tongue in cheek. He may seriously want people to think liberals are "crazy," and he may want people to donate to the GOP, but to suggest this is a serious medical diagnosis makes Krauthammer look far more ridiculous than he is.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 04:08, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Besides, notability of a term isn't limited to usage in mainstream media sources. There are countless words and phrases with Wiki entries that aren't used by the mainstream media at all. Should they be deleted, too? There are several very notable, very popular websites that aren't mainstream media sources that use the term regulary.

<dd><b>Comment</b> had you tried your search in october you would have found a different result. As for websites listed on wikipedia, if they have fewer than 10 articles in major papers mentioning them, sure, they should be deleted too. Sorry you don't find my reasoning convincing, but you certainly haven't identified any "faults" in it. In any case, I don't see the point of having a page for a snide joke made by a pundit. Shall we have a page for every joke made by Byron York or David Corn too? But what do I know; I was in favor of deleting <a href="../../../e/v/e/Every_time_you_masturbate%E2%80%A6_God_kills_a_kitten_3af5.html" title="Every time you masturbateâ€¦ God kills a kitten">this ridiculous page</a> too.

<dd>I'm using lexis/nexis. Google News includes blogs and other non-notable sources. It also lists the same article several times if it is posted on different web pages. In cases like this, I feel a database of actual published sources is a far better gauge of notability than google.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't think a <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> arguement holds any water. There is no OR in the wiki article. It comes from a published source, and is referred to by other published sources, all reliable.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm changing my vote from merge due to the discussion here. Claims that is non notable (or even OR) just don't cut it in light of the evidence. Also, thinking about it further, I think things which get traction in the political blogosphere probably <i>are</i> worth including in WP. In many ways it is becoming a sort of <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_estate.html" title="Fourth estate">fifth estate</a> (i.e. <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rathergate.html" title="Rathergate">rathergate</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netroots.html" title="Netroots">netroots</a> against Lieberman) and because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">WP is online</a>, it means we are in a unique position to cover it. In my mind, this is a more important thing to do than creating yet another article on minutia concerning the <a href="../../../l/o/t/LOTR_2d63.html" title="LOTR">LOTR</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">Armon</a> 14:29, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not an insult if it's true Sloat, you follow me around from article to article like a lost puppy dog. Please stop.

<dd>TDC, you are full of shit. I am getting sick of responding to this charge from you on every page I edit. As I have said over and over again, it is false. I have <b>NEVER</b> stalked you, and your crap about puppy dogs is ludicrous. If anything, you have stalked me; you frequently edited pages that you clearly know nothing about just to revert edits I have made to those pages. But I'm not the one who keeps bringing up the phony stalking charge. Wikipedia policy on stalking specifically backs me up here. You may be better educated than me, but you skipped basic reading comprehension in your studies if you think I am "stalking" you or if you think "Bush Derangement Syndrome" is an actual psychological condition. I'm not sure I would consider Wikipedia edits to be refereed publications, but I'm not sure why it would be relevant at all to this discussion how widely published you are, unless perhaps you have been publishing about Bush Derangement Syndrome.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 20:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is devolving rapidly, and now you are the one who is attacking.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I do not normally like neologisms for an encyclopedia and this is one. Don't such things really have a better place in wikidictionaries? I did not do any outside research so I could be convinced to change my view, but based upon the article it is the unique expression used by one person and referred to by one other person. Plus it is sort of an insulting joke thing. Is that really encyclopedic? I also do not think faddish blogosphere stuff is good for an encyclopedia. I know that I am out of step, but I do not think fads like <a href="../../../f/o/27/Fo%27_shizzle_my_nizzle.html" title="Fo' shizzle my nizzle">fo' shizzle my nizzle</a> are encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have used this article for reference more than 5 times since I discovered it. The value to the readers is what merits keeping it. The accusation that this is a 'neologism' is weak in that new words always need to be created when a new concept needs discussion. This is a very viable concept. Deleting the words used to name it from an encyclopedia will not make the concept go away, it will just remove a name for it. <a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyStroke_24be.html" title="User:KeyStroke">KeyStroke</a> 15:11, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
