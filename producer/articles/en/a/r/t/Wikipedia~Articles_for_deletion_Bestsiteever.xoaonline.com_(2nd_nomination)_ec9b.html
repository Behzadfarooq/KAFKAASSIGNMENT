<p>This was nominated about a month ago, and no consensus was reached. However, now that we have <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">guidelines for website inclusion</a>, I think this needs to be revisited. First and foremost, its Alexa ranking is a whopping 1,607,664, which certainly suggest it's not nearly as well traveled as the article suggests. Secondly, considering how little information it contains, almost none of it is sourced, or even verifiable. <b>Delete</b> as non-notable advertising. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 05:03, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, nn, <s>vanity</s>. From VanillaX's <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaX_0984.html" title="User:VanillaX">user page</a>: "The original author contacted me about working some on this article, since, as one of the creators of the website, I knew some details about it, so I agreed to work on it and I think it turned out pretty well." <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 22:30, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - How does that make it vanity? Let's be realistic here, if I'm not the original author but I am one of the creators of the site, doesn't that actually prove the opposite? If someone else took the time to make it, I obviously wasn't trying to advertise my own site. <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaX_0984.html" title="User:VanillaX">User:VanillaX</a>
<ul>
<li>I don't see how that's obvious. You're contributing to an article, and arguing for the importance of a subject, about a website you created. OK--I will amend "vanity" to "self-promotion", which is what I should have said. Apologies for the misstatement. But unless there's some way to document its notability, that's all it is. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 02:33, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I'm saying is that it's not self-promotion because I neither wrote the article or run the site now. Someone else wrote the wikipedia article and contacted me to work on the article since I knew more about it than them. If this was self-promotion, I would have done an article on XoA Online, because that is my site. My only link to the site is that I host it and I helped create it, I have very little to do with it now. If I wasn't the driving force behind the creation of the wikipedia article or the site itself, how could this be self-promotion? If you guys don't feel the article is worth keeping, that's fine, but just don't say that this is self-promotion. <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaX_0984.html" title="User:VanillaX">User:VanillaX</a> 9:52 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm here at the request of VanillaX. I'm new to wikipedia so bear with me. bestsiteever.xoaonline.com is my site. Vanilla isn't trying to selfpromote anything because it's mine, not his, and he's told me he wasn't even the initial writer of the wikipedia article. I don't know if that changed anybody's opinion on this, but I figured I'd try and clarify.

<li>It's impossible to look at an alexa ranking for this forum, since the alexa ranking would be for the entire xoaonline.com site. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:37, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>,This is not a notable paintball website. Notable paintball websites would include <a href="http://www.pbnation.com" class="external text" title="http://www.pbnation.com" rel="nofollow">PBnation</a> or <a href="http://www.forceofnature" class="external text" title="http://www.forceofnature" rel="nofollow">Force of Nature</a> or <a href="http://www.warpig.com" class="external text" title="http://www.warpig.com" rel="nofollow">Warpig</a> (started in 1987). These sites have stood the test of time and are the ones getting the lion's share of visits by paintball players. Do you really want a site that has minimal information, weak design, and makes questionable claims to represent the paintball community? On their front page they have this statement "Die Hard paintball also sales new and used guns, vistit our pro shop at <a href="http://www.pevs.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.pevs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pevs.com/</a>" - I doubt that Mike Peverill (founder of Pev's Paintball) would saction such a statement or affiliation. The issue is whether or not this site is notable. According to the guidelines, this site doesn't qualify as <i>notable</i>. 1. it hasn't been the subject of national or international media attention, 2. it isn't a forum with more than 5,000 members that has made a verifiable impact beyond its own user community (www.pbnation.com has over 200,000 members), and 3. it doesn't have an Alexa rating above 10,000 (the site has a rating of 1,607,664). The other three sites I mention above all have higher Alexa ratings (pbnation has a rating of 16,057 for example). As for the self-promotion argument - Alexa's entry for the site states "This website is a home to cross-platform clan called XoA Online".65.28.204.25 01:08, 30 December 2005 (UTC)Steve (Photographer for Paintball 2Xtremes Magazine)

<li>User's second edit. Please give proof that you are affiliated with the magazine before making the claim. Thank you. - <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaX_0984.html" title="User:VanillaX">User:VanillaX</a>
<ul>
<li>PS: Keep in mind that Alexa will usually only display information for the main site. Go to xmission.com on Alexa and it will pull up a webhosting site despite the fact that 75% of the traffic comes from the infamous "<a href="http://maddox.xmission.com" class="external text" title="http://maddox.xmission.com" rel="nofollow">Best Page in the Universe</a>". Keep that in mind, Alexa, while great for overall traffic statistics, isn't always the strongest source on determining what content is held under the name of the domain. Also, check the site again. Die Hard Paintball links over to Pev's Paintball, saying it's a "fantastic" site, why would Mike Peverill be against that? No reason at all. No where on the homepage does it make the statement you claim. Also, you said Warpig was started on 1987. While it may have started then, I doubt it had a website at that point. According to your notability standards, PBNation (which I would agree is notable) has an Alexa ranking that is not notable, despite the fact that is has made such an impact. If you like your other sites so much, take the time to write the articles on them and let other people write the articles on the sites they feel are notable.
<ul>
<li>PPS: Before saying this site is not notable, let's take another look around the internet shall we? Look at the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=forceofnature.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=forceofnature.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa ranking for Force of Nature</a> (which I would also agree with you, that site is notable, I'm just pointing out these statistics to show you that the site in question is as well). It's ranking is 502,806 (which is below your standard of 10,000, and, since we both agree your site is notable, means we should probably look at this with a different standard), with no daily or weekly ranking, which, since you may or may not know how Alexa works, means absolutely no one with Alexa technology has gone to that site in a week. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=xoaonline.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=xoaonline.com" rel="nofollow">This site's daily and weekly Alexa rankings</a>, however, are existant and fairly high. So, according to your standards, if one is notable, and this site has had more traffic than it in the recent past, you should probably acknowledge that either both are notable or both are not. Saying that A = Notable and even though B &gt; A, B =/= notable does not make sense. - <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaX_0984.html" title="User:VanillaX">User:VanillaX</a></li>
