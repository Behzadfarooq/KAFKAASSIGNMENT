While the article doesn't say "The ITA is notable because..." in as many words, it does call out the number of distinct groups and links to the media coverage. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_De_Smet_d95a.html" title="User:Alan De Smet">Alan De Smet</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlan_De_Smet_e320.html" title="User talk:Alan De Smet">Talk</a> 04:25, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The group has notability through size (100+ members? Would be nice if someone with knowledge could provide an exact number) and scale (10+ cities across Ontario). While relatively young, it has existed for three years, long enough to survive the high failure rate of many groups. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation_65d3.html" title="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation</a> apparently considered one of the ITA's member groups noteworthy enough to cover: <a href="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-5696129290292273615" class="external autonumber" title="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-5696129290292273615" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The ITA appears to be a significant group in Canadian LARPing, similar to <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCRAG_1641.html" title="NASCRAG">NASCRAG</a>, albet smaller and younger. The article should certainly be improved to emphasize why it's notable, but that's grounds for improvement, not deletion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_De_Smet_d95a.html" title="User:Alan De Smet">Alan De Smet</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlan_De_Smet_e320.html" title="User talk:Alan De Smet">Talk</a> 00:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>To be clear, the article does assert notability: it's encompasses 13 other organizations across Ontario, making it region-wide group. I've added a line to the article in question trying to call this out more clearly. The ITA has also been subject to independant media coverage (the CBC video). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_De_Smet_d95a.html" title="User:Alan De Smet">Alan De Smet</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlan_De_Smet_e320.html" title="User talk:Alan De Smet">Talk</a> 18:55, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No Need For Deletion</b> - Honestly, I don't think this should be deleted because it IS out there, it has many members and it is getting larger and larger each year. I was first introduced to this a couple years ago when I was living in Oakville, ON and I don't think at the time I was ready for it. Although my buddy was all about it and he loved doing it I never got the hang of the real life stuff. Although I did enjoy the table top it made me think outside of the box I guess you could say. I have saw this grow from a couple friends to many people in real life and in the online world. I have met many people through this and I think it will get bigger and bigger as the years go on. From it being on tv and now online I think it has the potential to get the exposure and reach its targeted audience plus make many people happy as it has been doing to its members for the years it has been alive. I have heard of many groups failing and I think thats right that it has survived all the trials and tribulations of a group such as this. I have no reason to think that this should be deleted. People will continue enjoying the experience that the ITA brings no matter what. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Maclawa (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maclawa_03cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maclawa">contribs</a>) 12:49, December 7, 2006 (UTC)</small> <small>— Maclawa (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maclawa_03cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maclawa">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>The ITA information is valuble to Wikipedia</b> - Hello, Everybody, I am new to Wikipedia. I am also a member of the Imaginary Theatre Association. After reading the ITA article, i found this to be noteworthy in the spirit of Wikipedia. Throughout the article, it is still new, and given more time, i feel that this article will eventually meet the standards of Wikipedia. This srticle should not be up for deletion. If anyone wishes to discuss this article at length, I will be here.
