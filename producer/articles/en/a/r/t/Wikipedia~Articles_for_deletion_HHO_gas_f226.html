<li><b>Comment:</b> I appreciate the idea to redirect the article, however, the only problem with the above said compromise is that HHO Gas is not a Brown's gas. This was reported in the cited sources of Santilli's International Journal of Hydrogen Energy Paper, and the Company website science page. So I think that would be an even more misrepresentative change to redirect people to the Brown's Gas page than to keep the original page. <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoyohio02_eaa1.html" title="User:Boyohio02">boyohio02</a> 18:37 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I still think HHO Gas itself is a hoax; the only question is, is it a sufficiently notable hoax to need its own page? (<i>Aquygen</i> gets only about 900 google hits.) And would the authors be satisfied with a rewrite that made it sufficiently clear that this was notable only for being a fraud or delusion? I doubt it.

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is the second article relating to new hydrogen technology which has been recommended for deletion. There is obviously an unknown but disturbing agenda at work here. This is user intimidation. There is no excuse for what is being done to me. I have worked long and tireless hours working on this article, finding sources for the information, discussing both sides of the issue to ensure article neutrality, citing all sources used, ensuring that the sources are credible reliable and verifiable. I have studied this subject extensively to ensure accuracy. IF this page is deleted, I contend that it has been done so based not on sound wikipedia policy, but on personal disagreement with the article's ideas and facts. This represents what may only be described as user intimidation and bullying. I have also studied the rules and guidelines for Articles for Deletion (AfD) and this article does not meet the criteria for deletion. I will not be silenced by intimidation tactics by both users and administrators of this website. I have not committed any infractions or violations of the wikipedia policy, and my article does not deserve to be discredited and deleted as though the article which was written is my own personal view. The article is not original research but a compliation of information gathered from multiple credible and verified cited sources. <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoyohio02_eaa1.html" title="User:Boyohio02">boyohio02</a> 18:00 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment/Keep</b> The company responsible for this Hydrogen Technology Applications, Inc. has had research funding from several investors since 2000. Financial reports can be found through a simple google search. There apparently are several patents filed with the USPA for an engine claimed to generate this gas, although that is no guarantee that the technology is viable. I do however find it hard to believe that a "hoax" company would remain viable for so many years without one if its investors asking pointed questions. E.G. UTEK (a UK based company) claims 10% in Hydrogen Technology Applications, Inc. and is currently listed in NASDAQ and the NYSE. One would imagine that any company, whose goal is to make money, making such an investment would expect a return or at least evidence that a return was probable. Innocent until proven guilty. If you can't disprove the claim then the logical response would be wait to see if they can prove it.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon_0a1b.html" title="User:Anon">User:Anon</a> 13:37 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>AS per the previous statement regarding "blasting" the page with dynamite per <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a>. <b>From the Official Wikipedia Policy:</b> <i>Verifiability, not truth</i> One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by <i><b>reputable publishers</b>.</i> The goal of Wikipedia is to become a complete and reliable encyclopedia. Editors should cite <i><b>reliable sources</b></i> so that their edits may be verified by readers and other editors.</p>
<p><i>"Verifiability" in this context does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a New York Times article are true. In fact, editors are strongly discouraged from conducting this kind of research, because original research may not be published in Wikipedia. Articles should contain only material that has been published by</i> <b>reliable sources</b>, <i>regardless of whether individual editors view that material as true or false. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth</i>.</p>
<p><i>Cite</i> <b>peer-reviewed scientific publications</b> <i>and check community consensus</i> Scientific journals are the best place to find primary source articles about experiments, including medical studies. Any serious scientific journal is peer-reviewed<i>.</i></p>
<p><i>Make readers aware of any uncertainty or controversy. A well-referenced article will point to specific journal articles or specific theories proposed by specific researchers.</i></p>
<p>The article which was reverted and removed addressed those uncertainty and controversy. Viewing the history will show the added section on the controversy. The <b>Reputable Publishers</b> and <b>Reliable Sources</b> provided are for Verification purposes only. I cannot confirm the findings of these sources, and as it is stated, that would be original research, and that is discouraged. As per the <b>peer-reviewed scientific publications</b>, I have listed that journal as the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy Volume 31, Issue 9 , August 2006, Pages 1113-1128. and specifically at the following website. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.11.006" class="external text" title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.11.006" rel="nofollow">| http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.11.006</a> and <a href="http://hytechapps.com/aquygen/international_journal.pdf" class="external text" title="http://hytechapps.com/aquygen/international_journal.pdf" rel="nofollow">| International Journal of Hydrogen Energy- Full Article</a></p>

<li><b>Point of Reference</b>: This is the last comment I am going to make regarding this Subject! At some point when this technology is more readily available and becomes common knowledge, The article will be rewritten anyway so If its deleted, so be it... Therefore I am not going to waste my time with people who believe that EVERYTHING about this gas is a HOAX. I am however going to state for the record that this is in fact a real product. You can argue that this gas may NOT be a Revolutionary New form of Energy, but NOT That this is a Real Product. You can call up Donald Wann<a href="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/old/atc/Machine.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/old/atc/Machine.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> with The Fulton County Area Technology Center in Kentucky (a state employer) and ask them if they are using HHO Gas, They will tell you Yes. I called them and confirmed this. Fact is that HHO Gas is being used in commercial applications. The overwhelming reason that this article was submitted for deletion was on the basis that it is a HOAX. I submit that if that is the case, I have been fooled by one of the most Elaborate and Expensive Hoaxes in history!! For anyone who is interested in more information, please view the following video from Google Video. It is 15 minutes long, and there are interviews with credible people about their use of HHO Gas. <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=660759158947266385&amp;q=HHO|Google" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=660759158947266385&amp;q=HHO|Google" rel="nofollow">Video - Approx. 15 min</a> You can also download the powerpoint presentation provided by the Fulton County Area Technology Center in Kentucky. <a href="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/atc/morenews_files/waterwelder.ppt" class="external text" title="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/atc/morenews_files/waterwelder.ppt" rel="nofollow">| Powerpoint Presentation by Fulton County School District</a> and Here <a href="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/atc/news.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/atc/news.htm" rel="nofollow">| News Article from Fulton County School District</a></li>
