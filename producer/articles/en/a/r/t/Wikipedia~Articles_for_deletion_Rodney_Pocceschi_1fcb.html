<li><b>Strong keep</b> any police officer killed in duty is notable. Otherwise you may as well get rid of the whole police killed in duty categories. These officers slain are more notable than most of the minor athletes who have articles on wiki and there are hundreds of them. This article has been here for over year. Deletionists would be better off fighting vandals and improving articles rather than deleting articles.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 22:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'd strongly disagree that "any police officer killed in duty is notable"...One can make an individual case that the circustances surrounding a police officer's death while on duty might make a stronger <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> case that is otherwise weak, but <b>inherent</b> notability does not, nor should not, exist for a single class of persons. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a memorial</a>, so the merits of a subject's inclusion should be weighed independent of how one personally feels for the subject in particular of fallen police officers in general. Furthermore, the presence of "minor athletes" on Wikipedia has little bearing on this individual case—nominate <i>those</i> articles for deletion if you don't believe they belong. Also, the attack on "deletionists" is a tired ad hominem that implies that those that support deletion are somehow less interested in making quality contributions to Wikipedia than "non-deletionists." -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 23:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I didn't say I wanted the minor athletres deleted. I'm pointing out the double and inconsistent standard. If you want them deleted, go ahead. I don't make a habit of deleting other people's work.

<li><b>Comment</b> If you want to propose a guideline WP:COP that every officer killed in the line of duty gets an article, then propose it. Some of us might agree, but others might feel that any worker killed on the job is just as dead and just as sorely missed by co-workers and family. Farmers die in tractor rollovers. I think they are heroic to go out everyday knowing the risks. Same for utiility linemen, ironworkers, roofers, and miners. How about all soldiers killed in all wars? Way more heroic. The question is notability: was the death noted in multiple independent reliable verifiable sources in more than a passing reference or a listing like an obituary? More than a person who was a victim of violent crime?<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>And as an aside, I'd like to agree with the editor above (but in less strident language) how disheartening I find it when articles that perhaps fall short of global significance but still are miles away from vanity page or indulgent frippery get knocked off Wiki.

<li><b>Comment</b> I voted to delete for lack of notability, but I would rather have an article for every police officer, construction worker, or soldier killed on the job than for every episode of a game show, every subway station, TV mast, 2 lane state highway, video game character, un-famous kid band. middle school, or city street, which some people love to create. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact that virtually all municipalities have laws designating violence against an officer as a separate category of offense, and that the epithet 'cop killer' exists and has such cultural currency is fair evidence that society treats the murder of a police officer as fundamentally different from, say, the murder of a teenage gangbanger. Both actor and victim become at least worthy of consideration for an article in my eyes. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 05:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and Deizio, with whose observation that <i>to say "any police officer killed in duty is notable" makes most rabid deletionists look decidedly moderate</i> I concur entirely (to be sure, the putative notability of the subject is not exclusively the fact of his being killed whilst on duty; were, for instance, Fallen Officers Remembered to be understood as a notable/prominent group, it's likely that notability for Pocceschi would entail). I am, as others, altogether unhappy that we might lose an exceedingly excellent contributor in view, inter al., of this AfD (and I'd join in their entreaties that he stay), but this seems a pretty clear case. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 07:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Being killed in the line of duty does not automatically confer notability, and nothing in the article suggests that this individual did anything notable (in the Wikipedia sense) during his lifetime. News coverage seems mostly local (correct me if I'm wrong?). Article fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Note: around the world there are literally 1000s of officers who are killed in the line of duty every year. Does this make them non-notable? IMHO yes, although others may disagree. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange"><sup>Please rate me at Editor Review!</sup></font></a></b> 08:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>General comment</b> A lot of you need to change perspective and get a bit more creative, I'm sure there are a lot of notable <i>incidents</i> involving fallen officers - if something gets widely reported then put together a page called "Rodney P murder" and tie in info about the killer, the death, news reports and such biographical info about the victim as is appropriate. But don't slam others for following the rules, it's clear this officer does not neet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If the memorial clause was relaxed then slain officers might well be among the first to deserve articles, but a hell of a lot of people die for a hell of a lot of reasons and I for one don't want to see WP turn into an online book of remembrance.

<dd><b>Strong Keep</b> If articles listing high ranking police officers that were <i>just</i> high ranking police officers are kept on wikipedia, then an article of a police officer killed in he line of duty is definitely notable. Furthermore, "It was the first felonious killing of a Virginia Beach police officer in twenty-two years" and "founded an organization named Fallen Officers Remembered" make it more noteable still. There are plenty of similar articles regarding military personnel with similar (or less) notoriety, who have fallen in the line of duty, and I've never heard the "wikipedia is not a rememberance book" comment used regarding any of them, no hostility intended Deiz. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 12:25, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If there are articles on high ranking police officers or army personnel that do not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> then perhaps they too should be nominated for deletion. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange"><sup>Please rate me at Editor Review!</sup></font></a></b> 12:55, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(EC) Articles about high-ranking personnel still have to satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and any article nominated for deletion <i>must be judged on its own merits</i>. If you find yourself making vague references to other articles to validate this one, rather than direct references to policies and guidelines (which you'll note I am doing) then maybe this subject isn't actually encyclopedic. "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a memorial</a>" is <i>official policy</i> whether you've heard it before or not. His family founded this organisation of unknown importance after he died. The lack of cop-killing in Virginia Beach is a matter for "Crime in Virginia Beach". I don't take anything at AfD personally, I wish everyone else felt the same&#160;:) <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 13:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Wikipedia is not a memorial. An officer killed on the job is not more article-worthy than a soldier killed in a war (50,000 in Vietnam, 24,000,000 in WW 2, nearly 3,000 in Iraq) or for that matter a utility lineman electrocuted while restoring power or an ironworker killed building a bridge. What matters is whether the death was notable in terms of press coverage, things named after them, books or tv shows about the incident , like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Onion_Field_77de.html" title="The Onion Field">The Onion Field</a>. This officer got some local press coverage, but really no more than a victim of armed robbery or domestic violence might have gotten if they were mediagenic. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:44, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> "<i>any article nominated for deletion must be judged on its own merits</i>" I wasn't implying that just because other articles are kept means this one must be kept, I was pointing out that wikipedia has enough space for articles of lesser notoriety. I still think that the "It was the first felonious killing of a Virginia Beach police officer in twenty-two years" and "founded an organization named Fallen Officers Remembered" make it notable, aswell as the $44'000 money grant. I don't mean to step on your toes when I say that, Deiz.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 14:41, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No problemo. I'm certainly not one to stand in the way of consensus, although the number of "strong keep" votes being expressed here with no recourse to policy is something I would certainly consider if closing this debate, AfD is not and never has been a headcount. I do admire all editors who spend time researching topics and creating articles, as it's one of the things I enjoy the most about Wikipedia myself. May the verdict of the closing admin be declared "wonderful" by all those who witness it. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 15:24, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Note that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a <i>guideline</i>, not policy. From WP:BIO:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) "This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious). However, it is the opinion of many, but not all, Wikipedians that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies).</dd>
<dd>People who satisfy at least one of the items below may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them."</dd>
<dd>2) "This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted."</dd>
<dd>This article satisfies NPOV, verifiability, does not suffer from OR, and there is public interest. Non-uniform application of the notability concept seems to be a recurring problem. Articles on video game characters, comic book characters, etc. exist to fill in information of interest to "special interest" groups. Likewise, this subject is of interest to a different "audience". The added fact that his death has inspired a grass roots effort to supply police officers with needed life-saving equipment adds to his interest. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 15:09, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Regular AfD visitors are well up on&#160;:BIO. You're making vague references to video game characters but not addressing what it is this individual achieved that makes him notable, nor establishing the significance of this organisation. As I said, this would be fine as an article about the <i>incident</i> given sufficient news coverage, but is much weaker as an article about the <i>officer</i> unlucky enough to be involved in it. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 15:17, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
