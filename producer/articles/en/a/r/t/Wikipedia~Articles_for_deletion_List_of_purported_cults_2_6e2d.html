<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). For those interested in the vote count I find 17 delete votes and 15 or 16 keep votes depending on whether or not the anonymous vote near the start of the debate is counted. Otherwise moving this page to some other title has been suggested, such discussions should go on the article's talkpage. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:48, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>First note that there is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_purported_cults_Delete_eda3.html" title="Talk:List of purported cults/Delete">previous VfD</a> from July 2004 which didn't reach consensus.</p>
<p>This new VfD is for an unrelated reason, as I judge the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_purported_cults.html" title="List of purported cults">List of purported cults</a> to be original research and as such violating the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. This list tries to avoid the POV problems and endless struggles which would plague a "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cults.html" title="List of cults">List of cults</a>" (but accept a redirect from there). Only the solution found by the authors of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_purported_cults.html" title="List of purported cults">List of purported cults</a> has a massive <i>Original Research</i> problem. The authors are doing their own research which of the zillions of possible sources in mass media are ignored, or put in one three categories of varying degrees of consensus. To make matters worse the authors are also attempting own research, which word in languages other than English should be considered equivalent to "cult". (Unfortunately they ignore the question of the different meanings of "cult" itself, but this is not central to VfD).</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is simply a list of organizations that have been cited as cults by one or more news sources. Perhaps if the article's title were changed to "List of movements and religious groups cited by one or more news sources as being cults," we would not have to consider it for deletion.

<li>Being very active in two Wikipedias (admin in one) I don't always take the time to check systematically for every vote or article I might be interested in - so I'm really glad if other people inform me about ongoing discussions or problematic articles where I might throw in my two cents, though I never see this as obligation to participate, just as invitation - and if I respond to it, I see it as invitation to state my view on the subject or contribute my knowledge to the article, not echoing someone elses views. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 07:15, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, firstly, "original research" does not mean and has never meant "the very act of doing research." One might as well ask of <i>any</i> Wikipedia article, "if it is not a copyvio of some existing article on a subject, how is it not 'original research'?" Second of all, why <i>should</i> it be noted which Wikipedians voted on this VfD in response to my letting them know the vote was going on? It almost sounds as if you're suggesting that there is something untoward in doing so, but the only policy or guideline I know which discourages such things applies to notifying <b>non-Wikipedians</b> of a VfD and encouraging them to come and vote. I'm not aware of anything that suggests it's a wrong thing to notify interested Wikipedians of a vote that may affect them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. With all due respect the article is the opposite of original research. Over several months editors worked together on the talk page to develop a strict criteria for inclusion on the list - a direct description of a group as a "cult" by one or more carefully ranked sourced. There have been questions over how to translate foreign words, and it was previously agreed that "sect" is sometimes used in British english and french with the same meaning. A discussion is now underway, which <a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> refers to, about the german word "Sekte". But we are treating the matter carefully, seeking citations and working slowly. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 15:07, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Transwiki to Wikisource</b> (if they'll have it)</s><b>Delete</b>. I have no problem with a list of purported cults (although it'd be a nightmare to maintain and remain npov) but this page is original research, not an encyclopedia article. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 15:15, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It is that very criteria that makes it original research. Where is the reference that these are widely agreed criteria among academics of what makes an organisation a purported cult? I know you have references of where other media agencies have called something a cult, but is that really NPOV? If you take that out, you're just left with the criteria at the start that may as well have been plucked from nowhere. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 21:42, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>One of the article in the "Cult" template is Cult checklists which covers exactly that topic. However, if we were to use one of those checklists to decide on our own if a group was a cult then <b>that</b> would be original research. Like any good NPOV article, we are not making assertions of our own but instead are sourcing every opinion. Should we eschew sources and make determinations on our own logic? That seems totally contrary to the normal methods of Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 02:48, July 22, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You keep pursuing the argument of "if it sourced, it is NPOV". But it is not so. A controversial subject (and don't tell me that this is <i>not</i> one of these...), needs to represent all sides of a controversy in a balanced manner to attain NPOV. The groups listed here does not have a recourse to present <i>their</i> POV in the matter. This list is a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacklist.html" title="Blacklist">blacklist</a> in camouflage and deserves to be deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi ≈</a> 04:08, July 22, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right, Jossi. For purposes of NPOV, it <i>is</i> important, and in fact, the guiding principles of Wikipedia specify, that both sides of the controversy <i>should</i> be represented. The question is, though, when both sides of a controversy about a group <i>are</i> covered in the most logical place -- i.e. in the group's own entry -- is it a violation of NPOV to <i>acknowledge</i> the fact of the controversy in any other place? Because that's what this article is about, about <i>acknowledging</i> these controversies. You've been telling everyone that no, this article goes farther, this article presents the "anti-cult" POV, and <i>only</i> the anti-cult POV, and my question for you is "where?" <i>Where</i> is this article presenting the dissection of doctrines with a critical eye? the testimonies of those harmed and degraded by the group? the secret documents seized by law enforcement and brought out at trials? The answer is, nowhere. The list says "This is the group; these are the sources that raise the issue; you must follow the link if you want to know the arguments on either side of the issue." The list simply <i>does not contain</i> the "anti-cult" POV you are arguing that it presents out of proportion to any other view -- <i>except</i> to the degree that that POV is acknowledged as <i>existing</i> in order to acknowledge the <i>existence</i> of a controversy. And you seem to be arguing that even that much <i>acknowledgement</i> of the <i>existence</i> of a POV that says "this group is a cult" is automatically so damaging an NPOV violation that we must burn the article with fire. How come you've never shown so much concern about, say, whether a group is called a <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_group.html" title="Hate group">hate group</a> or not? Have you been as fervent in your belief there that an accusation against a group cannot be <i>allowed to exist</i> within a Wikipedia article, unless the opposite POV is presented right then and there, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&amp;diff=8482670&amp;oldid=8480078" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&amp;diff=8482670&amp;oldid=8480078" rel="nofollow">when it's not a group you approve of as the target</a>? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:10, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The term <i>cult</i> is a minefield if one is to judge by the numerous definitions of the term in the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html#Definitions_of_.22cult.22" title="Cult">Cult</a> article. In an attempt to make a list of cults NPOV, a group of editors came up with the current idea that somehow skirts the controversy around the term. Admirable as their effort may be, it is unfortunately not NPOV, it is dangerously close to being <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> (in particular the taxonomy upon which the source "cohorts" was designed) and the fact that it is still used as a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacklist.html" title="Blacklist">blacklist</a> for many religious groups: Note that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cults.html" title="List of cults">List of cults</a> redirects to this article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi ≈</a> 15:24, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just read the criteria established for including a group in the list, for an example of the extent to which this article resorts to original research. Highlights are mine: <i>Groups are arranged by the "width of consensus" of the sources: sources aligned with <b>widest consensus</b> are first, sources aligned with <b>decreasing consensus</b> follow, and sources that are aligned with only a <b>very narrow consensus</b> in their use of the term "cult" are last. Within these "cohorts" groups are arranged alphabetically.</i> The decision of what "width of consensus" means, the choice of certain sources and exclusion of other sources to have bearing or not on that "consensus" is 100% original research and arbitrary at most. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi ≈</a> 16:13, July 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Note that all of the sources are on the list, just some are ranked higher than others- so it isn't a matter of picking and choosing.

<li>Don't you see it? Why Source A is higher than source B? Why source X is included and Source Y is excluded? The ranking of these sources is indeed, original research. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi ≈</a> 18:31, July 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> because the article is a list of <i>purported</i> cults. The list makes plain that it is "purported" (i.e. commonly put forward).

<li>I don't think it's neccessary to be a cult to be included on a list of purported cults, however your last point (on blacklists) has made me reconsider my vote. Even the MILS report (a horribly biased anti-religion piece) views the term "cult" as overly perjorative, and IMHO it's unfair to list organizations with huge memberships (mormons, adventists, jws, etc) on this list.

<li><b>Keep.</b> The restriction on "no original research" is not a bright line. Almost every article involves the exercise of editorial judgement to some extent. When the list seems to be useful, seems to represent a reasonable consensus judgement, and where the items are either noncontroversial or where the interplay of editorial give-and-take has created a reasonably neutral point of view, I think they can be kept.

<li>I don't see anywhere in the article any conflicting views. Aum Shinkiryo doesn't provide cites that say it's <i>not</i> a cult, and I'll hazard it doesn't call itself one. To cover the conflicting views would essentially be a "List of organisation that are sometime called cults and sometimes not called cults", and then to present a battle-of-the-googles or something. Which, to me at any rate, doesn't impart much encyclopedic information. I suspect that many of these organisations appear on various countries' "restricted organisations" (or whatever) list; a collection along those lines under a relevant title <i>might</i> not be POV and I suspect already exists, somewhere. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 04:20, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I did read it, and I'll grant you all of the above - but my point is that if a journalist has called something a cult that in itself is pretty meaningless. All users of the word mean different (derogatory) things by it - 'one man's sect is another man's denomination'. An article listing religious groups called 'cult' might list them all.

If we delete this article because it is "original research" then we may as well delete all of Wikipedia, because there is no article on here that doesn't require exactly the same sort of "original research" -- considering the various points of view put forth by various sources, trying to decide which sources are credible, which sources are prominent even if not fully credible -- and the <i>average</i> article calls for editors to <i>synthesize</i> from those largely unspoken judgements that an accusation by CBS News needs to be reported and an accusation on an anonymous Geocities webpage does not. This article goes <i>farther</i> than most Wikipedia articles do to <i>avoid</i> any NPOV problems coming from editors' undiscussed, undisclosed decisions about which sources are worthy of mention and why by <i>discussing</i> it and <i>disclosing</i> it and putting that information <i>into the article</i>. To pretend we have to destroy this article to satisfy NPOV is to willfully misread <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and what it says about <i>not</i> letting NPOV spill over into false balance where <i>no</i> judgements may be made about sources. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:01, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Where are the conflicting views presented to be able to adhere to NPOV? Where are all the newspaper articles, or encyclopedias in which these groups were <b>not</b> labelled as "cults". And what about the blacklist from the France government? Where is the opposite view to <i>that</i>? Can we say than group XYZ is not considered a cult by the governments of Italy, Canda, Spain, Greece, Venezuela, etc.? It does not make sense. NPOV requires that a controversial subject is treated in such way that the controversy is described and conflicting views be given a balanced coverage.

<li><b>Delete</b> and merge. Early Christianity, in all its various sects, was considered a cult for centuries until its endorsement by Constantine. After the definition of Christian orthodoxy, many long established Christian viewpoints were considered heretical cults. All emerging Protestant denominations were considered heretical cults by the Roman Catholic church - and the later movements (i.e. Quakers and Puritans) by the mainline Protestant churches as well. Almost all religious movements begin as a "cult" - a movement based on the charismatic appeal of one individual. So where in history should the article start? The sources for the article are very recent and reflect modern perspectives and prejudices (which are usually based on old ideas lurking in the mist). Although an interesting, and exhausting effort, I would have to vote to delete. But incorporating the sources -- and the reasons the sources assert these movements are cults -- into existing articles could be useful. Controversial and edgy, perhaps, but useful. This would allow counterpoints and sources to be presented. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 06:17, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> article strikes me as odd, with its introductory paragraph about "cult" in what is now a less-used sense, and its continuation with "Definitions of 'cult'" whose concluding paragraph reads "However, in common usage, 'cult' has a very negative connotation, and is generally applied to a group in order to criticize it." (Perhaps to criticize. Or perhaps simply to describe the unpleasant reality of the organization in a terse and immediately understandable way.) If "cult" indeed usually meant something like "locally unusual or unorthodox religious group", it would indeed be meaningless, but since it (I think) usually means a (pseudo-/quasi-) organization that has a fairly well recognized number of traits, a list seems, if not useful, then potentially useful. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:13, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <s>I don't think that this list is original research.</s> On second thought I agree with Pjacobi that this may veers off into original research if we use each and every (fringe) source.

If the question <i>which media and government labels which organization</i> a cult (<i>in which meaning of the word "cult"</i>, preferably) is an area of active research on scholarly base, and results of this research can be quoted, then there would be no problem with putting up a list.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Pjacobi, it sounds like what you are saying is that this article would avoid the "original research" problem you think you see if we simply included every single accusation ever from any source at all no matter how fringe -- that way we'd be doing no "original research" in trying to determine which claims have any credibility or notability, which is the objection you raised. The prohibition on "original research" is <i>just that</i> -- a prohibition on <i>original</i> research. Looking at what others before you have said on the subject isn't original research, it's just research. Weighing the significance of what others have said on the subject by factors such as credibility and notability doesn't make it original research, either, just still plain research. As I've said, if we start misclassifying the sourcing of articles and the weighing of sources as "original research" there's little on Wikipedia we <i>won't</i> have to delete. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:42, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: That would be correct -- <i>if</i> it were true that saying something is a "cult" is "never [anything] more" than namecalling. While many people like to claim exactly that as if it were true, all it takes to prove it untrue is to look at <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_checklist.html" title="Cult checklist">cult checklist</a>. These are professionals in government and in academia who are clearly using the word and the concept in an attempt to predict and to understand, not to namecall. You may not <i>agree</i> with their theories, and that's fine. You may have the POV that every scholar who ever entertained the notion that the theoretical construct of "cult" ever had any value has their head up their backside -- and that's a legitimate POV. But to claim that no allegation that a group is a cult can <i>ever</i> be more than namecalling, and to call for deletion of this article based on that opinion, is to ask Wikipedia to <i>endorse</i> your POV above all those others. We don't have a list of purported cads because no professional has ever tried to classify exactly what distinguishes a cad from a non-cad. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:37, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The cult checklists — plural — are subjective, vague and contradictory. The cult checklists are not specific enough to objectively include some groups while excluding more mainstream ones. It is namecalling and an ideological weapon, not science.
<dl>
<dd>As I've said before, you are completely entitled to your opinion that the science involved is bad. However, if you are claiming that there is <i>no</i> science involved, and that the word only exists so that purported experts can dress up namecalling -- would you care to explain why said purported namecallers would try to define criteria that could then be used to <i>exclude</i> groups from said namecalling? The intent is clearly more than namecalling. Your POV may be that that intent can never be realized, that there is something inherent in the word "cult" that prevents it from ever being used to designate a legitimate sociological concept.

<p><b>Comment:</b> I have been observing this discussion from the sidelines, and what I see is that editors are missing the <b>fact</b> that this is a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political.html" title="Political">political</a> <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethical.html" title="Ethical">ethical</a>, and deeply <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal.html" title="Personal">personal</a> discussion, not a POV vs. NPOV, blacklisting/namecalling, original researrch or the like. This is all about the politics of the countercult/anti-cult (a very unlikely coalition of new leftists, evangelical Christian fundamentalists, and skeptics) vs. the politics of the moderate religious, the academia, and some open minded libertarians, are at the core. These politics are unlikely to disappear precisely because of the political act's ability to polarize issues, to disguise aspects of those issues which do not serve the various poles or positions. A huge amount of intellectual energy has been spent on defining (or more correctly, <i>attempting</i> to define) the word "cult". This discussion being yet another one in that cacophony of voices, is not unique or any different. Then, of course, there are the no less powerful arguments fueled by a deep personal agenda: apostates vs. new religions, rightist vs. leftists, and the wide gamut of strong opinions stirring the pot of any discussion about beliefs, <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_nature.html" title="Human nature">human nature</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_%28political%29.html" title="Freedom (political)">freedom</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">liberty</a>, and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a>. If one is to judge the related articles on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Brainwashing">brainwashing</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cults.html" title="Cults">cults</a>, cult apologists, and the like, one will find the <i>same</i> political divide as in this discussion, and the same editors at each side of the battlefield. It will be interesting to see if Wikipedia and its NPOV policy can move from utopia to reality: Accepting the politics involved will be a honest first step. The outcome of debates like this one, and the dismissal or acceptance of articles like this one into the Wikipedia fold, will undoubtedly shape the future and relevance of this encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../3/8/2E/User%7E38.119.107.70.html" title="User:38.119.107.70">38.119.107.70</a> 03:00, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>In that case I propose that we declare "no consensus" and move on. There is often no coming to terms when there is an emotional note to the facts in a debate. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 03:26, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>. This is an encyclopedic <i>topic</i> of general interest. The <i>article</i> may have to be renamed and/or reworded, but that is beside the point. Fact is, the word "cult" gets used (not by us, but demonstrably by others), and the question of who uses it to describe which organizations is inherently interesting. One may think that the article title is POV, but that only warrants a call for improvement, not deletion. There are many articles with seemingly POV titles (e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_that_are_considered_the_greatest.html" title="List of countries that are considered the greatest">list of countries that are considered the greatest</a>) and neutral, factual contents. This particular list clearly strives for accuracy and includes relevant disclaimers as well as a definition of its scope. That's more than can be said about other lists on controversial topics. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 19:47, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> those articles you mention are useless for an encyclopedia unless you think Wikipedia is a a propaganda tool. --<a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">AI</a> 21:39, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: We are not comparing like with like. Read <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_that_are_considered_the_greatest.html" title="List of countries that are considered the greatest">list of countries that are considered the greatest</a> - it actually deals in verifiable and notable facts. So, in a manner does this article, but the fact that some journalist once called a certain group a cult, although verifiable, is n<b>ot notable</b>. There are so many definitions of 'cult' that anything might have been meant, and different things will have been meant, on each occaasion. To gather these disparate references together to create a list - creates a meaningless list. We might as well have a 'list of organizations at one time called bizzare' --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 21:54, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful list. Not inherently POV, since the list serves to explain who thinks these things and why in brief, while implicitly referring to the pages on the movements in question for details. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 22:07, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Propaganda. The method for deciding on inclusion of groups in this list is original research. IMHO, use of the word purported to avoid List of cults is not good faith: <i>Purported</i><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=purported" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=purported" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> is vague and refers to a assumptions. The assumptions used are not necessarily from experts on religion and in many cases the opinions are from the media. --<a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">AI</a> 14:30, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
