<li>The archived website that you linked to reeks strongly of irony. Even if this "festival" actually happened, the fact that a Google search of <i>"Burning Shithead Festival" "Joshua Tree"</i> turns up 35 results, all of which are mirrors of the original Wikipedia article, makes this not notable at the very least. –<a href="../../../m/e/m/User%7EMementoVivere_56a6.html" title="User:MementoVivere">MementoVivere</a> 11:45, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Me and my friends did something similar from 1992 to 1997. I can still remember it. It was when we played Nirvana songs while burning effigies of our parents. I can also remember burning the Romanian flag one year and almost being thrown in jail for it. These things bring back memories. (And believe me, Nirvana songs sound quite funny if translated into Romanian.) <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazismIsntCool_0029.html" title="User:NazismIsntCool">NazismIsntCool</a> 11:22, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC) PS: We called it "Burning Dolls" - I seem to have forgotten how to put it in Romanian.

<li>I don't see what you and your friends doing something similar to the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> Festival in Romania between 1992 and 1997 has to do with whether or not <i>this</i> article should exist. –<a href="../../../m/e/m/User%7EMementoVivere_56a6.html" title="User:MementoVivere">MementoVivere</a> 11:45, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think the point is that such parodies are not unusual. Looking through the archived pages it was around for at least 4 years as a parody of Burning Man; I think that is notable. Also it is mentioned on other pages -- <a href="http://www.googlism.com/what_is/s/shithead/" class="external text" title="http://www.googlism.com/what_is/s/shithead/" rel="nofollow">like this</a>. When I was involved with a website called nofuncharlie we sponsored this festival and there was a story about it on our website. It was quite funny, and apparently got some feedback from burning man people (there was something on the website for it). The festival definitely exists (or existed). It's true that copies of wikipedia come up most on google but that just shows how pervasive wikipedia is, IMHO. I think this is a legitimate parody and should not be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 12:41, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>! - Just because this site is down now doesn't mean that it wasn't real for a long time. I should know, I hosted it. I own the domain and will put the site up again when time allows. I have been to every Burning Shithead Festival that ever existed. If you don't believe it's real, come to the Best Western Inn and Gardens in Twenty Nine Palms California over Labor Day and see what happens there... shithead is indeed burned... This isn't even a parody of burning man, it is real!... NoFunCharlie

<li>What constitutes "happening" in your estimation? According to archive.org, the website for the festival goes back 5 years. And <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010202144600/nofuncharlie.com/archive/20000822.bsh.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010202144600/nofuncharlie.com/archive/20000822.bsh.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a link to a press release from 2001 about it (from when the nofuncharlie site sponsored the festival). There is also a mention of it still on the web <a href="http://www.freshlybaked.com/recipes/viewrecipe.cfm?Recipe=Plain%20Shithead" class="external text" title="http://www.freshlybaked.com/recipes/viewrecipe.cfm?Recipe=Plain%20Shithead" rel="nofollow">here</a> in addition to the other pages mentioned above. This may not be a huge deal, but it is a legitimate entry. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 19:24, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The fact these sites tell me zilch about this event is what I consider to be "happening." I took your opinion under consideration and checked the links you posted. An impromtu gathering on public land isn't encyclopedic, isn't notable and barely verifiable if it's verifiable at all. I see press releases every day. The local papers do a good job of covering local events, even the esoteric ones. It wouldn't be hard to remember something called the "Burning Shithead Festival." I stand by my vote and my opinion. - Lucky 6.9 22:29, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand most people want to delete and that's fine if it's not notable but how can you guys say it's a hoax? Are you saying somebody hacked archive.org? Are you saying someone (presumably me) created the burningshithead pages in the year 2000 in order to play a trick on wikipedia 5 years down the road? That's a pretty elaborate hoax. And I'm not sockpuppetting (sockpuppeteering?) either, as a simple look at my IP will tell you.

<li>I believe that we've made it quite clear that we don't consider this to be a hoax, so much as a satirical website created as a joke. I disagree with your implicit assertion that having the website up for four years means that it is a "hoax" of significant magnitude, not to mention of the same magnitude as the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Piltdown_Man_3087.html" title="Piltdown Man">Piltdown Man</a>.

<li>Again, fair enough; I was just responding to those who have been calling this a hoax. I agree that this festival is satire; when I originally put the page up it said this was created as a parody of burning man, and I think it is fair to say it is satirical. Whether it is notable enough to include here is another question, but it is not a hoax or a sock puppet as many claimed here.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 09:49, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah, our good friend the Wayback Machine! Well, I don't really know. Burning cereal sounds a bit naff to me. I could grab a couple of inebriated friends, burn (object here), eventually recruit more and more friends for future years, set up a website about it, and say it is an important part of Wikipedia. Now maybe that's a bit exaggerated, and I'm not intending to offend anyone by saying that, but, really, where do we draw the line?</li>
