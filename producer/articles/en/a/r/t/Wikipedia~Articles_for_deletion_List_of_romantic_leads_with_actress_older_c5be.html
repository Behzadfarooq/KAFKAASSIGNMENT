<p><b>Delete</b> - indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture examples of any film where the lead actress is older than the lead actor, regardless of whether the age difference has any significance either in the film or in the real-life relationship between the two. The entire intro is POV/OR, a number of the listed relationships are not clearly "romantic leads" which thus requires POV judgment in deciding to include them and the standard for inclusion can never be anything but arbitrary. Whoever made the list apparently decided that a three year age difference was the cutoff point since that's the closest in age that's listed, but there is no possible objective reason for setting the age gap at any number. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:54, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Ageism against women in Hollywood casting of romantic leads is a frequent topic in the news. A list of movies, with stars and their age differences, which defy that trend is an important resource. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_featuring_May-December_romances_d54d.html" title="List of films featuring May-December romances">List_of_films_featuring_May-December_romances</a> does not address the same issue.

Ignoble 13:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Ignoble. This is hardly an "indiscriminate list"; the criteria for inclusion are clear enough, and can be verified by linking to the pages about the actors in question. If differences less than two years should be added, let them be added. The data compiled here are of interest to some folks for the reasons related by Ignoble, among others. The list helps interested people find and compare them, and as such serves a valuable indexing function. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:03, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>How much older is old enough to warrant inclusion? The editor who started the list seemed to feel that a three year difference was the cutoff point, but did not offer any explanation as to why. You have suggested that age differences of less than three years can be included. What objective standard is there for choosing any age difference? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:26, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact that a list is incomplete, or that the original author chose not to add to it any more after some point, is not grounds for deleting it; much less does it turn it into an "indiscriminate list" as the nominator claims. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 18:26, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>By now I haven't a clue what you're continuing to argue about. The criterion is as simple as could be: if the figure from column A is greater than the one in B, it belongs. The fact that the creator chose not to go deeper than a certain point does not change that, and doesn't <i>need</i> to reflect an "objective standard"; it's just a point where they chose to stop writing, that is all.
