<p>Seems like a Hoax article, aside from a couple of hits on a forum username Google comes up with zip and all the images on the page appear hand drawn, while even the most stubby article about a video game tend to overflow with screenshots. Asuming this "game" even exist it's remarkably unremarkable. <b>Delete</b> --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 23:22, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I did a Yahoo Search and I found a link that, although poor, could be used to link to the website. When searching for "The Sanga Team" I discovered one of the images on a geocities page which, with a little modification of the URL could be used to find a proper webpage. I also found the forum hits referred to and found a link to said webpage. RoryKillhorn</li>

<li>I think that articles like this are a thing that should be allowed to help wikipedia to broaden its reputation and that to delete articles like this, personalised touches that wikipedia should be allowed to cover. I don't believe that this article should be removed, if it is, wikipedia will certainly, for me, feel a slightly more alien environment.-Tom Calpin <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/9/4/User%7E194.80.32.8.html" title="User:194.80.32.8">194.80.32.8</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/User_talk%7E194.80.32.8.html" title="User talk:194.80.32.8">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.80.32.8_e095.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.80.32.8">contribs</a>) 15:27, 2005 December 7.</small></li>

<li>After being told to check out the site by a friend I downloaded the actual game from 'The Sanga Team' website (which means the "game" does exist). Although of a bedroom-programmed standard the game and its story had quirky appeal and shows definite potential! After seeing that this page is to be removed, I am initially disappointed by the fact that a small bedroom programmer is being cut from what are infinite pages of knowledge (wikipedia). I also argue the fact that this doesn't exist and suggest that if this is the only reason for its deletion the original poster should check the newly added link (to the games website) and re-think his/her position...

<li>As an enthusiast of comic book heroes, I am slightly upset by this decision. I have ascertained the existence of said site, and can confirm it is by no means a 'hoax'. This suggestion is preposterous and I would issue an immediate apology if I were as wrong as the initial complainer.

<li>The whole "boy sanga" is no hoax. i have both viewed the website and played the game, to be able to say this "follow link at bottom". If it is out there, then it has the right to be on Wikipedia, which is the whole idea. Deleting it because it is not on Google is a poor reason. its not causing harm, leave "the boy sanga" where he is for all to see. - Craig Mahoney UK <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 150.237.47.3 (<a href="../../../1/5/0/User_talk%7E150.237.47.3.html" title="User talk:150.237.47.3">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_150.237.47.3_c5be.html" title="Special:Contributions/150.237.47.3">contribs</a>) 18:15, 2005 December 7.</small></li>

<li>no its not a hoax, ive played the boy sanga n its an awesome game i could even describe the levels and charachters if you want. the cheesy voice overs make you cringe abit but its no reason to delete this otherwise perfect game site <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.42.217.225 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.42.217.225_99cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.42.217.225">contribs</a>) 18:23, 2005 December 7.</small></li>

<li>VIVA LA BOY SANGA!Having played the game and heard about it's in depth mythology from one of the creators itself.For an individual to go to the extent I know the creators have gone to,giving up their own time to create such a labour of love. I believe it would be an insult to them to delete this wikopedia entry.As previously mentioned, just because it isn't found in a google search doesn't mean it doesn't exsist. Try typing my name, Alex G. Wilkinson. You found me yet?...Didn't think so. Just beacuse it's not there doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Alex Wilkinson.

<li>Ok, it's real, sorry about that (this is why you are supposed to include verifiable sources in articles), but is it notable? The site in question is scertainly not notable (124 hits last I checked acording to it's counter). So this is based on a indie comic? How many issues where published, where, by who, and that kind of things would be usefull, rather than making the article about this obscure game. We don't need more info on the characters, we need more info on why this deserve an article in the first place.

<li>The Boy Sanga is not "up and coming" its already here many people have just not realised it yet, and as for information regarding the team, this is from the mind of a dedicated man who’s many priorities otherwise leave him little time to update the site as it is believed to be needed. The team are well known amongst my own friends, they however already know much about the team and have played the game, due to their laziness see no reason to go on the website, how do we know this is not true of others. Furthermore the game information keeping this site provides inspiration and enthusiasm to all Indie programmers who can see the great fun to be had of creating their own games.Goonroy 16:35, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
