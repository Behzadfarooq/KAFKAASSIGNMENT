<p>This article provides insufficient content to meet Wikipedia's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_style_guidelines_945d.html" title="Category:Wikipedia style guidelines">quality standards</a>. The information in this article has not been verified and is not reliable. No sources have been cited and the article is subject to vandalism regularly by users shown to be using "<a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sock puppets</a>".

<li><b>Keep</b> I find the timing of this Afd a bit suspicious, as an admin (DeathPhoenix) has been involved in the process to render a final version of the article that conforms to standards. Nevertheless, there are other usenet groups on Wikipedia. Many entries are subject to more vandalism than this one and your statement "insufficient context for those unfamiliar" makes absolutely NO logical sense whatsoever. Work to improve the entry has been marred by ONE user: Chadbryant, and this situation is currently being dealt with. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 17:40, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have removed unverifiable information and have provided links to verify the number of posts. Honestly, why is an Afd being proposed for an entry that is in the middle of being brought up to Wiki standards? <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 17:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's much better now. But in my opinion the article is still sourced only to <a href="http://www.rspw.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.rspw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rspw.org/</a> and I don't think that meets the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> standards, which say "Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as primary or secondary sources." Now, one might say that the newsgroup itself is its own source, but I don't see how you can use it as for general, overall statements about the newsgroup itself without performing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:33, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> <i>"highly suspicious"</i>... No I am not affiliated with anyone involved in your apparent dispute, if that's what you mean by <i>"highly suspicious"</i>. However what I am aware of is that the article lacks sufficient content to meet Wikipedia's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_style_guidelines_945d.html" title="Category:Wikipedia style guidelines">quality standards</a>. Not only was the information there unreliable, but no sources were even cited. The article has also been subject to numerous edit wars even after an apparent consensus was made. The continuous disputes with yourself and whatever other parties involved are for you to handle so it is irrelevant to the AFD. But just because the article is being nominated for deletion does not mean it can't be improved. Like I said in the edit summary, feel free to edit it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I suspect that very few individual Usenet newsgroups, even old ones out of the Big 8 hierarchy, are worthy subjects for individual encyclopedia articles. As far as I can tell we don't even have an article yet for the rec.* hierarchy. If there's a reason why this specific group is worthier than others of its ilk, I am open to persuasion. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:38, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. None of the conditions mentioned in the nomination are valid reasons for deletion. If there's insufficient content, expand it; if sources aren't cited, find sources and cite them; if vandalism occurs, revert it. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 20:05, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a> says "The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:02, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True but irrelevant. A lack of sources is a reason for cleanup, not deletion. (Now, if sources simply don't exist, that would indeed be a reason to remove the unverifiable information, and, if that leaves the article with no content, <i>then</i> that's a reason for deletion.) <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 00:02, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And it is a reason which appears to me to apply to this article, as <a href="http://www.rspw.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.rspw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rspw.org/</a> is the only source, and I don't think it meets the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines. It seems to me that if this newsgroup is really important, there ought to be a book or a wrestling magazine article that says so, and if someone quotes that in the article with a proper citation I'm quite prepared to change my recommendation. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:28, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>www.rspw.org is NOT cited as a source on the entry. It is only put down as an external link. The source for the number of posts, which is the ONLY information in the entry, is cited through Google, which is really the ONLY way to get a source for the number of posts a usenet group has.

<li>Inconsistency, which is to be expected. If you want perfect consistency and policy administered with the even-handedness of Solomon, you want a command-and-control encyclopedia. There is a good deal of content in Wikipedia which does not accord with Wikipedia's policies. As I write this, there is an article in Wikipedia entitled Andrew Greiner whose entire content is "Andrew Greiner is an amazing person." That is not an argument for keeping another article with similar content. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:45, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If so then why has the entry for rspw been around for over a year, and had many comments posted by various editors, none of whom saw fit to nominate it for an Afd. Also, if you feel this way than why haven't you slapped Afd's on the rest of the useless usenet articles? <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 07:19, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see absolutely no reason for deletion. While professional wrestling as a mainstream medium in the entertainment industry (and, to a point, the world of sports) has wained in the last several years, becoming not as popular as it once was in the late 1990s/early 2000s, that does not mean that it no longer holds a legitimate place in popular culture OR on the Internet. Now, as per regards to that, rec.sport.pro-wrestling is one of several HUNDRED THOUSAND discussion groups on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a>. Therefore, it stands to reason that even the most seasoned veteran, from the guys who put the first computer together in the 1960s to Bill Gates and his Microsoft cronies in the 21st century, would not necessarily know what the newsgroup is, or even what Usenet is if questioned about the subject. HOWEVER, that does not mean that an entry on Wikipedia for it must be deleted. To argue that this entry should be removed based on the fact that one person has had a personal agenda to see his information placed onto the article is ridiculous. The entry -- while copiously changed thanks to trolls such as Mr. Chadbryant -- still gives a valid, informative definition on what RSPW is as a whole. No one person should be allowed to sway the balance of a Wikipedia article, and it seems to me that Chadbryant is simply laying on an immature level of "You guys won't play the way I want to, so I'm taking my ball and going home." It's just that since this is Wikipedia, he has to have the approval of the group before he grabs the ball. Keep the article, but semi-protect it and make sure that Chadbryant is aware that he is not the only person on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDooby_Scoo_5416.html" title="User:Dooby Scoo">Dooby Scoo</a> 18:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>and your logic makes sense how? If you delete a biography of a politician as unverifiable, does that mean that all biographies of politicians must be also deleted?

<dd>While I agree that we should keep this article, I don't think that the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPok%C3%A9mon_test_7449.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokémon test">Pokémon argument|</a> is a strong argument. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 13:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A lack of content or verifable sources has never stopped a Wikipedia entry before. If you write a letter, then before you mail it decide to add additional content, does that mean that the person you were sending the letter to should decide to ignore the whole thing if they were to find out what you did? This entire arguement has no substance. It appears to be more of a personal agenda by one or two persons rather than an actual question of the article; as a result, to delete it would not only be unjust and unfair to those who have attempted to keep it as legitimate as possible while removing material placed there by trolls, but at the same time it would say a lot in a negative sense for Wikipedia in general. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that this Web site advertised itself as a "free encyclopedia." I think I've even heard it called the one that "anyone can edit." With that in mind, sure you are going to have articles that lack content, or sources, or seem a bit awry. But that's going to happen to a lot of articles -- not just rec.sport.pro-wrestling. Looking at the history of the edit of the article, I can see where attempts have been made to keep the article in check with Wikipedia policy, as well as update it whenever possible. Given that this is a newsgroup on Usenet, however, and not say breaking news or anything current, that may have proven to be difficult in the past or it may even become difficult in the future. But if, for example, (and I know this is a bit of a stretch), the article on <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> was not added to or placed with additional sources due to the fact that his Presidency has been over for quite some time and he's passed on for more than decade now, should that mean that someone should come along and request his entry on Wikipedia be deleted? Or should the entry be polished up with whatever facts may have been overlooked, or possibly the article could be written in a better format by those authors and writers who have had no only experience writing on Wikipedia, but offline as well? I guess what I'm trying to say in this long-winded statement is that the article, while flimsy and questionable due to a certain individual attempting to modify it in a way that seems to have been regarded as incorrect or trolling, that does NOT mean that it should come along and be removed. It should instead be kept to the highest standards that an article such as that can be kept (and let's face it, since it's RSPW that's not exactly the best, but whatever works) and it should also be scrutinized and watched carefully for when such trolls as the one or two individuals involve come along and attempt to change the article for their liking, either in a malicious attempt or other such immature behavior. --<a href="../../../w/r/i/User%7EWriters_Block_4394.html" title="User:Writers Block">Writers Block</a> 02:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The reasoning that "other articles lack sources so its ok" is fallacious in the extreme. That's analogous to claiming that because one person may have gotten away with murder, murder is ok. If an article lacks verifiable sources, they need to be added. If they do not exist, the article needs to be deleted as unverifiable.

For an article to be worthwhile, there needs to be scope for expansion of the article to be <i>more</i> than a simple directory entry. There needs to be secondary source material published and available that is <i>more substantial</i> than simple directory listings and excerpts from "active" files. Usenet newsgroups that have had multiple non-trivial works published <i>about</i> them (such as FAQs on <a href="http://faqs.org./" class="external text" title="http://faqs.org./" rel="nofollow">faqs.org.</a> for example) qualify for articles on this basis. This newsgroup has <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/pro-wrestling/faq/part1/" class="external text" title="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/pro-wrestling/faq/part1/" rel="nofollow">a FAQ on faqs.org</a>. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:51, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, AfD is not a substitute for the cleanup and cite tags, nor is being a vandal magnet a good reason for deletion.

The article is now a stub which acceptably indicates the sources for the traffic numbers. The description of the forum is not referenced to anything; for the time being I'm going to assume that people glancing at the actual forum content would take it to be an adequate and non-controversial description (which still doesn't meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, of course). I would be much, much happier though if the article cited some good mainstream sources indicating the importance of the group: a news interview with a wrestler who says he follows rec.sport.pro-wrestling to see what people are saying about them, or a wrestling magazine recommending rec.sport.pro-wrestling as a good discussion venue... or something like that. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC) P.

<dd>A major pro wrestling star, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Richards_61b6.html" title="Stevie Richards">Stevie Richards</a> repeatedly wore an "Rapw sucks" shirt to several ECW shows and a PPV in 1995.

<dd>Not alone, but we were looking for examples of other mediums that have mentioned rspw...the fact that a known wrestler on a ppv sported an rspw shirt is notable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillC_00d5.html" title="User:WillC">WillC</a> 02:34, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Articles on the other USENET groups are not relevant here, we're discussing <i>this</i> article. The relevant guideline is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, not the content of other articles. (I happen to think now that rec.sport.pro-wrestling does meet that guideline... barely). The content of other articles would only be relevant if it were crystal-clear that the Wikipedian community had judged them to be representative of good practice; for example, if they had been featured articles.<a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 09:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that there is a wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a> gives the RSPW entry a permanent place here.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just because Stevie Richards wore an RSPW t-shirt doesn't mean it warrants an article on Wikipedia. In the discussion for Bleeding Was Only Half the Job, your argument (This is to TruthCrusader) was that even though Ron Jeremy has endorsed a project it doesn't mean that it is notable enough to be on Wikipedia. Applied to this topic, that argument would make your Stevie Richards claim not stand.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 22:10, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>yes but the difference is that "Bleeding was only half the job" was a vanity entry made by yourself, promoting a book being written by YOU that may or may not ever be written. Big difference. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 23:01, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether it was written by myself is not relevent as there is no Wikipedia policy saying an entry can't be written by the person who it is about. Personally, I think rspw deserves an entry on WP as it has played a significant role in the development of the IWC so I am voting <b>Keep</b>. That being said I think the current entry needs some work.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 01:04, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
