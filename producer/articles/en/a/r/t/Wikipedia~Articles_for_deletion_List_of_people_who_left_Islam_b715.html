(For example, lists can include redlinks while categories cannot. List entries can be annotated with, for example, the date and reason of conversion, whereas category entries cannot. Lists can be watchlisted to track additions and deletions, but categories cannot.) Note also that while some people may consider the lists for Islam and Christianity to be unmaintainable, the ones for Judaism and Hinduism certainly aren't. Those are not proselytizing religions, and as such the number of converts is, and will remain, very small. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 14:11, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep all</b>. It was rather unwise to nominate these pages for Deletion. Lists are another way of categorizing people. The link given above by Psychonaut <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> gives the advantages of keeping lists. Here you can categorize into different sections, tabulate information, provide pictures (like in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_converts_to_Christianity_a6c7.html" title="List of converts to Christianity">List of converts to Christianity</a>) and add additional features which you CANNOT do in Categories.</li>

<dd>On consideration I have an alternate proposal. Keep the lists, but we should delete the categories. The lists are dealing with a subject that may require some explanation, but categories can be added without expanation and affect the article. Putting <a href="../../../f/o/r/Category%7EFormer_Muslims_a937.html" title="Category:Former Muslims">Category:Former Muslims</a>, or anyone, can cause unnecessary problems to people that merely being on a list may not. This is because lists, ideally, require sources.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 16:16, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree: the Categories provide an easy way for all the different articles to be linked together. When a person clicks on a category, they can either see others in the same category, or seek more information on the separate Lists page, which will be/should be linked on the Category pages. These are all different ways of displaying information. If a person doesnt belong in a category, they can always debate that and I have observed they have.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 16:32, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think categories are necessarily the best way to keep this information, but I think these articles have another problem other than the category vs. list maintenanbility issue: they're inherently POV and difficult to verify. With that being the case, eventually, if the lists are deleted, perhaps the category should go next. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 16:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Great, so you're suggesting the Deletion of all categories and lists on Wikipedia which could inherently be POV. People come on Wikipedia and debate their POV and they frequently arrive at conclusions which are based on facts and so we arrive at a NPOV. As far as "List Maintenanbility" is concerned, that is true for ANY page, not just lists. ALL pages have to be maintained. Thats the responsibility of the editors. Thats what we are HERE for.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 16:47, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>While they may not be cited, their articles should mention it. And if they don't they don't they should be googled. A lack of references does not in practice does not mean the lists should be deleted.

<li><b>Strong keep all</b>: All of these articles include notable people who already have articles on Wikipedia. They function as a good research tool.

The prospective researcher easily could find subjects to examine further. The other lists work the same way. These lists are wholly viewpoint neutral, and they provide a valuable research resource. Also, replacing them with categories is <i>not</i> a good idea, because categories cannot be placed on a watchlist, but these lists can. The lists are very well-developed and fit Wikipedia's purposes very well. Please keep them. 65.28.2.218 18:42, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> - Its stupid to nominate so many pages at once. Its actually stupid. For Judaism and Hinduism, it would be easy to maintain, and a keep vote should be placed on Islam and Christianity for fairness as well.

<li>Not at all. These are all lists of people who went from one religion (or none at all) to another (or none at all), so they're all related. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:35, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I also find it interesting that you stated on my talk page that you "would have voted delete had [I] not been so adventurous (or crossed into the Hinduism line)." I see no reason to show such partiality to any one specific religion; it seems to me that either these lists all belong, or they all don't. Why do you feel Hinduism does not fit in with the others? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:04, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<i>Reply <b>- But the point is</b></i> <b>to <i>a religion. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_left_Islam_6892.html" title="List of people who left Islam">List of people who left Islam</a> is a</i></b> <i>left</i> list not a <b>to</b> list. Also verifiability, should be in the article, it doesnt have to be in the actual list. For example <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a> 's article cites he converted to Hinduism. Its redundant to cite the same link in the list. Just because it has to be policed doesnt mean it can fall victim to a deletionist crusade. The Hinduism comment was showing why I'm fighting for a strong keep, because it affects me more personally when my religionis up for deletion. I would have voted delete had the afd been only for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_left_Islam_6892.html" title="List of people who left Islam">List of people who left Islam</a>.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 21:07, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course it does, and I suspect that that, rather than the merits of the articles, is what will drive many of the keep votes. Nevertheless. I still don't see a difference between 'from' and 'to'... if George Harrison converts <i>to</i> Hinduism, is he not also converting <i>from</i> a previous belief? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:20, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Good point. If you read any of the lists you AFD'd you might see that each of those lists has a section "Fom ISlam", "From Buddhism", "From Christianity", "From Hinduism". The actual <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_left_Islam_6892.html" title="List of people who left Islam">List of people who left Islam</a> is therefore unneeded (and merits delete) but dragging the <b>to</b> lists into the <i>same AFD nom</i> messed up your case.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 21:30, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I wonder why only lists for Conversion/Apostasy are being targeted.

<ul>
<li>Because lists of converts/apostates are all related to each other. Lists of people by religion would not be suitable for inclusion in the same AfD in my opinion. Do not take my exclusion of those lists from this AfD as a statement that I feel those lists are or are not important; they simply are not relevant to this AfD as I see it. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:04, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per Psychonaut.

<li><b>Keep</b> - a) we have lots of categories <i>and</i> lists on the same topic; if that is your beef, start somewhere else; b) if we are going to have lists and categories of people by their religious affiliation, notable apostates and converts should be last on our list, so to speak. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 11:20, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
