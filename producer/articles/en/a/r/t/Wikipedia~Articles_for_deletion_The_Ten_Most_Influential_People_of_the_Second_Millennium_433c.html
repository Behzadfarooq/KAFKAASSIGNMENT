<li><b>Suggestion</b>: Why not hold a open for wikipedia users, list to nominate and vote for Top Ten Most influential people of the second millennium and we can then print a final page to show the results. This can be similar to how BFI does it, <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/index.html</a></li>
<li>Comment: Please do <b>not</b> refactor the list into "delete" and "keep" sections. The context of the comments and rebuttals is as important as the actual votes.

<li><b>Leave it alone</b> This is a very interesting entry and quite educational! Perhaps the better name would be "Schlesinger's Most Influential ..." so that to leave space for "UK Public's Most Influential ..." and "Time's Most Influential ...".

<ul>
<li>Why not? We would eventually have had printing without Gutenberg, but without Lincoln the USA might not have survived the South's secession. People like Newton and Darwin belong in the list not so much for their discoveries (we would have figured out gravity and natural selection without them) but because their entire body of work has a beauty of its own, much like Michelangelo's or Leonardo's. Frankly, I'm surprised Gutenberg is even mentioned. <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vincent</a> 06:17, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>(<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">...and frankly, I'm not surprised why nobody—except the loons—takes you seriously, Vincent...</a>) You cannot state with any degree of reasonable certainty that moveable type would have been invented without Gutenberg. Why? That's purely hypothetical and untestable, and lacks complete rational support much like your ideas that a) the U.S. required Lincoln and b) Lincoln and Darwin's birthday coincidence require mentioning. Apparently, you're just another Sam Spade cronie. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 07:19, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I say, your fondness for me would appear beyond measure, dear Adraeus. I'm not sure I've ever had a more vigorous enthusiast of my fine self. Please keep it up, if your hard work continues I should have more than enough "cronies" to shout down incivility and intellectual dishonesty whenever it rears its ugly head on the wiki. <s><b>Keep</b>, btw, titles don't have to be NPOV (altho I think the list is utter crap myself&#160;;) <a href="../../../e/x/a/User%7EExample_2365.html" title="User:Example"><i>Example</i></a> (<a href="../../../e/x/a/User_talk%7EExample_2c24.html" title="User talk:Example">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Example_b69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Example">contribs</a>) 14:30, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</s><small>(see my vote below)</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually, I did hear somewhere that other people were working on a printing press before Gutenberg's - there was just something special about his when it came out, or he was the first, or something. (He was the Discovery Channel's Man of the Milennium, if I remember correctly.) But I don't understand how Lincoln changed the world on such a scale as Gutenberg. He prevented an insurrection and gave a nice speech, but it was all just pertinent to this one country. Not to be a cynic. He's a great guy, but I don't think greater than Gutenberg. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELockeShocke_c870.html" title="User:LockeShocke">LockeShocke</a> 16:47, Jan 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> Arbitrary to say the least. Impossible to name all the flaws such a list would present in any case. For example, it only includes western personalities (being very incomplete and arbitrary even at that!). Also, perhaps national/regonal lists would be more appropriate, though I believe this sort of article could attract unwanted political discussion! livino 14:54, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I concur, now that it has been accurately titled (as World Almanac's Ten Most Influential People of the Second Millennium), it's a useful article. I find these lists are kind of fun and thought-provoking, because you can look at them and say "boy, they sure blew it when they listed X about Y, Y clearly was more important". Plus to which if you see someone you don't recognize, it's fun to look them up and see what they did that the lister rates so high. A pefect example is <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsai_Lun_f1a3.html" title="Tsai Lun">Tsai Lun</a>, often considered one of the half-dozen most important people of all time (and certainly more important than, say, Gutenberg) - I'd have never have known who he was unless I'd seen him in one of these lists. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 22:32, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. We have the list of The 100 greatest britons, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_TIME_Magazine%27s_100_most_influential_people_of_2004_1e3c.html" title="List of TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people of 2004">Time most infuential people of 2004</a>, even the <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Grootste_Nederlander_ee56.html" title="De Grootste Nederlander">greatest dutchmen of all time</a>. Why not have this one? And as for the arguments that the list is arbitrary, 1) thats not the point (what if you wanted to know which people the World Almanac named as the greatest?) and 2) all these lists are arbitrary (Copernicus, really, the ones that made a difference was Newton, Galileo and Kepler). As such, strong keep. <a href="../../../g/k/h/User%7EGkhan_3d68.html" title="User:Gkhan">Gkhan</a> 00:25, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - it has historical importance given the publication source and the millenial event it coincided with. World Almanac has been publishing since 1886 and has high market penetration.
