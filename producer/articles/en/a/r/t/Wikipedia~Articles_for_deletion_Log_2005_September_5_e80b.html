<li><b>Keep</b>. This has been deleted already, but I have reworked it to make more sense. If anyone is planning to "speedy" it on the mere record of its past deletions, I would urge them to look through it as it is now. If they still think it is not valid, I would prefer it be sent to the "Deleted Jokes" section. But, to be quite honest, I don't know anything about these other deletions. As far as I knew, it was a one-shot thing (till now)... Of course, they go to show that it has been considered more times, by more than a single person. I must also point out that, as a neologism, it opens the language to an entirely new species of individual. Whatever you might say of it, I still contest that it is a useful word. Scoff if you will; it can't be denied. Whoever sees it as nonsense, with its new material, can't have much more than sour prejudice against the article.

<li>It's not a neologism, the term being in widespread and frequent use for decades as shown by the source citations on the page.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas tree</a> is not "traditionally Christian." As far as I know, Christmas trees are not mentioned in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>. If I'm wrong, please provide a citation. Our article on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas trees</a> discusses this in detail and suggests that the practice either originated as a pagan custom, or as a nonreligious celebration originating in 18th-century Germany (which was objected to by at least one priest specifically as <i>not</i> being Christian).</li>
<li>Even if it were considered offensive, the appropriate remedy would not be to delete the article, but make sure the article is neutral, by providing proper, well-sourced material showing to whom it is considered offensive. The article <i>already addresses</i> the differences of opinions between Jews in some detail. I am not aware of any widespread objections by Christians, but if there are, please provide <i>properly sourced</i> commentary for inclusion in the article.</li>
<li>I don't see how <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> applies, because nothing the actions and procedures surrounding this article were disruptive to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The article was discussed in AfD very recently. In its present form, it received fourteen keep votes and no delete votes. (For some reason <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordain_c8a5.html" title="User:Jordain">Jordain</a> did not vote in the first AfD, even though it is clear he or she was aware of the article.) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:52, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It should not be moved to "Jewish Christmas tree" for the following reasons. Unlike <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah_bush.html" title="Hanukkah bush">Hanukkah bush</a>, "Jewish Christmas tree" <b>is</b> a neologism. This term is not used to any appreciable extent. Our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">naming conventions</a> call for the use of the most common term; this is "Hanukkah bush," not "Jewish Christmas tree."

<li>I know him mainly through a very influential introduction to Lisp. He's a researcher with a number of interesting projects, and I think we might put him relatively high on the scale of notability mainly because he has co-organized international workshops and conferences; for instance he was one of the organizers of ECOOP 2005 (European Conference on Object Oriented Programming) at Glasgow as well as delivering workshops and papers at that event. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:53, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article title is wrong, as it should be <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pascal_Costanza_884c.html" title="Pascal Costanza">Pascal Costanza</a>. I'm somewhat familiar with Costanza from reading his postings in c.l.l. and c.l.s., but I'm not convinced that it's accurate to characterize him as a <i>major</i> figure in the field of a certain programming language. Right off the top of my head I can think of two dozen or more lispers who are more much more notable. Although I love lisp and this is certainly not an attack on Costanza, I'm not sure that lispers that far down the totem pole are encyclopedically notable. Lisp is over 45 years old so it's harder to become notable for it now than it was for work in the 1960s through 1980s. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 09:45, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry, I can't find any verifiable evidence that this person is notable. The claims of "several full length feature films" <i>might</i> do the job, if they were actually released by a legitimate moviemaker, but they aren't named here, and IMDB can't find any sign of them.

<li>Maybe I should have said <i>notable</i> moviemaker.

<li>Always great to have a good article on legitimate targets, but, um, <i>this</i> article started life as a Geogre's Law failure (miniscule last name) and was personal spam/hoax.

<li>It is not a bus stop it is a bus station or terminus. There are two other Queen Street bus stations on Wiki already, as weel as countless others, including the entire system in Perth, Australia, which includes Park and Rides bus stops.

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Wikipedia is not paper" does not mean that useful, encyclopedic information can not be overwhelmed and diluted by the presence of unencyclopedic trivia.

<li>You haven't thought it through. There's the obvious dilution of "give me a random link" being more likely to return a useless stub on a dumb subject — like this one — but let's put that aside. Part of the value of an encyclopedia is in the selection and ordering of material, as well as the inclusion. Inclusion of a main article on a subject is an implicit assertion that the topic is notable. If Wikipedia becomes known as a place that asserts that random bus stations with no distinguishing characterics in Singapore are important main topics, then our credibility is diminished accordingly: we become known not as an encyclopedia, but as a garbage dump. This article is, essentially, the geographic equivalent of a dicdef. Unless there's some actual aspect of this bus station that is encyclopedic, let wikitravel or some other more appropriate site catalog it. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 16:28, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've clearly outlined why this is more than just "a bus terminal" - there are other entries for bus termini much less notable than this one - it follows logically that either we delete all of them, or we keep this article.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 00:35, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Then it's very obvious to me that pretty much all of them have to go. I don't see either guidelines nor common sense as good reasons to keep these articles around.

<dd>I've been very specific, no one of notability has asserted that Katrina was influenced in any way differently or more extreme than other recent tropical cyclones. To argue that point you keep providing externals to articles that say things like "Is the rash of powerful Atlantic storms in recent years a symptom of global warming?". There is no singling out of Katrina. The text is covered in Tropical cyclone, and I object to your claim that I am "determined that such allegations should not be documented" as I started the section in the Tropical cyclone article. I have strongly opposed duplicating the information elseware because the people who know what the heck they are talking about edit Tropical cyclone and make sure the text is accurate, while people who want to pump up excitement over conspiracy theories edit 'Alleged causes'. The text related to global warming that has spent most of its life on that article is embarassingly inaccurate. BD, I didn't start out intending to say anything rude at all to you, but since you continue to just simply repeat things which are untrue and you fail to respond to any of my points at all I must simply conclude that you are unable or unwilling to read. If you're going to worry about wikiquette, you could help me restart my assumption of good faith by not ignoring my talk page discussions requests. --<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.165.233.150.html" title="User:24.165.233.150">24.165.233.150</a> 19:23, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've now responded to your talk page statements. I've never suggested that anyone is claiming that Hurricane Katrina was affected by global warming in a way that other hurricanes wouldn't be. As you just pointed out yourself on the talk page, Katrina <i>is</i> "mentioned to hook readers" in articles about global warming - ergo, people (some of them notable) have, for whatever reason, invoked <i>this</i> hurricane in an effort to raise the issue of global warming. The point of the debate is not to "pump up excitement" over such theories, but simply a) to document that they exist, which is a notable sociological phenomenon, and b) to give them a place apart from the various Katrina-related articles in which they originally sprang up, and where they will spring up again if this article is deleted. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 19:49, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I'm confused by your position then. If you are not claiming that people say Katrina is special, what is wrong with directing readers to our coverage on <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_Cyclone_86bc.html" title="Tropical Cyclone">Tropical Cyclone</a>? We discuss all other weather related factors which are common to all such storms there already.

<dd>Ah, but Katrina <i>is</i> special, in that it is a particularly devastating hurricane, and therefore something of a magnet to which people have attached their ideas (just as 9/11 was no different from any other terrorist attack, except for its location and scale, and the Kennedy assassination was no different that any other shooting, except for who he was). I think we can agree that, had it been a category 2, or had it just fizzled out after brushing through Florida (and knocking down most of the trees in my yard), Time Magazine would not be writing articles with headlines like "<a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1099102,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1099102,00.html" rel="nofollow">Is Global Warming Fueling Katrina?</a>. Also, I think there a are a few particularly apocalyptic references by persons such as Ross Gelbspan (referenced below) who suggest that Katrina was <i>worse</i> than previous hurricanes because of global warming, and a sign that things are going to get worse still. The fact that some people will now believe these theories who would not have before the hurricane makes these specific allegations a notable point of discussion. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 21:15, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As the original (albeit somewhat reluctant) creator of this article, I must explain why it should be kept. Really, there are two pertinent questions raised by these theories: 1) are they notable enough to deserve inclusion in the encyclopedia?; and 2) if so, do we want them in the main articles addressing Hurricane Katrina, or its impact on society, politics, and the economy? I suggest that they are notable, in line with the three different 9/11 conspiracy articles (<a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_domestic_conspiracy_theory_f49c.html" title="9/11 domestic conspiracy theory">9/11 domestic conspiracy theory</a>, <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_claims_regarding_Jews_or_Israel_189b.html" title="9/11 conspiracy claims regarding Jews or Israel">9/11 conspiracy claims regarding Jews or Israel</a>), as this was an event on par with 9/11 in terms of the destruction wrought and the likely impact on society. Notable people (even if they are "fringe lunatics") have made assertions about the cause of the devastation, and each individual claim is likely to have a believing audience in excess of what we would require for, say, a disk jockey to be notable under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. These claims, therefore, will have a real impact on the world, whether it be to stir radical Islamic suicide bombers to action, or to stir a subset of American voters to desire changes in social or environmental policy. If there is no separate article, these theories <i>will</i> end up being housed in the main articles on the effects of the hurricane (where they were to be found before I removed them to their own space). That leads to the second question: if this information should be in Wikipedia, where should it be? Arguments have already been made for the inclusion of much of this material in the articles from which it originally came, but I draw the line here - if material that is clearly "fringe" is nevertheless notable enough to merit inclusion, it should have its own place apart from more mainstream discussions of this topic. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 20:14, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete and Comment</b> The word alleged implies speculation and the objective of Wikipedia is to be a source of knowledge not of irrational speculation. Is there a need to speculate on mindless reasons for the passing of this hurricane? Will we allow an alleged causes article on every event in history? Hurricanes are an act of nature, not a divine punishment. This kind of article detracts greatly from the credibility of Wikipedia. Senseless articles tarnish Wikipedia's objective image.

<li>I hate to be rude BD, but for a law student you've demonstrated a profound inability to read. We argued this before, and still not a single one of your citations is talking about Katrina specifically. For example look at the quote from the German minister: "these natural events". I'd agree that we could list global warming on the page if someone indeed claimed there was something special about the specific storm. But no one is, which is a good thing because the scientific community would rightly call for their head over such a claim. --<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.165.233.150.html" title="User:24.165.233.150">24.165.233.150</a> 23:39, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>We do provide one, it's answered quite clearly on tropical cyclone. In fact, the text which you've supported is misleading, and is loaded with weasel words to cover its factual inaccuracy. I do agree that the public has been, to an extent, mislead with respect to Global warming and Katrina... but we do them no service by repeating their misconceptions.

The opening line is "The Hurricane that struck Louisiana yesterday was nicknamed <b>Katrina</b> by the National Weather Service. Its real name is global warming," and which later states, "Although <b>Katrina</b> began as a relatively small hurricane that glanced off south Florida, it was supercharged with extraordinary intensity by the relatively blistering sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico."

<li>BD, I've read it... he also attributed every other major weather event in the last year (about eight events if I'm counting right) to the same cause. I don't argue if he's right or not, the point is that even he makes no claim that there is anything specific about Katrina.

<li>Well, let's be clear then - if your point is that no article has said that this hurricane and <i>only</i> this hurricane was affected by global warming, then you're right, none of them say that. However, the point of the discussion is that a number of people have cited global warming as an alleged cause of stronger storms <i>in the context</i> of discussing this hurricane. You would have to parse the referenced articles pretty narrowly to suggest that the respective commentators were <i>not</i> linking global warming to Hurricane Katrina at all. It's as though Big Bird said "A through Z are letters of the alphabet", and your reply was that he was not claiming "G" to be a letter of the alphabet because he did not specifically say that it was (or because even though he said "G" while reciting the alphabet, he said the same thing about the other letters). --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 04:11, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>So why aren't you importing all the other information on the formation of hurricants from <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_cyclone.html" title="Tropical cyclone">Tropical cyclone</a> into the causes article? Surely NOAA has mentioned all the standard effects and mechanisms in their reports before, during, and since this event. By your logic everything that has been mentioned which is also true about all others must be repeated. I might suggest you see how far you get with interting a description of how the eye wall works into <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 06:16, 6 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Irrelevant. You're disputing the actual causes of Hurricane Katrina, but this discussion is about "<i>alleged</i>" causes. Taking it out of the GW context may make it easier to understand - suppose Dr. Phil (who has a fairly large audience that believes the things he says are true) were to go on TV and say that the storm surge that broke the levee was actually caused by a meteorite that landed in the Gulf of Mexico right after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, and but for that meteorite, the storm surge alone would not have been enough to break the levee. Now, suppose that Dr. Phil also argues that scientists have been warning for years of the potentially devastating effect of a meteorite impact on the earth, and that the government could have develepod technology to protect us from meteorites. The actual science of meteorites hitting the earth is irrelevant to this discussion, because the discussion is about the influence of the claim. Dr. Phil's "followers" will change their behavior or their priorities based on the belief that a meteorite hit the Earth, and something could have been done about it (or could be done to prevent the next one). Now, the claim itself may or may not spur people to argue about the <i>actual</i> effect of meteorites hitting the Gulf, and proponents could bring up every other non-Katrina related meteorite alleged to have hit the Earth. But what makes it notable is that there is a belief shared by a significant number of people that this particular Hurricane reached its deadly apex because of a meteorite, and now perhaps we should change our policies because of it. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 13:29, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

The current title doesn't seem to bother me much, since the keyword "alleged" suggests that these causes are only proposals to explain the nature of the hurricane. I also cite the earlier arguments in regard to having articles on 9/11 theories and what not. Besides that, if people hundreds of years access this article (if this hurricance becomes a key event in the bubble-popping of America's supposed arrogance: <i>given that civil order and basic services in New Orleans were reduced to that of a war-torn third world country</i>), they should be able to read about every detail in relation to this event, including the wacko conspiracy theories that arised.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> or at least <b>Rename</b>. The only reasonably encyclopedic claim here is the global warming one, and that's covered elsewhere. The "divine retribution" stuff isn't being stated by anyone truly notable, so it shouldn't be here. You'll ALWAYS have zealots saying that a catastrophe of any magnitude is divine retribution. There's no "Claims of Alleged Divine Retribution of the Kennedy Curse" section, but if you scour the web enough I'm sure you'll find some lunatic website claiming it's God's way of punishing the family. At the very LEAST this should be renamed. Global warming can at least be considered alleged, but not divine retribution. An allegation is defined right here on wikipedia as a statement of fact by a party in a pleading, which he or she expects to prove. People claiming that this is "divine retribution" aren't expecting to prove their statement is true at all, anymore than they try to legitimately prove existence of God, Satan and Heaven - hence the term <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a>. jcomp489</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. My guess is that 40% of Europeans, 60% of Americans, and 80% of people in the Middle East believe that an omnipotent, all-knowing god either made, or let Katrina happen. And these people aren't talking about rain on their wedding day, or natural disasters in general - they are talking specifically about 'entity Katrina', that has no relation to the science of weather-related phenomena. Why would Wikipedia care what those people think? Beliefs are important in themselves, irregardless of what the reality of a situation is. Maybe even more important. They shape the future of humankind, as beliefs always have, whether they're religious, philosophical, based in science, or whatever. Even the most hardcore materialistic determinists that edit Wikipedia should realize that. Another reason to keep the article is that when fanatics of different denominations read/edit the article they will (hopefully) be exposed to a sober, enlightened atmosphere, where they can't help to read that their opinions are (very) similar to the opinions of 'those crazy' Jews/Christians/Muslims/etc. --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsaddik_Dervish_c96b.html" title="User:Tsaddik Dervish">Tsaddik Dervish</a> 05:54, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reluctant keep</b> and possible <b>rename</b>. It's my personal POV that the theories outlined in this article are bullshit.

<li>Admiral Roo, I just don't see where <b>keep</b> votes are "so far outweighed." Right now, the opposing views are separated by 5 votes out of over 60 votes cast, yielding about 46% to keep and 54% to delete. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> notes that "consensus is interpreted as something closer to supermajority" in general and suggests "two-thirds or larger majority support for Wikipedia:Articles for deletion" in particular. Quite frankly, this is one of those issues where there are strong feelings on both sides, and where it may just be impossible to <i>ever</i> reach a consensus. There votes cast include 5 <i>strong/speedy keep</i> votes (and I was not even one of those), an equal number of <i>strong/speedy delete</i> votes, a smattering of <i>weak keep</i> and <i>weak delete</i> votes, and no fewer than four voters who have changed course, in different directions no less. I think a number of people have hit on the best basic formula to deal with this: keep for a few months, until the current surge of interest in these theories has ebbed, then quietly trim them down, move them to a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theories_%28a_collection%29.html" title="Conspiracy theories (a collection)">more general conspiracy theories page</a>, and make a redirect. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a></li>

<li>The simple fact is: These issues are valid, existing references surrounding this event. While they are 'conspiracy' based, it is a valid reference to sociology and psychological states of a section of the US population. An open information based encyclopedia such as this is used by researchers of all types. Why remove information simply because it might not 'jive' with what you would want it to. I can certainly see the worth articles such as this have in providing research and insignt into the state of affairs from social to mental in this day and age.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article does a great job in illustrating the range of people's reactions to the event, and also demonstrates just how devoted to their religious/political beliefs people can be.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Human wackiness is interesting in and of itself, at least to some people. To argue that the article should be deleted because it is "not encyclopediac" sounds like a tautology. I think that at least some of those taking that position may be confusing an article about the wackiness with an endorsement of the wackiness as being factually correct. At its heart, that viewpoint is akin to saying we shouldn't have articles on Nazi Germany because the Nazis were bad people and their views were clearly wrong, or we shouldn't have articles on abortion or creationism because (one half or the other of) the participants in the debate are clearly wrong. (And yes, I recognize that there are distinctions that can be drawn between those cases and this one, but I don't think those distinctions change the basic fact that some of the "delete" crowd are engaging in the same sort of magical thinking -- if we delete all mention of the evil content from Wikipedia we can delete it from the world -- that motivates those who would like to purge articles on things like Nazis and abortion). -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 17:44, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm, I ran into you (65.241.103.49) earlier today in another VfD, where you were <i>supporting</i> an article about a patently nonsensical "theory" due to another (?) German engineer. If by "legitimate physicist", you mean that Sarfatti did earn a Ph.D./ in physics, as a matter of fact, you are right about that. If you mean he is worth paying attention to, I disagree. (I know noone who actually <i>reads</i> his incomprehensible Usenet posts. As someone who knows the jargon, I claim they are incomprehensible because JS doesn't make sense, not because physics is hard.)---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 19:28, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I note that several of the people above who vote for deletion have done so making personal attacks on Sarfatti as a "troll", a "hoaxter", a "kook" a "quack" etc. Does this not violate Wikepedia rules? Why the obvious double standard.</dd>

<dd>Sarfatti wrote: "Caveat: This glimmer of "RV" advanced action-at-a-distance FROM the future from Dick Bierman's "presponse" signal nonlocality violating linear entangled unitary quantum non-mechanics of lifeless closed systems is still half-baked "speculative" with low decoding signal-to-noise ratio and is in danger of being not even wrong. Proceed at your own risk. Nevertheless we must oppose the Victorian Station Masters who prematurely censor what may prove to be ideas of vast importance. Talking about an idea does not mean that one professes that the idea is true - only that it might be of some utility as it matures." <i>woodymarble@mac.com</i></dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Jack Sarfatti is not a physicist (at least not a notable/significant one as claimed by the article).

<dd>Indeed whoever wrote that Sarfatti never published is wrong, whether deliberate misinformation or not I don't know. Sarfatti has been involved in deep cover intelligence operations since 1973 or so when he virtually disappeared from conventional academia. For the record Sarfatti wrote an important paper with A.M. Stoneham "The Goldstone Theorem and the Jahn-Teller Effect" (1967) that is cited in the American Institute of Physics "Resource Letter on Symmetry in Physics". Ray Chiao credits Sarfatti's Phys Lett A paper on self-trapped laser filaments as analog to Type II superconductor magnetic vortices as stimulating his experimental work on the phenomenon. Sarfatti predicted the recently observed "supersolid" in a paper published before Antony Leggett's. This will be confirmed by George Chapline, Jr at LLL. Leonard Susskind of Stanford will confirm Sarfatti's essential role in Susskind's first published paper on quantum phase operators at Cornell in 1963-4. Sarfatti is in several TV shows and is in Paramount's Star Trek IV DVD on "Time Travel: The Art of the Possible." Sarfatti is an informal consultant to the new National Intelligence Directorate MASINT. [Comment by anonymous user, possibly woodymarble@mac.com]</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Abstain</b></s>. I agree with several comments above:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>DS is correct: Sarfatti is well known in some UseNet physics.* newsgroups as a frequent poster, who rarely if ever replies to criticism in the groups (except by email threats to file suit for defamation of character-- in the interests of full disclosure I should say that I have been the recipient of at least one such threat). Most would call his behavior <i>cranky</i>, but he is not a "troll", since his aim is apparently to promote his "ideas", rather than to foment flame wars and such like. Anyway, on this basis, he is perhaps notable, although not in a very laudable fashion.</li>
<li>OTH, I agree with JIP that the present version of the article is patent nonsense. (Lumidek, you can't be serious--- this article "contains what everyone wants to know"?!) The problem seems to be that JS reacts very badly to what most would consider an NPOV characterization of his writings as incoherent and highly dubious. Is there any way to rewrite the article to remove the nonsense and express what I just said as nicely as possible, cite a few of Sarfatti's published papers and link to his website, and then <i>lock the content</i>? If not, I'd have to change my vote to <b>delete</b>.</li>
<li>Let me call attention to the possibility that several anonymous commentators are socks of the same user (perhaps JS himself). Jack, if that is indeed you, we appreciate your financial support of Wipedia, but you <i>do</i> tend to be very excitable and sometimes your behavior is <i>in my opinion</i> inappropriate. If you attempted to delete someone else's "delete" vote above, or if you are trying to vote here under multiple names, these would be examples of clearly inappropriate behavior. I think you recognize that your ideas are not mainstream, so in my opinion the place to try to sell them is in published papers, or barring that on your website, not here. Also, contrary to what one anon said above, it appears to me that the non-anons are pretty much of one mind about the dubious stature of Sarfatti's "ideas".---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 19:50, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>As per several user's suggestions above, I just rewrote the article to be more NPOV. Sarfatti fans, please keep your cool! I think a good compromise is to say right away that most who have encountered JS's writings consider them cranky, but I balance that by stating second that he <i>does</i> have a genuine background in physics. I took some basic biographical infro from his own website, made a list of claims from the previous version of the biography, (plus one from one of his books), and cited his entry in crank.dot.net but also some of his own websites. I think that's NPOV and I propose that an admin now lock the contents, at least until this VfD is over.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 20:43, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Keep</b> After completely rewriting the article myself, and reading some minor improvements by Chan Ho and Apyule (thanks!), I am changing my vote, since the current version of the biography appears to be sufficiently NPOV and we three seem to agree that a sufficiently prolific UseNet poster is perhaps notable simply on the grounds of being so prolific that many newsgroup readers will have encountered his posts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One comment: I am suspicious of Chan Ho's claim that Wikipedia's coverage should be different from that of a paper encyclopedia (at least without knowing more about what kind of differences he has in mind), but I have to agree that I can envision the possibility that some newbie might encounter a Sarfatti posting, notice all the impressive buzzwords combined in apparent gibberish, wonder "is it just me?", and search Wikipedia to find out something about Sarfatti.</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. Just because one doesn't agree with him or regards him as "unworthy" somehow of a Wikipedia article does not negate the fact that he is well known in certain Internet communities, such as Usenet.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>.

<li>Slight typographical error on my part.</li>
<li>As you can see, if you do a search for Shawn Werner at poetry.com you will find a half dozen of his works. This poet should deffinately not be deleted from the wiki database and deserves to be recognized. That's my case, in a nutshell.

<li>Tinsley79, you can easily "sign" and date your comments here by putting four tildes (~~~~) at the end of your message.

<li><b>Comment</b>, when I first saw this I didn't believe it but when checking up with Google I still didn't believe it, however the name of Galnafanaigh does seem to link to a Scottish village which does in fact have a Duck festival for some odd reason. My guess is that this village is so isolated that there isn't enough information about it. The author of this article is probably the only person from the village who's connected to the net. But I do agree there is not enough backup information or source material to allow this article to remain. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 01:06, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How big does a company have to be to be included into wikipedia? It seems pretty clear to me that your rules for advertisement/spam are neither upheld nor clearly defined; several of the companies listed in WP do not have anything else than $$$ on their agenda, and they are allowed to advertise through WP. So, the question is then on the size of the company, but is this the number of employees, or the revenue? If the focus is on the revenue, is the cost of living calculated into the equation? A firm in Ghana of 200 employees, will probably not have anywhere near the revenue of a company in Norway, such as FreeCode.... And one more thing; What are <i>your</i> personal criteria for keeping a listing in WP?&#160;:) --guStaVo ZaeRa 13:23, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Both cities are in Fukuoka prefecture, and the former is the prefectural capital, but residents of both do not use or refer to this concept of "Fukuoka-Kitakyushu", which is a misleading one. Also the second statement: "It probably takes up about 1000 to 2000 km2 (400 to 750 sq. mi.) of urban and ex-urban land. " is very vague indeed. So I propose this article be deleted.

<li>Am I allowed to vote if I am not logged in? If so I vote to <b>Keep</b>. The article may not be particularly well-written, but it describes an important cultural creation of the early 21st century. Mars exploration is hugely ambitious and historic, and I think we should allow its explorers the recognition of recording the cultural icons of its explorers.

<li>PLEASE DO NOT DELETE. The existance of the term Great Galatic Ghoul was coined by John Casani of the Jet Propulsion Labatory in Pasadena, CA upon attempting to communicate to a reporter that developing successful space probes and missions was difficult. The reporter demanded a reason for failed space flights that he (in his simple mind) could comprehend. In frustriation John Casani told him perhaps there was a Great Galactic Ghoul at Mars that simple devoured spacecraft. The term Great Galactic Ghoul subsequently appeared in a prominent newspaper article. John Casani has been routinely reminded of this comment by his friends since that date. John Casani retired from JPL but was recalled to take charge of the PROMETHEUS mission. J. F. Skipper (JPL)

<dd>It's worth noting that Random House has had a Wikipedia article for some time. Although Random is a full dorm at MIT, it has less residents than does Burton Third. Though the Burton Third article is obviously a stub and lacking in what would be the depth needed to show why it is a legitimate entry, it should stay so that it can be added to. Then the unique history of this community dating back almost 50 years at one of the most prestigious universities in the world can be available for reading and appension.</dd>
<dd>Whoever has said that dorms are not inherently notable has obviously never spent time around MIT. Our dorms are world renowned (yes, I'm serious) for their unique character and rich history. Burton Third is among the top tier of that group of famous dorms. Therefore, I believe it deserves a proper recognition.</dd>
<dd>This article should stay because Burton Third is unique, not only within Burton Conner but also throughout MIT. Things that are unique at MIT, whether they be positive or negative, always end up being acknowledged, and better Burton Third than the 10 year old milk in Random House. (don't get me wrong, that's impressive)</dd>

<li>I was abslolutely shocked that this was ALL the Wiki had on Sizer. I recommend: remove the contact information, and regard this as a stub to be expanded. Theodore ("Ted") Sizer is known to practically all knowledgeable educators for his 1984 "Horace's Compromise," and has been churning out books since then. And although he's relatively unread outside of education circles, this doesn't have to be the case; his writing is engaging and readable enough for anyone, unlike much of the educational philosophy writing. In fact, anyone with a vested interest in schooling--including anyone who has a child in school or went to school themself--ought to read "Horace's Compromise." --Andrew Bonner (unsigned by 65.87.180.216 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.87.180.216_adc3.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.87.180.216">contribs</a>))</li>

<li><b>Keep and rename, and remove stereotypical concepts.</b> Originally I created this list as an anonymous user, and I intended it to be (or: I deemed it most useful as) a collection of interesting terms which are in and of itself completely <i>unrelated</i> to gayness, like "light blue" in Russian and "warm" in Hungarian. I don't welcome the different variants of "effeminate gay male" and "sodomite" etc. here (unless they have a really special history, like Hungarian <i>buzi</i> from <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogomil.html" title="Bogomil">Bogomil</a> heretics), since they only reflect common stereotypes. The goal of this list was to collect interesting, unusual, unexpected terms, not commonplaces (especially not abusive ones). – If you agree, this idea could be made explicit in a brief and concise note at the beginning of the article and the irrelevant terms could be removed. That's what could differentiate this list from sexual slurs, and that's why they should <i>not</i> be merged, in my opinion. -- <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClosetedOne_3bfa.html" title="User:ClosetedOne">ClosetedOne</a> 00:53, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">Travis'</a> own profile states that he plays with the delete button. It is my opinion that he abuses some self-perceived authority in contrast with <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>. Furthermore, the article was neither an advertisement nor SPAM. It is merely an article about the history of a website. The original author is well known within the community of Howard Stern-related bulletin boards. Simply because the site is one month old doesn't mean the article about the history has no merit or validity. If you want to argue relevance, there are many articles, some that FCYTravis edits and supports, that have no merit or validity to me. If you want to argue "vanity," certainly under semantics anyone who posts an article here does so for vain reasons. The first person to post about the 7/7 London Bombings probably felt good having "broke" the story on Wikipedia. For FCYTravis to use "vandalism" as a cause for deletion is a petty and weak argument. Some, like myself, could view abuse of access as a form of vandalism. STFI Alumni 20:06, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Though it's absolutely fanscinating that there is a character called Hi-Tech in TMNT, I doubt think it's worth having an article to say that. Since he's apparently from the older series, and at the very least *I've* never heard of him (or her, I guess - it doesn't make that clear either), I don't think it's likely that any more info is going to become apparent any time soon. -- <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupermorff_0984.html" title="User:Supermorff">Supermorff</a> 19:48, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I merged the content of this article into <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism_4df0.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monsterism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</a> because it wasn't really notable enough for an article of its own. That content was cut down to almost nothing in that article because it wasn't considered notable enough even for that. To use that as justification to resurrect this article isn't an accurate view of what happened. The only notable thing about it is a very brief mention as an aside in the New York Times; it therefore deserves mention as an aside in the FSM article, which it now has. This isn't Uncyclopaedia.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Even though I agree that the article is not all that "notable." But the Wikipedia is a compendium of knowledge that should include what some may want to know even though most would find it "not notable." Indeed, arguably, most information in an encyclopedia would be deemed not notable by most people.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't have created this page if its "mention as an aside in the FSM article"---which I agree is all that is needed (or "justified")---hadn't disappeared. For this reason, merger with fsm doesn't work because of the volatility of the fsm page. E.g., if someone reading the NY Times article (or after hearing about it from some other newspaper or blog) went to Wikipedia to find out what SPAM is, they would be redirected to fsm where there was no mention of SPAM. (This is also why a redirect won't work.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I changed the fsm page to mention spam again, but that won't necessarily last. The solution is to have very brief articles such as this SPAM article that can stand alone and not be affected by changes on other pages. What's wrong with such a short article/note? Wikipedia is not like a paper encyclopedia where space is limited. While not an important article, it would never be seen by someone who is not specifically interested. It would not fill some volume taking space on some bookshelf. If someone wanted to learn about "spaghetti," for example, they wouldn't have to pick up an unwieldy volume weighed down with articles like spam, i.e., if not interested in this specific topic, users of the Wikipedia will never be aware of its existence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I don't think every word ever written should end up in the Wikipedia, this is information that people are actively seeking today. The NY Times article/column has been reprinted verbatim in newspapers all over the world, not to mention innumerable blogs. To be able to find out more and at least be directed to external sources for further information, isn't that the function of an encyclopedia?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Goodness me. Wikipedia is not a junkyard for collecting every piece of information floating about the place. Given the reason for keeping FSM (it was used to bully an education board), I'm not even persuaded of the case for the merge, but there we are. Since it wasn't a merge in the GFDL-retaining-redirect sense, we should just remove this page. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 23:39, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what the principle is that you are espousing: "the reason for keeping FSM [is because] it was used to bully an education board." Apparently, the fact that it was used to ridicule a school board makes it eligible for inclusion? The VAST majority of people who show interest in FSM---especially those who edit it and develop other parodies and have developed the uncyclopedia article---are in it for the humor/entertainment. Is that legitimate enough to warrant its inclusion in Wikipedia? If not, why not? Comic cultural elements are surely of legitimate interest to many. The issue for an encyclopedia surely is "what information may people be interested in seeking?" Not "what do you or I find to be junk or worthy." Indeed, short articles like this would help to prevent what your user page indicates that you are concerned about, i.e., people putting stuff in articles that doesn't really belong there and weakening the credibility of wikipedia. Short pieces like this one will not be seen by someone stopping in a "wikishop" looking for something else and will thus cut down on the feeling that extraneous information has been shoved into an article. Again, why shouldn't people be able to find out about something they are interested in, especially if making the info available does NOT clutter up other articles? -Kriegman</dd>

<li>Where to start - you can detail exactly what makes this article so unencyclopedic, where you see POV, how links within the article are "advertising" (I only see two direct links, which are topical and used for comparative purposes; other non-hyper-links are within a verbatim quotation which is also topical) and any other arguments you may have please.
