<li><b>Delete.</b> Somehow simply putting the word "list" in front of an article seems to make our normal standards vanish. Where to begin: is this simply meant to be a list of <i>every</i> shock site? If so, delete per Not as above. Since there don't appear to be any standards applied to the external links, delete per NOT a linkfarm. While I suppose that there is some micro-micro stub of a list under there that could be meet WP:NPOV and WP:CITE, it would probably be better served as a category. This will almost certainly prove impossible to maintain, impossible to verify, and what's the encyclopedic aim in this list anyway?

<li>While I would be hesitant to vote keep, which does seem to be the lean of the community, and while I would much rather redirect to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_Site_180a.html" title="Shock Site">Shock Site</a>, I am compelled to be the recent cleanup of the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Opera_8dd5.html" title="Rock Opera">Rock Opera</a> page. The example list was rediculously bloated, the resulting cleanup proved beneficial. So my vote is <b>Keep</b> as <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_Site_180a.html" title="Shock Site">Shock Site</a> will eventually become so bloated as to merit a list. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragoonmac_a999.html" title="User:Dragoonmac">Dragoonmac</a> 01:26, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
