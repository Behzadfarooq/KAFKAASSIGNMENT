<p>As this weekend is, in fact, Monnett Weekend, this seems a strangely appropriate time to list this on VfD. Monnett Weekend is in no way notable. It is a minor event at a small liberal arts institution, namely Ohio Wesleyan University. It is essentially little more than a parents weekend with few events of any note. To say this is a major annual event in Delaware is a gross overstatement, as the town itself is really not involved at all. There are no fairs or festivals or exhibitions and no concerts or plays or other events put on by any group not a part of the university itself. I base this on four years of attendance at said university and continued contact as an alum. This should be deleted. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:45, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Not certain about this idea - it sounds attractive but it may not be pravticle. The topic is a bit too complex to be as a sub-topic under Linux - especially as it would also be advantageous to refer to other unixlike operating systems. It would also mean the same data would then have to be repeated for each of the other Uinxlike operating systems of which there are around 70. That would lead to undecessary duplication. I would prefer to suggest the strategy of placing a cross reference into articles for the other UnixLike and provinding a short sub-sub paragraph into Linux Tablet stating for each distribution how Tablet PC's implemenatation differs for that OS from the Linux implementation. What do you think to this strategy? Vizion</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the author of the original article and it was posted as a stub in the expectation that others would contribute to it and that I would add more material as itbecame available and I had the time to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>My view is that the topic deserves an article on its own account because it brings under one heading so many different fragments of specialized knowledge which in combination contribute to an understanding of a Linux (or any other **ix distribution)Tablet and how to build and operate one. I have already identified over 20 sub-topics which need to be referenced and indexed within the main body of the article.</p>
<p>The interface requirements of a Tablet is entirely different from of any other computer type. This produces particular problems for software and the OS under Linux/Unix(especially on boot up/login) and an understanding of the hardware/OS interface. I see this stub article providing a reference for all the data about the OS/software/hardware and specialist applications which can be provided using this tool.</p>
<p>I also envisage the article encompassing the data for other **ix like distributions supporting the Tablet PC under one title. That may justify a change in the title of the article and I would be keen to hear any suggestions. What I had in mind doing was to create a sub topic which gave modifications necessary to the data in the main article to build and operate Tablets under other **ix OS distributions.</p>
<p>Iwould agree that my first draft was a bit idiosyncratic and too personal in nature. I was expecting to get some pretty good constructive editing and contributions from others and had collated material ready for carrying out some editing which would have addressed that deficiency. I went back to edit the article and was astonished to find that it had been deleted (I no longer have a copy) within such a short time of the original draft being posted.</p>
<p>If I had realized that the would have been a risk of deletion before an opportunity had arisen to mature the first draft I might have held off from posting at the early stage. I feel it is not inappropriate to ask that the article be undeleted so Ican have an opportunity to receive helpful comments and criticisms, carried out further editing and provide an opportunity to incorporate the benefit of contributions from others.</p>

<dd>Yes, you can still edit the article. The Votes for deletion is kept separate (the only change it makes to the article is to add a box on the top, which should be kept if you change the article — it will be removed when the Votes for deletion on it is closed). In fact, the removal of most of the content of the article was an edit made by someone else <i>after</i> the VfD notice was added, and would probably happen even without it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia isn't a howto archive, and that seems like what you are trying to do. I think if you want to make an encyclopedia type article great, but it simply sounds like you are trying to make a howto. Now I think that the section on Linux in the Tablet PC article needs expanding, I think thats the best place for it, unless it gets too large, than you can branch it out. I would prefer one long article on Tablet PCs in general then one short article on the hardware, another short one on Windows Tablet PC Edition, and another short one on Linux Tablet PCs. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 14:21, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Sorry if you gained an impression from the early draft that this is intended to be a "how-to". That is not the intention as you will see as the article progresses. It is intended to be a collation of all the knowledge and references about Linux Tablet (note the article's definition of OS (Linux and Unixlike) including data about design challenges with references to design solutions. I do not want to make this a sub of the Linux article because the concentration is on the wider Unixlike needs.(I also want to avoid internecine editing wars with virulent advocates of the different Unixlike OSs). I also do not want to get involved in the spats between microsoft/apple/unix devotees which will plague us if the article is a sub of the Tablet PC. This article extends beyond the purview of The Tablet as an instrument andvextends into the areas of OS and application design. The other thing you mightbwant to take into account is that this is planned as a substantial article. I have already garnered s lot of material to be be include once the basic structure is in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>You mightbwant to consider that I am making links to other Wiki articles as I go to make cross-references where appropriate. So to start under one heading and change later would create unnecessary work. I hope to persuade you to support me on keeping this article as is and thank you. Vizion</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Based on the current edit it can either turn into a term paper or a howto, both of those would be out of place in Wikipedia. I feel that it would benefit wikipedia more if you started your article as a section of the Tablet PC article, and only seperated out if your article starts to get too long. Until your article demostrates other wise my vote is delete and merge as posted above. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 18:08, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please see the latest edit - I have made it clear that it is not a How-To. What do you mean by a term paper?</p>
<p>I am not familiar with that. Is that a word with a wiki specific meaning or is it an american word with a meaning unknown to me (I am a Brit)? I do remain strongly opposed to placing it under the Tablet PC article. I have a lot of experience of the difficulties which arise when Unixlike operating systems are discussed in the same space alongside microsoft and apple communities, especially as the agendas would, in thebcontext of this article, be entirely different. The politics get too fierce for my taste! The other thing is the structure of the Tablet PC does not facilitate the objectives of this article and I really do not believe it can be made to work. Vizion</p>
<dl>
<dd>A term paper, jeez hard to describe, I have written way too many of them when I was in college. Anyways your objectives of the article, don't seem to line up with the objectives of wikipedia, which "surveys existing human knowledge," this article would require quite a bit of original research to complete. A perfect Linux tablet PC article would include a description, short analysis of current Linux Tablet OSs, short comings of those OSs, and links to sites with howtos. Unfortunately that wouldn't be long enough to merit it's own article, when the current Tablet PC article can easily edited to accommodate it IMO. Note this is no way official, but the opinion of myself. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 18:55, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am inclined to ask whether you are jumping to conclusions. First the article will bemuch more substantial than commentators here seem to assume. Maybe that is because I have been researching this topic for some time and it is extremely complex. I am not willing to provide surface treatment of the subject. The structure of an article dealing with Tablet PCs on Win XP would have to be entirely different than one on UnixLike systems. Then there would be justifiable criticism that one was writing beyond the subject topic-- the article I am writing goes well beyond that limited title!</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> However, you seem to think that an article on Linux powered Tablets would actually be different enough.</dd>
<dd>At this very moment I am using BeOS 5.03 on a HP Compaq tc1100 tablet. I installed via a DOS network boot and a hard disk image file - took under an hour. All the hardware works (except page flip chip). Its bascially indistinguishable from using the tc1100 under Windows, except for the fact that I have a Tracker in the top right hand corner and no Windows systray. Linux is much the same. There is little that can be written about Linux, or any other OS, on Tablet PC's without devolving into a howto. <a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 19:20, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just an aside the compaq tc 1100 is really a dual mode portable as it has a convential keyboard which is detachable. This places it in one of the genre of portable systems distinct from the "pure" Tablet. The Tc1100 shares many attributes with Laptop/Tablet but is perhaps best defined as a Tablet/laptop convertable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The interesting is that each genre, has its own fascinating distinctions and potentials. For example it is much easier to install/repair an OS onto a Tablet with a detachable physical keyboard which is generally or frequently used in a location with access to a network than it is onto, for example, a rugged Tablet with no keyboard on board a small ship (where physical keyboards are also impracticable and get damaged) or in all terrain vehicle in the desert which never has access to a network. These systems need an OS which is standalone installable and repairable. Most Tablets in use are applied as a simple alternative to a conventional laptop. The limited vision implicit in the use of does not define what can be written about the Tablet. I hope this helps.</p>

<p><b>Question?</b> Please tell me where the Linux Tablet falls into one of the categories identified in What Wikipedia is not-- as far as I can see it does not do so. If you can show me where it does then I will edit accordingly.. Vizion</p>
<p>Comment: I think you have all created an opportunity for me to identify WHY the encyclopaedic knowledge brought together in this article is required. At this point in time there seems to be a general assumption is that the Tablet PC is defined by reference to a Microsoft instance (see Kiands comment - he compares his Tablet as says it does whatever Microsoft can do -- (it could be argued, outside of an encyclopeadic article, that Microsoft's Tablet Edition does not begin to test the Tablet potential possibly because of the limits placed by the privacy of its Operating System source code). In fact the limitations on Tablet potential may be arguably defined by the Microsoft instance and by the public lack of encyclopeadic information about the Tablet. Now that is not an argument which I would dream of including in a Wiki but because there is no publicly accessible source of enclopaedic knowlege about the Tablet the Tablet is in default defined by Microsoft. It might be argued Microsoft would like to keep it that way by retaining their encycopaedic knowledge of the topic in their private domain. I freely acknowledge that I am a newbie in the Wiki world but why do you guys not let something mature a bit before trying to delete it,or, in the alternative, make some constructive suggestions so the article can meet essential requirements? In the current context I cannot help but feel a decision to delete this article would amount to censorship in Microsoft's interest. At thensame time even though I assume this is not personal, and the comments have been made in good faith, it is hard to resist the feeling of being jumped on before time and of exclusion.</p>
<p>Vizion <b>REWRITTEN:</b> The article is being rewritten and I suggest it be revisited. The suggestion the article is a How-to isva false assumption --I cannot but repeat what is said in the article. <b>This is not a How-to article</b> Vizion</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>: I've tried to clean up the style, though it could still use some work. Even so, I still vote for deletion. I can't help but notice that despite the article being fairly long, it doesn't really contain any information. I or someone else can continue to work on the style, but until there's useful information, can we justify keeping this article? If there really is anything useful in this article that I'm overlooking, maybe it should be merged with <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tablet_PC_7bf2.html" title="Tablet PC">Tablet PC</a>. I still don't see the need in a Linux-Specific Tablet PC article, especially until there's a larger body of information. I'd recommend a sub-section on the Tablet PC page, and if it grows large enough, then it could be moved into its own article. So far, there's just a page and a half of empty headings. That does not constitute an article. <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpark_3481.html" title="User:Dpark">Dpark</a> 23:24, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>: I think I've pretty much exhausted what I can/am willing to do for the style. Looking through the article, I found that the following things qualify as useful and original content: The intro sentence. That's pretty much it (and I added that). The rest is either already in other articles (the definitions, basic info on the touch-panel), qualifies as how-to (how to install using a usb keyboard versus custom software), or as "what should be here" (About this Article, everything under the subheadings). The usefulness of the intro sentence is pretty much up for debate, too, since it depends on the importance of the term (which I'd rate as pretty low). I still say delete. There's not really anything here to even merge into <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tablet_PC_7bf2.html" title="Tablet PC">Tablet PC</a>.

<li><b>No vote</b> as yet. Site itself boasts that the forums have 107,220 members, but it has an Alexa ranking of 49,546. Have there been precendents set for Web forums based on number of members? I think there have, but I can't find them. Normally, I'd vote delete on something like this and say "Wikipedia is not a website directory," but despite the Alexa ranking, this might be somewhat significant. (BTW, does anyone else find <i>some forums are "Christian Only" as defined by the administrators</i> a tad creepy?) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 03:58, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Regarding forum membership precedents, we seem to often vote to delete forums with an obviously small number of members, but on the other hand the opposite doesn't seem to be true: i.e. that forums with membership above a certain number should be kept. This makes sense, because obviously it's very easy to lie about membership numbers, and even "truthful" member counts almost always include inactive accounts, banned users, sockpuppets, bots, etc. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:45, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Complete</b> This article isn't encyclopaedic, it's barely even well-typed. While I'm not sure whether or not this deserves a wiki entry, if it does, it needs a complete entry. Currently, it is just a vanity page for a website. Our comments on what to do with this contain more info than the actual posting. --TheAdversary 06:49, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> pretty awful substub, reads more like an ad or web guide entry than an encyclopedia article. While the Alexa rank of 50,000 is higher than a lot of the websites we VFD, it certainly isn't so incredibly high that the article should be kept on that basis alone. Maybe someday somebody could write a decent article on this topic, but this isn't it (or even a good start for it). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:49, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A "no-hit wonder" and a zero-hit wonder are different things. A no-hit is a band that plays all right, but never made it to the charts, likely something popular in a specific genre of music, but without enough mainstream backing to crack the charts. A "Zero-Hit Wonder" sounds like someone's ploy to make it onto wikipedia with an article. Similar enough to make it, but not actually a real or useful article. --TheAdversary 06:17, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Øystein Runde has written Norways first and only superhero comic, Bjartmann,</li>
</ul>
<p>and he also recived the most money from the norwegian comic foundation last year. Norway is a strong nation when it comes to cartoon/comics and I think a couple more should be included, not excluded. Being involved with Kristopher Schau is not a reason in itself, however.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm responsible for this entry. Kristopher Schau, the Norwegian muscician and artist has an entry in the English Wikipedia. Upon seeing that, I thought it useful to supplement this article with the fact that he also is the author of a quite controversial comic. Namely, Margarin. Øystein Runde, the illustrator of this comic, is an up-and-coming cartoonist in Norway and also has entries in the Norwegian Wikipedia. Admittedly, I got a bit carried away with some of my entries (including Sigurd Ohrem which I admit I do know and which I agree should be deleted or in any case only appear on a Norwegian site) on my first day here at Wikipedia. But if Kristopher Schau is worthy of a Wikipedia entry, so is Øystein Runde. He has, by the way, as the unofficial criteria demands, been published in a periodical with a circulation of 5,000 or more (Smult) as well as having published two comics of his own with a circulation of similar magnitude. Not to mention his monthly strip in Spirit, with a circulation of a lot more than 5,000. The man is a notable Norwegian sub-cultural phenomenon. I will add a link and expand this stub in the run of some days to make it more serious. I will also include information from some of the smaller articles pertaining to this man.-- <a href="../../../g/a/u/User%7EGaupepasser_1d99.html" title="User:Gaupepasser">Gaupepasser</a> 18:27, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>Random Mootness is a common expression in the North-eastern United States. This page should not be flagged for deletion, as it is an expression that is severely under-represented on the Internet.</p>

<li>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22random+mootness%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22random+mootness%22" rel="nofollow">google search</a> found absolutely no references to "random mootness" on the WWW.

<p>As previoiusly stated, this expression is under-represented on the Internet; hence the reason for the Wikipedia entry. It is purely colloqial - Western-half of NY, PA, Ohio &amp; Western Maryland especially. If you have access to a major university library, I can provide you with the names of scholarly linguistics journals which have documented this expression, as a colleague of mine has written extensively on such topics.</p>

<p>Thanks Kappa - I think I'll just throw in the towel though. Maybe when Merriam-Webster picks up the expression, someone else will add it to the Wikis.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> and comment: No one's biting anyone and no one wishes for you to throw in the towel. After looking at your edit history, I noticed that most of your edits simply didn't qualify as encyclopedia entries. The one you did about "shoe shopping" was a perfect example of what I mean. That isn't elitism at all. It's a combination of common sense and wise use of the site's resources. Opening an account won't necessarily mean your anonymous contributions would lack credibility. If anything, it'll strengthen your position. The door's open. Come on in. If that isn't anti-elitism, I don't know what is. - Lucky 6.9 07:22, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Ok, relax and read the updated version. Hopefully you'll agree it's up to "Wiki" standards. It was my belief that the point of the Wiki was to introduce the topic as a sort of "Place-holder" for update later. I didn't expect to have to spend as much time as I have, for a simple explanation. Futhermore, the Random nonesense, as you put it, is the key to Random Mootness. I wouldn't believe you one bit if you said you've never discussed "Who would win..." in hypothetical scenarios. Animal Planet seems to think it has enough merit to do an entire series of Random Mootness as it relates to the animal kindom - not by that name, of course.

<li>I've certainly never heard of "random mootness" and I don't feel as though I know much more about it having read the article. Why does the "Related Random Mootness" section have a link to "Wikiepedia"? Unless somebody can demonstrate the widespread existence of this phenomenon (involving an audience of at least 5,000) I will vote to <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliverkeenan_148a.html" title="User:Oliverkeenan">Oliver Keenan</a> 09:58, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC). In fact this is worse than I first thought, if you look at the links in the "Related Random Mootness" section, they are to an array of bizarre, random, totally unrelated pages, a significant percentage of which are also on the VfD page. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliverkeenan_148a.html" title="User:Oliverkeenan">Oliver Keenan</a> 10:00, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am new to Wikipedia, so I hope I am adding my note appropriately. A friend pointed out this page. Based on personal experience, I would expect the "audience" to well exceed 5,000. I do not believe the article should be removed, but the author of the article has made an error. Per the article, the genealogy of the term involves the sitcom Seinfeld. Seinfeld ran from 1989-1998. The term took hold in WNY (Buffalo and Rochester, NY and surrounding regions) prior to that time. Although I have no evidence to verify the relationship other than personal observation, the term seems to stem from an episode of Saturday Night Live that first aired on 10/20/84. Jesse Jackson was a guest on the show. At one point, he played a character in a game show. When asked a question, he responds “The question is moot. I’ll take the car!” I did not see the episode, but noticed that the word “moot” was being overused in everyday language in my high school – with the meaning becoming more general, akin to irrelevant. After inquiring, I was advised that quite a few people had seen the episode and that the word stuck a chord as being humorous. Therefore, it stuck. Keep in mind that SNL carried terrific ratings at this point. Shortly after that time, the expression seemed to naturally expand into “random mootness”. I later went to SUNY-Buffalo and usage of the term was widespread. Apparently, the phenomenon was not limited to my high school. Again, I have no idea how or why… 21 years later, both “moot” and “random mootness” continue to be commonplace terms in the area. I do not know if everyone uses it, but many do. One specific place where I have heard it repeatedly is at Buffalo Bills football or Buffalo Sabres hockey games over the years. When a play goes against the home team, I have often heard – and, admittedly, occasionally said – comments along the line of “Oh, that was just moot!” or “C’mon, ref! What is with this random mootness?” I do not mean to imply that the term is only used at sporting events, as I hear it in the workplace and many other settings. In summary, I am surprised that the term is geographically isolated and am equally surprised that it has no presence on the web. However, why would anyone bother? To me, it is like devoting a page to the term “oh, boy” or “I agree”. It is just a phrase… However, it is clear that many people are not familiar with it. If Wikipedia is a place to spread this type of information, then I think it should stay. By the way, one poster comments “…links in the "Related Random Mootness" section, they are to an array of bizarre, random, totally unrelated pages…”. Are you missing the point? The author is trying to better define the term by linking to “random mootness”. I don't have a user name.12.19.225.242 13:27, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as vanity. Though it does get bonus points for trying to claim someone as an "internet celebrity" even without a current website. Obviously JSP (being the Javascript file extension) and 665 (being a common number) are hard to Google, but a search for <i>JSP +665 +vampire</i> turned a handful of results but none relevant to the article subject within at least the first 5 pages. I'm not sure whether the allegedy-popular 665 website was located at 665-dot-com or not, but if it was, it hasn't been in the Alexa top 100,000 for at least 2 years, according to Alexa. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:51, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note/update: According to DS, the website in question is sixsixfive.com, which has a current <b>Alexa rank of 483,063</b>, and hasn't been in the top 100,000 for at least the past two years (older data not available, but likely similar).

<li>You're right... and I knew that too, I dunno where my head was at. In any case, the underlying statement is true, that being a common file extension, JSP's notability cannot be determined by a simple Google search. It's like if someone was nicknamed "MP3" or "HTML". You might get tons of results, but very few (if any) relevant ones. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:51, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is nothing but an advertisement for a booktitel of a "historian" known for very revisionist positions in Germany. Has nothing to do with NPOV, has nothing to do with serious enquiry of Prussian history. The information about this book belongs to some other place, f.e. "Ethnic policies at the end of World War II" or something like that. There you could discuss the book and name it among others, but not alone like this.</p>

<p>Now, it seems entirely unnecessary to have pages for each of these.

If this particular station is notable, then fine, keep it. None of the others are. Wikipedia is not a directory of transportation information, or of public transportation stops.</p>
<p>Do we really want pages for each and every commuter train stop everywhere in the world? Heck, I could start right now. I live in Stockholm, Sweden--there are two major commuter lines going into town with a total of about 90 stops. Lets put them in! Even better, I can add all the other minor light rail lines, and all the metro stops!</p>
<p>I have no problem with stops that are actually significant (as the West Palm Beach Station may be). But the rest of these are just clutter.

<li>Actually the merge has helped organization, but it would still be better as a table, including the town, date, and possibly connections, but without the roads, places of interest, etc. The stations should be separate to keep the roads off the main page, to allow them to grow, and to allow cross-links. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:09, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just out of curiousity, what do Kappa and Meeler think these are going to grow into, especially given the comments of <b>8^D</b>?

<li><b>Delete</b> Instantnood cannot run the polls in a non-biased manner. He doesn't announce them, tries to control who votes, and inserts his bias into the announcement.

<li>When there is evidence that a vote was not properly conducted, there is every reason to point this out in support of its removal. Even the notification of one person is as good as introducing unfairness to the poll, and this does not get justified by notifying more persons. You claim that wikipedia is not an authoritarian or oppressive state, but this dosent mean it is not used by people with authoritarian or oppressive tendencies. Your claim that "nobody is in a position to have the power to influence the result." does not hold, because there is more then enough evidence to show how untrue this is, and all the more when I can show evidence of you doing it.

<ul>
<li>I have aleady mentioned in detail why it is not properly conducted, and all others who call for its deletion has given even more points to that. Perhaps you might spend some time reading them instead of asking me a well-answered question. Secondly, you started and worded this poll without contribution from anyone else. In that sence, you are the one who is conducting this poll, since you set it up. If it is not you, then who is it? The history page dont lie. You created the page with no objection, because the people who are objecting are not informed of your intentions, and neither do they know of the format of the poll and its wordings used. Your impatience shows. For someone who can make the effort to inform people that the vote is on in their talk pages, I am surprised he cannot do the same when contemplating the idea of coming up with the poll. Last but not least, your repeated discomfort shows when you repeatedly tells me to "stop implying that wikipedians can be influenced and are not capable to think, decide and act independently". Is this an excuse for your vote garnering habits? Is this to justify you dropping notices in people's talk pages when they vote against your favour? Do you feel you are entitled to <b>only</b> ask people who are likely to support your POV to vote because you think they wont be influenced anyway? If you think they wont be influenced, why bother?

<li>Neither of those two "annoucements" mentions that 25 polls will be conducted, and neither did they list out the pages to be voted on. Neither of them discusses the mode of conduct of the poll, and neither of them discusses the wordings and options to be presented. Worse, neither of them actually say in explicit terms that this poll will be conducted at all. I have seen one of them before, and I was still taken by surprise. I do hope you realise we cant always read your mind. Next, your statements above just shows how biased you are. You find it unnecesary to inform people that you have mentioned the likelihood of your conduct of a poll. The next moment, you expect no surprise amongst anyone who sees that poll when you think it neccesary to inform people that the poll is already up. You insist that the poll is "reliable" and "valid"...by informing some people about the poll? You think it neccesary that "everyone" knows what the matter is...what is you definition of "everyone"? If "everyone" is "aware" of the situation at hand, are they allowed to vote against your favour without you dropping messages in their talk pages demanding for a review on their part?

<li>Oh, and if there is a change in the conventions tomorrow, we are going to have another round of votes of over 25 entries? Think about it. If the conventions are supposed to be respected, why do we need a process like this to enforce the conventions? If there are people protesting these moves despite having read and understood the conventions, do you not think the discussions should be centred over its contents, instead of having to go thru this over and over again, and yet paradoxically facing the possibilities of votes not going in favour of the stated convention?

</li>
<li>It depends.

</li>
<li>There are many articles and categories nominated to be retitled according to the naming conventions. But some people, while they agree retitling according to the naming conventions, do not agree with retitling one or two, or more, of the articles/categories. And that's why it's necessary to be considered on a case-by-case basis. If everyone agrees that the retitling can be done to all of the articles/categories, then case-by-case assessment won't be necessary.

<li>Hence as I mentioned just now, the contradiction is getting obscenely obvious. You now justify this page by saying "some people disagree with some renamings despite conventions".

<li><b>Delete</b>. The idea of a vote is a good one, and we will probably need a Gdansk-like vote. However, first of all there are not enough options (common usage is just "China", this should be offered as an option to "mainland China" and "PRC"), and probably a Taiwan/ROC vote should be held at the same time, for an overall solution. Second, there are also too many options, but the wrong kind: it doesn't seem to make sense to have case-by-case special cases for each of "museums", "transportation", "tourism", etc. and then have to memorize what applies where; there should be some overall universal principle with only a few exceptions (such as for "history", for example). Finally, any vote/survey should be announced well ahead of time, and the exact wording needs to be discussed and hammered out to be as neutral as possible (not just "mainland China, for or against"). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:17, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Here's the situation as I see it: The naming conventions article that this vote is a subpage of try to specify under what conditions "PRC" and/or "Mainland China" are more appropriate than "China". Some users believe that the naming conventions entail that a significant number of articles should be renamed in order to better conform to those conventions. Others disagree, either because they think the proposed moves do not satisfy the naming conventions, or because they see the results of the moves as violating other policies, or they disagree with the naming conventions. There's been considerable debate already, with no clear results. The naming conventions are arguably the "overall universal principle" you are looking for. In the past on a related topic, several moves were proposed en bloc on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, which met with opposition, because achieving consensus on a whole set of items is difficult. My own view is that a different approach is needed, one which separates policy making (coming up with naming conventions) from policy implementation (carrying out the requisite moves without any need for additional polls), but I have no idea if that would be feasible or how to go about it. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 07:30, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

That poll has already suggested that, to some users, although they agree with the moves, they don't think certain pages are satisfied.<br />
As this is an assessment on whether an item satisfy the conventions, the only option is to stick with the naming conventions, and therefore no alternative option was provided (say, "China") when I created the page.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was a former member of this community (leaving in about 2000 or 2001), and a huge EarthBound fan. So maybe I'm a bit biased. That said, I do think Starmen.Net is notable in that the fanbase it represents is much more fanatical, and probably more wide, than can be said for most other games of the popularity of EarthBound. The Mother 3 petition is particularly notable as has been noted on a previous VfD attempt that is listed on the talk page. sm.net has been mentioned in several magazines (which the site has its own page about), which probably cannot be said for any other fansite about a game with the same popularity level as EarthBound (were it not for this fanatical fanbase, the game may well have been regarded as a failure). I think sm.net is notable when attributes such as these are taken into consideration. - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 14:28, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. During the first heyday of MMORPGs Lum was one of the major, or perhaps the major, commentator on the scene.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lum the Mad helped shape much of the current philosophy on MMOG design, and he doesn't even use a gratuitous rainbow-colored nickname. I see no evidence of vanity in this entry.Einer 11:07, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Started out just keeping the occasional notes on games and game play when the MMOG industry was in its infancy (UO) and as it grew to encompass several major games and companies. The site spawned the phrase "We fear change", as well, I believe, and was a non-corporate-controlled spot where some serious discussion and useful mocking of the industry, its people, and its flaws could take place, and did take place.

<ul>
<li>The article is a stub with potential. (See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Deletion policy</a> - table 'Problems that don't require deletion')</li>
<li>It is related to precedent: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html#Is_some_Internet_culture_encyclopedic.3F_-_Yes" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Is some Internet culture encyclopedic? - Yes</a>. Gaming and Internet culture are quite intimately related, and this is apparent from the video series itself.</li>
<li>As Mtoman pointed out (in the unsigned vote above, nevertheless), the subject of this article is somewhat related to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a>.</li>
<li>The article might <i>presently</i> be seen as a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Vanity page</a>, however, as I pointed out above, the article is still a stub and is in need of expansion. As for the claims of 'non-notability', please see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html#Does_lack_of_fame_a_vanity_article_make.3F" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Does lack of fame a vanity article make?</a>. <i>Pure Pwnage</i> (the video series) is primarily about gamers and the gaming subculture, however, since it is a parody, it can appeal to a much wider audience. (e.g. see <i>Pure Pwnage</i> Episode 2: <i>Girls</i>)</li>
<li>This is <b>NOT</b> a personal attack, merely a statement of fact. The VfD tagger has not viewed the video series that is the subject of this article (excerpt from <i>#wikipedia</i> on FreeNode, times are GMT +08:00):
<ul>

<li>Apr 11 12:02:27 &lt;eleusis&gt; ok</li>
</ul>

<li>As such, I believe the VfD listing is based on simple assumption relating to the current length of the article, rather than its potential. I also believe that <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> would not have VfD'd this article had he seen the video series, considering that he is familiar with the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a> series, and would have been aware of the parallels:
<ul>
<li>Apr 11 12:03:58 &lt;eleusis&gt; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue</a>) is related to (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Pwnage" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Pwnage" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Pwnage</a>) in that it's a video/animation series published on the web, and that they're both about gaming</li>
<li>[...]</li>
<li>Apr 11 12:04:07 &lt;eleusis&gt; i don't see (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue</a>) getting vfd'd</li>
<li>Apr 11 12:04:40 &lt;InShaneee&gt; eleusis: I love red vs. blue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Answering other VfD voters' concerns:
<ul>
<li>The present form of the article does not make its notability apparent - as I pointed out, the article is still a stub in need of expansion.</li>
<li>The popularity of the video show is mostly irrelevant: <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html#Does_lack_of_fame_a_vanity_article_make.3F" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Does lack of fame a vanity article make?</a>.</li>
<li>The article is not simply promotion. For example, a term that is often used without explanation in the video series is 'Uber Micro'. This article is properly linked to explain this term.</li>
<li>Labelling this article as 'Advertising' because of the presence of a 'Review' section is irrelevant. This 'review' was <i>not</i> NPOV (negatively biased against the content of the video series) and was added by an anonymous user from IP 67.140.145.26. This review was removed by another anonymous user from IP 24.3.104.7, but then reverted back by 67.140.145.26. Notice that the anonymous user from 67.140.145.26 has also posted a <i>Delete</i> vote on this page. The review has since been moved to the Talk page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In summary, I believe that <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_Pwnage_9d82.html" title="Pure Pwnage">Pure Pwnage</a> has good potential for growth, being a good example of a <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webisode.html" title="Webisode">Webisode</a>. (The webisode article doesn't exist yet, try google for definitions and other examples. IMO, a webisode is a more general concept than a <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> - something that <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a> is classified as.) As evident from the article presently, the video series is relevant to the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamer.html" title="Gamer">gamer</a> subculture. However, a wider audience should be able to relate to the content of the video series, as it is a <i>parody</i> of gamers, not simply an obscure gamer-related publication.</li>

<li>I'm glad that Eleusis made a clear explanation, but unfortunately I don't find it particularly convincing. The article is conceivably vanity since it is written by people involved with the show. That is, of course, debatable as always, but it is valid grounds for voting. "Red vs Blue" gets over ten times as many google hits as "Pure Pwnage". Thus it does not follow that Pwnage is 'famous' simply because it is 'similar'. And it is pretty easy to create whatever kind of site on the net; <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a web directory.

<dd>As far as I know, there is no evidence to suggest that this article was written by, or has had most (or even, any) of its contributions coming from the cast or crew of <i>Pure Pwnage</i>, or anyone else affiliated with (read: helps run, or promotes) purepwnage.com. I was not implying that <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_Pwnage_9d82.html" title="Pure Pwnage">Pure Pwnage</a> is as famous as <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a>, merely that they were both parodies of the gaming subculture, and were both published in the form of 'webisodes'.

<li>The band that half of Internet knows about would certainly be accepted on Wikipedia. Similarly, an Internet phenomenon that is Pure Pwnage certainly deserves a mention in Wikipedia.

<dd><i>So, in case you genuinely don't understand, and not just playing dumb</i> I've noticed that bad writers often try to shift the blame for the confusion, ambiguity, and mystery they cause by insulting their readers. But you wouldn't know about that, would you?</dd>
<dd><i>Do you understand how this is can be interpreted as malice?</i> Sure -- if you <i>start off</i> assuming malice.</dd>
<dd>Quitting in disgust and coming back is proof of what? Well, that he got over it. If this is suspicious behaviour, I'll work up a (long) list for you of shady characters for you to watch, including <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">User:Ta bu shi da yu</a></dd>
<dd>I like the reasoning, though: he's nominating this for deletion for a <s>third</s> fourth time because he has a vendetta. The proof he has a vendetta? The fact that he's nominating it for a third time. Why is he nominating it for a <s>third</s> fourth time? Because he has a vendetta. Rinse, lather, repeat.</dd>
<dd>And the fact that he nominated this and not others proves what, exactly? It's a slight variation of the bogus rationale offered by hundreds of voters in past AfDs: namely, the whine "if the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>/one-horse town/trivial-in-my-opinion-subject article stays, so should mine": the appropriateness of this nomination has bugger all to do with other lack of nominations. If this (in your view) double standard upsets you, give me a list of other candidate articles, those running on the No-Hope Party ticket in the Riding of BFN that, gosh darn it, Spinboy <i>should</i> have nominated for deletion and I'll do the job myself: I've got some time to kill right and I can get right on it. Though be quick, I'm leaving in half-an-hour.</dd>
<dd>Maybe Spinboy has nominated this article for deletion because he thinks Neufeld doesn't rate an encyclopedia article? Yes, standards in an encyclopedia -- that's just crazy talk! As far as I'm concerned, if Mr. Neufeld wants free publicity for himself, he ought to check out MySpace or Geocities.</dd>

The reasons given for 'notability' were my roles as president of the Green Party of Alberta, and founder of the Revolutionary Knitting Circle (laugh if you want, but we've got chapters on two continents and have had mainstream media coverage on three - I'm most proud of my interviews in <i>Interweave Knits</i> and <i>Vogue Knitting</i>&#160;:-). --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 05:11, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's obvious that I disagree with that view. I think that folks with direct knowledge of a subject should be contributing to the articles here. I'd see a serious problem if they were the only ones working on the articles, but the presence of "many eyes" on Wikipedia balances off any POV issues that such contributors may create. I've contributed to a lot of articles on Wikipedia where I'm not "at arms length" (such as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Alberta_41f1.html" title="Green Party of Alberta">Green Party of Alberta</a>), and provided detailed references when questions have been raised (such as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGrant_Neufeld_d6b9.html#Documenting_References_-_Not_Original_Research" title="Talk:Grant Neufeld">on the article</a> being debated here). In any case, the previous two votes on this article have not found my auto-biographical contributions to be sufficient cause for deletion. As to the imposibility of auto-biographical NPOV, I encourage you to review the comments from Earl Andrew, Kevintoronto and gord on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGrant_Neufeld_d6b9.html" title="Talk:Grant Neufeld">the article's talk page</a> as counterpoints to that view. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 07:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That is because there is no such policy. In fact during the recent debacle regarding Mr. Seigenthaler many people were critical of him because he did not simply change the innaccuracy himself and instead made a big deal out of it. It seems people desire to have it both ways on the autobiographical issue.

<li><b>Keep</b>, <i>President of Alberta Greens, candidate in Alberta general election, 2004) and founder (in 2000) of the first Revolutionary Knitting Circle (now an international activist movement).</i> are claims which make this individual notable in my view. People are allowed to edit articles about themselves as long as they remain neutral and while starting your own article is frowned upon, there's nothing forbidding you to do so. Anyway, neither of these are reason to delete an article. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:41, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. That this has survived earlier discussion is astonishing: execrable self-promoting vanity page of an insignificant that heavily exaggerates asserted notbaility. The organisation which the subject has founded, <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Knitting_Circle_04d7.html" title="Revolutionary Knitting Circle">Revolutionary Knitting Circle</a> should also be brought to AfD as inherently unnotable as well. Perhaps other Canadians here can chime in on having heard of it or not, but so far my running tally is 0. I find maclean's suggestion that this is a bad faith nomination hard to fathom. A badly self-authored page that is nothing more than a funnel for an out-of-control ego should not be on WP; bringing it up for nomination is a perfectly good thing to do. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 12:49, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jim Harris isn't the president of the party either. Perhaps you misunderstand Canadian political party structures. "President" is a position within the political party's <i>internal</i> structure, who's responsible for running the organization.

<li><b>Keep'</b> I don't see it as POV (although it is a bit heavy on the vanity front). I also think that the repeated nominations for deletion will eventually cause it to be deleted, if only because the ones seeking to have it deleted will keep coming back, but the people voting keep will eventually move on assuming that once the vote was settled, it was settled. I don't see how an article can be nominated for deletion after passing an AfD vote and the article not changing significantly.

<li>I have revised the article to remove the vanity aspect and make it more encyclopedic. In previous communications that I have had with Grant Neufeld, he has indicated that he understands and accepts that other editors will revise the article. This is no longer a "vanity article". As far as future attempts to delete this, if this attempt fails, it will be clear that future attempts will be bad faith nominations. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 16:33, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Mildly notable politician. The last AFD was a keep, and the precident stands. The only time a keep should be overturned, is if it was based on information that turned out to be false and/or unverifiable; or else if there was some kind of failure in process. The nominator shouldn't just keep redoing AFD's till they get what they want. Far to many articles and AFDs go without attention, because AFDs are clogged with these unfounded nominations. Note: if this article hadn't survived a prior AFD, it would have been entirely justified to nominate as this is a "week keep" level person. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:17, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
