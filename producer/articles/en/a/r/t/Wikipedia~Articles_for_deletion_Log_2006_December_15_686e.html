<p>The article describes a low-budget show featuring an aspiring talk show host named Matt Chin. An example is available here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhINJaobeU4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhINJaobeU4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> My view is that the show or the host could eventually achieve sufficient popularity to be included in Wikipedia, but that at the moment there is little to distinguish it from many other programs on Youtube and elsewhere. <a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsene_7967.html" title="User:Arsene"><font color="blue">Arsene</font></a> 3:49, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Clearly this does exist but I think deletion would be a little harsh. It appears to be an actual TV show and the page does cite its sources and references. I see no reason for this pages deletion but the page itself needs a little bit of cleaning up... <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebaser23_b60b.html" title="User:Debaser23">Debaser23</a> 12:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)--<a href="../../../c/2E/l/User%7EC.lettinga_b2f4.html" title="User:C.lettinga">C.lettinga</a> 06:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Is on the internet, but also Category 2 cable TV in canada. May not be the most notable show, but is available on cable so I think it should get a chance. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 12:38, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't want to be overly stubborn about this, but does its appearance on <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bite_TV_97b1.html" title="Bite TV">Bite TV</a> really offer an argument for its inclusion here? From what I can see the channel isn't particularly selective about its content, maybe more so than a public-access station but not a great deal more. It seems like a public access program (unless it were an especially noteworthy case) would be deemed insignificant for Wikipedia, and so what I want to ask is whether this program really has enough at this point to distinguish it from the former case. <a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsene_7967.html" title="User:Arsene">Arsene</a> 4:44, 8 December 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry things are not available on-line, but google can at least point to some of these, but this person has featured on both CBC and CTV national news, and a number of other media sources, not just for his church activities, but also because of his election website and political activities. The election website is extensively referred to by many election-oriented websites.<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>During the recent Liberal leadership, several Young Liberal articles were created, probably so that their articles could be linked from the Liberal leadership endorsements article. I nominated several for deletion but I left Chan because I felt that he had some notability. At the time I would have been fine if somebody else had deleted the article. But having thought about it, I think that this is a <b>keep</b> for me (I'd say a "weak" one if I used those terms). He's certainly no <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Tanenbaum_83d3.html" title="Andrew Tanenbaum">Andrew Tanenbaum</a> but his website has been around longer than <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral-vote.com.html" title="Electoral-vote.com">electoral-vote.com</a> and is probably more important on the Canadian scene than EV is on the American one. He was possibly the most prominent liberal Catholic in Canada when the Pope came, which was a huge news story day after day for weeks. And then there's his Liberal Party activities. No single thing really distinguishes him but taken together he seems notable enough to me.--<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 19:32, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, the minimal coverage and completely mundane bio information does not add up to a totality of notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> doesn't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> in my opinion. It's been claimed that there are more sources of notability, but that they aren't online - they don't need to be. If multiple media sources are available to cite, offline or on, doing so in the article might change my mind. Without those citations, an assertion that the media mentions exist doesn't help me see the increased claimed notability. If someone gets around to writing an article on the Election Prediction website, he certainly should be mentioned there. --<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrich_e5dc.html" title="User:Krich">Krich</a> <a href="../../../k/r/i/User_talk%7EKrich_4a36.html" title="User talk:Krich">(talk)</a> 23:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Neither Rachel Hudson, nor her murderers' trial, has encyclopedic importance. Yes, the trial is the subject of multiple news articles. But, while media coverage is necessary for inclusion at Wikipedia, it's not sufficient. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">One of the rationales</a> for the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">primary notability criterion</a> is that we rely on the editorial judgment of reputable publishers as to a topic's importance: if they think it's important, we consider it worthy of inclusion here. But importance is not the only reason things get published. In general, when sources exist on a certain topic, we have to look at the <i>reason</i> the publisher decided to publish on that topic before we conclude that it's appropriate to have a Wikipedia article on the topic. We should ask, did the publisher consider the topic important or consequential in any way? In this case it should be clear that the BBC and other news organizations decided to publish articles about this trial only due to its sensational aspects: Rachel Hudson's brutal treatment and death at the hands of her own family was truly horrific and attention-grabbing. The trial had no importance, or consequences; as far as I can tell, it engendered no widespread discussion on crime and punishment or on the human capacity for cruelty (that's been around for a while now), and had no impact on the legal system or on society at large. In 100 years (even 10 years? even now?) this case will (has been?) surely and rightfully be forgotten, and almost surely not included in any history books. Rachel Hudson herself should, of course, not be forgotten, but that's no reason to keep the article <i>here</i>, because Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a memorial. (Note: De-prodded with comment "seems like there are reliable sources... perhaps it should be renamed, since it was the trial rather than the victim who was notable, but not deleted" -- as I have explained, I don't think either the victim or the trial has encyclopedic notability.) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

While the story is sad, heart-wrenching, and sick it still has not notability as the nominator points out.

<li><s><b>Comment</b></s> <b>Weak Delete</b> It is always amazing how people writing in deletion debates can read the minds of publishers and decide what they were thinking when they published a story. To become encyclopedic, such a case would need to have a longer shelf life than "crime-arrest-trial-imprisonment." This might include a prolonged debate about the actual guilt, a retrial, and books and movies about the crime, such as <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Cold_Blood_%28book%29_1b7f.html" title="In Cold Blood (book)">In Cold Blood (book)</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Cold_Blood_%28film%29_744f.html" title="In Cold Blood (film)">In Cold Blood (film)</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Sheppard_6b3d.html" title="Sam Sheppard">Sam Sheppard</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Starkweather_f56b.html" title="Charles Starkweather">Charles Starkweather</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_and_Loeb_4a74.html" title="Leopold and Loeb">Leopold and Loeb</a> or <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawley_Harvey_Crippen_c006.html" title="Hawley Harvey Crippen">Hawley Harvey Crippen</a>, which focussed mostly on the thrill killers, or spree killers, not the victims, and some of which have passed the 50 year test if not yet the 100 year test. This is a horrible murder, following torment. Sadly, it is far from unique. If it becomes the subject of books, movies, scholarly analysis, etc. as did the other cases cited, then recreate the article. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:29, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Media coverage does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability - the BBC, the New York Times, The London Times, CNN whatever... these are mainstream news channels which cover much non-encyclopedic material, including serious matters, on a daily basis. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline.

To be encyclopedic, there needs to be substantive evidence that this case has lasting social/political/cultural impact beyond personal tragedy/police log/media sensationalism e.g. if this case brings about a new law; if it inspires a movie; if it leads to creation of a significant charitable foundation etc. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding your points about sensationalism, notability, and "subjective evaluations" -- I explicitly acknowledge in my nom that this story passes the primary notability criterion. You, on the other hand, fail to address the main concern of the delete voters here, which is that this story is not <i>encyclopedically</i> notable, due, in the opinion of most of the delete voters, to lack of any indication of legal or long-term significance. Whatever you think of these arguments, none of us is making "subjective evaluations" as you claim. We're making an objective and reasoned judgment that this story doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:46, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You've got the wrong end of the stick with those sources. These articles <b>do not</b> support the idea that there is a wider social impact of this case - they merely place the case within a broader social context. It's like any drunken spree by teenagers can be said to raise the question of the wayward behaviour of kids today.

<dd>"Rachel Hudson is not current news." Well, of course. Nothing stays current news forever. The point of Bwithh's citation and comment (I think) is a distinction between news that has fleeting interest, and news that has lasting significance. If we apply <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s crystal ball test, which you seem to favor in your comment, it is clear that the article should be deleted, because there is no sign of lasting significance. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:10, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We're still here discussing here a year later, aren't we? But that and Alternative Tests don't apply in this case as the subject already passes other WP:BIO criteria.

<dd>(1) Re: "guidelines have been explained" -- Guidelines are not policy. I, for one (can't speak for other delete voters), acknowledge that this story passes the guideline <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. You continue to ignore our arguments that there is good reason to be stricter than the guideline WP:N in this case. Note that the guideline template says "it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception." (2) Re: "even an admin" -- There's at least one admin who has opined to delete above. (3) Re: "a year later" -- The only reason we're still discussing this a year later, is that I came across this article in an alt-x search. A Lexis-Nexis search shows that the last mention of Rachel Hudson (in Headline, Lead Paragraphs, or Key Terms) in European papers was in March, in two local papers; there has <a href="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?scope=all&amp;edition=i&amp;q=%22rachel+hudson%22" class="external text" title="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?scope=all&amp;edition=i&amp;q=%22rachel+hudson%22" rel="nofollow">apparently</a> been no mention of Rachel Hudson in the BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/nottinghamshire/4671910.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/nottinghamshire/4671910.stm" rel="nofollow">since the last family member was sentenced</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> It should be noted for the benefit of those people commenting on this who have never been to wikipedia before, but wikipedia is <b>NOT</b> merely about "facts" or "the truth". It is about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> facts. Please click the blue link to learn more about this important concept. Mere existance is not enough to qualify an article for acceptance at wikipedia. Anyone can create any website at anytime. It does not mean that one can then use Wikipedia as a means of advertising that website. There does not seem to be any compelling reason that Wikipedia needs to keep this as an <i>encyclopedia</i> article.

<dd>Spaced initials without periods is per typical British usage, as opposed to American English which would include the periods. I have located nothing in WP:MOS speaking to this issue, though there appears to have been a tentative proposal to include the periods and most articles do. In notable cases both conventions are supported, e.g. <a href="../../../j/_/r/J_R_R_Tolkien_e12b.html" title="J R R Tolkien">J R R Tolkien</a> redirects to <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._R._R._Tolkien_236d.html" title="J.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think some of the earlier contributors have been labouring under a misapprehension. Levens certainly didn't write textbooks. Editing a classical text is a substantially more complex and academic procedure, involving consideration of sources and careful analysis of documents over several years. That the edited text was then widely used in schools is a red herring: editions of classical texts are typically used by scholars at all levels of the discipline, and his work in this area was not like that of a "textbook hack". In addition to his work as an editor, it appears from a cursory google that Levens also researched in classical studies, and published papers in such academic journals as "Greece and Rome" and "The Classical Quarterly". Because almost all of this work was paper-based, it's difficult for us to track it down quickly: google-hits are not a good guide to notability in this case. Note that Levens was a fellow of Merton College ( for many years perhaps the most academically prestigious college at Oxford University - see the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norrington_Table_a3b0.html" title="Norrington Table">Norrington Table</a> ): this, on its own, is a pretty good indicator of academic distinction. I've adjusted the article to reflect these points. As it stands, the article is too brief, but it's not clear to me that deleting it is the way to go; rather, we should keep and expand as time and information permit. One final thing: to say that Levens was a Mods tutor is to misunderstand the way classics are taught at Oxford, so I've deleted that as misleading. Roughly speaking, at the time that Levens was working at Oxford, his teaching load would have been largely in <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literae_Humaniores_e648.html" title="Literae Humaniores">Literae Humaniores</a>: Mods would have been concerned with the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and Greats with the related history, philosophy, historiography and related disciplines. Levens would have taught whilst researching: the Oxford system is built on the principle of putting smart students in the company of leading researchers, and hoping the genius will transfer from one generation to the next&#160;! I hope all this is helpful. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:15, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, I should also add that I think he passes <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>.

<dd>The Google Books project includes the digital archiving of old book texts from Oxford, Harvard, Stanford, New York Public Library, and several other major libraries<a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/partners.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/partners.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. I ran a search through it and specifically looked for references to his work mentioned in other books - not simply books that he wrote. I also ran a search through the Oxford University library catalog, which even threw up a prize essay he wrote as a student. So I didn't base my conclusion on a cursory use of normal google. If he was a <i>prolific</i> scholarly paper writer and that hasn't been shown by searches so far, that still needs to be verified (WP:V) and not simply assumed. btw, I graduated from <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_College%2C_Cambridge_7df5.html" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">an old, venerable college</a> in the Oxbridge system too - but I don't see why simply being a teacher at a place like this is a supporting reason for justifying a encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 15:34, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Page is about a generic commercial <a href="../../../k/v/m/Kvm.html" title="Kvm">kvm</a> product and should be merged into the kvm page. The page is only used by the company to advertise their product. References to competing products, alternatives or even the general kvm page are frequently removed by company officials and thus this article does not bear any encyclopedic value. <a href="../../../q/d/r/User%7EQdr_a2cd.html" title="User:Qdr">Qdr</a> 18:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>-- <b>Keep</b> 1. Maxvista is not just "a generic commercial kvm product". If you review the specs carefully, you will find that it rather consists of two different features while the major feature is rather the screen extension to another computer by using a virtual video adapter. As far as I can see, this is a quite unique functionality. The links to other software programs do not have this major feature and cannot be compared to Maxvista at all. The particularly mentioned program "Synergy" is frequently considered falsely as an alternative to Maxvista. However, it completely lack the essential virtual video card functionality.</p>
<p>2. I cannot see any false statement or advertisement language in the debated article. It uses neutral description according to the Wikipedia guidelines.</p>
<p>3. I cannot see a compelling reason why a product description must include competitor links. If they are considered to give the feeling of objectivity they should be appropriate and as far as I can see the links which have been added and removed occasionaly do not have much in common with the virtual video function of Maxvista and can be considered as spam.</p>
<p>In conclusion I formally request to remove the deletion tag. 84.166.80.9 23:15, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Qdr: 1. Your initial deletion request is showing that you fail to understand the actual purpose of Maxvista at all. 2. Regarding your false accusation that I would be associated with Maxvista please finally aqcuire some basic skill about dynamic IP provision for dial-in internet accounts: Such IP addresses are temporarily assigned to millions users of ISP clients. If you would visit the makers website you rather find the IP 82.165.99.90, so finally stop making false accusations. 3. It is not my software, but I am a user of the software. I hope that this does not prevent me from defending this article 4. I have not manipulated anything. Rather YOU have erased MY vote. 5. I have not doublevoted (See 2.) 6. Sign your comments with full name and address before you try to teach me about id. Your Wikipedia participation does not show significantly more contribution than the continuous attempt to delete this article. 7. Refrain from false accusations in the future where you can provide no evidence. Regarding IP addresses, see #2. 8.

<li><b>Keep</b>, my gut tells me this article should be deleted, however this article does in my opinion meet <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. My personal tipping point was that at least one of the websites that reviewed this game is itself notable (<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_Gamers_5db4.html" title="Adventure Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a>), and the content of that page is a non-trivial discussion of this game. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 07:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> GameTunnel, Adventure Gamers and Just Adventure all seem like perfectly acceptable critique of the game. It isn't WP's fault or problem that the indie/freeware developing community doesn't receive critical review in printed sources or the major gamesites, it's up to the indie community to club together and generate websites that can do that. On the other hand, when that is accomplished when will WP stop rejecting review sites because they're not Gamespot? The adventure genre is not widely covered by the published gaming press, this includes 'proper' games sold through stores, not just web-distributed ones. That's resulted in a far stronger online presence from smaller sites reviewing these titles, some of which are featured in this article. Whilst I don't accept AGS awards as being sign of anything in terms of articles belonging to WP, honest reviews are another matter. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 08:21, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Further to that, in my eyes this is a clear pass of <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, which is not policy but certainly makes a good start.

<li><b>Keep</b> As QuagmireDog says. <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_Game_Studio_5281.html" title="Adventure Game Studio">Adventure Game Studio</a> is hardly obscure, having been the subject of numerous print articles <a href="http://americangirlscouts.org/agswiki/AGS_in_the_media" class="external text" title="http://americangirlscouts.org/agswiki/AGS_in_the_media" rel="nofollow">AGS wiki link</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/v/AdventureGamers_0897.html" title="AdventureGamers">AdventureGamers</a> report on their awards results, and have in their own awards often given them to many of the same games. Also, look at the index of this O'Reilly book: <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gaminghks/inx.html" class="external free" title="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gaminghks/inx.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gaminghks/inx.html</a> and you'll see that Fatman gets a mention. As do the AGS Awards, I notice. I'm also not sure how the quantity of staff is relevant to a review site's reliability? Roger Ebert (insert favourite film review here) is just one guy, you know...

<li>I can't find any references to print articles on the AGSwiki page linked. The AdventureGamers website is not obviously a significant source.

<li>Lower standards? No less than 8 rival adventure sites have reviewed it! WP+SOFTWARE does not state that the non-trivial need to be in print. Since anyone can make a print-on-demand book via <a href="../../../b/o/o/BookSurge_be4c.html" title="BookSurge">BookSurge</a> these days, the printing doesn't really add very much in notability IMHO. Just Adventure, one of the reviewing sites has been described by <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> as "an editorially rich destination for adventure gamers on the Web. It prides itself on pulling no punches and digging for scoops." PC Player touted Just Adventure as "the ideal meeting place for adventurers old and new." JA have been quoted on box covers, in magazine advertisements, and in newspapers. Adventure Gamers built a solid, dedicated readership over 7+ years, owing to its reputation for high editorial standards. The website has been quoted in magazines and on box covers, has been cited in game-related books and appeared on television several times. Adventure Gamers has over 20,000 unique visitors <i>every day</i>. gametunnel.com have been on G4TV in February 2006, September 2005 and January 2005. etc. etc. if you care to look. Please, if you are going to deny the validity of the references in the article, please specifically denounce each one, with evidence, until there are less than 2 left and the article then fails WP:SOFTWARE. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmaccormack_886d.html" title="User:Amaccormack">Amaccormack</a> 16:05, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Relatively small chain of stores in southern Ontario. Originally prodded as a nn company that does not meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. It is claimed in the article, without proper <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that a past proprietor of the store invented instant coffee.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Refer to the previous discussion when this article was brought up for deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hangovers_2cee.html" title="The Hangovers">The Hangovers</a>, although perhaps not incredibly notable outside their sphere, are certainly notable in the realm of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collegiate_a_cappella.html" title="Collegiate a cappella">collegiate a cappella</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_University_7419.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> music. They are certainly far more deserving of recognition than many organizations and ensembles on Wikipedia. Referring to the criteria for a musical ensemble in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, I believe <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hangovers_2cee.html" title="The Hangovers">The Hangovers</a> meet the following to varying degrees:
<ul>
<li>4: "Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in reliable sources." - The Hangovers have toured extensively internationally and nationally for many years. Last year they toured Italy, and they will be traveling to Spain next year. Many of their performances have been for important individuals, such as their performance for South Korean President-elect Kim Dae-Jung in 1998. <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/March98/hangovers.pc.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/March98/hangovers.pc.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. On their 2004 tour of Brazil, The Hangovers were shown on the Brazilian national television news, Jornal Nacional.</li>
<li>6: "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable" - The Hangovers spawned the Washington, D.C. a cappella ensemble, The Tone Rangers, about 20 years ago. The Tone Rangers were recently referenced in the Jennifer Aniston film, "The Break Up." <a href="http://www.tonerangers.com/news.asp?nid=557" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tonerangers.com/news.asp?nid=557" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. Another group spawned by The Hangovers is The Breakers <a href="http://www.breakersvocalband.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.breakersvocalband.com/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, which recently toured Malaysia. Musicians Brian Chu <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/~jhso/artists/chu.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jhu.edu/~jhso/artists/chu.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> and Alan Farouk <a href="http://www.adamfarouk.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adamfarouk.com/" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> are merely two of the accomplished musical alumni of The Hangovers. Also, although not a musician, politician <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Keyes_43a9.html" title="Alan Keyes">Alan Keyes</a> was a member of The Hangovers.</li>
<li>9: "Has won or placed in a major music competition." - The Hangovers have often participated in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA), placing in the regional competitions. In 2001, they placed in the Mid-Atlantic semi-final competition and won recognition for "Best Entrance."</li>
<li>1: "It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable." - I admit that the "independence" of this source can be questioned, but The Hangovers are the subject of a lengthy chapter in the book <i>Songs From the Hill</i> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Hill-history-Cornell-University/dp/B0006FBMBK/sr=8-1/qid=1166166233/ref=sr_1_1/102-6763742-1292939?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Hill-history-Cornell-University/dp/B0006FBMBK/sr=8-1/qid=1166166233/ref=sr_1_1/102-6763742-1292939?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>.</li>
<li>10: "Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show." - The Hangovers have performed on a variety of television and radio networks. As the article mentions, they perform in a <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a> documentary.</li>
<li>7: "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city" - The Hangovers are certainly one of the pioneering groups in collegiate a cappella, and have shaped the a cappella environment at Cornell University and likely elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel it better serves the Wikipedia community to strive for a broad coverage of articles than to cut itself down to only the most notable or impressive in some broad category like "music." I recognize that some organizations use this site for blatant publicity, but I think this article serves a broader purpose. Honestly, would a general encyclopedia have incredibly awesome articles like the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_Future_timeline_7bf0.html" title="Back to the Future timeline">Back to the Future timeline</a>? Such articles only appeal to a small niche, but they are part of what makes Wikipedia great. (To clarify, I am not a member of The Hangovers.) <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECREarle_be64.html" title="User:CREarle">CREarle</a> 07:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Whilst you may have a point with some of the arguments, I have just re-read the article, and now believe that if we trimmed out a lot of the trivial and POV crap, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pardon_my_French_8274.html" title="Pardon my French">pardon my French</a>, in the earlier part, I would have not got completely turned off by the time we got to the tours section. However, I must contest some of your arguments:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"backwards notability" is highly problematic, IMHO: the Tone Rangers may have came out of the Hangovers, but the fact is that group "became" the Tone Rangers, whilst the Hangovers "became" another group on their departure. Members have drift out of it by rotation on their graduation (sic), and the Tone Rangers does not equal the Hangovers.</dd>
<dd>I do not feel that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>/<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> defines that being placed in a regional competition is noteworthy.</dd>
<dd><i>Songs from the Hill</i> is a history of the Cornell Glee Club and not the Hangovers (which is but a later offshoot), Having said that, anything less than a chapter in the book on the latter would IMO be a death knell. It is indeed correct to say that it is not independent, nor is it multiple.</dd>
<dd>By (10), I'm pretty sure the drafters didn't really mean that anyone who has publicly performed "The Theme from the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockford_Files_9c3e.html" title="Rockford Files">Rockford Files</a>" or "<a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Are_You__a433.html" title="Who Are You?">Who Are You?</a>" be notable.

<li><b>Keep,</b> for the same reasons it was kept <i>last time</i> the article was AfD'd. CREarle lays out a good number of reasons to keep this article. Ohconfucius: the Hangovers <i>performed the theme song for the PBS special.</i> It's them singing. It's not a cover. And, as ICCA is as major a competition as there is in this genre, they clearly qualify under criterion #9. They've had an original song that's been written up in college-related publications and has gotten airplay. They tour widely and have been featured in international media while touring. The article is sourced and the group has notable accomplishments. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 20:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>sorry to be pedantic, but nowhere in the article does it state the group "performed the <b>theme</b> for a PBS broadcast" - that's a new piec of informaion you've imparted; I'm not deprecating the ICCA, but the group won competition at a regional level, whilst policy states this should be a major competition.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Since this AfD began, a great number of references have been added to the article, including international news coverage of one of the Hangovers' tours. Further tags, most likely citing the chapter of Slon's book dedicated to the Hangovers, are likely to be added in the next twelve hours. As often happens, this has proven to be a good opportunity for article growth. I encourage those editors who have cited citation or POV issues to take the discussion to that talk page, where it can be addressed in a drive to improve the article. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 00:21, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per previous arguments, the group's history and achievements certainly merit an article. The article itself could be tightened to reflect those rather than focusing on recent and more minor issues, but should not be removed. I see it is being edited even as I write this. airbreather</li>

Even the keep vote above admits theres no <i>idependent</i> coverage of this group (i.e. non-members; not within the bubble of their university).

There is no evidence that they are any more notable than the average a capella group (i.e. having performed in front of a few famous people, been on tv once, 15th place at the local competition, paid BOCA to get on the cd).

<li><b>Comment:</b> There are already multiple non-trivial references to the Hangovers, including both a national newspaper article about them and a book with a <i>chapter dedicated to the Hangovers.</i> Yes, you're right: there are <i>also</i> university press releases, and references to the official website, but you're moving the goalposts here. Those are both reasonably reliable sources which add to the scope of the article; you're acting as though using them somehow weakens the content. I'm still not clear on the confusion about the TV show thing: they went into a studio and recorded a song, written by a member of the group, specifically for the TV show. It was then broadcast as part of the production of that show. Not incidentally, the reference to their participation in the production of that show is listed at PBS.org, which is certainly (yet another) "reliable secondary source." You are correct that they were also <i>later on television performing,</i> but that was an entirely different event (which seems, therefore, to further add to their notability). The article is well-referenced and only continues to get better-referenced. I'm not at all clear how deleting this article would be anything but a net loss to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 04:32, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> the article says "<i>It originated from "Xbox Underground,"</i>". Now does this mean that the XU changed their name to Game-Spectrum? If so then keep because the XU might pass notability. However, if it is just a fork of XU users, then it definitely fails notability. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 03:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, the XU changed its name to G-S. XU appeared to be a personal project, hosted at tripod. XU is IMHO also NN. It is a fansite and blog. <a href="../../../m/k/o/User%7EMKoltnow_7f00.html" title="User:MKoltnow">MKoltnow</a> 03:42, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'll skip the prod since I'm sure it would be contested. POV fork from <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centaurs.html" title="Centaurs">Centaurs</a> as acknowledged in the page history. I assume the controversial assertion is that Centaurs actually existed and the article suggests (via <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">non-reliable sources</a>) they still exist today.

<p><i>(See also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bill_Freeman_63fd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bill Freeman">first AFD</a>)</i> This page was brought to the attention of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLPN_8a63.html" title="WP:BLPN">WP:BLPN</a> so I took a look at it. It is filled with nothing but rumors and allegations against the subject of the article. "By the late 1990s, allegations resurfaced that Freeman's wife, Patsy, had caused numerous divorces in different cities and mentally abused many different church-members." What the heck does that mean? She caused numerous divorces? That doesn't even make sense. The ENTIRE article is an attack page - it isn't just one or two sentences. I looked back in history and this article is basically identical to the first version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Freeman&amp;oldid=13724516" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Freeman&amp;oldid=13724516" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> 1.5 years ago, so there is no good version to revert back to. The article was kept at AFD before, but the only question was notability. But we now have a new policy, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> which says that unsourced or poorly sourced information must be removed. I have no idea if the guy is notable or not, but this attack page ought to be deleted so that a decent article can be written, if desired.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure I agree that the "entire article" is an attack page -- seems to me about two sentences could be removed and two others trimmed, and you have a basic history of the group. The "Whitworthian" coverage is certainly <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> to that extent. I'm less convinced of the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> side of things, because the controversy seems to all be local and minor (of the church kerfuffle variety). They don't cause controversy in the community, that is. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:06, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It looks like the Whitworthian is a school newspaper ... if it's like our school newspaper was at Tech, I'm not sure I'd believe it if it said the sky was blue. The content of the article seems mostly to come from an opinion piece written by the editor of the school newspaper. The other two references are anti-cult sources. Googling, I couldn't find anything else out there except for other anti-cult publications ... so I'm not sure that there's anything out there to even attempt to write a neutral article. At any rate, an article that is just a rehash of allegations is, in my book, an attack page, even if someone else has made the allegations too. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:11, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Balance</b> The two anti-cult sites are clearly relying on the <i>Whitworthian</i> coverage, and are effectively just reprinting portions of it. (The Apologetics Index is more honest about it; it uses quotations and cites its source.) At this time, there is one book he edited with Amazon sales rank above 150K, and three he wrote with sales ranks between 500K and 1 Million. Amazon shows that he wrote some books back in the 1970s, so somewhere in the past 30 years there probably have been multiple independent reviews of his work, causing him to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But the article doesn't demonstrate it, or even say anything about his writing books. So I'm comfortable with deletion as the article really only has one source, and that one is inadequate for writing a NPOV article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:55, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Deletion</b> for violating Wiki policies on biographies of living persons. This article is highly biased. When blatant POV statements are removed, the author promptly reinserts them, making a neutral article about Bill Freeman's life and work as a Christian speaker and writer impossible. Additionally, the article is factually incorrect. For example, it claims that the Freemans own SIX houses, which is not accurate. It is apparent that the author of this article has a personal vendetta against the Freemans. The "sources" are nothing more than published personal attacks which do not constitute a factual biographical article. This article needs to be deleted entirely to prevent the propogation of misinformation.Wh4ever 18:08, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Deletion</b> for obvious attack article. The author uses and maintains incorrect facts to support a personal agenda. Ckmnstr</li>

It was asserted in the first afd that inclusion in the 2006 Best of College A Capella CD (as one of about 20 tracks from about 20 different groups) indicated that the group had won a major competition. I'm not sure about this. Here's an excerpt from the contest's FAQ<a href="http://varsityvocals.com/boca/faq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://varsityvocals.com/boca/faq.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Does it cost anything to appear on BOCA?</i> <i>Yes. Groups are required to pre-purchase 50 CDs at $5 apiece, for a total of $250, in order to appear on BOCA. Note that you are not limited to 50 CDs; some groups have bought many more and sold them on campus for much more than $5 each.</i> <i>What do we get out of appearing on BOCA?</i> <i>Bragging rights for one. More than 100 CDs are submitted each year for BOCA, of which we will choose fewer than 20. You can sell your copies at any price, though you only pay us $5 for them, so at $15 per, you make a 200 per cent profit.</i> <i>You also get international publicity, and we include contact information in the liner notes so people who like what they hear can order your disc.</i></p>
<p>Well, the "international publicity" sounds nice (though all the groups on the 2006 CD were from the US, and the organization running the contest is taking, rather than giving money away...) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:20, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that this article does not establish notability for the event that it describes. The second paragraph does not seem to have anything to do with the event. <b>Delete</b> unless material is added to establish notability. I prod'ed this but the prod is contested, so that's why I'm bringing it for discussion. It does return a lot of google hits, but there does not seem to be a lot of national coverage. The most pertinent guidlines for notability on this might be <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> and it does not seem to pass those.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 04:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> thank you for contributing to the discussion. Without sources, we have no way of determining the accuracy of your statement, and this is really what the discussion is about. If you can, please edit the article to include sources that show the national/international notability of the event. For example, coverage in a national newspaper/magazine might help, but articles in alumni newsletters/magazines or magazines that do not have a broad readership, probably wouldn't.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Ummm, the PRODer notes that there are many hits, some of which I note are the result of the Ann Arbor historical society, yet these are dismissed because they are largely local? The vast majority of the hits for <a href="../../../c/n/_/CN_Tower_50ef.html" title="CN Tower">CN Tower</a> from from Toronto, so that criterion seems extremely weak. There's also mentions of caselaw at what appears to be the State level, which seems to nullify the argument, and a large number of link-ins from various "pot" related sites that are not local. And given that the "zeroth" bash (1970) included John Lennon, Yoko Ono and Alan Ginsberg <a href="http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v04/n804/a03.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v04/n804/a03.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, it would seem the justification for inclusion based on historical notability is more than obvious. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 17:41, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure that comparing this to the <a href="../../../c/n/_/CN_Tower_50ef.html" title="CN Tower">CN Tower</a> is a good analogy. According to the article the CN Tower is listed in the Guinness book of records as the world's tallest building. That fact alone qualifies the CN Tower for an article in Wikipeida. John Lennon and Yoko Ono must have played lots of venues in their time, does that automatically qualify every venue for inclusion in Wikipedia? I simply think that this is fine as part of the culture in Ann Arbor article, but does not qualify for a separate article. Lots of universities have street fairs, carnivals and parades. Should wikipedia have an article for each one? I change my vote to <b>redirect</b> to the culture article and if an interested editor wishes to expand that section (for example, to include a history of the event, notable performances, coverage in national media, etc) to the point where a separate article is warranted, then great.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 05:04, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you can provide examples of other "university street fairs" that are quoted as legal precedent, I'm all ears. You ask "Should wikipedia have an article for each one", but that's a non-sequitur, whether or not it should (and I say "sure") is no argument on whether or not <i>this</i> one should be here. It seems more than notable, which pretty much ends the argument IMHO. And it's not like merging it into some other page would save resources or anything, all that would do is make it more difficult to find. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 15:47, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't agree, but I agree to disagree.

<dd><b>Keep</b>. The event is of broader historical/cultural interest for several reasons, including: A.) its catalyzing role in broader battles over marijuana legalization in left-leaning U.S. college towns in the early 1970s (see, for example, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana_laws_in_Ann_Arbor%2C_Michigan_20f6.html" title="Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan">Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>); and B.) its creation as part of the widely noted struggle to free poet/activist <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sinclair_%28poet%29_d532.html" title="John Sinclair (poet)">John Sinclair</a> from prison, which drew support from a number of nationally noted figures.

<li>It depends on its userbase and unique features, of course, but I wonder what would be notable about such a distro.

<li><b>Keep</b> See if it evoles to be a good article, it's unfair to delete something based on a stub. This has gotten alot of attention in it's lifespan, and is certainly noticeable. And it may "only be a theme" on the site, but that's because there's nowhere to host a 666Mb file, so donations are being taken for a server, etc. It's not doing anyone any harm, it should stay. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt.Hoy_37b1.html" title="User:Matt.Hoy">Matt</a> 01:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> while I realize that all subjects related to Disneyland and Walt Disney World are of at least some interest to families, this reads more like a how to guide to employment opportunities at the Anaheim site.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Original research is not the same thing as unreferenced. I'm unsold on the utility here, most of the definitions are too long for a disambig page. But I'm not sure if these other definitions exist that <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teabagging.html" title="Teabagging">teabagging</a> is the best place to put the Wiktionary jump. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:56, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Numerous references to teabagging imply a need for the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teabagging.html" title="Teabagging">teabagging</a> article, not neccessarily a disambig page.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> - there needs to be some standard for what counts as an assertion of notability. If I make a page that says, "Dave is known around the world as the coolest guy ever to exist", that is speedied even though it is an assertion of notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> self published writer with no apparent notability <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 11:52, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Not Delete</b>. According to the Wikipedia guidelines, a person is notable if there have been articles and other bibliographic references about him or her that can be verified. Victor Celorio meets that requirement with hundreds of articles about him and his invention. If his invention is what made him notable, this in no way diminishes his accomplishments and/or his notability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The genesis of the main article was the inclusion by somebody else of Victor Celorio in Wikipedia on a List of Notable Mexicans. My article specifically didn't mention the trademark name (InstaBook) to avoid the appearance of promotion. While it is true that a search of InstaBook will provide more hits, the fact remains that a search for Victor Celorio pulls a significant number of hits as a leader in Print-on-Demand technology, which is a growing segment of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>Therefore I believe that the entry of Victor Celorio meets the criteria set by Wikipedia and should not be deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Llambert (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Llambert_628b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Llambert">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Llambert (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Llambert_628b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Llambert">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I change my vote, now that evidence of notability is included in the article. Now if Victor and his friends will take the time to learn wikipedia editing style (start with <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>, and stock deleting the editorial suggestion tags before acting on them, this article can be rescued. And if they refrain from putting commercial external links on pages other than the InstaBook article itself (if there is one) or the PediaPress article, we shouldn't have much problem about it. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 17:29, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Not Delete</b>. He is notable as a pioneer in the fledgling 'Books on Demand' field. He has patents as well as business operations in that arena. A google search turns up a bunch of hits on him as well as his company. The article is neutral and does not violate any copyrights that I see. Please keep it.--JustKeith 03:57, 19 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— Kperkins411 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kperkins411_d0c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kperkins411">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Changing my vote as well, as the sources seem to establish verifiability and notability for InstaBook, and Victor Celorio founded the company. My concern, however, is that the articles don't seem to say much about him other than "Victor Celorio founded Instabook", so perhaps we should be putting this information into InstaBook and redirecting this page there. (By the way, I'm <i>not</i> convinced that his books are at all notable; they all have Amazon sales ranks over 4 million, and that's the ones that even <i>have</i> a sales rank. I would imagine it's not hard for the founder of a company that prints books on demand to get his books published.) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave6_6c0a.html" title="User:Dave6">Dave6</a> 08:57, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-Notable Internet-only Neologism</p>
<p>Please see: <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms</a> - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 07:33, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To wit:</p>
<p><b>Articles on neologisms</b></p>
<p>Some neologisms and protologisms can be in frequent use and it may be possible to pull together many facts about a particular term and show evidence of its usage on the Internet or even in larger society. It may be natural, then, to feel that Wikipedia should have a page devoted to this new term, but this is not always the case. There are several reasons why articles on (or titled with) neologisms may not be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is that Wikipedia is <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">not a dictionary</a>, and so articles simply attempting to define a neologism are inappropriate.</li>
</ul>

<li>The second reason is that <b>articles on neologisms frequently attempt to track the emergence and use of the term as observed in communities of interest or on the internet — without attributing these claims to <u>reliable secondary sources</u>.</b> If the article is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> (see <i>Reliable sources for neologisms</i>, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia. This is true even though there may be many examples of the term in use.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Reliable sources for neologisms</b></p>
<p>Support for article contents, including the use and meaning of neologisms, must come from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, not truth. <b>To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research">secondary sources</a> such as <u>books and papers</u> <i>about</i> the term —</b> not books and papers <i>that use</i> the term.</p>
<p>Neologisms that are in wide use — but for which there are no treatments in secondary sources — are not yet ready for use and coverage in Wikipedia. They may be in time, but not yet. The term does not need to be in Wikipedia in order to be a "true" term, and when secondary sources become available it will be appropriate to create an article on the topic or use the term within other articles.</p>
<p>An editor's personal observations and research (e.g. finding blogs and books that <i>use</i> the term) are insufficient to support use of (or articles on) neologisms because this is <i>analysis</i> and <i>synthesis</i> of primary source material (which is explicitly prohibited by the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research policy</a>). - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 23:57, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who said anything about deleting the history? I'll undelete the entire thing including its entire history, move the entire thing to your userspace, and delete the auto-created redirect from article space. That's what providing you with a copy means. Giving you just the latest copy for you to work on would be a breach of GFDL. However - userfying the article before the AFD is closed means that no community decision would be reached, and you could just move it back if it were deleted, wasting everyone's time and sidestepping the deletion process.

<li>The sourcing here is quite poor. Sources are only cited for the Klingons and Starfleet ranks. The source for the Starfleet ranks is not adequate, because it cannot have described the cadet insignia, because they did not exist in the real world in 1988. Furthermore, no sources are presented for the Romulans, Cardassians and Bajorans. I think the Bajoran militia ranks in particular were never as firmly established as this, and seem to be speculation based on existing traditional british/us army ranks. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 13:26, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a tough one. While I in principle think a "list of the sultans of Sulu" can be a good subject for an article, this isn't it. SInce its creation in september 2005 (i.e. more than a year ago), it has been tagged for cleanup, and for months it has been tagged for NPOV and lack of sources as well. The article is a mess, and is one big POV list. It seems unsalvageable to me, and none of the editors (over a 100 edits so far) has done a serious try to improve the article (wrt Wikipedia standards and policies). As it stands and has stood for over a year, it is POV, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and heavily lacks <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources, and I think it would be better to just erase it completely, and if needed start again from scratch, with a sourced, neutral article (neutral meaning: if there are disputes, show both sides, with their sources, and without taking a stance). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't mind keeping it, but I do feel that in this case, since there isn't nothing really salvageable in the history, it may be better to just get rid of all the heavily POV history (never mind the terrible layout, just look at the contents) and start from scratch. I think cleanup has had more than its chance (over a year!), so saying that we should keep this because it needs to be cleaned is basically saying that any article, no matter how bad, can be kept indefinitely. I wonder where the benefit is in that, and if we in those cases aren't better of without an article than with a bad one. But anyway, I would be happy if the result of this AfD was a much improved article, then it hasn't been for naught. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:09, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page was split from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_minute_%28time%29_1e3f.html" title="New York minute (time)">New York minute (time)</a> more than a year ago, and I'm not sure why it needed a split, or why this info wasn't deleted in the first place. This page, apart from the definition of the term, is pure original research, and I cannot find any verification that this term is commonly used in the way this article claims it is. (I certainly have never heard it used this way. Any New Yorkers care to comment?) Even if this term <i>is</i> widely used in this manner, which I doubt, this page should be <b>nuked</b> anyway for being virtually all original research. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="green">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="red">ka</font></a> 08:37, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

</blockquote>
I personally feel that the two "reasons for deletion" listed by the prodder are flawed, and I am listing here as proscribed in the steps for deletion (contest prod means AfD, in most cases). Currently a procedural nomination - there may be some good reasons to delete this, other than those listed (which I have given my opinion for).

<li><b>Keep</b> - I see no reason to delete this... it was taught in local history classes here and occasionally makes it way into the local paper for debate.

<dd>I've seen no independent sources vouching for the BOCA as a reliable independent "award" or "contest", let alone a "major music competition". As you can see on their website <a href="http://www.varsityvocals.com/boca/faq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.varsityvocals.com/boca/faq.html" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, their submission criteria is mainly composed of the submissions not having tuning problems or poor production quality. There is no indication on their website that they reject a significant quantity of the reasonably recorded songs that they recieve, as would be indicative of some kind of competition. In fact, you can hardly call it an award when you have to pay them! You have to buy 50 of their CDs at $5 a piece to get on their CD! It's a glorified self-produced CD. If winning the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Merit_Scholarship_Program_18f8.html" title="National Merit Scholarship Program">National Merit Scholarship</a> required you to pay them $200, I doubt anyone would put it on their resume. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 09:20, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, I missed this policy decision. Can somebody point me to where it was discusssed? Particularly with reference to the British education system where secondary schooling ends at 16, rather than 18 like most countries, with the result that there are over 200 such colleges in the UK. Most of these would have nothing interesting to say about them. So why have articles on them? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 21:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Notability of all post-secondary institutions was in a previous draft proposal of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, it has been removed in the last few weeks. In general, each further education college will either have a local monopoly over the A-level curriculum, or will be one of very few institutions offering the qualifications. I suggest this may satisfy the local aspect of criterion 2 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. For a large city like London, this is less obviously so than in more rural areas, so I defer to editors with local knowledge and decline to vote. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 15:48, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If Wikipedia went by the proposed rules of <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, most of the articles on software titles in the encyclopedia would be subject to deletion. But Xtorrent has been the subject of a number of articles and a great deal of blog hype in the Mac community due to the notoreity of its developer, so I would argue that it passes even that stringent test. Xtorrent is also notable because it is one of the first attempts to <b>commercialize</b> a Bit-Torrent application on a large, mainstream scale, which has already stirred some controversy. // <font color="#0033BB">Josh</font><font color="#001166"><em>Kagan</em></font> <sup><a href="../../../j/r/k/User%7EJrkagan_8c1f.html" title="User:Jrkagan">Jrkagan</a> | <a href="../../../j/r/k/User_talk%7EJrkagan_c664.html" title="User talk:Jrkagan">talk</a></sup> 10:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Your rationale for keeping is that <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> isn't applied enough and thus, shouldn't be in this specific case we are looking at? Why use logical fallacies? Just because the person next to you was driving 100MPH and you were only driving 80MPH doesn't mean you can't be pulled over and ticketed. <b>Furthermore,</b> if there are 'a number of articles and a great deal of blog hype' why aren't they listed as sources or cited or linked... or 'anything'? The proposed guideline asks for several independent sources of coverage for an application -- you see only MacDailyNews has been linked and even then it may only barely pass the 'article is more then a recap of download link, report version release' -- but I'll say that MDN article passes that standard. So your argument comes down to 'don't pick this app to delete when others might have problems', there is a lot of hype but there are no links that I can post to the hype and there is controversy that I also can't seem to cite or reference. When you have a actual rational for saving this article like multiple reviews, a userbase or something noteable -- please post it on wiki but right now it fails. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMacMan_b672.html" title="User:MrMacMan">MrMacMan</a> 18:14, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A quick Google search for the application's name yields over 140,000 hits, including a link indicating that over 1200 people dugg the story on digg.com <a href="http://digg.com/apple/BitTorrent_Done_Right_Watanabe_s_Xtorrent_Previewed" class="external free" title="http://digg.com/apple/BitTorrent_Done_Right_Watanabe_s_Xtorrent_Previewed" rel="nofollow">http://digg.com/apple/BitTorrent_Done_Right_Watanabe_s_Xtorrent_Previewed</a> when Phill Ryu reviewed it, and Ryu's blog is one of the most popular Mac blogs in existence. So, my actual rational [sic] is that the application is notable, and it is improper to delete an article about a notable application by a notable author.

<dd><b>Hope OR never lets you down again...</b>: Sadly, though it's an interesting read, I don't think this can be saved from ORdom, I'd be willing to make a go at fixing it or merging or doing something with it, because it looks like an informative list if nothing else. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is probably also prone to the "hey! you forgot &lt;insert obscure one-hit-wonder here&gt;!" unmaintainability issues. Any ideas on something constructive that could be done with the list? it's obvious someone took a lot of time on this and it's a musical genre I'm a big fan of, so if something could be done with all or part of it (IE transwiki, a music site, ect.)

<dd>Something constructive would be tracking down culture mag references that say each and every song on there is important. Not just chart placing, as that hardly denotes the sort of lasting influence that "key" implies (and then the list might as well be titled "Chart topping new wave artists"), but also claiming some sort of other effects. --<a href="../../../e/y/r/User%7EEyrian_d64b.html" title="User:Eyrian">Eyrian</a> 05:08, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> There's really no assertion that she meets any part of BIO. Instead, the assertions to notability are that she's notable as chair of the board or successor to Wales. While it's true she's chair, Wales is still far more the "face" of wikipedia for all intents and purposes. (For example, it's his quasi-likeness that appears <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home" class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) After him is Brad Patrick, who has a higher profile in day-to-day operations as the Executive Director, but his article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brad_Patrick_0af2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brad Patrick">was redirected</a>.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 21:38, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On the contrary, a guideline is just a guide for those who can't make a decision without it, it's not a policy and it should never supersede simple common sense. Personally, I consider any guideline which would deny notability to the chair of the Wikimedia board to be a stupid guideline, which I'll happily ignore. Just because she's new in the post and is no media whore doesn't change the fact that she's the head of an entity which controls a top-20 website. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBramlet_Abercrombie_9dae.html" title="User:Bramlet Abercrombie">Bramlet Abercrombie</a> 00:37, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Gay stereotyping is hardly a valid article for wikipedia. It consists of only a few very vague sentences, which amount to not everyone who has "gay traits" (with no explanation or example of what gay traits are) is gay. Also wikipedia doesn't seem to have any articles for any other races such as Scottish, Norse, Irish, Frech, or Italian. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 04:40, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> the reason that there is only a few sentence is because I wanted to remove the crap content immediately but didn't have time to expand the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I was reading it and asked myself <i>WTF? This is a dicdef - did someone delete all the content?</i> Turns out yes, yes they did. Seems like a reasonable article idea, but right now it's a dicdef and an unsourced assertion that gay stereotyping come from homophobia (a dubious assertion, given how frequenty non-homophobes stereotype gays as well) and is completeley unreferenced. I hope someone will bring it up in quality.

<p>Not a notable enough character. Never appears in the film or TV show and is simply mentioned ocasionally by Borat.

<li>From a pizza delivery driver:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is a subject that needs to be addressed. As pizza delivery drivers we need to spread the word about numerous subjects. For one, the delivery charge does not go to the driver. 2, describing, in detail, what our jobs entail. Such as vehicle usage, gas reimbursement, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If anything, I think we can make a page dedicated to "Pizza Delivery Tipping". The reasoning for this, is that many people feel that pizza delivery is not the same as restaurant delivery and that they aren't required to tip as would be a server. We need to get detailed and explain this thoroughly. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.94.110.134 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.94.110.134_b711.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.94.110.134">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's not a English-language term. It's a term used in many Indian languages (Hindi/Bengali/Gujarati/etc.) for a man who lives in his in-laws house, instead of his own. Most of the stuff in article seems to be exaggerated. There's a movie called "Ghar Jamai", though. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 18:26, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The term is used in subcontinent with different pronounciations and synonyms. In Urdu the word "Ghar Damad" is used where damad is the urdu word for son-in-law.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm new to editing Wikipedia articles. I'm not given enough time to edit the article properly. I was in the middle of editing the article when I got the obtrusive message stating it's nominated for deletion. Note my link website to the AUFORN official website. It does exist. It's in the External links section of the article (works in progress as i write this). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mantom555 (<a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMantom555_6c1a.html" title="User talk:Mantom555">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mantom555_f070.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mantom555">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>The AUFORN website is not a Wikipedia reliable enough source to use to justify a separate article on AUFORN. You need to have footnotes (references) and those footnotes need to cite to newspaper articles, books, and the like. I checked available newspaper articles. Most of the newspaper articles on AUFORN only mention when they are having a meeting and have a quote or two from an AUFORN member. I've created numerous Wikipedia articles and, even with enough time to edit the article properly, there is not enough information about the organization AUFORN contained in newspapers to support an independent Wikipedia article on the organization AUFORN. If you really want a separate Wikipedia article on AUFORN, issue press releases to have one or several reliable newspapers write up the history of AUFORN. Then you can use those newspaper articles to build the Wikipedia AUFORN article. If you locate enough Wikipedia reliable sources containing information on the organization AUFORN, post a note on my talk page and I'll help you create a proper Wikipedia article.-- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 16:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Reference the article is not enough. The article needs footnotes. A footnote is a link between the end of a sentence and the listed source. None of the 10 sources were linked directly to the end of a sentence. I added footnoted fact to give you an example of how to footnote a sentence. Before this article is deleted, you may want to use the 10 sources in that article as footnotes to the facts listed in the article. However, make sure that the footnoted source supports the fact stated in the article. Also, there needs to be Wikipedia reliable sources. A person's web page may be reliable for some facts, but it usually is not Wikipedia reliable for most facts. If there is to be a Wikipedia Auforn article, then Auforn needs to get its history in a newspaper such as those in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_newspapers_in_Australia_972a.html" title="List of newspapers in Australia">List of newspapers in Australia</a> and/or perhaps a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/105-2065508-8533217?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Auforn" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/105-2065508-8533217?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Auforn" rel="nofollow">book</a>. I think a main problem is that Auforn itself has no interest in promoting its own history. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.auforn.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.auforn.com/" rel="nofollow">Auforn website</a>. Even they do not have a history of the Auforn organization. If an Auforn article can be created in the future, one reason to send that new article to AfD would be that the organization does not want its history publicized. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 17:35, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not going to suggest that my vote counts as I am the one that created the page, but I just wanted to put forth an argument as to why I believe he is notable. The <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dropkick_Murphys_5d0d.html" title="Dropkick Murphys">Dropkick Murphys</a> are an increasingly popular band and continue to put forth "Never Forget Chickenman." This causes people to wonder just who "Chickenman" was. I created this page to answer just that question.

<li><b>Keep</b> As Num1dgen points out, I did already say I thought he was notable. As the page stands now it does look like it is simply a memorial, but I think it can be reworked. For instance,rather than say GR grew up in Dehdam and lived there with his gf it should read something to the effect of GR, more commonly known as chickenman, was the inspiration for the Dropkick Murphy's Never Forget Chickenman campaign. Bumper stickers and t-shirts with this saying can be found all over New England.... Then it can go on to explain more about him,and finally what the campaign hopes to accomplish.</li>

<li><b>keep</b> and watch very carefully, per all others. There are criteria that a person needs to fulfil in order to be a dictator and RS should be supplied with every addition.

<li>The page starts by saying that it is a list of people 'commonly regarded as dictators'. That creates a difficulty because even in undeniably democratic countries like the UK people accuse forceful leaders of being "dictators" - see <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5143822.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5143822.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC News story</a>. Reading through what others say, why not try to set out some key characteristics of dictators, e.g. lack of real accountability and unwarrantably restricting opposition, and then see who fits? I do see the value of having a list like this but there should be some solid reason for appearing on it. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 12:18, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Clearly some dictators are utter tyrants and others comparatively begnine. There will clearly be aguments over who should be included; perhaps there should be two sections - one for those who definitely fit the definition and another for those whose inclusion in it is disputed. The dispuyted cases could then be argued out on talk pages. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 17:45, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Perhaps the most POV page on wikipedia. In modern terms, a dictator isn't a title, it is a term based on a subjective point of view. Most, if not all the names on the list are debatable and disputable containing multiple points of view. NPOV says
<blockquote>
<p>The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views. The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these should be presented fairly. None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being the truth, and all significant published points of view are to be presented, not just the most popular one.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yet this page asserts one point of view as the truth by its very title.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: the word dictator has a negative meaning. Democracy in its western meaning is a phenomenon of 20th century. So leaders of earlier times were all undemocratic in its modern meaning. However they were not necessarily bad people. The word dictator has a negative meaning. We need to include British qeen and Kings and princes of Denmark and Netherlands etc. here as well. <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorbeh_dd41.html" title="User:Gorbeh">Gorbeh</a> 14:38, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now I read the criteria again. It is vague. Many of the rulers mentioned do not have absolute power. Many of these countries have parliament, elections and the king have to work in the framework of law. The very good example is Iran. The leader is not a democrartic leader. However he is not able to do what ever he wants. He has to follow the law and can in principle be kicked out if he does something against the law. And the law can only gain legitimacy by a referendum. I suggest change the name of the article to <b>Undemocratic leaders</b> rather than dictators (too strong). <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorbeh_dd41.html" title="User:Gorbeh">Gorbeh</a> 14:48, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Nomination did not include a valid reason for deletion from <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a>. Last time I checked, lists with some disputed POV or OR entries where not candidates for deletion themselves just because some entries contained errors. We can always reduce this to include only Roman dictators, Stalin, Mao and Hitler and maybe few other obvious cases that only crackpot would dispute. Then we wait a decade or two for historians to sort out the mess, or more likely present references both supporting and opposing the dictator label for a given list item. 172's position seems to boil down to something like: <i>Most professional historians disagree among themselves whether to classify a given person as a dictator. Therefore we cannot label anyone as dictator</i>. What is this kind of reasoning if not just disguised <i><a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_populum.html" title="Argumentum ad populum">argumentum ad populum</a></i> with little <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> thrown in? Maybe professional historians cannot arrive to conclusions starting from a dictionary definition and expanding it into usable political typology because their branch of science is (yet) too immature or suffers from (currently not well understood) epistemological flaws? Should we also delete all other lists where the list element is Weber's <i><a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealtyp.html" title="Idealtyp">idealtyp</a></i> and where the term is in general use (e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_emotions.html" title="List of emotions">List of emotions</a>) just to satisfy historian's desire for pretence of knowledge (to steal a phrase from professor Hayek)? <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 10:41, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> as noted above, no policy- or guideline-based reason for deletion, and the Ero Goru movement is a very real and existant phenomeon in Japanese culture spanning across art, music and (more recently) fashion.

<p>Further explanation: Firstly the 49000 Google hits you get when you search on "Azure Flame" are not actually for this singer - in fact, I could only find one or two that referred to her. Secondly, the user had not only created an article for the singer, but another under the name under which she wrote a book, another entry for her autobiography (which was self-published) and another for her album, which again has no notability. They had also created interwiki links, but when I checked, none of them existed on the other wikipedias. If I had spotted this article when it was first set up, I would have speedy deleted it. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 23:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please <b>keep</b>. It certainly has historical significance, having had a sizable German Catholic congregation dating from before the civil war. I found the German scroll interesting as a testament to (rather odd) attitudes of German Catholic immigrants in the 19th century.

<p>I am not sure exactly what the position of Costituency Assistant to a (presumably Canadian) MP entails, but it looks like he's more of an intern at the office of some MP. The article also fails to mention anything he did while being Constituency Assistant but talks at length about his achievements at school. Maybe someone can convince me otherwise, but methinks Craig should wait a couple of years until he's an elected official himself, then maybe someone else will write an article about him - at the moment it looks like just another vanity article. -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 20:42, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm concerned that this article somewhat reads as an advert for the "Tantric Massage Association", but moreso that the references don't appear to be reliable sources.

<li><strike><b>Keep</b></strike> - I think an association of practitioners is a valid source. However, it appears that who created the technique is disputed.

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike>You are right, Syrthis. And there is not only this article, there is also one about the Tantric Massage Association.&#160;;-) The topic was discussed twice in the German Wikipedia and the article was deleted twice. There are no reliable sources that Andro invented the so called Tantramassage (except the website of his own Association, which represents a minority of practitioners in Germany and Switzerland). The mentioned book from Stubbs exists (it has more to to with erotic massage than any sort of Tantrism) and proves that the terme was used years before Andro used it (there are several editions from several publishers). --Edi Goetschel 22:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you can find a source that docuements the history of the use of the term, you can use and cite it. You just can't <i>infer</i> from book publication dates, etc. Also, note that the article is titled "Tantra massage" not "Tantric massage". Is there a difference as <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> suggests below? Is "tantra massage" simply a well-defined and possibly trademarked form of "tantric massage"? If so, both TMA <i>and</i> you could be right, "tantric massage" existed and was refined into official "tantra massage" by the German dude. Still you need to docuement the respective dates from reliable source to make any statement about primacy. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_Xyzzy_0e2b.html" title="User:Frater Xyzzy">Frater Xyzzy</a> 22:52, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Tantra and Tantric are one in the same. The term 'Tantra' is a noun, whereas 'Tantric' is an adjective. The correct term for a massage based on the practice of tantra would be a "Tantric Massage" Again, any first year student of tantra would know this. The fact that you people are discussing issues such as this is quite telling. Please, if you don;t know anything about tantra, move on to another subject. - Etheric One</li>

<li>Those of us who have studied tantra certainly understand that Andro's organization is a front for marketing. For goodness sakes, take one of Daniel Odier's workshops, or read his books. I recommend "Tantric Quest". It'll put a perspective on the matter. In the book, he writes about performing tantic massage with his master back in the 1950's. What is amazing to me is that any novice in tantra clearly understands Andro had nothing to do with "inventing" the tantric massage modality. I mean, please ... that is preposterous and you know it. And, if not, you better go write someting about something you do know and leave this subject to others who have studied tantra.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.123.131.226_f721.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.123.131.226">70.123.131.226</a> (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.123.131.226.html" title="User talk:70.123.131.226">talk</a>) 14:06, 16 December 2006 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> - about Edi Goetschel and his personal war against Tantra Massage:
<dl>
<dd>I want to inform you about the person Edi Goetschel. For some reason he is very much against Tantra Massage and tries to make it miserabel whereever he can. It was mainly the work of Edi Goetschel to destroy the German Articel with similiar arguments like he uses here.</dd>
<dd>There is a growing scene of people who work with Tantra Massage in Germany and Switzerland. These people use the massage concept of Andro, who is a very experienced Tantra and Massage teacher - he was the first person who used this "Tantra Massage Concept" - not only the term "Tantra Massage" but a comlete concept for a full body massage.</dd>
<dd>Out of his students developed some very motivated practitioners who made his work more and more popular.</dd>
<dd>Tantramassage practitioners do not want to be mixed up with prostitutes!</dd>
<dd>The Original Tantramassage in the style of Andro has a very clear structure and clear borders, sexual exchange is not allowed.</dd>
<dd>It is not right to merge this articel with <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erotic_massage.html" title="Erotic massage">Erotic massage</a> because <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erotic_massage.html" title="Erotic massage">Erotic massage</a> is not specified and can be anything.</dd>
<dd>By the way there are about 300 people in Germany working with Tantra Massage (Andro's style) most of them work together in massage instituts and most of these instituts are members of the Tantra Massage Association.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Kaukaukau, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a messageboard for your personal opinion about other persons!</b> If there are any sources, that proof that Andro is the inventor of the tantric massage, I will accept it. Till now he is only the inventor of the "Original Tantramassage" (as a brand), but not at all of the so called Tantramassage. Perhaps you know his publication about the concept you mentioned. Its title is Berühre mich. Anregungen für erotische Massagen (tranlated: Touch me. Inspirations for erotic massages). So why do you pretend Andros massage has nothing to do with erotic massage? Finally is not true that most of the "institutes" are member of the Association. Most practioners are not! Only 13 massage parlors in Germany and one person in Switzerland are affiliated to the Association. --Edi Goetschel 00:01, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. I'm closing as a default keep for now. Wikipedia cannot make a comparison between two things. No matter how well referenced each of the things compared it, it will still be original research. All we can do is report comparisons made by other scholars. We report research, we don't do it. That's a fine but important line. I'm closing as keep for now to allow the article to be re-written with citations to comparisons being made elsewhere. If such cannot be added after a reasonable time, then the article MUST be deleted. If it isn't properly cites, I invite someone to re-nominate it after, say, two months, or alternatively an admin to delete it on the strength of this debate. -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 22:37, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

No <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources given, and none seem available as far as I can see (see e.g. the 410 Google hits, which don't look to be really about the subject<a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=ido+novial+compared+-wikipedia&amp;hl=nl&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?q=ido+novial+compared+-wikipedia&amp;hl=nl&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>, and the fact that there are no Google hits for any text containing either "novial and ido compared" <a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22novial+and+ido+compared%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22novial+and+ido+compared%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[82]</a> or "ido and novial compared" <a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22ido+and+novial+compared%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22ido+and+novial+compared%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[83]</a>. For the moment, no encyclopedic content at all. Oh, not a reason for deletion, but using a Christian prayer as the comparison text in the article (and similar ones) is probably not the best choice for a neutral text about languages intended to unite the world in friendship. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> and expand. This is evidently a nascent form of something much like the article <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto_and_Novial_compared_5618.html" title="Esperanto and Novial compared">Esperanto and Novial compared</a>. A link needs to be added from the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novial.html" title="Novial">Novial</a> page once this reaches an equivalent form. I'm puzzled how this could be considered original research any more than a table of corresponding identities of circular and hyperbolic functions. Nothing has been made up and all is well known. Links should be added of course, but this page has just started. To see what it will probably evolve into, look at <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto_and_Novial_compared_5618.html" title="Esperanto and Novial compared">Esperanto and Novial compared</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps some more explanation as to why this is neither frivolous nor trivial is in order. Otto Jespersen was by far the most sophisticated and scholarly of the creators of auxiliary languages. Today he is best remembered for his profound and extensive work on English grammar. His creation of Novial was driven by the inadequacies of Esperanto and Ido. He wrote on this in <i>An International Language</i>, referenced on the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novial.html" title="Novial">Novial</a> page. References to this will undoubtably be added as the article expands.</p>
<p>In comparing Ido and Novial, we can see why Novial is what it is, and more importantly, we can see what a first-rate linguistic thinker thought had to be changed. The topic is of interest even though nowadays the notion of an artificial international auxiliary language seems hopelessly quaint.</p>
<p>Finally, let me address the paternosters that <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> found offensive. In fact, this is a tradition of comparative linguistics, perhaps because a translation is almost always readily available. (Another traditional comparison is the fable of the Sun and the North Wind.) Furthermore, Novial was not intended to unite the world in friendship, though I'm sure Jespersen wouldn't have minded if it did. It was intended as a practical language for international business and science. It may not sound practical today, but when it was created it sounded like plain good sense to many level-headed people. <a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 03:02, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b>: <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto_and_Novial_compared_5618.html" title="Esperanto and Novial compared">Esperanto and Novial compared</a>, the page you use as an example for what this will become, has no sources or references at all. References to the work of Jespersen, if added, are no secondary sources of course, as he is the creator of Novial (and involved with Ido as well). How do you judge that this is <i>not</i> <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>? As for the "unite the world in friendship", this comes from the introduction to the page <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novial.html" title="Novial">Novial</a>: "He devised Novial to be an international auxiliary language (IAL), which would facilitate international communication and friendship, ". As for the prayer, from <a href="../../../e/s/p/Talk%7EEsperanto_and_Novial_compared_8b2f.html" title="Talk:Esperanto and Novial compared">Talk:Esperanto and Novial compared</a>, it looks to me as if people are making up their own translation of the prayer, not using a standard version. So what is then the value of it, and why not use some neutral text? I don't really care about tradition, especially not when it is non-neutral. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:50, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"He devised Novial to be an international auxiliary language (IAL), which would facilitate international communication and friendship, " I've read a great deal by Jespersen about Novial. I doubt whether he ever made such a statement. That's probably the personal opinion of the editor who wrote it. Wikipedia has a lot of opinion and clearly erroneous statements are sometimes made.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: "if this article is deleted, then so should those" is an old argument in AfD's and usually considered invalid. As I have discussed above, none of these articles has <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources discussing these comparisons (making them for the moment <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), and only one of them has any sources at all. Being linked from a navigation box is not a reasdon to keep any articles, being helpful and interesting is not a reason for keeping either, being old and quite well developed isn't either. Do these articles follow Wikipedia policies? No. Can they be rewritten to be compliant to Wikipedia policies? Perhaps, but that has not been shown by the defenders of the article in question, and the "good" comparable examples don't show it either.

The following are specific quotes from "An International Language" (1928) by Professor <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Jespersen_e8ef.html" title="Otto Jespersen">Otto Jespersen</a> (the book which first described Novial: note that the book is about Novial, not <b>Ido</b>, but let's see how often Ido is mentioned).</p>
<p><br />
"Therefore in <i>Novial</i>, as well as in Esp-<b>Ido</b>, we simplify the spelling in all words containing double letters in the national languages, from which the words are taken: pasa (E pass, F passer), efekte, komun (F commun, E common), etc. "</p>
<p>"This is especially the case with some more or less learned words, which it would be awkward to spell with j: geologia, geografia, and others with geo-, genealogia and others in -logia; further, gigante, gimnastike, tragedie, genie, general, original, geste; to these I count also rege 'king' on account of regal, regalia, though <b>Ido</b> has rejo."</p>
<p>"Imaje is better than image, and there is some justification for the <b>Ido</b> differentiation of this word and imagina vb imagine."</p>
<p>"The second pronunciation, [ts], is the one given everywhere to c in Esperanto and <b>Ido</b>, in the formerly undoubtedly on account of Zamenhof's Polish extraction; and in both languages c is used extensively with this value not only before e and i, but also before other vowels."</p>
<p>"In <b>Ido</b> we have the demonstratives ca, co, taken from F ce, but with a pronunciation and endings not found in F, and further a great many verbs like formacar, importacar, where the sound [ts] is taken, curiously enough, from the Latin (F E etc.) ending -ation, which has no place as such in the system."</p>
<p>" <b>Ido</b> alleviates these groups and has such forms as cienco, ecepter, ceno scene, etc."</p>
<p>". This means one sound less than <b>Ido</b> has, in the sc-words, and the group [ks] instead of [ts] in xc."</p>
<p>"Very often, where <b>Ido</b> has c, it is best to reintroduce the L ti, e.g. tendentie, silentio, natione, sientie, pretie - with the ordinary pronunciation of t, not with [ts] or [S]. in some of these ti is found in derivatives in some languages, e.g. D pretiosen, Dan pretiosa."</p>
<p>"This sh is found in <b>Ido</b> in a certain number of words, which seem worth of admission into our language on the principle of being known to a greater number of people than other expressions for the same ideas; some of them are common to E D Sc, others are found only in one or two of these languages; I give the most important of them, and quote them as above without any grammatical endings: sham, shark, shel, shild, shirm, shov, shovel, shu, shultr, shutr."</p>
<p>"In Esp and especially in <b>Ido</b> z is used extremely often, not only where F E write s between two vowels (rozo, amuzar, akuzar, fiziko), but also where the voiced sound is found only in one of these languages (krizo E crisis, bazo base, words beginning with iso- or ending with -ozo, E -ous), and even where neither language has the voiced sound (karezar caress, mazo mace, F massue, kazo case, F cas with mute s, komizo F commis, E salesman)."</p>
<p>"It is no exaggeration to say that this excessive use of the letter z is one of the features of <b>Ido</b> which are least liked in many countries, except perhaps by the few professional phoneticians. To the many millions speaking D I S it will always be a stumbling-block."</p>
<p>"This is D satz disfigured by writing z for the North-German initial sound and by the Polish-Zamenhofian c before the substantive ending -o, the whole thus a very strong argument for a revision of the entire Esp-<b>Ido</b> system."</p>
<p>"As we have seen, <b>Ido</b> is inconsistent; it is so even through writing s where according to its own principles it should undoubtedly have had z: frizo F frise E frieze, fusilo F fusil, gasoza F gazeux E gaseous (generally pronounced with z). "</p>
<p>"The result of this somewhat chaotic distribution of s and z is that in writing <b>Ido</b> one is constantly obliged to look up words in a dictionary, and in speaking it one cannot help hesitating now and then, for no one can remember each word separately."</p>
<p>"I suppose no one can doubt that this consistent use of only one letter where Esperanto and <b>Ido</b> have three, c,s, and z, constitutes a very considerable simplification and lessening of the burden on memory."</p>
<p>"But there may be many interlinguists who will think that this is only possible at the cost of clearness, because as a matter of fact these sounds are often used in Esp and <b>Ido</b> to distiguish words that would otherwise be identical."</p>
<p>"The alphabetical list on p. 174 will show how it is possible to get out of all serious difficulties without disfigurements of well-known words, for it can hardly be called a serious defect in Novial that musa means a female mouse as well as a muse! (<b>Ido</b> musino and muzo with unnatural -o.)"</p>
<p>"Here it is possible to pronounce the combinations of i and u with a following vowel either as one syllable (in which case the stress would fall on the preceding syllable) or else as two, with i or u stressed: the former is the system of <b>Ido</b>, the latter that of Esperanto."</p>
<p>"If we want to make things as easy as possible for everybody, we must therefore avoid the mistake of Idiom Neutral (and to a less extent of Occ) with its heavy groups of final consonants in many words, but must rather imitate Esperanto and <b>Ido</b>, which are made sonorous and pleasant to the ear by their numerous vocalic endings like Italian or Spanish."</p>
<p>"This ending was selected in <b>Ido</b> (with omission of the substantival ending of the singular, thus homi from homo man), the reason being twofold: a vocalic ending was wanted in order to make the addition of the (Esp) accusative -n possible, and on the other hand the s-endings were used as in Esp for the verb."</p>
<p>"NOTE.- Z quite properly gave to his definite article the same ending as to his adjectives: la bona, but he also felt that it would be unsupportable to inflect it like adjectives (lajn bonajn homojn etc.) and therefore made la invariable: Ido was more consistent and made adjectives invariable too (la bona homi). But then <b>Ido</b> had difficulties with "substantivized adjectives" (adjectives as primaries), and there invented the unlucky device of inflecting the article, plural le bona, neuter lo bona."</p>
<p>"It was an important step in advance, when <b>Ido</b> after having had for some years the Esp system established common-sex substantives, e.g. spozo husband or wife, patro parent, with derivative endings for both sexes: spozulo husband, spozino wife, patrulo father, patrino mother (though it yielded to sentimental reasons, which some look upon as prejudices, by also allowing the use of matro for `mother'). <b>Ido</b> also created a common-sex pronoun for the third person, lu by the side of masc. il (ilu) and feminine el (elu)."</p>
<p>And so on and so on and so on (I've only checked a few chapters of the book so far). The comparison of Novial with <b>Ido</b> has obviously been an object of careful consideration by one of the more influential 20th century linguists. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENov_ialiste_f3ef.html" title="User:Nov ialiste">Nov ialiste</a> 23:43, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Yet more quutes from the same book:</p>
<p>"But while the principle is sound, the way in which it is carried out in <b>Ido</b> does not deserve praise in every respect."</p>
<p>"It should be noted, also, that some words had to be changed, because the -in- found in national languages might be mistaken for the feminine suffix, thus Esp has rabeno instead of rabino, and <b>Ido</b> mandareno instead of mandarino (though -in- has been admitted in mandarino `mandarin orange'). As <b>Ido</b> has diciplino for `discipline,' it could not at the same time have diciplo for 'disciple,' and therefore took dicipulo for `disciple' or `pupil' of either sex, which makes dicipulino for a female and dicipululo (!) for a male pupil. Even stranger than this is the treatment of the word for `cousin'; Esp has kuzo for a male and kuzino for a female cousin, consequently <b>Ido</b> has kuzo as a common-sex word, and kuzulo, kuzino for the two separate sexes. "</p>
<p>"Esp and <b>Ido</b> have the prefix ge- for both sexes combined: gepatri parents, gesiori ladies and gentlemen. "</p>
<p>"This rule is carried through in E and must be ours in N (as <b>Ido</b>, but different from Esp): natural formes; ti forme es natural; ti formes es natural, etc."</p>
<p>" Z simply added his adjective ending -a to the personal pronouns: mia, via, lia, etc., which is systematic enough; and <b>Ido</b> took over the same system, adding -a to its personal pronouns, which are somewhat different from the Esperanto ones."</p>
<p>"These were not imitated by <b>Ido</b>."</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> keeps the acc. ending -n, but does not make its use compulsory and specially recommends it in the case of inversion: ilun me konocas, ne ilua spozino, him I know, but not his wife; mea amiko quan vu vidis my friend whom you have seen - thus very often with interrogative and relative pronouns."</p>
<p>"In <b>Ido</b> this play of vowels was extended to the infinitive amar to love, amir to have loved, amor to love in future, to be going to love."</p>
<p>"Several teachers of Esp and <b>Ido</b> say expressly that these six participles constitute one of the greatest difficulties for their pupils (cf. also estus estinta `would have been')."</p>
<p>"Now the corresponding construction would not do in a language of the Esp-<b>Ido</b> type, with an adjectival form of the participle and no indefinite article, because a sentence like me havas perdita klefo (or the plural klefi) would easily be misunderstood as meaning 'I have a lost key (some lost keys)' instead of 'I have lost a key (some keys).' "</p>
<p>"This was at first imitated in <b>Ido</b> (me esas perdinta, me esis perdinta), but to a West-European mind these must always seem clumsy roundabout expressions, and therefore most Idists took readily to the new synthetic forms with inserted -ab-, when these were allowed after some years: perdabis 'had lost', perdabos 'shall have lost', perdabus 'should have lost' (Why perdabas 'have lost' was not adopted at the same time, will ever remain a mystery)."</p>
<p>"It is, of course, possible to form participles of the auxiliaries: hant veni having come, salent veni = <b>Ido</b> venonta. "</p>
<p>"These compound forms may be freely used in apposition, but cannot easily be used as adjuncts in the same way as the Esp-<b>Ido</b> forms can, but then they are not often wanted and relative clauses are always handy."</p>
<p>"The existence of more than one passive participle in Esp-<b>Ido</b> creates some difficulties: what is exactly the difference between esas skribita and esis skribata, between esas skribota and esos skribata - in other words, should the time indication be added to the auxiliary or the main verb? "</p>
<p>" Now this rule was transferred by Z to Esp, and from Esp taken over into <b>Ido</b>, one of the reasons being probably that otherwise it would have been necessary to create a new tense for the shifted future in (3)."</p>
<p>"Now in Novial there is no necessity to follow the Russian rule, and we can easily form the shifted future missing in Esp-<b>Ido</b>, by adding -ed to the auxiliary sal: saled. "</p>
<p>"The <b>Ido</b> synthetic forms videsas, videsis, videsos, etc., are not good, because the most important element, that which should show the passive, is eliminated, and only the empty verb `be' is included."</p>
<p>"On the whole the synthetic forms of <b>Ido</b> are often cumbersome: it is possible to form such passives as naturaligesabis, elektrizadesabos, which are not far from outdoing certain Volapük formations."</p>
<p>"The chief differences between the Esp-<b>Ido</b> system and ours are (1) that in Novial the elements are separate words, in Esp-<b>Ido</b> inseparable word-elements: it is true that Z claimed that each of his suffixes, etc., was independent and separable (which leads to the curious use of suffixes like inda and igi as words in themselves), but this is not true of the verbal endings as, is, u, i etc. "</p>
<p>"The first of these endings is in Novial the same as in Esp and <b>Ido</b>, namely -o, but in our system it serves to denote substantives immediately derived from or connected with a verb and meaning the simple act or state denoted by the verb (nexus-substantives)."</p>
<p><br />
"For the first sb <b>Ido</b>-dictionaries have rulilo, rulbloko, rulajo--rather unnatural formations. The word rule should be kept distinct from role, F rôle--etymologically the same word."</p>
<p>"Kronisa from krone 'crown' would therefore seem correct for 'to crown' (with kroniso coronation), but it must be admitted that 'to provide with a crown' is no fully adequate description of a coronation, and the formation krona with vbsb krono is less dangerous in our system than in <b>Ido</b>."</p>
<p>"It is claimed that this system is both clearer and more natural than those of Esp and <b>Ido</b>. "</p>
<p>"n writing <b>Ido</b> one is constantly confronted with the problem: am I here logical justified in using the immediate formation, or should I use a suffix and which?"</p>
<p>"But if <b>Ido</b> 's rules are too strict, those of Esp are undoubtedly too lax, as they allow any substantive to be made into a verb simply by changing the ending, and vice versa, without taking the meaning into account; each writer may thus follow the practice of his native language or his own individual fancy. "</p>
<p>"The same is the case to some extent in <b>Ido</b>, which has not -iono or -ationo as derivative suffix, but which has a certain number of words in -iono besides some in -aco, vb -acar, taken from national-language words in -ation in half-Russian dress, due to Zamenhof: formaco from formation (R formatsia), operaco, naraco; similarly atenco (= N atentione from atente). In other cases <b>Ido</b> has changed Esp -io into -iono: naciono, profesiono, prepoziciono, but without consistency: religio, ambicio. "</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> has the suffix -uro joined to verbal roots to denote the result or product as distinct from the act itself. "</p>
<p>" Note that our e/a/o-words make it possible to have simpler forms for many Esp and <b>Ido</b> ilo-words; in N -ilo is used only where it is absolutely necessary to start from the verb."</p>
<p>"The latter is the only way in which -izar is used in <b>Ido</b>, but the suffix is really much less widely used in national languages in this than in the first-mentioned meaning, corresponding to Ido -igar, Esp -igi. "</p>
<p>"-AD- taken from such substantives as F promenade, cannonade, fusillade, is used as in Esp and <b>Ido</b> with verbs and verbal sbs for the repeated or continuous act: frapada beat several times (frapado continued beating, frapo a single blow); kantada; parlada go on talking."</p>
<p>"-AN from L is found in a great many words in Romanic and other languages; it means inhabiting or belonging to a class or party: Roman (Romani, -e, -o, -a), Italian, Amerikan, urban, akademian, senatan, vilajan, partisan, leftano member of the "left" party; further the convenient Esp-<b>Ido</b> formations samlandane fellow-countryman, samreligionano, sampartisane, samideane; also altrilandano, etc."</p>
<p>"Esp and <b>Ido</b> have -ema, coined with some reminiscence of the F verb aimer. "</p>
<p>"This suffix is very convenient with adjectives: beleti pretty, varmeti lukewarm, maladeti poorly; it is used extensively in <b>Ido</b> and Esp with verbs, and -eta is of a certain utility in such verbs as rideta smile, dormieta take a nap, salteta caper, frisk about (whence of course verbal sbs rideto, dormieto, etc.); still the use with verbs should not be exaggerated, and there may in rare cases be a little danger of confusion with the passive participle of verbs in -e. "</p>
<p>"The <b>Ido</b> system of composite numerals (70 sepadek, 17 dekesep) is rather confusing."</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> has here the verb mariajar `to marry' with the derivatives mariajo or mariajeso `marriage,' mariajatulo `married man,' mariajatino `married woman,' with the variants mariajitulo, mariajitino; mariajo-festo `wedding'; further, the independent words spozo, spozulo, spozino for husband and wife."</p>
<p>"Even (E): by taking even and self instead of <b>Ido</b> mem (F) and ipse (L) we gain the advantage of having words which are known to several more millions of people and which are unambiguous, while mem is apt to induce all those who know French to use it in the meaning either of N self (F lui-même) or of N sami (F le même)."</p>
<p>"Jus just now, a moment ago (D . . . S, here as in Esp and <b>Ido</b> differentiated from justi, justim)."</p>
<p>"Non may also be used as a prefix, see Prefixes: nonrational irrational; nonnesesarieso (better than <b>Ido</b> neneceseso), etc."</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> went far away to Sanskrit to find ka, which, by the way, does not seem to be used in Sanskrit in exactly the same way; it might have been mentioned that Japanese has an interrogative particle ka, only placed at the end of the sentence."</p>
<p>"It may even be used put twice (as Z uses cxu . . . cxu) to denote two alternatives (<b>Ido</b> from L sive . . . sive), as in rendering Goethe's "Er liest es jedem froh und laut, Ob es uns quält, ob es erbaut!" "</p>
<p>"The discrimination and correct use of prepositions is a very important thing in an IAL, and as <b>Ido</b> has contributed much to perfection in this point, I have used most of the <b>Ido</b> prepositions."</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> dop is very bad: it is taken from I dopo, which is chiefly temporal, not local as <b>Ido</b> dop."</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> has de, but it is confusing to have the three prepositions de, di, da - here supplanted by fro, de, da."</p>
<p>"which is more internationally known than <b>Ido</b> diafan"</p>
<p>"After (E, D in some compounds, Sc efter) is really more international than <b>Ido</b> and Occ pos, an abbreviated L post, which survives only in some compounds like postscriptum."</p>
<p>"Depos in Novial is a separate word (F depuis, S despues, P depois), not as in <b>Ido</b> a compound of de (for which we say fro) and pos, the meaning of which cannot really be inferred from that of the components."</p>
<p>" <b>Ido</b> has L dum like Esp--one of those L words which have not survived in any language."</p>
<p>" This use of an invariable particle seems preferable to the <b>Ido</b> conception of kloko, plural kloki."</p>
<p>"Po (from R Po, Esp, <b>Ido</b>)"</p>
<p>" The form kun (as in Esp <b>Ido</b>) is chosen, because the L kon (con) is found in so many compounds in which it has lost its original meaning"</p>
<p>" <b>Ido</b> has vice, which is used in no language by itself, but is derived ingeniously from words like vice-president--which, however, means a man standing next below the president rather than one who acts instead of him."</p>
<p>"Convention come to play a rôle here as in national languages: for `railway' Esp, <b>Ido</b> and N use fervoyo, fervie, which is modelled on D eisenbahn, F chemin de fer, but might just as well have chosen rel-vie like E."</p>
<p>" Provisionally useful information may be found in <b>Ido</b> dictionaries (best L. H. Dyer's Ido-English Dict, and English-Ido Dict. (I. Pitman and Sons, London, 1924)."</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> distinguishes basa (adj) bass (with compounds like basvoco, basreliefo, basklasa) and bazo base, basis, foundation, bottom."</p>
<p>"Better than <b>Ido</b> skopo (from I: E scope does not mean exactly the same thing); ema serves also for Ido vizar."</p>
<p>"FOGLE `bird' D vogel, E fowl (which in seafowl and fowler has the old meaning), Dan fugl, Sw fågel; better than <b>Ido</b> ucelo (I uccello; F oiseau is too far be of use) and Romanal ave, "which can be recognized by everyone" (Guérard), i.e. everyone that knows Latin, for others will rather think of Ave Maria; S P ave is rarer than pájaro, passaro."</p>
<p>"HUSE (or HAUSE) house E D Sc better than dom-, which both Esp, <b>Ido</b> and Occ have inherited from Volapük"</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> insulo has wrong accent."</p>
<p>"the <b>Ido</b> distinction justa and yusta is arbitrary"</p>
<p>"Similarly <b>Ido</b>."</p>
<p>"LEFT(I) as Occ from E `left' instead of <b>Ido</b> sinistra (L), which has acquired other meaning."</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> creates a totally unnatural word evar `to be so and so old' from L ævum which does not mean that), probably because in F one cannot ask `Combien vieux?' or say `L'enfant n'est vieux que d'une semaine.'"</p>
<p>"OSA `dare,' F oser. Conflict with ose `bone,' F os, I osso, S hueso, is not dangerous, and there is no reason to take osto like Esp and <b>Ido</b> from Greek osteon."</p>
<p>"Thus we distinguish <b>Ido</b> paco, paso, pazo:"</p>
<p>"But for <b>Ido</b> selo (F selle, I S) we must take sadle from E saddle, Sc sad(d)el, D sattel."</p>
<p>"<b>Ido</b> has celar hide "</p>
<p>"The echo-word D summen (<b>Ido</b> zumar) is best made into huma, E hum"</p>
<p>"Esp iri, <b>Ido</b> irar takes the L infinitive ending into the root, which should be avoided"</p>
<p>"VETRE `weather' (D Sc E) on account of the accent better than <b>Ido</b> vetero"</p>

<dd>Yes, and this is the book by the creator of the language, not an independent source. Has someone reliable and independent (per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) cared to make a serious comparison of Novial and Ido since the creator of the former? Furthermore, this explains mainly how the roots of some words were arbitrarily chosen in both languages, which is quite different from comparative linguistics of e.g. English and France, who have an organic history, not a synthetic one. So, we have the original inventor writing about it, and then we have some editors doing original research, but we don't seem to have any independent sources, and indication that this is a scientific field of study, that this gets discussed anywhere but here. Nope, I still see no reason to keep it... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the sources. It seems all very small (for the Ido vs. Novial part), just explaining that Novial is basically a changed version of Ido with some small changes. A paragraph or two in some books about two languages that are spoken by very few (Ido, 200 to 500 speakers) to barely anyone (Novial, less than 50 speakers) and which only gets discussed by a small but dedicated group of enthusiasts (the sources all come from very limited publishers, it seems, so I'm not sure if they are good enough for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) seems to me still a way too small topic for an article, but I guess we'll let other editors decide this. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excuse me, but if you would actually read the sources you might notice that Jacob's 2 books have several chapters concerning Novial and Ido, not a paragraph or 2. Additionally Novial is *not* a changed version of Ido. It is based on Romance and Germanic languages and the most similar previous IAL was Occidental. It differs radically grammatically from Ido, as well as Esperanto. <b>Novial was and is one of the most influential IALs ever</b>. Just because a topic is unfamiliar to you, or you happen to find it uninteresting does not mean that is unencyclopedic, unless Wikipedia is "Encyclopedia for Kiddies and the Poorly Educated". Concerning numbers of speakers I believe that even small or extinct languages are of encyclopedic interest. Maybe you are against AILs, though, in which case I suggest you read the essay <a href="http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/reactions.htm" class="external text" title="http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/reactions.htm" rel="nofollow">"Psychological reaction to Esperanto"</a> by the psychologist Claude Piron.

<dd>In my opinion, your rather lenghty citations prove only that Novial is notable - nobody denied it. Bot we are now discussing the notability of two Paternosters written in esoteric constructed laguages.

<p>This article is still just a stub! We are not discussing "the notability of two paternosters written in esoteric constructed languages" but rather the validity of this article which has just been started, and of which the parallel paternosters will be a small part. Of course a great deal has to be added comparing the grammar, morphology, and so forth. The parallel paternosters are a minimal (but canonical) comparison. I'd like to note that Jespersen was not just some crackpot cooking up his own language in some utopian scheme, but one of the greatest linguists of his time. The dismissal of his work as WP:OR is misguided both because he is no lightweight and because he is not associated with anyone writing the article. Neither is he a contemporary figure. Nor is he the sole source intended for inclusion in this article. <a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 16:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"International language was a subject which he passionately advocated, and he helped to form <b>Ido</b> and later invented <b>Novial</b>. It was a source of bitter disappointment to him that the rising tide of nationalism dispelled any immediate hope of their universal adoption."</dd>

<dd>I really think people should make some effort to find out about a topic before advocating drastic steps such as deletion. I did take the trouble to quote the sources. False statements were made in spite of the appropriate information given within the sources. It might be necessary to read the sources to know what they contain.

<li><i>Comment:</i> A forum post is hardly a credible source, though perhaps I have mistaken the OR as an edit from the <a href="../../../g/e/a/Gears_of_War_aeea.html" title="Gears of War">Gears of War</a> page itself. As discussion on the GOW talk page is strongly against mentioning <i>any</i> sort of weapon without reference to its significance from credible sources, I am under the impression that a GOW weapons list is not warranted. I am also confused by various weapon lists being deleted while others are kept. Currently, the HL2 weapons article is more informative than a technical rundown, which belongs more on StrategyWiki. If I'm not mistaken, Wikipedia is discouraging game guide pages such as this GOW weapons list. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 23:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The weapons need to be mentioned somewhere and listed as they add unique characteristics to the game. However the stats could easily be removed and are unneeded.

<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i>: The weapons are not the game's signatures. The only "selling point" of the game is the Lancer, and based on consensus in <a href="../../../g/e/a/Talk%7EGears_of_War_6a25.html#Weapons" title="Talk:Gears of War">Talk:Gears of War#Weapons</a>, it isn't enough to warrant a section within the article, let alone a standalone article. Nothing in the list adds anything special to the game and are certainly not pivotal; just because a game has weapons doesn't mean you need to create a list talking about all of them. Detailed lists can go on StrategyWiki; there's nothing special about GOW weapons. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 16:14, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>University club. PROD contested. I still do not feel that the references provided to the article do enough to establish the club's notability, especially since most university clubs are non-notable. To me, it seems that the references provided just back up tournament results for specific people, rather than demonstrate the notability of the club as a whole. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 22:40, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am strongly contesting Mr. Andy Saunders' contest of the Queen's University Chess Club article. I have provided a significant number of different references, and am digging up more. While I acknowledge his points, planning and hosting the two most important events in Canadian chess, with international grandmasters competing, is a notable feat for any group, let alone a university club formed entirely of dedicated volunteers who received no payment for their months of planning and weeks of work, and created very successful championships which paid significant prize money to the champions. Several outstanding games, two of which have been referenced to a world-respected chess database, were played in these events. That doesn't happen with garden-variety groups. Then, the Queen's Club took the lead role in creating a new national organization for Canadian chess. So, this blanket, catch-all statement that most university clubs are non-notable definitely does not, in my view, apply here. We apparently have five days to improve the article, and have already significantly done this on the first day after receiving the potential delete notice.

<p>Thanks to Mr. Bradbury for his encouragement. I will take his suggestions to heart, and plan to continue to improve the article. Not to be too hard on Andy Saunders, the Ontario Quizzer, but I took a look at his bio, and he is a trivia guy!! To a certain extent, chess competes with trivia as a mind sport, so there is a little bit of a rivalry subtext here! Organized trivia is a very recent phenomenon. But chess has been played for close to 2,000 years, is played around the world by millions of people (including six million in Canada alone), and there are more nations which are members of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) than any other sports federation except that for soccer (FIFA). Two players need not speak the same language to play a game of chess; knowing the rules is enough! Try trivia with that arrangment, Andy! Also, there have been more published books written about chess than about all other games and sports combined! Chess research has led to significant scientific advancements in other fields, some of which were attained by strong chessplayers. There are more possible ways to play a chess game than there are electrons in the universe. (And that's just with the basic starting position; do stuff like rearrange the pieces, add more pieces, change the board size and shape, add additional dimensions, and the unique possibilities multiply even further.)

<p>Early Music ensemble of unclear notability. Was tagged for speedy-A7, but a basic claim to notability is made (participation in important music festivals at national level).

<p>Non-notable and unsourced. I was taking the advice of someone to make sure and stick to articles and out of politics, which is a good idea although I'm drawn to it. So I hit random article and get this page, and am now getting into politics...</p>
<p>Anyway, the article is nearly two years old, with no discussion page until today when I commented on my earlier prodding of it (which I decided not to do after all). There are no sources for any of the information. I don't think sources are a possibility either - top hits on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Joey+Calderazzo&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Joey+Calderazzo&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">google</a> are his own website, a music listing whose biography on him is identical to the one found on his own webpage, and a bunch of downloading sites. Even <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sick_Puppies_f8b4.html" title="Sick Puppies">Sick Puppies</a> is sourced, so it's no great feat. Probably not notable enough to have sources, thus delete. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Milto LOL pia</a> 22:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>On second thought, it might have potential. It's been unsourced for over 16 months, but not 16 minutes after I posted something to my talk page about it, <a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a> came up with <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/reviews/r0600_003.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/reviews/r0600_003.htm" rel="nofollow">two</a> <a href="http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/artist.aspx?ob=per&amp;src=prd&amp;aid=3397" class="external text" title="http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/artist.aspx?ob=per&amp;src=prd&amp;aid=3397" rel="nofollow">sources</a> I'd skipped over.

<li>This seemed like an article on an important person that should be in Wikipedia, but after following up the links at the bottom, I'm not so sure. The article appears to be partly cribbed (parts word for word with just a change of tense) from the the first reference, a 32 year old church newsletter. Apart from that, I can only verify that he was at the Hong Kong College on whose website he is listed as stated. But, the link gven to Keele University Alumni Obituaries Page does not work. This does though: [<a href="http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/uso/alumni/obituaries/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/uso/alumni/obituaries/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[88]</a>] but his name not does not appear there or anywhere else on the Keele University site. The Conservancy Association has no mention of him (granted, he has been dead six years). What can this mean? <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 19:07, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although there is <i>some</i> assertion of notability in the article, there seems to be nothing to verify it, certainly nothing linked to this orphaned dead-end article. If he were a significant part of the history of the Conservancy Association, there would have been at least a slight mention of him in the external sites... or in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservancy_Association_e2f7.html" title="Conservancy Association">Conservancy Association</a> Wikipedia article. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 02:46, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>At the moment I am still confused as to how this article got on Wikipedia. Robert Rayne was my grandfather and neither myself nor my father knew anything about it until I stumbled across it on a Google search. We can both vouch for pretty much everything in the article and I am in the process of re-writing it to expand on his life much of which has been missed off. <b>Dont Delete</b> Admiral007 21:24, 13 Dec 2006

<li>Per <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Wikipedia's conflict of interest policy</a> I would strongly suggest that neither you nor your father (as members of the immediate family of the subject of the article) do the rewrite, but instead have a third party not affiliated with the family to add the pieces you want to add and remove any perceived inaccuracies. I'd also suggest that if there are sufficient omissions to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservancy_Association_e2f7.html" title="Conservancy Association">Conservancy Association</a> that you could "fill the holes" without any <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> problems if you have no direct affiliation with the group.

<p>A School of Tomorrow school is a private school that uses Accelerated Christian Education curriculum. In these classrooms teachers are called supervisors. Students work individually on their work without direct teaching from the supervisor. Student desks are set up with dividers that do not allow students to see each other. Students have American and Christian flags that they place at the top of their desk to signal that they need help from the supervisor. Students correct their own work with score keys that are kept in a central location for all students to use.</p>
