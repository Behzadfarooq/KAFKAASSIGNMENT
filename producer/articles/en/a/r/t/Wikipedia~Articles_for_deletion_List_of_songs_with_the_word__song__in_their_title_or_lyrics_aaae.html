<p>Although I hate to do it, I nominate this article for deletion. It is hardly enycyclopedic and it will never end! The title, (List of songs with the word "song" in their title or lyrics), is what really got to me. Do we really need a dynamic list of songs and albums that include a single word. What's next, <i>List of songs with the word "of" in their title or lyrics</i>? Furthurmore, I fail to see the importance of the page. <a href="../../../d/g/x/User%7EDGX_7ea7.html" title="User:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">D</font><font color="#000000">G</font></a><a href="../../../d/g/x/User_talk%7EDGX_0a84.html" title="User talk:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">X</font></a> 17:53, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> Is there a policy regarding songlistcruft? I don't think this list is intrinsically more pointless than, say, List of English songs whose title includes the name of a fictional place, List of theme songs which don't mention their show's name in the lyrics, List of songs with brackets in their titles, List of English songs whose title includes the name of a landmark, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_with_the_name_of_a_musical_performer_in_their_title.html" title="List of songs with the name of a musical performer in their title">List of songs with the name of a musical performer in their title</a>, List of albums which do not contain their title track, List of English songs whose title includes nonsense-words, List of songs whose title includes dates and times, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_whose_title_includes_a_phone_number.html" title="List of songs whose title includes a phone number">List of songs whose title includes a phone number</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_self-referential_songs.html" title="List of self-referential songs">List of self-referential songs</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_whose_titles_are_composed_solely_of_numbers.html" title="List of songs whose titles are composed solely of numbers">List of songs whose titles are composed solely of numbers</a> or List of songs containing covert reference to real musicians.

<li>Thats a really good question, I think <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> covers that. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. If afd's don't appear later for the above article, I might have to consider creating one. <a href="../../../d/g/x/User%7EDGX_7ea7.html" title="User:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">D</font><font color="#000000">G</font></a><a href="../../../d/g/x/User_talk%7EDGX_0a84.html" title="User talk:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">X</font></a> 18:44, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I noticed that some of the lists I mentioned above have been through AfD and survived: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_songs_whose_titles_are_comprised_solely_of_numbers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_songs_whose_titles_are_comprised_solely_of_numbers" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_songs_whose_title_includes_a_phone_number" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_songs_whose_title_includes_a_phone_number" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_songs_with_brackets_in_their_titles" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_songs_with_brackets_in_their_titles" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> at a quick guesstimate there's over 1,500 entries here and they barely step outside the bounds of the last 20 years. Any serious attempt to make this list ocmplete would result in the servers imploding. Do we include Dowland's books of songs because they incuded the word song in the name of the book? Do we include lute songs? Lieder? Lieder ohne worte? A list whose selection criteria are utterly arbitrary and of no known significance, which potentially contains many huyndreds of thousands of songs going back hundreds of years. Did I let slip the fact that I don't think much of the conept of this list? I do hope I managed to maintain my legendary air of studied neutrality... <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:11, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is listcruft at its worst. If any of the others ever come up for afd I will hapily vote delete on them. <a href="../../../y/d/a/User%7EYdam_9ecb.html" title="User:Ydam">Ydam</a> 19:14, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article has existed for more than three years and has been edited over 500 times by a lot of different users and IP-numbers; apparently there is some kind of interest from the community and readers in this list, and I don't really like the idea of just throwing away their work. In the absence of a general policy on "lists of songs according to this or that", and with the above-mentioned lists and AfDs as examples that we keep and maintain many strange things in this field, I'd rather err on the inclusionist side. David Sneek 19:21, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Thats why I was reluctant at first at nominating the article. It has a <i>long</i> history dating back to 2003. Even though it does have a long history, I still can't get over the fact that this is listcruft. I don't doubt that the lists were made in good-faith but maybe when they were created, they weren't aware of policies like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../d/g/x/User%7EDGX_7ea7.html" title="User:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">D</font><font color="#000000">G</font></a><a href="../../../d/g/x/User_talk%7EDGX_0a84.html" title="User talk:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">X</font></a> 19:29, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>It just seems to me it just took that long for someone to AfD it...

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Those lists will never be complete or even close to that.

<li>Agree, it's one thing to have a list of songs based around something like it's genre, but just random things doesn't cut it. But I would refran from mass deleting them all per this AFD because seperate Afd's or one AFD that links from them all would be more appropriate. <a href="../../../d/g/x/User%7EDGX_7ea7.html" title="User:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">D</font><font color="#000000">G</font></a><a href="../../../d/g/x/User_talk%7EDGX_0a84.html" title="User talk:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">X</font></a> 20:10, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
