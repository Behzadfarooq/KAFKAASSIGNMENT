<p>This is a user page that user switched to main encyclopedia - it's vain person who believes he's important, but is not notable to the world in general. The key, though, is that if he truly is important enough to have an article in the encyclopedia, he needs to wait and let someone else write it, rather than writing about himself. As a result of writing his own autobiographical entry, this page is full of unverifiable information. 129humility 15:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just because Leonovich is not world famous does not make him any less noted. He has had works performed in Carnegie hall, and completed Tchaikovsky's Cello Concerto. 129humility needs to stop his or her personal quest to delete Mr. Leonovich's biography on Wikipedia. Instead of trying to improve Wikipedia by looking real problems, he or she is making persistant hits on a solitary individual that he or she might or might not know personally. I am well aware of Wikipedia rules of vanity and promotion. I am here to state the facts. As you can see, there is a legitimate reference on the Yuriy Leonovich page: www.tchaikovsky-research.org. This page is mainained by Brett Langston and Alexander Poznansky, authors of the Tchaikovsky Handbook, and other well known biographies on Tchaikovsky's life. The authors are used as references on different pages on Wikipedia. I am not here to explain my means of obtaining information. However, I'd like to see the end of attacks on this article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't see where in the article it is asserted that Leonovich has had works performed in Carnegie Hall, nor how this is verified. It does mention that he has performed at carnegie hall with a religious figure, but I fail to see how this makes him important as a classical musician. As for the Tchaikovsky, while this may be notable, it does not necessarily make Leonovich notable. This is similar to the argument that a professor with one important paper is notable. I believe, and numerous wikipedians agree with me, that the appropriate action would be to mention Leonovich in the context of an article on the Tchaikovsky, rather than to create an article about him. Also, Mr. Lysenko, could you please sign messages with your username, rather than a name that doesn't verify whether you're a seperate user or not? Thanks! 129humility 22:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Comment</b>, guys, rather than fighting at least one party should bother to get some verifiable non-trivial second party references. If they exist there is absolutely no reason for an AfD and further nominations would just get a speedy treatment <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 17:10, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what a second party reference would be. I also don't understand why "humility" believe that I am Mr. Leonovich. That seems to be his only claim, of me writing about myself. I met Mr. Leonovich once, breifly, and have no personal ties to him. And the fact that an important author on Tchaikovsky has noted Mr. Leonovich as someone of importance, seem to me as a good reason to keep the page alive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A second party reference would be some published material that verifies all of the information presented. As is, one is forced to wonder how you, who claim to have met Leonovich only once, could know all of the facts about his history, his childhood teachers' names, and his many unperformed works, unless they were published in, for instance, some reputable biography. That would count as second party. Personal recollections or interviews are considered new research, and are not allowed on wikipedia. Finally, as to my assertion that you are Leonovich: the fact that your facebook profile gives your username as your AIM username and your AOL email address, and that this biography started as your own personal user page seem to be pretty big indicators that you and Leonovich are one and the same person. That and the fact that hours after I had initially questioned the validity of this page, you had mentioned in on your facebook account. 129humility 22:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I don't see notability asserted in the article. If it was confused as self-promotion, it's because that's how it reads. There are lots of cellists and composers in the world, not all are notable. I'll change my vote if notability is established, i.e., via <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 18:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

(this article is in Russian, from a Russian-American paper: Kontinent). However, the article is no less valuable in a differnt language. <a href="http://www.tchaikovsky-research.org/en/Works/th249.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tchaikovsky-research.org/en/Works/th249.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tchaikovsky-research.org/en/Works/th249.html</a> is by a noted Tchaikovsky biographer Brett Langston, who gives credit to Mr. Leonovich for completing Tchaikovsky's unfinished concerto.</p>

<dd>If you are not Yuriy Leonovich, then by an amazing coincidence, your user name is the same as his email address. I understand your concern that a self-authored article runs a bigger chance of being deleted, but you should be honest with the process - it makes it easier for us to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. As to the article, unfortunately, I can't read the first source, but I hope that the closing admin makes sure that somebody does before this AfD closes. The second source is a trivial mention, but it links to this page <a href="http://www.tchaikovsky-research.org/en/features/article004.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tchaikovsky-research.org/en/features/article004.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which, while written by Leonvich himself, seems to be a scholarly work on his completion of the concerto. It seems to me that it would confer notability, <i>if</i> completing the concerto was a notable or unique occurrence in the music field (much like a mathematician solving or proving a famous theorem or equation). Unfortunately, most of us lack the frame of reference for determining if this is a notable act, so sources would be needed to support the following questions: Was the concerto "famous" for being unfinished? Are there any other sources on the concerto and Leonvich's modifications? Has the completed concerto been played anywhere? These are the questions that need to be answered to avoid deletion. Officially, put me down as a <b>Weak Delete</b> - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>.
