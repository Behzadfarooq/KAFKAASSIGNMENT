<p>Deleted by myself under A7, restored by <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">User:Friday</a>. After some discussion and a good deal of time, I'm still not convinced that this particular group would pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; it's possible they'd pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but I'll leave that decision to the community. As I mentioned on the article's talk page, I think the lack of really <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources is itself an indication that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> is lacking. As the article says itself, <i>"Although La Coka Nostra have yet to release a proper single, the mere posting of their songs on their myspace.com page music player..."</i>.

<p>you dont understand anything - maybe you would if you take a minute and read the article instead of typing up total nonsense here. house of pain is history, la coka nostra has nothing to do with them. it is a whole new thing. 87.186.12.193 23:55, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> We DO understand wikipedia policy and guidelines. From that, we see that the 'band' has published no albums (myspace doesn't count). I did read the article or I would have never known the 'band' was made up of the members of HoP and a few other misc artists. Hop may be history, and this may be a 'whole new thang' but if you would like any information kept on wikipedia, the band needs to release at least to release at least one album. If they don't then the logical thing to do is merge them into the Hop article until they do. If la coka nostra has nothing to do with HoP besides it's members, then perhaps you would prefer we change our minds to delete? Those are the only two options available right now. Either we merge this information in the the HoP article and redirect any quereis made for la coka nostra to that article, or we removed the la coka nostra all together. That's it. They don't pass wikipedia policies, but they do make it on one count of WP:WEB, so I was trying to help SAVE the information in some form and I liked HoP as a kid. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:30, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe this article should absolutely not be deleted. La Coka Nostra member ILL BILL's recently released CD "ILL BILL Is The Future - Vol. 2 - I'm A Goon! - Hosted by La Coka Nostra" is available in stores worldwide and has been available on iTunes as of Dec. 19. It contains three proper LCN songs along with LCN interview soundbites. A search of iTunes for "La Coka Nostra" will yield these three songs available for purchase. I think this and the history of the group's members alone warrants the existance of this La Coka Nostra article. The accurate nature of this article and the amount of interest and acclaim already garnered by the group from the La Coka Nostra myspace page and various other interviews/articles easily accessed through a Google search of "La Coka Nostra" further cements the legitimacy of this article. --Strong Management - La Coka Nostra's offical representation.

<li><b>2 Cents</b> - Lady Sovereign had a wikipedia page before her official album dropped, aswell as many other artists. I could understand if this was a local group, or something, but since they have fans from CA to NY, and sell out huge name venues, the page should stay. Ill Bill and Slaine have released two IN STORE albums, both with La Coka Nostra songs on it. Does that not valid the group? Theres no reason the page should be deleted or merged, if Mr. T left the A-Team and did a new show, would that wikipage have to be merged with the A-Team, even though its a whole new show all together? No, it wouldn't. Stop complaining people, its valid and check information. Thanks. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgz33_09cc.html" title="User:Burgz33">---Burgz33</a> 07:56, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>La Coka Nostra is its own project, and constitutes its own page on this website. I've seen this get merged with House of Pain, I'll tell you now, this is NOT House of Pain. This group is rapidly expanding, and deleting it now or merging it again is going to be a waste of everybody's time, since La Coka Nostra WILL be very popular in the very near future. LSN isn't worth some insignificant mention on the House of Pain page. KEEP THIS DAMN PAGE UP. --Sycotherejekt 20:52, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>idiotas?</b></li>

<p>Are you guys idiots just looking for a reason deleting this? Is there ANYONE with ANY insight in the scene that doubt that this is a real group and not "a myspace band". This group got some heavy hype and bootlegs floating around in the NY underground. Not to mention Ill Bill namedropping La Coka Nostra in practically every song he's done lately. Or wearing the La Coka Nostra logo in the Jedi Mind Tricks video for "Heavy Metal Kings". Whats wrong with you? Get a damn grip, will you?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>myspace?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>i got a bootlegged song called 'this is war off' off the <i>Ill BIll Is The Future Vol. II</i> album, i dont think anyone would bootleg a myspace band.. since i would assume they would be trying to get a fanbase by giving songs away for free, hardcore rap is not to my likes but keep the article.. 75.38.84.126 04:07, 26 December 2006 (UTC) [edit] heres some <a href="http://www.dancefrontdoor.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=67007" class="external text" title="http://www.dancefrontdoor.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=67007" rel="nofollow">reassurance</a> or <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk/products/242476-01.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.juno.co.uk/products/242476-01.htm" rel="nofollow">here (where the 1st website links to)</a> (note they are samples)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipidea is not a crystalball on 'what might be'</a>. Is there media coverage NOW? No. Does the band have multiple, independent, third-party, reliable, reputable published sources covering it? No. The ONLY wikipedia guideline it meets is one clause of notability. Not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Tracks on other people's CD's has been noted in past AFD's not to be a valid reason to keep. Myspace or online only music is also not a replacement for a published album, again this has been covered on past AFD's. The point is, no matter what the 'fans' believe, wikipedia has standards. As of today, LCN does not live up to those standards. In the future, if they can pass the pillars of wikipedia, then they certainly should have a page, but not now. Before anyone comments, I strongly believe they should first read and understand all the wikipedia rules and guidelines to understand this is nothing personal. This is just how wikipedia is.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 16:39, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
