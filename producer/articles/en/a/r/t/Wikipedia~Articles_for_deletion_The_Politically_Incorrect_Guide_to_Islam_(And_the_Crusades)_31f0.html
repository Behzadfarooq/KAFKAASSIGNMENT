<p>Not notable enough to have a page. There are thousands of thousands books. A book must be very very notable to have a page(e.g. Bible, Quran, Dante's divine comedy etc etc). I don't expect to find this book while searching in Encyclopedia Britannica for example. Aside from this, the scholarship of the author is also believed to be fundamentally flawed by university professors like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Ernst_52f3.html" title="Carl Ernst">Carl Ernst</a>, please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.Furthermore, if there is any controversy, it should be addressed in "Criticism of X" articles.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 12:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the media attention it has received, including the Fox News interview that we have a link to in the external link section, makes it notable. Another thing is that negative criticism doesn't make it any less notable. That Mr. Carl Ernst has commented on it's writer, actually helps establishing the writers and his books notability. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 13:01, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The book is quite notable and aside from being a conroversial book in its own right has been the topic of numerous news reports as well--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 13:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">User:CltFn</a> created a page for each of Robert Spencer's books in order to promote Spencer's anti-Islam views. His views are controversial and not taken seriously by scholars to the best of my knowledge; he also runs a website that contains material that's arguably Islamophobic, as well as legitimate material. Most importantly, he isn't notable enough to have so many pages devoted to his views; the descriptions of his books can be added to his biography. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It's a lousy book and a fairly lousy page. Wikipedia would be no worse without it. But it may be fixable with some effort if someone with easy access to the book tries. One problem I have with such bad books is that I don't want to create demand for them, so I don't usually get them... --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 13:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Stephan, my argument is that there are thousands of thousands books. A book must be very very notable to have a page(e.g. Bible, Quran, Dante's divine comedy etc etc).

<dd>This is an idea worth considering as most Encyclopedias would limit articles on books to the classics and a few additional works of historical significance. Few books written after <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> would fit that. However traditionally that's not been how Wikipedia does things. For example <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2005_books.html" title="Category:2005 books">Category:2005 books</a>, the year this book came out, includes things like <a href="../../../d/a/r/The_Science_of_Discworld_III%7E_Darwin%27s_Watch_f08d.html" title="The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch">The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch</a> or <a href="../../../a/d/v/Dead_Men_Don%27t_Leave_Tips%7E_Adventures_X_Africa_a155.html" title="Dead Men Don't Leave Tips: Adventures X Africa">Dead Men Don't Leave Tips: Adventures X Africa</a>.

<dd>I don't quite agree with this (Aminz's) view. Wikipedia has articles on thousands of books, including a lot of fairly obscure ones that may be less well-known than this one in the general population. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/Settling_Accounts%7E_The_Grapple_65c2.html" title="Settling Accounts: The Grapple">Settling Accounts: The Grapple</a> (I'm reading this at the moment), <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Colours_6a3e.html" title="Flying Colours">Flying Colours</a> (which I co-wrote), <a href="../../../1/6/3/1633_%28novel%29.html" title="1633 (novel)">1633 (novel)</a> (which is fairly obscure), <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crusades_Through_Arab_Eyes_9fd9.html" title="The Crusades Through Arab Eyes">The Crusades Through Arab Eyes</a> (which is more germane to this discussion - a much better book, but not, I fear, more notable), and so on.

<li><b>Comment</b>: can people here actually discuss the issue of <i>notability</i> of this book instead of throwing around epithets like "anti-Islam" and "Islamophobic"? This is an Afd on a <i>book</i>, not a discussion of Spencer's website or his scholarly standing. If the nominator's reasoning is applied consistently, 90% of Wikipedia's articles on non-fiction books must be deleted. This is not necessarily a position I would disagree with, but we must tighten the existing policies to do so. Otherwise, the basis for the nomination seems to be at odds with the current Wikipedia practice. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 15:19, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>Amazon sales rank of #586 makes it a notable book. The fact that someone criticized it or a Wikipedia editor does not approve of the authors political views are irrelevant, since <b>Wikipedia in not censored</b> and we are discussing notability.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:49, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a bad-faith nomination that does not cite policy in its deletion reasoning. There is no precedent "very very notable" in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a> proposed guideline or anywhere else (and by analogy, we should have almost no articles on television episodes or music albums if that were the case). The argument by analogy with Britannica is also outside of policy, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. The argument against the author's "scholarship" is a content dispute and does not belong at AFD.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a notable book. Even taking out Wikipedia, several Wikipedia mirrors, and several bookstores it gets 62,500 hits.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=The+Politically+Incorrect+Guide+to+Islam+And+the+Crusades&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=wikipedia+barnes+books-a-million+borders+e-bay+amazon+wiki+answers+absoluteastronomy+masterliness&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=active" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=The+Politically+Incorrect+Guide+to+Islam+And+the+Crusades&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=wikipedia+barnes+books-a-million+borders+e-bay+amazon+wiki+answers+absoluteastronomy+masterliness&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=active" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> That includes reviews or mentions from magazines that have articles of their own.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Has anyone looked at the edit history of this article? There has been so much flack over <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> doing a broadside of AfDs of articles on books by this one controversial author that the fundimental issue has been ignored ... this artice had {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} because it lacked any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> citations ... that's what the tag said, "This article or section does not cite its <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">references or sources</a>." That was because the only claim of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> derived from <i>simply having been written</i> by a "notable" author to satisfy <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> ... several editors had independently put various tags on these stub articles, and other editors removed them ... those reverts escalted to this AfD and others, but it does not alter the fact that without <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citations</a></i>, anything in this article (and the others) is just <i><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></i>, and discussions of <b>what</b> the article is about, or any editor's opinions about the subject, have no place in this forum ... the real issue is, "Will we allow articles about books with no references to any reviews of the book simply because the author has an article in Wikipedia?" What happens when <i>their</i> claim of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is based on how many articles already exist in Wikipedia about books they have written, and all of <i>those</i> articles were created by the same editor and/or their sockpuppets? I think that these AfDs simply represent a symptom of a systemic problem in Wikipedia, an alarming trend of bootstrapped notability without any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> independent non-trivial <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a>. —72.75.85.159 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.75.85.159.html" title="User talk:72.75.85.159">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.75.85.159_b3d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.75.85.159">contribs</a>) 06:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Lack of sources is reason for a {{<a href="../../../s/o/u/Template%7ESources_a60f.html" title="Template:Sources">sources</a>}} tag; if there is doubt that sources can be found, an Afd is appropriate. The article does not present any facts except that it is a book, who its author is, a quote from the author, and the ISBN. I've added a source for the quote. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 07:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> There are probably over ten thousand articles about books in WP. The guidelines do not say that only the most exceeeding universally known go in. They just say notable. Furthermore, the comment that this book is controversial is not a reason to keep it out, it is a reason to keep it <b>in</b>. If there is such criticism, it would demonstrate notability. But I will continue to assume your good faith in making this nomination.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:06, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>strong keep</b> The nominator has said the same about an entire group of books by the same author, it is apparently a campaign against the author because of the author's views. I am beginning to lose my assumption of good faith in these nominations. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:16, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia policy on books is not that restricted. Being controversial <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_War_3d8b.html" title="Hitler's War">Hitler's War</a>, racist <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>, or discredited <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Destruction_of_Dresden_b765.html" title="The Destruction of Dresden">The Destruction of Dresden</a> are not grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdward321_0e26.html" title="User:Edward321">Edward321</a> 05:33, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> But notable criticism of the book has to be there for the sake of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, even if it is from partisan scholars. Of course, one must distinguish between criticism of Spencer and criticism of this specific book, with only the latter allowed in this article.<a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 10:07, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
