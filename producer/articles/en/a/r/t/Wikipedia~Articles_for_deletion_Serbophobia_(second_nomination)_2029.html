<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was determined after careful examination of all the edits to this page. Here are the opinions of those who have edited this page - I derived this summary by going through every single diff in the article history. Some voters did not use the terms "Keep" or "Delete" in their posts - I have done my best to reclassify such posts so that it is easier to determine the overall consensus for this article. Another reason for doing this is so that others who read the result of this AfD closing will find it easier the rationale behind the close. This is a long and complicated AfD, which contributed to its delayed closing. Votes expressed after the typical 7 day grace period are counted here. I am deliberately not posting the final decision of the close at the top to encourage everyone who had an interest in this article to read through everything I am writing here. I am aware this is somewhat unconventional, but in this case, I feel that other concerns presented outweigh the need to follow uniform practise for closing AfD debates.</p>

<p>Even if all opinions which were considered to be from "questionable" accounts are discounted (for example, due to low edit counts, or possible sockpuppetry), the result of this debate is still at best no consensus. Now, having said this, I find that the quality of dialogue displayed on this page is not particularly exemplary of the sort of dynamic which Wikipedia requires to function smoothly. Please consider this carefully: Wikipedia (and in this case, an AfD on Wikipedia) is not the primary place to discuss the philosophies of concepts, their existence, or their validity - there are other, much more suitable forums for this. An article's existence on Wikipedia does not necessarily follow from qualification and determination of these sentiments. Discussion regarding these ideas should be invoked when it serves directly to help write freely available, quality, encyclopedic articles on Wikipedia. It is my inclination that this AfD debate did not incline towards this - the exceptional amount of personal pronouns used and personal opinions expressed on this AfD is highly indicative of this. An ideal AfD should be simple to close, and only contain brief comments which answer these two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do we have the intellectual resources available to us write a great encyclopedic article?</li>
<li>Do we have volunteers who are willing to improve the article in a reasonable amount of time, so that content is verifyable and presentable to the public?</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of the debate centered on determining whether the terminology is in use, or whether it exists or not. However, none of the posts commented directly on whether any of this material is usable for the article itself. This consideration is absolutely necessary because our primary interest is to create verifyable article content, not so much determining the validity and existence of concepts. Please remember this for the future when voting for articles undergoing deletion - especially those which easily invoke strong, polarizing opinions.</p>
<p>Since there was some concern regarding the possible deletion of this article, let me address this by saying that if an article is deleted on Wikipedia, it does not mean that it has no place on Wikipedia. It simply means that at the current time, with the given resources, the article does not have the ability to grow into an encyclopedic article. As a result, the community has decided that, among many tradeoffs, it would be better to delete the article, and revisit it in the future. If this were not the case, there would be no need to archive AfDs. Deletion does not need to be taken too seriously - it may be more difficult to restart an article from the beginning, but this should be interpreted to be an opportunity and encouragement to rewrite something that is of better quality than what was present before. Nevertheless, I would be highly concerned if an administrator were to close this debate as "delete" - the article as it stands exhibits certain qualities which would not warrant a deletion.</p>
<p>So that part of sentiment of the nominator's intentions are not lost, I will repost part of the nominating statement here:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The article itself...is little more than a focus for edit warring...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>With this in mind, if an article's presence on Wikipedia siphons resources from the community which are better spent elsewhere, then perhaps it is a signal that one should actively and conscientiously pursue editing other articles temporarily where one's contributions would be appreciated and valued. The existing structure on Wikipedia can make it difficult to resolve edit wars, and I can only advocate that individuals be aware of this when the editing gets tough. It is my hope that the Magic of the Wiki can work - even for this article. This means at minimum:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transparent edits;</li>
<li>Neutralizing edits;</li>
<li>Quality edits;</li>
<li>Respectful edits.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will let the more experienced and well versed Wikipedians editing the article lead by example what this entails, and hope that everyone with an interest in it follows suit.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. This article has been an incredible burden to users on this Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Let me remind that arguements brought up in favor of deletion of this article were that the article is primarily used as the lightning rod for <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a> and that this article is going contrary to this official Wikipedia policy. Not a single person who voted to keep this article provided a counterarguement supported by evidence. Instead some have resorted to already seen tactic of bullying other users through <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> logigal fallacies and one has even attempted to revert the article during this discussion to a version that contained nothing but original research.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b>, first of all, just because an article is a "burden" on Wikipedia is not reason enough to delete it. It is not political propaganda, it is a term used in everyday life in the Balkans and it deserves an article. How can you say that it serves no purpose, when the term exists and the article explains thoroughly what it means. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 06:10, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, but that is simply not true. The word is <b>not</b> "used in everyday life in the Balkans" at all (a google search in native spelling comes up with 209 hits), but rather a propaganda term occasionally mentioned by Serbs in political discussions. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 06:23, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm sorry, but you're wrong. Maybe it's not used that much in Sarajevo and Bosnia, but in Serbia and Montenegro it is a general term used by many. Just because Google didn't have a lot of hits, doesn't proove that it is merely propaganda. And everything you wrote below is not a reason to delete the article. The term exists, and it deserves an explination. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 06:35, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a dictionary. Google's lack of hits might not prove that its propaganda (although the biased serbian political slant of most hits certainly testifies to this), but it does clearly show that the word is hardly "commonly" used. In the several months that this article has been up, nobody has been able to prove that the term is anything more than a political accusation. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 07:04, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

If you search them all together, and there is no question that those are real results since there is no other meaning for <b>Serbophobia</b> or any of the variations I just mensioned.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. "Serbophobia" is a purely political neologism used by Serbian nationalists pretty much exclusively in the past two decades to try and simplify the complex causes of the Yugoslav wars and assert that the blame for the conflict falls on the neighboring people's illogical phobic hatred of the Serbs. During the past several months the article has made absolutely no advancement excluding POV riddled versions inciting continous edit wars. Despite all attempts by Serbian users to portray the term as scientific and legitimate, not a shred of proof has been presented in some four months. The subject is inherently political and biased in nature, fairly unnotable (40% of google hits are wikipedia mirrors), and simply doesnt belong on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 06:19, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

This "phobia", unexistant outside the speeches and diatribes of Serb radical politicians and not justified by a shred of factual scientific evidence, has no place on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I was invited to vote on this (why I don't know), but will refrain since this is doomed to no consensus at best and I con't care aboutthe subject one way or the other. I will say this on reviewing the article, and perhaps as comfort to those who are upset by the article's continued presence on WP, and with apologies to any contributors: the extreme edit-warring has defaced the article to the point where it is almost completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not actually been involved in the dispute. The attempt to accommodate NPOV and OR objections has stripped it of any value and the content has moved from the encyclopedic to the ridiculous. This is choir-preaching and it seems to me that no one stumbling across this would be able to make much sense if it one way or the other. Articles that become subject to such disputes usually make themselves irrelevant in this way. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 22:32, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> after long consideration. I've meet alot of people that are afraid of Serbs, just like alot are afraid of Islam. The phobic behavior is old and has it's roots in nationalism.

<li>But don't you agree that personally knowing people who you feel exhibit Serbophobia is just <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>? Serbophobia implies that there exists an illogical hatred of Serbs based on their culture and ethnic identity. Similar points to yours were made in the previous AfD debate, but in the months since absolutely no evidence was presented for this. Rather, asides from allegations similar to the ones found on this AfD page, the only "proof" of Serbophobia has been directly tied to Serb nationalist politics - which, I hope you'd agree, would not belong on wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 03:21, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I diden't participate in the previous debate and I totally agree that Serb propaganda does not belong to wikipedia. But still what "proof" do you consider proof of Serbophobia? In Sweden I've noticed alot of "Serbophobia" in our media (accusing their culture etc.), I can name some writters if you want? Still we can argue about what is Serbophobia and not, but I consider that it exist (in some way). Sorry to say but what I've seen and read in Croatia and in Serbia is not pretty. I also do not deny something we can call perhaps "Croatophobia", or do you disagre? <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitany_cda3.html" title="User:Litany">Litany</a>
<ul>
<li>But here's the thing: the current anti-Serb sentiment in the West (whatever its extent may be) is a relatively recent phenomenon and a direct result of the Yugoslav wars and nationalist Serb politics. Prior to the late 20th century, the Serbs actually enjoyed a pretty favorable reputation in the West. This "Serbophobia" is not some extensive world-wide phenomenon worthy of a lengthly article. It can be neatly incorporated into the articles <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav_Wars_5a69.html" title="Yugoslav Wars">Yugoslav Wars</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> by saying "Another result of the nationalistic wars in the 1990s was a generally negative impact on the view Westerners had of the Serbian state and people." "Serbophobia" as you describe it is not so much a racist view towards the Serb people as a response to recent political events. In a few decades, when the Yugoslav wars are forgotten in the West, do you think younger generations will still have a negative view of Serbs? What I'm saying is that as a seperate article this is little more than a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protologism.html" title="Protologism">protologism</a>. After months of heavy editing, the only valid and undisputed material adds up to just a short stub. I don't dispute that some people may have a negative view of Serbs, but I think that christening this "Serbophobia" and propping up an article on it is inherently POV. What truth there is to it should be incorporated into other articles.</li>

<li>No need to be sorry <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a>, what you say is not nonsense and I hear you.&#160;:) You are totally right about the recent anti-serb movement in the West even before the WW1. After WW2 they were rather well supported (do many reconized all of the population as Yugoslavs (and some still do), in the West) due to the Ustaše. First their actions in WW2 and then the terror organization (that did some terror actions even in Sweden). So you don't think that Ustaše suffered some "Serbophobia" and "Yugoslavophobia"? I see that "Serbophobia" derives from nationalism, from both sides. But nobody than the Serb nationalist will ever promote it open. Still I would not say that this is mostly a world wide problem. This is mostly a Balkan problem. Would you not say that their is a "Bosnianphobia"(alot Islamophobia) and "Croatophobia"? All this anti-ethnic groups have a long history and should all be written. I think this article is needed. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitany_cda3.html" title="User:Litany">Litany</a></li>

<dl>
<dd>Enough with the <i>Ad hominem logical fallacy</i> routine. First ten times you and Dado mentioned it, it was just stupid, but it gets rather boring, so I'll have to intervene. <i>Argumentum ad hominem</i> is a logical fallacy when one of the persons involved in the discussion tries to discredit other party via personal attacks, rather then by confronting other party's <b>arguments</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
Example:
person A: .. as stated in von Neumann's Game theory ..
person B: .. yes, well that von Neumann of yours advocated nuclear holocaust ..
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>In our case, some of the participants in the discussion are being accused of something (namely serbophobia), but not to discredit them, rather to underlie that this phenomena is alive, and present even on Wikipedia (note here that in our current treatise is of no interest if these persons really are Serpbophobs (they might not be) - now we're trying to determine if <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> is present, this is purely logical problem).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If for instance you are discussing if blond men exist (I am perfecly aware how stupid this example sounds - this is a logical illustration, and serves its purpose), and in <i>no-blonde-exists</i> team is one blond guy, it would be perfectly legal for the <i>blondes-exist</i> team to state the argument: Blondes-exist - see even one member of your team is a blonde. Here <i>blondes-exists</i> team is speaking directly about members of the opposing team (which at first wasn't the subject), but it is by no means <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If someone would say: <i>Your opinion/vote shouldn't count, because you're a Serbophobe!</i>, then it would be a <i>ad hominem</i>. If however, someone says (as above): <i>Serbophobia exists - for instance person XYZ is acting like a Serbophobe</i>, then it is a logically valid argument (it may be factually incorrect, but it is still logically correct).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Logic is a serious science, and one has to study it carefully in order to assert logical truths - sometimes things can get very confusing, and mere throwing the few learned phrases that sound scientific (ad hominem/ad misercordiam/modus ponens..) can't lead anywhere (except maybe to logical fallacies). -- <a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObradovic_Goran_8d03.html" title="User:Obradovic Goran">Obradović Goran</a> <a href="../../../o/b/r/User_talk%7EObradovic_Goran_036b.html" title="User talk:Obradovic Goran">(<font color="red">t</font><font color="blue">a<sup>l</sup></font><font color="gray">k</font></a> 18:28, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have stated arguments. In return instead of providing counter arguements supported by evidence I was accused of being a Serbophob that should, somehow, imply that my arguments are not valid. It is an indirect way of trying to damage my credibility by accusing me of a very thing that I was disputing. If that is not a logical fallacy I don't know what is. This page is supposed to be used for debate where each side should natuarally be trying to pursue other party with arguments. Instead we have a line-up of users, who obviously approched this issue not from a scientific point of view but rather a partisan one. Those same users with baseless acusations have swayed the debate dynamics into a completely unproductive direction. This whole debate, with only few exeptional remaks, just like the article is a complete sham.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 22:39, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not closed yet? I vote <b>weak keep</b>. it may be a political term, but it goes both ways. From Serb perspective, it demonstrates an irrational hate against Serbs; from another perspective, it demonstrates an irrational Serbian sense of being hated. Thus the argument is flawed from both ways!

<ul>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>* As we can see, the term was used in an article in the Wall Street Journal. This alone should warrant its place on Wiki. Furthermore, why do people take an issue with the fact that the word is a neolism (which it is not, by the way)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Wiki is an encyclopedia and neologisms shouls be defined as well ( *sarcasm on* maybe we should delete the entry for the word "globalisation" since it is a neologism as well? *sarcasm off*). Moreover, the many results on Google show that the term obviously has a relevance. --Ketzman</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A lot of the reasons above for both keeping and deleting this article are based on personal opinion. Folks, I think we should all calm down and not use phrases like, "stop trying to ignore the truth." If this article is notable enough (which users like <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> have made a strong case against based on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_Policy_a230.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion Policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a>), then it should have strong section in it that states something like, "this phrase is often used by 'Serbian nationalists in the past two decades to try to simplify the complex causes of the Yugoslav wars and assert that the blame for the conflict falls on the neighboring people's illogical phobic hatred of the Serbs." (copied from <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever's</a> comment above). I do have a problem with an article that asserts something like this just as I would have a problem with an article that asserts that slavery was the cause for the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. However, since it appears that it is all non-notable (especially in English) political jargon, I don't currently see a reason to keep it. <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/m/User_talk%7EJHMM13_2dd8.html" title="User talk:JHMM13">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JHMM13_5487.html" title="Special:Contributions/JHMM13">C</a>) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 20:57, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I was telling myself I should restrain from such discussions, yet I didn't. The problem is, although the phenomenon exists (as can be seen by, erm, certain Wikipedia editors), there's little to write about it in an encyclopedical manner; it is also likely to attract edit warring. I don't think the current version of the article is too extremely PoV-ed, but it doesn't tell anything substantial either -- it looks like a stretched pile of bits and pieces, and I doubt it can be much improved. Somewhat contrary to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, I must say there were similar problems and similar edit wars with articles <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnians.html" title="Bosnians">Bosnians</a> and Bosniak unitarism (wha', that got deleted?).

<dd>The point is that some people simply wants to keep this going till the vote goes their way and the article is deleted (even by dirty tricks as throwaway usernames and vote-stacking spam). This vote was already casted once and the page was deemed as necessary for WP. There should have never been a second vote. This vote-again-till-we-get-what-we-want strategy is damaging for the whole of wikipedia. What would stop someone thinking is fair game to re-create the article if it gets banned using the sort of bad deeds at work here?

<dd>Sir, I can't count how many users who voted "keep" have very few edits on the English Wikipedia (remember, this is the English Wikipedia and things that may be somewhat notable on the Serbian Wikipedia may not be on EN-wiki) or are clearly cross-overs from the Serbian Wiki. I seriously question the validity of this "vote" in general and I certainly hope the way things have been run here are not how things are run on the Serbian wiki because this is grossly amateur. There is clearly serious advertising of this "vote" on both sides, but by going to another Wikipedia and getting users to vote on the English wiki about the deletion of an EN-wiki page is seriously diminishing the spirit of the process. Beyond that, this is NOT a vote. AfDs are meant to create consensus among users as to whether a page should be deleted or not. It is up to the closing bureaucrat to decide whether consensus has been reached, and getting as many other users to pile on votes on one side based on flawed logic does not make the article more likely to be kept or deleted. On the note of bureaucracy, I <i>seriously</i> suspect <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Bormalagurski_86ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Bormalagurski">Boris Malagurski's RfA attempt</a> as a cheap-shot way to end this argument in favor of "keep." I sincerely hope everyone can just calm down and ease their nationalistic tendencies with regard to a discussion on Wikipedia that <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">should not be laden with POV comments</a>. I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of EN-Wiki users (including myself) have never even thought to suspect a Serbian when fear strikes up, so it's not as if we're biased.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have given the article a cursory glance and have not found any major problems, but I don't know enough about the Serbian situation to justify a vote here. However, <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">User:Bormalagurski</a> is acting disruptively here. AfD discussions should not be speedily closed immediately when the number of "keep" votes exceeds the number of "delete" votes. <b>This is a discussion, not a vote.</b> Also the fact that all who voted "keep" are Serbian suggests that they are arguing from a subjective point of view. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 11:18, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
