<p><s>Goes into too much detail on a subject not deserving of its own article. A merge back into <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Earnhardt_2015.html" title="Dale Earnhardt">Dale Earnhardt</a> was requested, but I feel that adding this much about this topic would unbalance that article. <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Earnhardt_2015.html" title="Dale Earnhardt">Dale Earnhardt</a> already addresses the topic and, I would say, sufficiently. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 16:27, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</s> The new article looks much better, nomination withdrawn. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 14:05, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Neutral</b>, leaning toward delete.</s> I added a source about this controversy into the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Earnhardt_2015.html" title="Dale Earnhardt">Dale Earnhardt</a> article after seeing this, and now I think it's got roughly enough there. Editors should consider merging any points that would pass the hundred-year test, not just Wikinews-type content, to the parent article. I've mentioned this AfD on the WikiProject NASCAR talk page. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:56, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks, I probably should have mentioned it there myself. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 18:15, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Changed vote after Agne27's merge of content. Endorse history merge of the two AfD'd articles to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Dale_Earnhardt_1f52.html" title="Death of Dale Earnhardt">Death of Dale Earnhardt</a>. Parent article is being edited to trim death-related material and point to the new beakout article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Earnhart_dd90.html" title="Dale Earnhart">Dale Earnhart</a></s>, only about half of this article is really needed and that would not unduly increase the size of the original article. As with the photograph this is not really a controversy as much as it is minor disagreements magnified by celebrity. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:08, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b><s>Keep</s></b>. I respectfully disagree with Recury's assessment that the topic is well covered in the main article. Most of this article is encyclopedic IMHO. I would not call the disagreements minor, especially to Simpson Race Products. There was very much controversy over many months in my opinion (contrary to Dhartung's opinion). Keeping it in its own article serves to keep those ugly trivia sections out of Earnhardt's main article. Maybe it will help lessen the vandalism of that page too. This article can be refered to by the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Simpson_57c8.html" title="Bill Simpson">Bill Simpson</a> and the yet to be written Simpson Race Products articles. This article needs to have references added if it survives AfD, and I recently added some at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Simpson_57c8.html#Earnhardt_controversy" title="Bill Simpson">Bill_Simpson#Earnhardt_controversy</a> that would work. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil"><font color="#000000"><b>Royal</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>broil</b></font></a><sup>&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalbroil_9d82.html" title="User talk:Royalbroil"><font color="#FF0000">T</font></a>&#160;:&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Royalbroil_8587.html" title="Special:Contributions/Royalbroil"><font color="#000000">C</font></a></sup> 21:42, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would also support the proposed merge into <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Dale_Earnhardt_1f52.html" title="Death of Dale Earnhardt">Death of Dale Earnhardt</a> as a reasonable compromise. My primary concern is to not see Earnhardt main article dominated by the controversies. There is enough to encyclopedic material about the events after his death to warrant its own article in my opinion. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil"><font color="#000000"><b>Royal</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>broil</b></font></a><sup>&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalbroil_9d82.html" title="User talk:Royalbroil"><font color="#FF0000">T</font></a>&#160;:&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Royalbroil_8587.html" title="Special:Contributions/Royalbroil"><font color="#000000">C</font></a></sup> 02:26, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>change to <b>Delete</b>. The new <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Dale_Earnhardt_1f52.html" title="Death of Dale Earnhardt">Death of Dale Earnhardt</a> article is <b>very well written</b> and covers both articles completely. Kudos to Agnes for such an excellent article! The old articles are no longer needed. I have left a message for Recury because I'm puzzled why he would stop this nomination when the deletion appears imminent now. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil"><font color="#000000"><b>Royal</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>broil</b></font></a><sup>&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalbroil_9d82.html" title="User talk:Royalbroil"><font color="#FF0000">T</font></a>&#160;:&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Royalbroil_8587.html" title="Special:Contributions/Royalbroil"><font color="#000000">C</font></a></sup> 19:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, IIRC, this was split from the main Dale Earnhardt article in order to keep the focus of the latter article on Earnhardt himself. — <b><a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrotherFlounder_8c94.html" title="User:BrotherFlounder"><font color="#000080">Brother</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrotherFlounder_908a.html" title="User talk:BrotherFlounder"><font color="#DAA520">Flounder</font></a></b> 22:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> per BrotherFlounder.

<li><b>Delete</b> How many articles do we need <i>just</i> forking away from his death? Is it not enough that lots of focus is already put on his death in his own article? Wikipedia is not Access Hollywood or Crime Library or American Justice, we don't need minutely, morbidly detailed accounts like this just because some people find it interesting.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 23:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <i>(See below)</i> but I think a more appropriate splinter article would be <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Dale_Earnhardt_1f52.html" title="Death of Dale Earnhardt">Death of Dale Earnhardt</a> and include details of both the controversy but also the constructive changes that Nascar did in the aftermath.

<li>Change vote to <b>move</b> to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Dale_Earnhardt_1f52.html" title="Death of Dale Earnhardt">Death of Dale Earnhardt</a> per Agne, inclusive of the autopsy photos article and detailed information on the crash etc. rather than the overused label "controversy". --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:42, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Update</b> Since we essentially have three articles involved (This, the main Dale Earnhardt, and the autopsy photos), I was <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> and went ahead and created the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Dale_Earnhardt_1f52.html" title="Death of Dale Earnhardt">Death of Dale Earnhardt</a> with relevant text from those three articles. I did a little content editing to try and address the OR and POV concerns. I guess the best route now would be to <b>Merge</b> for the histories since the content work has already been done. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 13:45, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
