<p>Regrettably I am nominating this for AfD, though I do find it to be hilarious. If this does end up getting deleted be sure to <b>BJAODN</b> it, okay? <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font style="background: #000000" face="Impact" color="#00A5FF">Cyde Weys</font></a> 23:48, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Delete and BJAODN</b></s>. <s>I especially like the encyclopedic tone in which the song is initially discussed. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrazyCaley_d294.html" title="User:KrazyCaley">KrazyCaley</a> 23:49, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</s> <b>Keep</b>. Well. I honestly thought that one was either made up or of minor, non-notable importance. Still think it's a bit weird, but hey, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> censored for the protection of minors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I did not post this as a joke. This is a real song. It seems every kid in my elementary school was singing it. Moreover, my colleagues in college and graduate school (who hail from around the country) have consistently been familiar with it. OK, I know the sources are sketchy and one may argue that this does not belong in an encyclopedia. But lets be honest -- we all know that there is a genre of humorous songs (frequently children's songs and frequently plays on the tunes of existing songs) that are a widely known part of our collective cosnciousness. These are encyclopedic, though they may not appear in conventional sources -- large parts of the youth of any country knows such songs, for goodness sake. I know I am not an experienced poster (under this name), but please consider my rationales. Thanks <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also please see my additons, which cite a specific reference and discuss the fact this song, like many in it genre, has frequently variable lyrics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, recommend check for copyvio. This song was on published and distributed recordings (I've heard it in different jukeboxes), but I don't know whether it was new then, or owned or public-domain before then. Not significant enough for a WP article or BJAODN even if not copyvio. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:00, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - not big enough for a whole WP article, so to speak. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Ruby</a> 02:19, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> not an encycopedic subject. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolfcam_2c26.html" title="User:Golfcam">Golfcam</a> 04:38, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> -- what is so unencyclopedic about this? This is a fairly well known song (above poster seems to be familiar-- the fact that he heard it on a jukebox speaks to noteriety (and by the way I removed the lyrics if that is a copy-vio issue)). Plenty of songs have pages on wikipedia, some better known than others. Is it because this song is (or tries to be) humorous that you have such problems with this article? Sure, this will never be an extremely long article but, as stated, it is a verifiably (by this very discussion) well known song. What is the problem, guys? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../2A/d/r/User%7E_drew_2c46.html" title="User:*drew">*drew</a> 05:13, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So I suppose I should propose deletion for every other well-known song that has a Wikipedia page? 72.150.108.181</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you think it doesn't belong in the Wikipedia, please feel free to use the AFD procedure. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 09:07, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, actually. I remember this song from childhood, although we always sang "beat it off" instead. Note: we were bad children. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 16:56, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><s><b>Comment</b> If deleted, I would strongly support a <b>BJAODN</b>, however. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 16:57, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</s> This is not a bad joke and this is not nonsense. It should just be kept, especially as re-written, with no vote substitution. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 14:23, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Young American. There are a lot of well-known children's songs like this that could have decent articles. Let them start as stubs and get expanded, like all the other articles here do. <a href="../../../t/m/s/User%7ETMS63112_ebc1.html" title="User:TMS63112">TMS63112</a> 20:16, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Mehlberg_a895.html" title="User:John Mehlberg">John Mehlberg</a>. This is a traditional song of which the earliest known date is 1927. I have revised this article and have included references to printed and recorded examples of this song with variant texts. Oh, it is OK to have the LYRICS as they are traditional. See this wikipedia example of <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler_has_only_got_one_ball.html" title="Hitler has only got one ball">Hitler Has Only Got One Ball</a>. 27 January 2006
<ul>
<li>Please <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">BE BOLD</a> and update the article. It may help get it kept! <a href="../../../t/m/s/User%7ETMS63112_ebc1.html" title="User:TMS63112">TMS63112</a> 04:45, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> --- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a>. This song seems to be well known (I, for one, have known about it since I was a little kid) and the article is now much better referenced than in earlier versions. Also, I agree with above that there is definitely a genre of songs of this ilk, many of which could have worthwhile entries -- everyone seems to know these songs but hardly anyone knows there origins / history / variations...wikipedia could be agreat vehicle for making that information available.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - per Captaintruth's comments <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalepheasant_b77c.html" title="User:Malepheasant">Malepheasant</a> 21:06, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It is real and it is notable. Do a google and you'll see. (Signed: <a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.Smith</a>) 21:10, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If kept, the article should be renamed, with caps. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 04:17, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
