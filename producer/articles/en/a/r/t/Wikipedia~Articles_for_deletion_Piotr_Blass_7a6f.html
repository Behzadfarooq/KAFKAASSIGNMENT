<p>Dear Wikipedia community The attacks against my good name are politically and racially motivated.</p>
<p>Let me calmly respond: Jeff Fisher is a well known unstable person currently unfortunately homeless. His claim that I rigged the 2004 election is of course pure fantasy and as such needs immediate removal <small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FPiotr_Blass&amp;diff=67360452&amp;oldid=67356901" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FPiotr_Blass&amp;diff=67360452&amp;oldid=67356901" rel="nofollow">Removed legal threat</a>). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 01:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>The Ulam Quarterly Journal pioneered the entire web movement in the USA. We were the eggheads who did it for free and for love. Give me credit and enjoy the web with my best wishes and my blessing</p>
<p>I cannot tell you about being an unremarkable mathematician. Please ask for example Zariski,Grothendieck,Mumford and Deligne Field's medallists or anyone of my students including for example Chris Skinner who went on to work with Andy Wiles or Scott Flansburg who went on to have thousands of students of his own. Finally I ask the community to protect me from defamatory attacks against me and my family. If you are unable to do it then indeed we need to part company today. Ulam Lives! dr piotr blass</p>

<dd>Let me comment on the last part. We can't ask <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zariski.html" title="Zariski">Zariski</a> since he is dead. <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumford.html" title="Mumford">Mumford</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grothendieck.html" title="Grothendieck">Grothendieck</a> are no longer working actively in mathematics, but neither is <a href="../../../p/i/o/Piotr_Blass_f131.html" title="Piotr Blass">Piotr Blass</a> of course (last paper dated 1996). I doubt Deligne uses email but certainly wouldn't bother him with this. Finally, according to <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics_Genealogy_Project_a991.html" title="Mathematics Genealogy Project">Math.Genealogy</a> Blass had a total of three grad students (neither of the two mentioned above) <a href="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=7241" class="external autonumber" title="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=7241" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems somewhat notable as a politician, and as a mathematician. Vanity and/or unfamiliarity with Wikipedia procedures are no reasons for deletion if the subject is notable. His research in <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zariski_surface.html" title="Zariski surface">Zariski surface</a> seems somewhat notabale, and this compunded with being a candidate for an important election makes him notable in my book. Claims for work on early Internet and being an advisor/close coworker of some famous people, while they would make him clearly notable, need independent sources, but even without them I think he fits the borderline claim for notability.

<p><b>Speedy Delete</b>. This is a vanity article written by the subject from scratch. Not notable as a mathematician by any stretch. Not notable as a politician (e.g. NYTimes does not list him among <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/elections2004/2004FL.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/elections2004/2004FL.html" rel="nofollow">2004 independent candidates</a>). <a href="../../../m/h/y/User%7EMhym_f8c3.html" title="User:Mhym">Mhym</a> 07:13, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> as blatant self-promotion (he even mirrors this self-written article on himself on his own campaign website <a href="http://piotrblass.com/html/wikipedia.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://piotrblass.com/html/wikipedia.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>!). Also an utterly embarrassing case of name-dropping (note also his recent edit to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Michnik_0649.html" title="Adam Michnik">Adam Michnik</a>.) No notability as a politician whatsoever (and the sheer lack of professionalism in this effort as well as the dumb campaign design do not promise great things for the future). If he is notable in the field of mathematics (on which I am no expert), he really should have the patience to wait until one of his colleagues or students writes an article about him. The keep vote by Piotrus ("seems (!) somewhat (!!) notable") appears to be somewhat sentimentally motivated, for a namesake and a (former) compatriot... 213.76.22.170 14:14, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Ignoring for the sake of argument the blatant <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> violations, he has had a few papers published, and so the existence of an article might be borderline acceptable (note that I said <i>borderline</i>). But since it's all written by the subject, and he insists on putting ridiculous claims that border on vandalism (you and <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html#The_Internet_and_the_Webbys" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a> should hang out together), it's just not worth the trouble. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 19:25, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see a valid reason for deletion. Most comments refer to <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, however, this guideline says "vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of assertion of importance is". According to <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zentralblatt_MATH_3e98.html" title="Zentralblatt MATH">Zentralblatt MATH</a>, review 1028.14006, Piotr Blass did introduce the notion of <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zariski_surface.html" title="Zariski surface">Zariski surface</a>, which is important enough that we have an article about it. If that had been all described in the article, then the article would clearly have been kept, showing that he's passed the notability threshold. By the way, an IP editor cleaned up the article. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 09:26, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I checked <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_Reviews_f4e0.html" title="Mathematical Reviews">Mathematical Reviews</a>.

The point being the whole paragraph is misleading at best and completely wrong at worst. It seems that the whole article is compromised with this kind of vanity issues. Even if Dr. Blass merits an article this one has to be <b>deleted</b> and someone with <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> should write it from scratch. <a href="../../../m/h/y/User%7EMhym_f8c3.html" title="User:Mhym">Mhym</a> 11:01, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>mhem and ryulong have been truly astounding. They seem to be rather young and I choose to forgive them and to ask them to sin no more. My mathematics speaks for itself and the theory os zariski surfaces which i created with zariski and hironaka has inspired top quality work all over the world---especially lately in Japan where Shimada has made great strides. Moreover the work is being generalized to higher dimesions as we speak with applications to cryptography and physics (parallell universes).

<dd><i>Comment</i>: I just want to point out that accusing people of a racially-motivated Cultural Revolution-style crusade against you is not really helping your case. If Piotr Blass wants a Wikipedia entry on Piotr Blass, the best thing for him to do right now would be to back off and hope that somebody else creates an <i>unbiased</i> article. Even if everyone agreed that you were notable enough for inclusion, creating and/or editing an article about yourself is explicitly prohibited by Wikipedia policy. Accusing people of a vendetta on the AfD page is arguably even worse. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 17:38, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Comment</i> There is now a reference for this on the article page, however, the reference only states it is <i>one of</i> the first peer-reviewed electronic journals. Out of the four journals listed by the source as early peer-reviewed electronic journals, only the Ulam Quarterly is mentioned in Wikipedia -- and ironically, all of the other ones were more successful that UQ. The source <i>does</i> back up the claim somewhat, but simultaneously strikes a blow against the notability of the publication or Dr. Blass. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 17:59, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s><b>KEEP</b></s> (Vote struc out as repeated vote by same IP address) I am so happy to see decent people come to the defense of my page and of the truth . The people attacking us are anonymous and not well informed. My friend and relative Emmanuel Ax is a pianist Mark Levine my collaborator and friend is a very strong geometer in Boston. The red guard type calls him a pianist! The primacy of the Ulam quurterly can be checked with Odlyzko who wrote about us before 1990 as one of the early models of electronic publishing .Reference will be supplied as soon as you stop blocking me or even sooner. Also the journal was typeset in or very close to einstein's office at IAS princeton. I can probably can testimony from there if necessary. Comments by ryulong and salix users are anonymous attempts at smearing us. Perhaps we should just ignore these attacks with so little integrity. As for the links added to my allegedly forging the 2004 election ---let us just laugh---were caused my mental patients. Perhaps it would be best to remove that . It is up to you. The Zeosync drama keeps unfloding. I am the one person trying to salavage this intellectual property---i am the good guy who gets criticed---- There is hope for wikipedia if we can talk at this level. My hero einstein was often criticised I am trying to imitate his dignity and good humor. love and all that stuff to wikipedia honest guys ulam lives!!!!!!!!!! piotrek blass<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.168.221.213 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.168.221.213.html" title="User talk:209.168.221.213">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.168.221.213_9ad3.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.168.221.213">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Week delete</b> Following <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> I think there is enough to warrent sufficient notabliity. However I'm still voting delete as I am not convinced we can keep this page sufficiently objective. The page has improved somewhat but we still have not got to the root of how Ulam quarterly and the role it played in the development of the internet, was it just an early use, or did it effect the development of any of the protocols or browsers, or increase its popularity? Do we have any documentation about it? More concerning is the many mentions of Blass in a negative light, in conection with evidence he may have had about posible tampering of vote counting machines. There are many references to him in left-wing/democratic blogs, another recient one is <a href="http://nomorefraud.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://nomorefraud.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Roger Rancourt</a>, and there is even a signed afidavite which mentions his name (link escapes me). It seem like Blass is a contriversal figure at the moment and it may be simplest simply not to have an article, rather than an article which we cannot effectivly maintain.</li>
<li>p.s. As for my anominity, I'm not I have a user page with links just about all there is to know about me. As for anit-jewish motives, I had not even relalised that until Poitr mentioned it. It may actually be the case that the cricicism and attacks on external websites on Blass may be more to do with the fact that hes caught up in a situation which could damage the current govenment (and hence of interest to the left) than for any grounds of race. Still thats politics. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 00:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: There's a lot of name-dropping that still needs to be removed and unsourced material needs to be expunged also, per Wikipedia policy (<a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>). What will be left after all that is a bio with some basic background on family, education, etc., references to <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zariski_surface.html" title="Zariski surface">Zariski surface</a>, and possibly the Zeosync stuff and political campaigning stuff. With all this other non-mathematical stuff, it seems there is enough notability (notoriety?) to establish a keep vote. However, I really have no wish to keep a bio that is mainly kept because of minor scandals of dubious notability or verifiability. Additionally, Blass' mathematical notability was marginal anyway; it's no real loss or gain to have this mathematician's bio or not. As others have commented, it may just be too much trouble. After all, don't we have better things to do than patrol this page with the goal of what, not improving the article (since there's not really much potential in it), but instead with the goal of keeping it trimmed down to a stub or semi-stub? That's really the problem with these marginal mathematician bios. Most of the time, people say "keep" because they don't see the harm in it, and there is some marginal notability. In this case, we have the subject insisting on spending his free time changing the article to his blog/webpage. It's really too much trouble to bother with, I would think.</li>
<li><b>One last comment to Piotr Blass</b>: if Piotr Blass is reading this, I think he ought to know that he <i>really</i> does not want a Wikipedia bio. It's near certain that people are going to eventually edit out most of his additions to result in an article that, in his viewpoint, attacks his reputation and reflects badly on him. I really think if he understood this, he would vote "delete". --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 06:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To give some context here... I took some time the other day to try to explain to Dr. Blass on <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJaysweet_b11b.html#Conversation_with_Dr._Blass" title="User talk:Jaysweet">my talk page</a> why his page has been marked for deletion. That is why he is addressing me here. (Though frankly Dr. Blass, you still seem to be very confused about proper Wikipedia policies, e.g. signing your posts with --~~~~, as I tried to explain to you...)</dd>
<dd>I said on the article talk page I might be convinced to change my vote if we could get a promise from Dr. Blass not to touch the article about himself. Based on his comments here, I don't think we will be getting that promise... --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 17:15, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dr. Blass - I am of Jewish ancestry (from the former Soviet bloc) as well. That said, you are casting yourself in a very negative light - playing the race card, as it were, immediately after someone suggests deleting your page. You've already stated your keep vote, so there is no need to repeat yourself - your opinion has been noted, but it is not the end-all and be-all of the discussion here. As much as I hate to say it, you frankly lack the notablity to have a page on Wikipedia. May I suggest that you sign up for an account and create a User Page? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterested2_48ca.html" title="User:Interested2">Interested2</a> 17:31, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

Yes, he appears to have been a candidate in a Senatorial election, but it was only as an independent write-in candidate.
