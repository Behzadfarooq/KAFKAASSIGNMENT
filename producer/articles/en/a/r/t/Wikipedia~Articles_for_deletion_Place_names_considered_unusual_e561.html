<p>An article was dleeted at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_interesting_or_unusual_place_names_982d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of interesting or unusual place names">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of interesting or unusual place names</a>. It was taken to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> where deletion was endorsed, and several expressed themselves satisfied with its continued existence in Project space at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_interesting_or_unusual_place_names_a454.html" title="Wikipedia:List of interesting or unusual place names">Wikipedia:List of interesting or unusual place names</a>, since it failed <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. This seems to me to be a pretty blatant attempt to get round that by citing <i>other people's POV</i> - including some newspaper space fillers. I don't want to provoke a war here, but I am greatly disturbed by this apparent forking. I realise it's slightly different in conception, but overall it really isn't significantly different to the old article in that it is still POV and OR, it just says so up front and then appeals to the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> fallacy to justify it. In the end, "Fucking" is only funny to a sophomore Anglophone - in its native language it is not actually that odd - and the places listed as producing many "unusual" names are merely an artifact of dialect or influx of people from non-English speaking countries. So this should, if anything, be a list of place names considered by an arbitrary subset of people to meet some arbitrary definition of "unusual". But in the end no amount of saying "look, this is not the same thing, really it isn't" doesn't make this any less a fork, in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 23:16, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It looks to me like the previous version was nominated and deleted because of a lack of sources. This has sources so it is not the same article. We can't penalize people for making the effort to provide a verified treatment of the topic. Therefore "forking" does not seem relevant and I hope the article remains on this more scholarly track. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:10, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reluctant keep</b>. Imperfect as this article is, it is many orders of magnatude better than the other, as this one has sources. As it was sort of created as a compromise between having the other one (which includes anything anyone happened to toss in) and having nothing, I guess it should stay, just to help keep the other one away. As long as the entries in the articles have sources (real sources, not some "ain't this some funny shit" blogs), I'm not really against it. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 02:32, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weak <b>Keep</b> but change title to "non-traditional place names"-- unusual sounds POV to my ear, and perhaps a more accurate reflection of content. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 02:38, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this article is referenced. A different name doesn't indicate a fork - this is a more NPOV name than the old one (saying that a name is considered unusual is more NPOV than saying that it <i>is</i> unusual). World wide focus is a reason for article improvement, not deletion. This kind of phenonmenon occurs in other languages - for example, there were plans to call the Iraqi army (ok, not a place name, but same principle) the New Iraqi Corps, until it was realised it'd be arabic slang for f***. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 06:09, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Either keep or move the old article back into article space.

<li><b>Keep</b>. No good arguments for deletion have been advanced. This is not POV, the items are sourced. "Other people's POV" is not a problem at all - the important thing is that it is not *our* POV, as the previous article was. Seems like a good-faith effort to address the strong verfification concerns raised previously. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 06:01, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - given the parameters that were being placed around which references might be used for determing that a place name was unusual, this article will not be able to develop much further beyond the few entries it has now. Place names are easily verified, that the place names are considered unusual seems not to be according to the criteria for sources which as been demanded.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 07:38, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it is significantly different to the old list because it has a few examples which are sourced with references, rather than hundreds of unsourced examples. -- <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a><small>|<a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">talk</a></small> 23:49, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Encyclopedic. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is pretty clear that assertions in articles don't need to be true; they just need to be sourced. Some place names are of interest; in fact, I would cite Mary Pukui's fabulous <i>Place Names of Hawaii</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0824805240</a>), currently sitting on my shelf and my invariable companion in Hawaiian expeditions, as an example of a way that an editor can compile interesting place names in such a way as to produce an encyclopedic, verifiable and NPOV text. This article doesn't violate wikipedia policy; although it's currently in pretty sorry shape, I think it might one day turn into an article like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_believed_to_have_epilepsy.html" title="List of people believed to have epilepsy">List of people believed to have epilepsy</a>, a "list" that rewards the encyclopedic reader by its perusal. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 00:58, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
