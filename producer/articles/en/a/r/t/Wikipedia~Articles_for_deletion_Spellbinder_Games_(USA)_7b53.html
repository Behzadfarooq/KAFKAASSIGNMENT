<li><b>Comment</b> My interest in this subject came when I noticed (doing Newpage patrol) that you had created 10 separate articles about types of <a href="../../../o/o/z/Ooze.html" title="Ooze">oozes</a> and advised against it. I would also note that I have edited all over Wikipedia but yes, when I see signs of vanity editing I tend to follow the trails so that the necessary cleanup can be done. Also if this publisher has published children books I would be happy to have a title. We could then look it up in the library of congress and actually verify that it exists. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 18:24, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> They may be low on the scale of notability, but they do have a product, and there is also Spellbinder Games (UK) which might one day get an article, and I'd hate for folks to confuse them. I am however, troubled by the obvious acrimony between the various parties here, and I suggest that the folks involved take a step back and cool off.<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, but no, your line below this belies that attitude. It is obvious that there is a bit of personal feeling in this debate, and that's a problem that should set off warning bells in your head. Consider this a chance to be a good person.. Plus WP:CORP is not pretty clear. It actually starts off saying it is only a rough guideline. But that doesn't even address my real concern, which was confusion with the UK Spellbinder. That's reason enough on its own to have some information. (In fact, I'd say that the disambig page at <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spellbinder.html" title="Spellbinder">Spellbinder</a> probably needs this information, but I'll leave that to others.<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:04, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>With all due respect, that sort of thinking leads to disambig pages which are so large that they are useless. And <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is clear: while it's not prescriptive it does indicate that corporations who fail to meet the criteria are likely to be deletable. Since this particular corporation is well below any of the criteria then <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is in fact very relevant. As for what you perceive as my negative attitude towards this company, again, it is nothing personnal but yes, I do tend to get ticked when an article is being supported by essentially one user and his sockpuppets (well, plus you!) and when the arguments for keeping it involve what seem to be desparate lies. I'm surprised to find you completely unphased by the concern that the content of the article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 00:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>First, you're not exactly making a good case with me by simply citing policy pages. Sorry, but I find it hard to discuss things with people who just throw those out. Anyway, I've never seen a disambig page that's useless due to size, and frankly, I can't even imagine one. Maybe if it were poorly sorted, but that's a slightly different problem. In any case, two entries isn't that much. More if we move it to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spellbinder.html" title="Spellbinder">Spellbinder</a> (currently at 9). And no matter how annoyed you get, the important thing is to be civil. Annoyance tends to lead to the situation becoming aggravated, not resolved. It certainly distresses me, especially given And no, the entire contents of the article are not unverifiable. Dreadmire at least is listed on Amazon.com and various other sellers. So I'm satisfied with that. Anything else is merely questionable. And they aren't any less notable than many of the minor companies listed in the RPG publisher's category(which is where they should be placed IMHO, so I'm going to do that). Whether or not most of those articles should go through an AfD is something worth considering though. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:37, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Per Spellbinder at the NG discussion board we get this quote" I am going by memory so don't quote me on this. Keep in mind these were children's fantasy books along the same lines as Harry Potter. I believe there was The Persnackety Dragon, The Dimadon Lantern, and My Magical Maguffin. There was also a coloring book called Fantasmagoria. Sadly all the remaining copies of these long out of print books were lost in the storm."

<li><b>Comment</b> Your "ha ha ha" shows you are gleeful at the prospect of getting Spellbinder Games deleted. You should take Manticore's advice and pull back from this "jihad," as one user put it. Also, your comment "is that the best evidence they have" indicates you think this is some sort of game or contest. The 20-year old books existed, and no it may not be proveable online, but not everything is online. There are several books from my own childhood that I cannot find online anywhere, including Library of Congress online and WorldCat online.

<li><b>Comment</b> FYI for those that don't know, the "EN World" website was originally created as a message board to support a community project to design a campaign world for 3rd Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The "ENnies" started in 2002, hardly enough time to become "significant". They are currently the equivalent of a bowling trophy, albeit in the gaming community. I am sure they are very important to some people, just like a bowling or dance trophy is to some people. No offense to the people at the EN World website, who I am sure are good people that work very hard, but the ENnies are indeed a trivial award. A Pulitzer is a non-trivial award. A little perspective, please.--<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryogenesis_42ba.html" title="User:Cryogenesis">Cryogenesis</a> 16:48, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Some people put dance and bowling awards on their resumes. If its all you've got, hey, its a great thing. Unfortunately, bowling, dance, and ENnie trophies are all trivial, <i>as Wikipedia defines it</i>.--<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryogenesis_42ba.html" title="User:Cryogenesis">Cryogenesis</a> 15:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please advise as to where Wikipedia defines trivial and non-trivial awards and trophies. Regardless, It is not the equivilent of a Bowling Trophy, it is the equivilent of winning a championship in the Professional Bowling Association. There is absolutely no more prestigious and recognized award in d20 gaming.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobNoxious_a858.html" title="User:RobNoxious">RobNoxious</a> 01:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Same as a championship in the PBA? Really. A 50 year old contest that has thousands of contestants? You may need to step back a gain some perspective.--<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryogenesis_42ba.html" title="User:Cryogenesis">Cryogenesis</a> 04:32, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> So long as related pages are merged so as not to create volumes of material for a publisher with only one book, I personally see no reason the page should be deleted entirely. As I understand it, the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is a guideline, not an absolute. Various vanity pages, however should be eliminated/merged.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobNoxious_a858.html" title="User:RobNoxious">RobNoxious</a> 01:25, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
