<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> as non-notable unless evidence of importance is provided, like revenue and number of employees. Like porn actors, MLM companies have inflated Google results because of search engine spamming and also because of promotion/complaints/lawsuits by employees. There is some evidence that it is a scam - complaints, lawsuits and the fact that extract from the melaleuca tree has no proven health benefits. A company whose business is completely fraudulent has to be pretty big and/or scam a lot of people to be notable. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:38, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If there's any legitimate accusation of fraud from a non-trivial source, by all means include it. We've included the brief passing mention from Quackwatch. MLMWatch doesn't seem to mention it at all. There's some grumblings on message boards and individual attack sites but those aren't really reliable or substantial sources. As I mentioned before, the company <a href="http://www.idahofalls.bbb.org/commonreport.html?bid=10618" class="external text" title="http://www.idahofalls.bbb.org/commonreport.html?bid=10618" rel="nofollow">is a member of the Better Business Bureau with a satisfactory record</a> so the fraud accusations have already been a suitable amount of space, in my estimation. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 18:12, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Saying a company is fraudulent is much more serious than saying it is notable. Accusations of fraud should be held to a more rigorous standard of reporting than that required for accusations of notability. At any rate, a company's questionable business practice is not a criterion for deletion; if you'd like to discuss the validity of fraud accusations then post them on <a href="../../../m/e/l/Talk%7EMelaleuca_%28company%29_901e.html" title="Talk:Melaleuca (company)">Talk:Melaleuca (company)</a> where I've already started a heading on this particular subject. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 20:24, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
