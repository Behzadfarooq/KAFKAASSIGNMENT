<p><b>Delete</b>. I think that this article deals with someone who, while likely a very nice person, is not publically significant enough to justify a page on Wikipedia. Strelchik is a failed political candidate, and, according to the article, a rights activist in <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thornhill%2C_Ontario_5275.html" title="Thornhill, Ontario">Thornhill</a>. However, his article is so overwhelmingly for him, that it makes me dizzy. Whenever it is changed to make it at least somewhat neutral and acceptable, these edits are reverted. But even without this, there are many more 'important' people, and I use the word lightly, who are better suited to a page on this website. I even created this article, but now realize it was wrong. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheonlyedge_8121.html" title="User:Theonlyedge">Theonlyedge</a> 22:02, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> Please do not keep. The Canadian House of Commons has 308 seats. The US House has 435. The Canadian election, in many ridings, had Conservatives, Liberals, NDPs and Greens, along with a variety of independents. The US has Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians pretty consistently, and a growing number of Greens, as well as a good crop of independents. A huge number of these candidates are running in the only election of their lives. Merely being on the ballot is not a sign of notability, and most of them will be forgotten after the election is over. Unless an individual has other notability, or made the campaign notable in some way, they should not have permanent articles. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:07, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not certain that he remains a director; he doesn't appear on the <a href="http://www.freethechildren.com/aboutus/theboard.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.freethechildren.com/aboutus/theboard.htm" rel="nofollow">list of members of the Board of Directors</a>, and a search for his name on the Free the Children site returns only two <a href="http://www.freethechildren.com/sitesearch/search.php?zoom_query=Simon+Strelchik" class="external text" title="http://www.freethechildren.com/sitesearch/search.php?zoom_query=Simon+Strelchik" rel="nofollow">results</a>, each of which is actually in reference to Simon Fraser College. Nevertheless, his involvement does appear to be legitimate, at least inasmuch as both <a href="http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=8301" class="external text" title="http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=8301" rel="nofollow">Canadian Jewish News</a> and the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/196/" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/196/" rel="nofollow">CBC</a> reference such involvement, although it's unclear whether either means to vouch for the information as independently verified or simply to recapitulate Strelchik's provided biography. I'm profoundly disinclined to doubt the information, but I wonder as to our sourcing; then again, if indeed he co-founded the organization at age 13, it's unlikely we'd get many Ghits apropos of that involvement. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:42, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>there are lots of connections as theonlyedge either being Alan Shefman himself or a sockpuppet of Pm shef, first the name "edge" is the same name as shefman's company, they both were attack the same oppenents and have info that only they would know, appears to be politicaly motivated. being from the vaughan area myself they both (if not the same person) have been doing similer practices outside of wikipedia.

<dd>Let's try this again: <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheonlyedge_8121.html" title="User:Theonlyedge">Theonlyedge</a> <i>wrote</i> this article up in the <i>first</i> place.

<dd>I know you must be very frustrated with all the non-sense but the reason he originally wrote it had to do with 1) the federal election and 2) when the Alan Shefman article was up for deletion to show an opponent that he beat had an article. It is a real shame that the wike admins. don't have all the info. about this group. I don't think you realize, the non-sense that this group that the shefman's are in, causes here in vaughan. Mark my words, one day soon, you will read about a major scandal coming from Vaughan area politicians that not only include shefman but also there "king pins" De Biase, Kadis, Sorbara, Bevilaqua and there realife puppets, like shefman, ferri and many more</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no indication that pm_shef and theonlyedge are sockpuppets. The original AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Simon_Strelchik_2025.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simon Strelchik">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simon Strelchik</a> was nominated by pm_shef and theonlyedge voted to keep. This AfD was nominated by theonlyedge and I see that pm_shef has not made a single appearance on this page. If you are going to use sockpuppets then you might as well get them to backup your position. Sort of like having multiple IP's with little or no edits come and vote here or attempt to place invalid sockpuppet tags on both theonlyedge and pm_shef. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 02:45, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
