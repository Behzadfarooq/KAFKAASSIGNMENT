<dd><b>Comment</b> In all honesty I don't feel terribly strongly about this. However, for the purposes of having a proper debate - could someone who has voted "keep" explain to me why the man himself needs an article, distinct from the article about (1) CDA of which he is chair and (2) the important libel case which he was party to? Yes, the CDA is notable, yes, the case is notable - but is he?</dd>
<dd>There are plenty of clubs, pressure groups etc. more prominent than the CDA, the leaders of which don't have articles (and rightly so). There are <i>much</i> more important landmark legal cases where the plaintiff and the defendant don't have their own article (and rightly so).</dd>
<dd>Setting aside whether or not the nominator may or may not have a personal issue with the subject of this article (I gather he does), I think these questions need to be addressed. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 01:12, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment in response to Sandy Dancer</b> I think that we need to look at this in three parts. Firstly there are more assertions of notability than the two mentioned. There's the leadership of the Monday Club's "ultra" wing in their last days, then there's the attempt to expel Smith personally for from the Conservative Party that forced the Tories to back down after attracting a number of unhelpful media articles and finally there was the candidacy in Portsmouth North for UKIP which was credited by Smith, the Tory candidate and the analyst Richard North for stopping a Conservative win in that seat. These are all backed up by quite a lot of non-trivial coverage in the mainstream press. Now these are all related to his political activities but the political activities are not all within the realms of the CDA.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The second point is that even with the two assertions of notability - they are seperate enough to warrant a bridging article. When you count in the other political activities (particularly the UKIP candidacy in Portsmouth) this point is more crucial. While the argument that if he only attracted attention as the leader of the CDA, or only the UKIP candidate or only the plaintiff in <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith-Smith_v_Williams_c783.html" title="Keith-Smith v Williams">Keith-Smith v Williams</a> then he would have no independent notability might have some merit, as someone who attracts attention from all three fronts then he merits an article as a bridge between these.</dd>
<dd>Lastly there's a more general point. Politics is never simply about the people who hold official office it's about the sea in which these fish swim. It is important for a student of politics to get an idea of the people who are in the background influencing the political climate. People such as Mike Smith, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Montgomerie_a093.html" title="Tim Montgomerie">Tim Montgomerie</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_MacGregor_2d71.html" title="Mark MacGregor">Mark MacGregor</a> may not be well known to the public - sometimes by their own choice - but their influence means that they should be known - at least by those who wish to find out. <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Wilson_1ebd.html" title="Des Wilson">Des Wilson</a> in the Liberal Democrats or <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Lawson_2dfa.html" title="Neal Lawson">Neal Lawson</a> in Labour would fill similar positions. While I have little sympathy with vanity articles or articles for every councillor on a particular council, influential non-office holders should be included - whether or not one agrees with their politics.</dd>
