<li>2 issues first: "OBVIOUS HOAX AND PATENT NONSENSE? I THINK THE ONLY WHO HAS PROVED HE IS INEFFECTIVE AT THESE VOTES IS YOU IDONT HAVEANAME" would be a personal attack on Idont haveaname, and "USER: WEYES AND HIS MINIONS KEEP ABUSING THEIR POWER" would also be a personal attack on Weyes... second, i read the page, still doesn't prove anything under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Please read that page. You will then come to the conjecture, along with the rest of us, that the band is non-notable and everything we have done is fair considering we have only been able to find 1 hit on it... <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 06:07, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The comment to idont haveaname is not a personal assault, i was pointing out that he claimed it was an obvious hoax and patent nonsense dispite the fact that if you click one link you will see it is a real band. that is a CRITICISM of his voting technique, not an attack. ALSO it is my opinion that Weyes and his followers ARE abusing their power, that is not an attack, the only attack was there continued Speedy Deleting of the page. AND my comment to you to read the page had nothing to do with MUSIC, it had to do with the fact that you asked me to proof to you that this band EXISTS, please read what you wrote, you asked to prove it exists, and i told you to click the link to see it did. NOW you change the subject and ignore your original comments, how conveniant. -<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrowardBulldawg_2d70.html" title="User:BrowardBulldawg">BrowardBulldawg</a> 06:11, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Example: You asked: "Again, stop the personal attacks and come up with proof that this band exists from a verfiable source. " I replied: "AND LOOK AT THE LINK IN THE ARTICLE ITSELF. " then you completely change the subject and IGNORE your first comments in order to discredit me by saying: "... second, i read the page, still doesn't prove anything under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>."

<li>If you read the rest of my post, it also talks about notability... and the first post i made was about <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>... so i don't see how that really applies, plus, you really brought up the issue of notability by editting the original page to that the band member's name actually match up... <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 06:29, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>First, under the original page and the band members listed, it turned up 0 hits, therefore, that was a valid hoax. After you edited the page, you then changed the band members to the correct name. After you did that, this brings up the issue of notability brought upon the page by yourself by correcting your <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_nonsense.html" title="Patent nonsense">nonsensical</a> origial page which indeed contained false information about the band members. So really, you yourself are responsible for the change of topic because you EDITED the page. So therefore, even after the edits, it still is a valid <b>Delete</b> because it fails the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> test. As for your excuse the it is your opinion the Weyes are abusing their power, it is still as personal attack. The second you express your opinion, it can be interpreted as so (i.e. "I think &lt;&lt;insert any name here&gt;&gt; is an idiot because of his edits" would just be an opinion of an person, but also a peronal attack). Again, I reitterate, the original page, seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fallen_Desire&amp;oldid=14862664" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fallen_Desire&amp;oldid=14862664" rel="nofollow">here</a> was to be speedied as it was a hoax and did not contain the link at the time. Hope that answers your questions, either way, the page is not Wikipedia material.

<li>HOW IS SAYING HE IS ABUSING HIS POWER AN ATTACK? ARE YOU SAYING THAT SAYING THE TRUTH IS WRONG? ARE YOU SAYING THAT IF SOMEONE ABUSES THEIR POWER IT IS AN ATTACK TO POINT THAT OUT?! -<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrowardBulldawg_2d70.html" title="User:BrowardBulldawg">BrowardBulldawg</a> 06:24, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you say it without hard evidence, it is called <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander.html" title="Slander">slandering</a>. Simply because it is your opinion, doesn't make it fact. And he is not abusing otherwise he would have deleted the page himself. The fact that he put a notice up to let other admins to decide, is a sign that he didn't abust power. Again, opinion is not fact, don't slander and in general, just don't say anything about anybody unless it's to compliment them. Try <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethic_of_Reciprocity_f046.html" title="Ethic of Reciprocity">Ethic of Reciprocity</a>. Also, just calm down. if your going to post anything else here, let it be something that refutes the current claim that it doesn't satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as that is the current issue. You proved the band exists, but not notability. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 06:29, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Also I'd suggest to BrowardBulldawg that he turns off the Caps Lock, as writing in all caps on the internet is generally taken as impolite or a sign of lunacy (no, I'm not saying you're a lunatic, but it's the equivalent of screaming at the top of your lungs, which tends to get you strange looks if you do that in the street). <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 06:41, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
