<li><b>Keep</b> There are many types of pages that describe things from video games (and movies and books......). I don't think that it is a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_guide.html" title="Game guide">game guide</a>. A quote from our page on game guides: <i>instruction books that contain hints or complete solutions to specific video games. The exact meaning of a "strategy guide" these days is very vague, as most could be easily ranked as "walkthroughs" or "hint collections".</i> It doesn't give hints, it just describes the classes. <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a> 00:55, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is not a game guide, aside from a few iffy sections. It merely describes something that is characteristic of a game. The information is primarily an extension of the already existing WoW article, providing more details about the classes than can easily fit there. If you see anything that says something like "Taurnes make the best Shamans when they do this build" delete it, but the article itself isn't a problem. If it is...check the category for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_classes.html" title="Character classes">Character classes</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:03, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it appears to only list verifiable facts, and from the looks of the talk page, they've tried hard to keep it from becoming a guide. <b><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltra-Loser_fa06.html" title="User:Ultra-Loser"><span style="color:#112B84">Ultra-Loser</span></a></b> <small><a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltra-Loser_53db.html" title="User talk:Ultra-Loser">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultra-Loser_4117.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultra-Loser">Contributions</a></small> 01:13, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, doesn't meet my encyclopedic threshold. Agree with nom that this is spiralling into a game guide -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 01:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That's not very informative. I asked about your encyclopedia threshold, not for references to what is a very ill-defined standard. The page you cited doesn't describe the difference between a game guide and information about a game at all, and IMHO, is close to outright uselessness. So I ask, where is the threshold for you (or for anybody else claiming it is a game guide, I'm not addressing this to you in particular) as to what is a game guide, and what is encyclopedic content about a game? Where do you, speaking for yourself, draw the line? What would shift the balance of this article to encyclopedic? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This article is essentially a summary of the WoW site on character classes: <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and the sub-pages of that page. In my opinion, that makes it analogous to a gaming guide. Suitable for a gaming wiki, not for an encyclopedia -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 04:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. While it certainly can be argued that this page is redundant to any number of pages on classes in World of Warcraft, that is not a reason for deletion. In fact, that's a good thing, since it means there are sources on it. Anyway, this is an article that has spun off from the main article about a game, and there's no question of deleting that. Nor does the information being about a game make it a game guide in the sense that I'd consider it inherently objectionable. So really, what makes an article about a game, or aspect of it a game guide? What do you feel would have to be removed or added to make this article encyclopedic? What do you feel about the other articles about character classes? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see much in terms of sources. The only <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is the link I listed above and its subpages. This article is essentially a re-hash of that particular guide to the character classes. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 06:10, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lack of sources is not itself a reason for deletion, and if you want to tag it as unsourced, go right ahead. There's no shortage of informative books about WoW, that's for sure. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, but this can fundamentally draw from only one source, right. In its ideal, it will be the players guide to the classes of WoW. That's what defines its (for want of a better term) cruftiness and non-encyclopedic nature -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 07:34, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So in your view all articles not being the game/movie/book etc. should be deleted? Say example articles built on said main article; <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer_J._Simpson_dd4c.html" title="Homer J. Simpson">Homer J. Simpson</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excalibur.html" title="Excalibur">Excalibur</a> etc. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 10:59, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fundamentally, almost all articles about an aspect of a creative media can only draw from one source. I don't think that means much. This article isn't existing in isolation, but is a daughter of the main <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> article. Since people what to know about that, this aspect of it needs coverage there. But wait, that article has become rather long. So a convenient section was spun-off. And while I suppose if you define ideal as "Completely exhaustive and informative about a subject" it might qualify as a game guide, but there's a difference between that and setting a goal as "ideal for Wikipedia" which would simply be informative to the extent appropriate for an encyclopedia. In this case, I'd say a sufficient description so that the uninformed person can understand what the classes individually mean in the game is what we should be shooting for. Where do you draw the line? Having no content whatsoever? Having one line summaries? Again, I ask, where do you draw the line? What should be added or removed? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, it doesn't really seem like a game guide, it gives no info about how to play the class, only info about the class.

<dd>So instead of one reasonably convenient article, you'd rather have 9 to go through? Not that I really see a problem with having the information in both places, as that's helpful in its own way.

<dd>Well, as I see it the seperate article is meant to summarize what the classes can do, and exists because doing those summaries properly would contribute to an existing <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Article size</a> problem. Sad to say, the WOW main article is just that big. I don't see it getting smaller. Thus sections like this which can be treated independently are created, with more detail added as the size issue is not so much of an immediate problem. Talking about differences between the WOW classes and those in other systems is certainly appropriate for a different article, specific to the class, but getting into the differences might be considered original research. In any case, I'd strongly oppose this article being treated that way. This article is supposed to be about WOW classes, and should stick very carefully to just that. But feel free to bring up the issue on the existing class pages. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:30, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rage and Stances are common concepts? Since when? WoW's the only one I know of with them. How many other games have totems? Energy? Combo points?

<dd>I won't go into detail here, but all those things have been done by other CPRGs or PnP games, albeit under different names. More on that in a minute. Afd is first and foremost critiquing articles' <i>current</i> status, not their <i>potential</i>. This particular article needs a better focus on what is new or different from previous games and/or fantasy worlds rather than providing the current grab-bag of new and old concepts <i>without identifying which WoW changed or invented</i>. Doing this would strip much of the generic class handling content (thus removing the "game guide" argument) and would clearly indicate the real world significance of WoW's classes to fantasy gaming as a whole, whereas right now the information only demonstrates its importance to WoW itself (which doesn't count when it comes to overall significance). <i>This</i> revision isn't that, however, so I'm still arguing for deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 00:25, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've never played WoW, have you? Yes, it's true that Paladins heal people. That is what we in the inside-top-secret-know call a "basic description of what the paladin class does." GASP! The wiki does not tell you HOW to heal, merely that it exists. Game guides generally have the criteria of "telling you how to do things." Seeing as this wiki page has none of that... As for sourcing, that's not anything to delete the entire page over.

"Just because it's about pop culture or entertainment doesn't make it any less notable." No, it actually makes it easier for it to be notable and as such, the bar for inclusion into the general purpose encyclopedia is set that much higher.

If we start deleting things from the wiki because there are other places to look, then we'd have no wiki. At all. The wiki is ALL STUFF FROM OTHER PLACES!

Also, don't tell him to stop questioning people's opinions, because in doing so you are questioning his opinion. He's allowed to have an opinion just as much as you are. As for "specific information," not really. If you wanted specific information, we could list all talents and talent builds and whatnot. We give no advice as to what you should do as a class (which would be what we like to call "a game guide") but instead give a general overview as to what all the classes are - something perfect for an information depository such as the Wiki.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Not a horrible article, but it fails to provide any context outside of game-guide content.

Of course, there's the "original research" problem, but at least it wouldn't be a generic list of classes confined to WoW. Sure, WoW is tremendously popular, but how far does that popularity extend?

<dd>Nice strawman. Firstly, that's an announcement, not information for an encyclopedia. Secondly, I meant information that has any merit at all. Thirdly, the comment I was refuting had nothing to do with it being useful information or not. -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 22:17, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's Afd's like this which make the World of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a> a very compelling place to many of us who are adults (or at least aspire to act like adults). You have a user who strongly favors keeping the article voting <b>oppose</b> in a request for administrator based on another user's vote to <b>delete</b>, not because the user said something like " 'cause World of Warcraft sux" or the such, but because they gave their opinion (which was well thought out, logical, and based on what many would say is a consensus interpretation of Wikipedia policies). A user should not have to worry about a good faith vote(and there is no other way to look at that vote) in an Afd being one day used against them in an Rfa.</li>
<li>Look at the edit summaries on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Classes_in_World_of_Warcraft&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Classes_in_World_of_Warcraft&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history page</a>. Yes, occasional "cute" edit summaries are OK, but when the page looks like a myspace-page, it tells me there might be something wrong with the maturity of some of the users. This <b>is</b> an encyclopedia. And yes, while many of us did not have the benefit of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_math.html" title="New math">new math</a> such as AOLgebra, we understand that "CAPS LOCK AND BOLD = SHOUTING".

<li>For reference, there is a World of Warcraft wiki <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.wowwiki.com/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The reason I bring this up is this- a year from now, are there going to be less, more, or about the same number of WoW articles&#160;? I would bet my next paycheck that there will be more, possible 5 times as many articles. Some of you WoW fans might find this frustrating as 99.9% of the articles which need to be written about the subject have already <i>been</i> written. This is a general purpose encyclopedia, it's not designed to be the encompassing source for all things WoW, and if you're likely to get bent out of shape over a WoW article you expended much effort in writing, your talents may be better utilized <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.wowwiki.com/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>

<dd>Paragraph 1; no comment. Paragraph 2; Yeah, okay, some of my edit summaries are stupid. The problem is that people aren't listening at all, and it's REALLY starting to annoy me. I guess I'm taking it out on the edit summary. I'll stop now. And I was e-shouting because people have yet to answer my question, which is the entire reason the article's been nominated in the first place. Paragraph 3; This argument would have a point if it were a 5-page biography on some obscure WoW character. The problem is it's <i>not</i>. Classes are pretty much THE most important topic in the game.

<li><b>Keep</b> Read the secton on instruction manuals a bit more carefully. Yes, this article needs some serious work, but everything it contains is descriptive. It describes information from the game, and does not prescribe how to do things. It may contain some advice or instruction, but it could easily be fixed so as to not contain said elements. Also, as a gamer, I often use wikipedia to research games I am considering buying, and have often found pages like this useful. --Falard 00:32, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>Wikipedia isn't a resource to review video games. And just because an article is descriptive does not mean it should be on Wikipedia - here, the article is descriptive of information that doesn't in an encyclopedia. Aren't there fan websites to do with this game, if its so notable?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is obviously not a game guide, which offers hints or solutions to the game, but a mere description of an existing set-up. I would like to emphasize, that it is of a purely descriptive nature, and not a guide. If how-to bits appear, they need to be removed, but the article itself should be kept. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimlei_9818.html" title="User:Gimlei">Gimlei</a> 00:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> Though has a "gameguide creep" problem and can be difficult to manage sometimes, it's certainly an article that deserves existence. If it didn't exist, then it would be necessary to increase the size of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> article to accomodate information on its classes. And I'm talking like 250-500 words <i>per class</i>, which would bloat the article significantly and it's large enough as it is. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertM525_4c7c.html" title="User:RobertM525">RobertM525</a> 01:54, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Huh? Why would we need 250-500 words "per class"? Why is that information notable in the context of an encyclopedia at all? Wikipedia doesn't contain, for example, a 500 word profile of every character in <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Zhivago_718c.html" title="Doctor Zhivago">Doctor Zhivago</a>, and that is considered one of the greatest movies of all time - so even if this WoW thing is considered one of the greatest video games of all time, why do we need all this in depth detail?

<li>I agree with SandyDancer, why so detailed?

If you want an article to go into more detail about something, then write about it.
