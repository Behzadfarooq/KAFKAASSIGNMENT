<p>nn local lan party, no assertion of notability. I initially speedied this, and received an upset email from the author. Ain't nothin' that'll be hurt by letting this go through an AfD, and it might help smooth some ruffled feathers. I believe the author intends well, and I don't want him to think some cabalist is beating up on him, so, voila! &#160;:D - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 07:48, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>Just for the record, here is the email I sent to Chairboy regarding the deletion of this article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Chairboy,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You'll have to excuse me, I'm a long-time user/reader of Wikipedia, however I just recently created an account to create and edit topics, so I am not completely familiar with all the ins-and-outs of the system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know you meant well, but I am sort of offended. H4x0rLAN is a local organization that I've been helping run for over 3 years. My entry wasn't a blog whatsoever. I was doing my best to accurately document our existence. I thought Wikipedia was exactly for this sort of thing. I was using proper etiquette by following common procedure as I see used on other Wikipedia entries and linking to other Wikipedia entries for certain phrases and items. You say my entry (which was far from complete) was a blog, however I look at say the entry for the Internal Revenue Service. I was following the same format. Does this constitute the IRS entry as a blog? Does that entitle me the right to delete that entry? Why do entries for QuakeCon or DreamHack (other LAN parties) be allowed to exist, but that which I partake in does not?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry if I'm sounding rude, but I was working hard on that entry that I thought could be a great addition to help out local gamers of Green Bay in finding an active organization to engage in. Again, it was far from complete and what I had posted was a small sample of the factual information I was planning on posting. Unfortunately, if this is the welcome I receive, I may have to reevaluate my future contributions to Wikipedia. Sincerely, GBLANSandrock</dd>
</dl>
<p>We have hosted events in size from 10 up to 150 attendees and have a community of over 330 individuals from several states and even Canada, which I think meets the criteria for notability. I was not given time to post this information before my entry was initially speedied. Thank you Chairboy for giving me the opportunity to properly dispute this deletion and post my thoughts.</p>

<dd>OK, so I jumped the gun on assuming it was a totally nn lan party, but despite the author's willingness to clarify and support, I'm not convinced it's notable enough for an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> Vanity. Can I list my weekly poker party? No offense to the author but just because WP is a user-edited encyclopedia doesn't means it's a data dump. One limitation of paper encyclopedias is that you can only print the number of pages your audience is willing to buy, so you see maybe 20-30 volumes at most. But just because WP is electronic and can hold a lot more data doesn't mean there are no standards whatsoever.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Good faith article, but doesn't meet WP inclusion guidelines. Ikkyu2 23:16, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This "local" lan party is in-fact one of the larger "casual" LAN Parties in NE Wisconsin, and as original author/gbLAN owner said, has people from all over Wisconsin, Upper Peninsula Michigan, and Canada. This page is not also complete, more is to be added, and current information is to be expanded. Also, as I have suggested to the Author, and as he reports, suggested to the WP Editors, the title to be changed from h4x0rlan (the bi-weekly event of gbLAN) to gbLAN itself, which stands for Green Bay Local Area Network (the city in which these events are hosted), because the gbLAN community also hosts a semi-annual event called Kick-It-Lan which hosts as up to 150+ people and is one of the larger if not the larges LAN party in WI/UP-MI north of Chichago or Milwaukee, which to me appears to be worth notability. For those siting WP:NOT can you please cite the text you are refering to, as I cannot find what you mean by "WP:NOT A LAN directory". Thank you! Soriano 23:42, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
