<li><b>Delete</b> because the article fails to establish notability of this particular threat. The link to Symantec gives the risk as "medium". I don't believe Wikipedia should become a repository of every possible piece of malware. I would like articles in this genre to meet the <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> criteria and to have the very highest risk level designation of one of the major anti-virus vendors. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JonHarder_9df4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JonHarder">JonHarder</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonHarder_604a.html" title="User talk:JonHarder">talk</a></sup> 03:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Notability in the world of malware and viruses isn't really set as such, but unless third parties are writing about it (other than say Norton and McAfee...) it doesn't really have much notability in my opinion. A quick scan of the definitions list for your antivirus software shows well over 50,000 known virus profiles, if each of those is worthy of an article... ouch. If, however, it's been written about in news sources or such, and the sourcing can be provided, then I'd say keep. As it is, delete with no prejudice. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 06:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As JonHarder states, it is only a low level threat <a href="http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2006-090516-0204-99&amp;tabid=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2006-090516-0204-99&amp;tabid=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

As per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> it would pass as there are many more than 3 reviews (albeit the reviews are all negative). However, as <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> it's really only a minor player, alexa =8974, and how many of those are people looking to get rid of the maliscious adware. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.virusburst.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.virusburst.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li>Change vote to <b>weak keep</b>. The page has since been improved by authors - good call. Google research (see the article's talk page) pulls up just about 10k ghits that aren't here or on Myspace, so there's something of notability. Little on Wikipedia links to the article, but that may be irrelevant. I can't say better than weak keep for the grounds that it's notable within its genre (case in point: much of the furry related deletions that have happened here on WP), but I can no longer in good conscience at all say delete knowing that there's just about 10k ghits and therefore some notability. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 22:41, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not really. At any moment in the day there are about 1500 people on the site. vBulliten says there are "79,874 active members."

<li>Popcon is not exactly <i>that</i> straightforward to interpret, while it <i>is</i> simple in principle; think of it as a glorified Google test. You can set a rather vague limits and interpret accordingly. <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> suggests as much about its use, only that it can <i>and should</i> be used to gauge software's notability. <i>My</i> interpretation is that software above 10,000 line is notable and anything below 15,000-20,000 is probably chaff, and there's a buffer zone that fluctuates depending on what time of the day it is and how much coffee I've had. (See also below for time of the day.) You can probably find some other AfD where I'm pulling different figures out of my sleeves - <i>it's all based on a gut feeling</i>. My current idea, solidly on this gut feeling, is that if we include 15%-20% of what Debian thinks is their most remarkable software, we're sailing smooth and not including utter garbage. Also note that this thing tracks <i>packages</i>, not <i>software</i>; Debian compiles one source tarball into one or more packages. (There (at least used to be, if not still) packages <tt>celestia</tt>, <tt>celestia-common</tt> and <tt>celestia-gtk</tt>, and it's not uncommon to see -common and -data packages, not to even mention -doc packages!) Different versions of software can get into separate packages, should the maintainers keep them around to ensure compatibility. (There's <tt>mediawiki1.6</tt> and <tt>mediawiki1.7</tt>.) There's pseudopackages that just depend on other packages. In the upper end, there's Software You Can't Remove Lest Stuff Would Break. And libraries and -dev packages, well, it's better not get into them, or we'd be still talking about them tomorrow. My point is, popcon by_inst &lt;10,000 is much less of work that it sounds. And remember that MediaWiki is pretty darn remarkable and popular and it's still in the 7000s, last I checked. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 00:41, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm just a poor geek kid that was raised with Mario instead of Proper Manly Games.) I was pretty sure my chiss-sweesed brains had actually remembered that there was a mention of Pydance in some Linux magazine. Looks like <a href="http://icculus.org/pyddr/links.php" class="external text" title="http://icculus.org/pyddr/links.php" rel="nofollow">they have a list of press mentions</a>, but this one lists somewhat trivial mentions from print side (I have no idea if Linux Format covered it aside of just shoveling it to CD) though some online mentions are nontrivial. However, the article I'm remembering isn't here. (I'm thinking of Linux Journal, probably Marcel Gagné's column, but my memory is probably completely messed up in this regard, and it is, as mentioned above, past 01:45). Therefore, I see <i>no other resolution</i> but change my recommendation above from solid <del><b>Weak Keep</b></del> to extremely firm <b>Weak Keep</b>. (You know, because that's still based on notability rather than verifiability.) It's <i>not</i> the most remarkable DDR simulator or even influential, even when it's pretty impressive someone pulls this off with just Python - and like other people said, Stepmania kind of stole the show on this genre of software on OSS side.

<li>Not voting for obvious reasons, but I will mention this existed long before Stepmania went GPLd, and even longer before it worked on anything not Windows (you can verify that with the release dates of the programs; not sure what "no reliable source" means in reference to free software...). Certainly not a popular clone, but does Wikipedia want to have articles on popular software, or historically notable software?

What is wrong with my page i will fix anything that you want. You have already deleted it once. I don't want you to delete my work again. I dont work for this company, i used to volunteer for them. I just want an entry for the ranch on wikipedia. -isoar4jc</p>
<ul>
<li>isoar4jc, if you want a wikipedia article that's kept, I'd suggest you look up the relevant policies at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what wikipedia is not</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability requirements</a> <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability guidelines</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">Notability criteria for organizations</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">Notability requirements for corporations</a>. I can appreciate your desire to have someplace important to you on wikipedia, and I think you could write a great article, but sometimes it's tough to sort the wheat from the chaff in Articles for Deletion. If you have any news articles, published material from a third party, or other references, it would be great to see them, otherwise the organization might not meet our requiremts as per <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">wikipedia:notability of organizations</a>. Remember that notability is not the same as importance, there are many things important to many people that, sadly, are not verifiable enough for wikipedia standards. If you need any help, just drop me a line. As it stands, I'd say <b>weak keep</b> contingent on the providing of sources. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, if no sources exist, then delete. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 06:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As of now, the article does not show that the topic is notable. Unless notability is established, this should go. And Isoar, I too understand the desire to have an article on something you've been involved in, but not all things are important enough for articles. The problem in this case is not the writing and such, but rather the topic of the article itself doesn't seem important enough. If you can provide links from third party sources that show that the topic of this article is notable then it is more likely to be kept than if it remains as is. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:56, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Isoar, you'll need to supply links to the relevant news articles and those news articles must do more than merely mention the topic of this article; they'll need to discuss the topic enough so as to establish notability. These sources will also need to be cited in the article. If you can do this then I'm sure many of us who are voting for deletion would reconsider. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>fine delete it</b> your minds are made up. It is covered extensively on 100 Huntley Street, but since that is owned by crossroads, then you wont accept that. and most other news articles arent online they'd just be on local cannels or newspapers. I know alot of campers and volunteer staff who are visiting this page and would be very unhappy if it got deleted. isoar4jc 22:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC) And stop call in me Isoar it's isoar4jc no capital and complete UID brainiacs.</p>

<li><b>comment</b> isoar4JC: please don't get frustrated, and abbreviations of usernames are common, though they can be annoying no harm was meant I assure you. This debate is far from over, please don't give up and just leave. There appear to be some sources, if you can supply links OR MLA-format citations (for things that do not exist online) to third-party materials I'd be more than happy to include them. Despite the implication, online sources are not the only valid ones. I'd love to help you keep this, but I need your help in doing so. the SPCA materials appear to provide notability in my mind as well. Also: wikipedia sources are not considered viable, but if you can track down the sources on those other articles they may provide notability for the ranches as well. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 02:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>isoar4jc</b> My UID is already an abbreveation, an i'm just sick of peaple calling me isoar, sorry that you all caught the reaction to the same thing somewhere else. As to articles and news stuff, I am working on that, but its not as easy as you make it sound. I need to find stories aout specific camps which leads you on many wild goose chases. I'm currently on the trail of a huge news story about the rance in British Columbia being evacuated beacuse a forrest fire a couple years ago. (i was there when it happened, and the news crews were there to film the horses being evacuated) And have you ever heard of Shane Doan? He is the captain of the Phoenix Cyotes he was also the Captain of Team Canada in the last winter oylmpics. He is the son of Bernie and Bernise Doan who just happen to be the regional directors for the western camps, he was a camp kid. The stories exist but getting the specific articles is alot of work. Isoar4jc 03:18, 22 December 2006 (UTC) PS: Why are none of the other camps listed here under deletion review? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_summer_camps" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_summer_camps" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_summer_camps</a></li>

<dd>Isoar4jc, please don't be mad at people for further abbreviating your name for the sake of brevity; editors often will refer to people by only the first few letters of their name and mean no disrespect. That aside, regarding your above comment: often times if its really hard to track down sources on a topic like this, that is a good indication that the topic itself isn't notable enough to meet Wikipedia guidelines. Stories about a camp having to be evacuated because of a forest fire, for example, tell us nothing about the importance of the camp itself. If there aren't sources that can explicitly tell us why this particular camp is notable (ie., why it is especially important, as 'average' camps, whether religious or secular, are typically not notable enough to warrant articles) then we will probably remove the article on the camp because we have to have third party sources. Also, having the son of someone important being involved in something in no way makes that thing particularly notable. Finally, in regards to other articles on camps, any of them which don't establish notability should be nominated for AfDs. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:29, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a directory for every University professor who published something minorly significant. My professor from college published four popular books in historical subjects, but then again so did nearly every other professor in the department!

<li><s><b>Redirect</b>. While theoretically (no pun intended) a useful stub, this is an unobserved particle that is related to another unobserved particle through an unobserved relationship, despite all of that being predicted by supersymmetry theory. I'm uncertain how much we can expand this stub; I do not know that many (any?) of the significant properties of an axino are defined by the extant mathematics ... and the current content of this article is duplicated within the longer <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpartner.html" title="Superpartner">superpartner</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Why can't we have an article that is two lines long?

The first link (citation in the academic article) is for the <i>definition</i> of an adventure game and does not exactly contribute to <i>the meat of the article</i> as it were, i.e. the coverage of AdventureGamers in the context of the article is trivial. People cite Wikipedia all the time for definitions and such-like; it doesn't make Wikipedia content any more reliable or notable. The second link is an <i>interview with Ernest Adams conducted by Adventure Gamers</i>. <i>Of course</i> it's going to be published on AdventureGamers and <i>of course</i> Ernest Adams would see fit to republish an interview with himself on his own website. This doesn't lend any more notability to AdventureGamers <i>per se</i>. The magazines and TV programs cited don't seem notable in and of themselves. In summary, what we have is some notable coverage in non-notable media, as well as non-notable coverage in notable media, none of which satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Does the collective power of so many references establish notability? IMHO, no. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange"><sup>Please rate me at Editor Review!</sup></font></a></b> 07:48, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Where does it say in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> that the "multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself" ought to be notable in themselves? Wouldn't such an additional constraint lead to a <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circulus_vitiosus.html" title="Circulus vitiosus">circulus vitiosus</a> when trying to establish anything's notability?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Notability now appears firmly established. -<a href="../../../j/h/f/User%7EJHFTC_516e.html" title="User:JHFTC">Toptomcat</a> 18:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While the site may have started as a fan page, in the years since its inception it has become the defacto news and editorial source for a sizable pocket of the game community, not just for fans of adventure games and storytelling in games, but for developers of those games, and even other members of the press who cover such games. This has been covered pretty well by the increasing pile of links about the site being posted above. The site's notability and credibility have been well established by others in this thread. Ja2ke 19:25, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also it's worth noting that this AfD proposal seems to at least partially be a result of an only tangentially-related spat between a member of Adventure Gamers' staff and a Wikipedia mod over whether or not certain Wikipedia articles covering small independently developed freeware adventure games should or shouldn't be deleted. Ja2ke 19:23, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per Amaccormack, especially his comment on the WP:WEB talk page: who reviews review sites? The current rules effectively ban a review site from ever being mentioned in Wikipedia. This is clearly counterproductive. Furthermore, WP:WEB is explicitly descriptive, not perscriptive, and I'm amazed that it's used as a demand. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 12:56, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nominated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Color_or_Country_%28second_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Color_or_Country_%28second_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">again</a>, attracted almost no attention. I would like to renominate the article on the grounds that it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. There are no third party sources that discuss this in any non-trivial way. Only a few hundred google hits, most irrelevant, many mirroring wikipedia. I do not doubt this game exists but if the only sources we can find are mentions in posts to a math camp message board, it does not warrant an article. <a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 07:23, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I might add that the unverifiable nature of the article is the root of all its other problems, namely a lot of original research, complete lack of sources that might confirm notability (which I am for the moment not going to challenge), and a general air of <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> which may or may not be the case.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 07:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Its unverifiable and, even if it could be verified it doesn't seem notable.

<li><s><b>Neutral</b></s> -- ah heck, <b>Delete</b>. AfD has come a long way in a year. On this article's first nomination for deletion, there were large numbers of people around who thought "delete because it's stupid" was a valid reason, and I voted keep largely to counter that. (I also cared because I had edited the article.) AfD now is much more focused on well-defined standards of verifiability, which I must admit that Color or Country doesn't meet. I'll be sad to see it go, but it makes sense. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 23:47, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Delete all</b> These articles do great harm by filling Wikipedia with stale copies of non-notable info from a database. The huge number of articles were createdd in April 2005, and add nothing to the database from which they were copied. As that database changes over time, there is no automatic process to move changes into this one. TV stations buy taller masts, or the old one blows down and gets replaced, and we take up server space with stale data. Instead, just include a link to the external database in the master article on masts. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:43, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Amazon.com has e.g. "The Path to Serenity: The Book of Spiritual Growth and Personal Change Through Twelve-Step Recovery" (Minirth-Meier Clinic Series) by Robert Hemfelt, Frank Minirth, Richard Fowler, Paul Meier - so it is a generally important theme. - The sad fact that something is a short stub does not mean that it should be deleted.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 22:51, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually I disagree, I have removed the "mac-fanboy" section that was un-encyclopedic, and have spoken to the guy who wrote it. However, it did raise some interesting points, the major being that as a new style of marketing an otherwise niche software market it succeeded. Moreover, this was an unprecedented event within the macintosh community which has, (by initial estimates), boosted the mac shareware economy considerably and is already considered a landmark event in the history of the macintosh community's close relationship between software makers and users. Personally I question the necessity to have articles on Wikipedia about individual episodes of south park, and yet they remain unchallenged. This event actually meant something to the mac community, and is worthy of inclusion in Wikipeida. 86.15.162.159 01:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I believe macworld are including it in their next issue, but you know the delay between online and print. always amazes me how tech magazines stay in print, they can never compete with the online counterparts.
<dl>
<dd>Macworld don't always put everything in their magazine (since there are too many news stories), so we can't count on that happening. I haven't seen much mention of MacHeist outside of Mac/Tech sites. I still don't think this even meets the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> criteria (since there hasn't been mention in any print publications, it hasn't won any awards, etc).

<li><b>Keep, cleanup, and watch</b>. Moreschi's reasoning is understandable, but it's actually incorrect. Wikipedia has, and <i>should</i> have, articles on many things whose existence is open to doubt, or has even been completely disproven: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>; the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler_Diaries_9360.html" title="Hitler Diaries">Hitler Diaries</a>; the <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottingley_Fairies_fa9f.html" title="Cottingley Fairies">Cottingley Fairies</a>... This article should not be kept because any of the bizarre and outlandish claims made about Project Monarch are <i>believable</i>; far from it. It should be kept because those bizarre and outlandish claims have received a measure of attention <i>in and of themselves</i>. In fact, since probably the most exposure the Project Monarch 'theories' got was with the publication of Brice Taylor's "Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free! The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave" and the ensuing media attention, the article really needs to be revised to include information about Taylor's book. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Neologism? I have seen the term used in books and magazines decades old. For example, <i>A Margin of Hope</i> by <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irving_Howe_fb28.html" title="Irving Howe">Irving Howe</a> was reviewed in the Winter 1982/83 issue of <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Affairs_e653.html" title="Foreign Affairs">Foreign Affairs</a></i> as <i>"A compelling account of the author's youth, education, and decades of warfare in the <b>anti-Stalinist Left</b>."</i> So the term was clearly well-understood by then. The term is also used in the May 24, 1982 issue of the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, on a separate subject from Howe and Wald's books: <i>"Nowhere were these issues more vigorously debated than in the offices of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partisan_Review_1bf0.html" title="Partisan Review">Partisan Review</a> - the leading magazine of the <b>anti-Stalinist left</b> and for many years a kind of highly tuned seismograph of the intellectual climate."</i> This was a major intellectual current within the Left in its time. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 11:31, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I created this page, so I've got a vested interest. I'm not sure what you mean by "neologism" - yes, it was coined at some point in the 1930s as a neologism, but has become part of the vocabulary of the left. The collections of political tendencies are diverse, but they are not arbitrary: as the article says, "The term anti-Stalinist left tends to be used in relation to those currents of the left that <b>define themselves centrally</b> in opposition to Stalinism, rather than anyone on the left who is critical of Stalinism." <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 11:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, the problem is exactly in the formulation "tends to be used". The term is a POV usage by certain groups for their own self-identification, rather than an encyclopediatic criteria. There are many other contextual identifications, like 'Revolutionary Left', 'Progressive Left', which have no encyclopediatic article value of their own. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 12:45, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: What you're essentially saying here, Soman, is that only proper nouns deserve encyclopedia pages, as pretty much everything else falls into the "tends to be used" category, from <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism.html" title="Revisionism">revisionism</a> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressivism</a> to, for that matter, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a>, which are all context-bound, but surely deserve pages? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 13:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: No, that's not what I'm saying. Ideologies like <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">Conservatism</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyism.html" title="Trotskyism">Trotskyism</a> are ideologies that can be quite clearly defined, an should thus have separate articles. 'Anti-Stalinist left' concernes various ideological tendencies, grouped together. This is where the contextuality becomes problematic. Who defines that it is these tendencies comprise one single movement, in spite that their formulations of policy and political action are separate? --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 13:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment'</b>:&#160;? Liberalism and Conservatism are rather clearly demarcated ideologies. There is for example, a Liberal International. This doesn't mean that they are homogenous ideologies. Is there any Anti-Stalinist left movement? No. However there are left movements which oppose Stalinism. But these various tendencies have no other common denominator than their opposition to Stalin. We cannot have categorizing article on every issue that 2 or more groupings take a common standpoint. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 19:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Revolutionary left" gives 147 000 hits, but that by itself doesn't motivate an article that simply states "The term revolutionary left tends to be used in relation to those currents of the left that <b>define themselves centrally</b> in opposition to reformism". Likewise with "democratic left", etc. Just cause a wording is used in a book title doesn't mean it should have an article of its own. (For example, "Revolutionary Idealism and Parliamentary Politics: A Study of Trotskyism in Sri Lanka" by M. Somasundram alone does not motivate a separate article for Revolutionary idealism). --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 13:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Well known term, and one that's also useful as many leftist grops defined themselves by their opposition to Stalinism, as pointed out above. 'Neologism' as a reason to tag for deletion is clearly ridiculous-the term has been around for years and is widely used, to refer to this specific movement. Why wasn't this raised on the discussion page before it got to this extreme stage?<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelix-felix_6e81.html" title="User:Felix-felix">Felix-felix</a> 14:05, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> and <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelix-felix_6e81.html" title="User:Felix-felix">Felix-felix</a>'s question should be addressed: Why is this on AfD before other discussion on the page itself? Wikipedia is institutionally a tertiary source reflecting existing peer reviewed secondary sources. The fact that the term is specifically referenced in a Univ. of NC Press book title is ON ITS OWN evidence that this article reflects scholarly work, and the numerous citations of the term given in this discussion only reinforce that. Whether the original nom or anyone else has issues with the term is irrelevant from wikipedia standards as the term passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I'd like to see more direct footnoting in the article to ensure there's no OR taking place, but as there are references, any OR issues (as is standard) can be addressed by article editors, not AfD. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 15:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b> From reading the comments above I can tell that you guys don't know what you are talking about and you have not taken five minutes to look at the Italian Soccer Pages or the other European soccer pages for that matter. First of all, the more senior league (Serie A)has even more detailed results pages showing scores, goal scorers, time of goals, yellow and red flags etc etc etc. The same applies to the senior english league and spanish league to name 2 others. All this page does is show the results for the year. Once the season is over, it will be an historic record of the 2006/2007 game results. To me that 'is encyclopedic'. And who came up with the idea that re-producing a league schedule is a copyright violation? I bet I will find the same schedule in different forms in hundreds of places throughout the internet.AlexDelPiero 04:31, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I can't speak for any other country, but in England the Premier League certainly retain copyright on their fixture lists, and anyone who reproduces them without paying a fee is violating their copyright <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 14:51, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Of course this can be corroborated.

<dd><b>Comment</b> So you are saying that if I write that Bologna will play Juventus on December 19 I can can sued? That's the most rediculous thing I've heard so far. Team and League schedules of any sport are reproduced everywhere and anywhere. Teams want their fans to know when they will be playing so as to improve attendance and television viewing.

<p>I was considering <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">Prodding</a> this one, but I'm not certain about it. Although "The oldest science fiction society in South Africa" is a claim of notability, it's very short, doesn't have any sources, and links only to its own website. If someone can find more material, then I don't have any problem with it, but I don't think it should be kept as it is now. – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 14:45, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Retain</b> - Added a bit more data from the Web, to verify that the organization is legit. In fact, it's about the only contact with SF fandom in Africa that the rest of the world has.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is a tough one as realistically none of the citations (even with Orangemike's additions) really provide much in the way of justifiable notability beyond it being the oldest. That said -- the oldest science fiction society in any nation realistically has SOME notability assuming there is any community in that nation at all. I'm voting Keep largely on the theory that (in general) topics under <a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScience_fiction_by_country_4ae5.html" title="Category:Science fiction by country">science fiction by country</a> are encyclopedic as subjects of genre literature research. Although let's be honest: there are no other articles about South African Science Fiction anywhere on Wikipedia currently.

<li><b>Keep and speedy close</b> , after a minor rewrite with reliable sources. The Lead section shows notability and the References section should be read by the editors. Just needs even further expansion ASAP. Reason for deletion is no longer valid. There appear to be many separate industry media reference links, that shows there is reasonable industry interest.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am constantly baffled by the degree to which we tolerate deletion abuse. This is factual, and verifiable. Well-referenced, encyclopaedic. I'm having trouble seriously believing it's possible to nominate this article in good faith. I'm not sure what the agenda is here but the subject is clearly notable. This person has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of this person. I found plenty of sources in a <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis-Nexis_7163.html" title="Lexis-Nexis">Lexis-Nexis</a> search. This article can be cleaned up and set on track.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All of the links provided are from independent reliable third-party, reputable, non-trivial published sources.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It should be realized that <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investment_management.html" title="Investment management">Money management</a> is a highly specialized, yet suitable topic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Editors please look at the multiple independent reliable sources under <i>References</i>.</li>
<li>I found multiple non-trivial reliable external sources about " Larry Hite", this then establishes notability. It meets notability criteria and sources are reliable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Clearly notable, and widely reported. Perhaps a better article needs to be written, but this is not the form for doing that.

<li><b>Comment</b> It should be noted that due to a large overhaul of the page, all votes before the overhaul of the Wikipedia article should be reconsidered.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> , after a minor rewrite with reliable sources. The Lead section shows notability and the References section should be read by the editors. Just needs even further expansion. Reason for deletion is no longer valid. There appear to be many separate industry media reference links, that shows there is reasonable industry interest. Meets this criterion from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am constantly baffled by the degree to which we tolerate deletion abuse. This is factual, and verifiable. Well-referenced, encyclopaedic. I'm having trouble seriously believing it's possible to nominate this article in good faith. I'm not sure what the agenda is here but the subject is clearly notable. This person has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of this person. I found plenty of sources in a <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis-Nexis_7163.html" title="Lexis-Nexis">Lexis-Nexis</a> search. This article can be cleaned up and set on track.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All of the links provided are from independent reliable third-party, reputable, non-trivial published sources.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Editors please look at the multiple independent reliable sources under <i>References</i>.</li>
<li>I found multiple non-trivial reliable external sources about "Mark A. Ritchie", the Money Manager and acomplished author of 2 books, this then establishes notability. It meets notability criteria and sources are reliable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Clearly notable, and widely reported. Perhaps a better article needs to be written, but this is not the form for doing that. He has been featured in mainstream newsprint publications, including <a href="../../../b/u/s/BusinessWeek_6dfe.html" title="BusinessWeek">BusinessWeek</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wall_Street_Journal_8de1.html" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>. It should be noted that due to a large overhaul of the page, all votes before the overhaul of the Wikipedia article should be reconsidered. The result should be Speedily closed, as the article has been revised. The article was not properly sourced when it was nominated, and has now been much <i>improved</i>.</li>

<dd>It doesn't matter how "fringe" a political party is.

<dd>1) databaseSports.com is referred to in more than 10 thousand Wikipedia pages. Pretty much every single athlete has a link in their template or Wikipedia page to a branch site of databaseSports.com as a source to provide their career statistics, such as databaseFootball.com<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=databasefootball&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=databasefootball&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>, databaseBasketball.com<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=databasebasketball&amp;go=Go" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=databasebasketball&amp;go=Go" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>, basketball-reference.com<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Basketball-reference&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Basketball-reference&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>, databaseHockey.com<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=databaseHockey&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=databaseHockey&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>, and baseball-reference.com<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Baseball-reference&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Baseball-reference&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>.

<dd>3)Sports Illustrated did rave about them, however I didn't save the issue so I have no way to site the actual issue. Also the wording in the article says "according to their website" so pointing that out is pointless.</dd>

<dd>I will make one further note: any site listed in point 1 above is in reality databaseSports.com. So referring to databaseSports.com alone is false and misleading it includes all the sites as a visit to the site will explain also baseball-Reference.com is being converted to databasebaseball.com. As I also mentioned almost every single athlete in Wikipedia is linked to a databaseSports.com site in the athlete's template. Also I don't use bold lettering, cap letters or extra exclamation points or question marks in my arguments so if you wish to imagine any portion of my statements in that way please do so. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 16:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)"<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 16:21, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <i>Sports Illustrated</i> article in question is in the March 27, 2006 issue. It's titled "Welcome Sites in the Vast Wasteland of the Net," and it is written by Adam Duerson. (You can find it on Factiva.) However, the only thing the article says about these particular sites is that each one "is a comprehensive source with Britannica-like accuracy." That's it -- just a blurb in a list, basically. A handful of other newspaper and magazine articles use the Database sites as sources, but I'm not sure there's enough here to pass WP:WEB.

<dd>Indeed, Peel was known for his eclectic selections. However, that doesn't come under any section of the list "Criteria for musicians and ensembles" in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECpmartin_2238.html" title="User:Cpmartin">Cpmartin</a> 17:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Hitchers respect (at the least) section six of "Criteria for musicians and ensembles" <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. The Hitchers drummer and main songwriter, Niall Quinn, was a founding member of The Cranberries <a href="http://www.cranberries.ie/band/bio/1989.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.cranberries.ie/band/bio/1989.aspx" rel="nofollow">The Cranberries Official Biography - See paragraph seven</a><a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirwave_c0ba.html" title="User:Airwave">Airwave</a> 18:02, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Interesting. Does seem like he was in "The Cranberry Saw Us", the predecessor to "The Cranberries". At that time, "they were known to just a fraction of music fans in Limerick city". The band re-named to "The Cranberries" after he left, and they got the new singer, Dolores O'Riordan and became very successful. Therefore I argue that he was never actually in the notable band "The Cranberries", but in an unsuccessful previous band. Hence section 6 doesn't apply, and the band is not notable. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECpmartin_2238.html" title="User:Cpmartin">Cpmartin</a> 18:22, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but to come back to The Cranberries for a second, Niall, as a favour to the band he was leaving (amicably it must be said) contacted Dolores to come try out for the band as his replacement. <a href="http://www.cranberries.ie/band/bio/1990.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.cranberries.ie/band/bio/1990.aspx" rel="nofollow">See here.</a> Therefore, no Niall, no Cranberries, as we now know them.

But, as a renomination, it is not suitable for a <b>speedy</b> keep unless all the <i>delete</i> voters there agree.<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a></li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> What nonsense to bother authors with having to defend meaningful articles. There should be a stiff penalty for unsupportable deletion nominations. Why don't the critics spend time improving articles rather than nominating for deletion. If they are not familiar enough with the topic to propose improvements, then how can they be qualified to judge the merits of notability. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 00:48, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Four things, I guess (sorry, I'm going to be long-winded):
<ol>
<li>It's generally bad form to solicit votes, as BMcCJ did on Mr. Murray's talk page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKevin_Murray&amp;diff=95422746&amp;oldid=93927576" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKevin_Murray&amp;diff=95422746&amp;oldid=93927576" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>. Some people refer to it as "canvassing" or <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#Canvassing" title="WP:SPAM">vote stacking</a>. Please don't do it - it harms this process (though I know BMcCJ is a new editor, and I'm sure he had no idea about that).</li>
<li>Please try to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume more good faith</a>. AfD isn't nonsense just because an article you like shows up here. Those who participate here generally spend time improving articles as well. But they also improve Wikipedia when they eliminate the junk that shouldn't be here. There should emphatically <i>not</i> be a "stiff penalty" for being <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7Ebold_1b5a.html" title="WP:bold">bold</a> and trying to protect and improve Wikipedia, even if the person gets it wrong. You disagree about the notability of this article and want to keep it - great. Vote to keep. But the idea that we should "penalize" people because they disagree with you - I disagree with that strongly.</li>
<li>If people had to be previously familiar with the subject in order to vote to delete an article, nothing would ever be deleted. Those things notable enough for people to become familiar with them are...probably notable enough for Wikipedia. Stuff no one is familiar with (some 13 year old's Pokemon collection, somebody's friend's band) is probably non-notable. Would you really suggest that we couldn't delete that stuff because there aren't any experts who can comment on it?</li>
<li>And, finally - did you have any reason why you think this person <i>was</i> notable? Please don't take this the wrong way, but I don't see anything <i>about</i> the article in your comment - only a call for "stiff penalties" for the nominator. So why, in your mind, is this person notable? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 03:39, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> This one seems close to me, and I initially voted delete when the article was in worse shape. I don't think the Supreme Court case matters. Remember that there's a difference between "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a>" and "impressive." It's impressive that he pushed a case to the Supreme Court. But "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." The <b>case</b> received multiple non-trivial mentions in published works - but only because of what the Supreme Court did. (And, I might add, we haven't actually written an article about the case yet. When I have a little more time I may start that, but anyone else should feel free to as well.) I haven't seen anyone point out any similar media mentions of Whip Jones in relation to the case. I draw a distinction between someone like Brown, Roe, or Lochner (who became notable just by having their name in the title of a famous case), and those who were just <i>involved</i> in a notable case without themselves receiving any press. So I would discount the court case. However, he seems to have received multiple non-trivial mentions in published works in regards to his skiing business and his Harvard endowment - and that's enough for me. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 03:53, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Please keep this discussion to the merits of this article. I propose taking discussions of the process to whatever forums Wikipedia has for those discussions (feel free to add the links to those forums BELOW) so that this conversation can stay on track.

<li>I think the positive case for this article (above), and the facts that have been in it, for quite a long time, have been listed and mentioned enough.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> do not Merge...this character is clearly an icon for the network. He's appearing in advertisements on other networks (none of the other series characters are) and merchandising items related to him are selling out.

<li><b>Keep</b> As stated above, he is now one of the main icon representatives for Cartoon Network. Not only does he have at last count about 5 of his own commercials, he also has billboards dedicated to him.

<p>The result was <b>Speedy keep</b> This article concerns an important literary character and narrative device. A strange choice to mention <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby_Dick_3f81.html" title="Moby Dick">Moby Dick</a>, as <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishmael_%28Moby-Dick%29_c67e.html" title="Ishmael (Moby-Dick)">Ishmael</a>, the narrator of that novel, also has his own article here. Their respective novels are important in the literary Canon for the English language on numerous levels - construction, morality, philosophy, a reflection of the times in which they were authored, etc. To say that Scheherazade is merely a passive voice is to misunderstand her function, both in terms of the novel and the evolution of literary expression - <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Jones_ea17.html" title="Tom Jones">Tom Jones</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Life_and_Opinions_of_Tristram_Shandy%2C_Gentleman_a940.html" title="The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman">Tristram Shandy</a> to name but two later novels that experimented with the narrative voice.

<p>I know that the well read people are going to throw their hands up in the air and say "if characters like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Kirk_659f.html" title="Captain Kirk">Captain Kirk</a> can have pages of their own why not a literary giant like Scheherazade", well please don't do an automatic keep, read my arguments before voting.</p>
<p>The page is very small in comparison to other heroines like <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medea.html" title="Medea">Medea</a> and this is for a very good reason; Scheherazade is a part of the frame story and so doesn't have an active part in the stories so there is very little to say about her, other than she gets married, tells stories for 1001 nights and then lives happily ever after, the end. Unlike <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Kirk_659f.html" title="Captain Kirk">Captain Kirk</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medea.html" title="Medea">Medea</a>, Scheherazade's character is not flushed out, she's only there to allow movment from one story to the next, which she does with very few words. The page itself is unreferenced and all the information on it is already or could be easily put on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thousand_and_One_Nights_c794.html" title="The Thousand and One Nights">The Thousand and One Nights</a>. Captain Ahab, from <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby_Dick_3f81.html" title="Moby Dick">Moby Dick</a>, is far more influential on his story than Scheherazade is on her's, but he doesn't have a page of his own, only a subheading on the book's page and I think the same should be done with Scheherazade. I have also nominated Shahryar and Dunyazad for the same reasons. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHera1187_7eed.html" title="User:Hera1187">Hera1187</a> 18:10, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Poor quality or stubbiness of the article is not a reason to delete. One of the most famous characters in the history of literature. The idea that we would include <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinbad_the_Sailor_2f5b.html" title="Sinbad the Sailor">Sinbad</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Baba_c09a.html" title="Ali Baba">Ali Baba</a> but not their narrator is unreasonable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:51, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>.

<p>Wikipedia is not a collector of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate information</a>. This level of detail is well beyond the scope of what's appropriate for Wikipedia. I am also nominating the following for the same reason:</p>

<li>Strong Keep: I think the die-hard hockey fans out there will be interested looking back on the previous seasons and find out what their favourite team did to become a powerhouse team or what they did to acquire all those young players. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia. This kind of topic is a prime example of what should be in a sports encyclopedia. If we have topics for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_NHL_season_a823.html" title="2006-07 NHL season">2006-07 NHL season</a>, why not expand it further and have this topic which seperate but related to that one?

Merging is unrealistic given the size of both the transaction and the season articles. It is still not indiscriminate information as it remains a list built around a specific topic: team-to-team transactions that occurred during x season. An opinion on what "the scope of what is appropriate for Wikipedia" is not a valid reason for deletion. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 21:26, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Stronger than Samson Keep</b>, how can this not be part of Wikipedia's scope? Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia, and thus does not have to fit within a publisher's guidlines. Notability is definitely not an issue here, and I strongly disagree that merging with the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_NHL_season_a823.html" title="2006-07 NHL season">2006-07 NHL season</a> will serve any benefit, as the 2006-07 season alone has already been broken down into many sub-articles. I do agree the logos do not have to be there, they are against fair use and are only there because they look cool. If your worried about indiscriminate information, why don't you check probably a third of the 1.5 million articles on English Wikipedia and see just how many topics are milked to death and repeated over and over again on this encyclopedia. This isn't even close to being one of them, Wikipedia doesn't have even close to as much information as it should about the NHL. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECroat_Canuck_1286.html" title="User talk:Croat Canuck"><font size="1"><font color="blue">Go Leafs Go</font></font></a></i> 23:19, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<p>Unsourced and arbitrary, with unclear encyclopediatic value. The socialist movement was divided in the 1910s into a revolutionary and reformist wing, the revolutionary being the communist movement and the reformist being the social democratic. There are other ideologically tendencies that are both socialist and revolutionary, but there is no common denominator. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 19:09, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: no, i think there is a difference. the relation is the opposite. anarcho-communism is a separate tendency from the mainstream anarchism. revolutionary socialism is not a separate communist or anarchist tendency, rather its a category that encompasses both communists and anarchists. However, except for being a) revolutionary and b) socialists, communist and anarchists have little in common. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 19:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - They may well be the most notable group on their message board, but in the bigger world, there a tiddler, not a lunker. Main claim to fame seems to be that they discovered the fabled Hylian Loach in Ocarina of Time. That fish is notable in itself, but they have no proof to back up hteir claim. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 11:16, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep it</b> - Despite Mangojuice's lackluster Google search, in which he or she ignored the vast, non-forum references to the website, Nintendorks was a notable IGN affiliate in the past. Kinslayer's proof of the Hylian Loach can be found on YouTube in the form of a video, as well as references on independent websites. Nintendorks has a podcast, which can be subscribed to via itunes [?]. The website has historical significance if for nothing else than inventing the word "Nintendorks," which has since entered the popular lexicon as a way to describe Nintendo fans. It's a humor site, not a news site, so NeoChaosX's yearning for notable third party coverage is irrelevant. VerusMaya II 19:02, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> At best, this should be merged into the parent article, but there isn't alot there to merge. I mean, Napoleon?

<li><b>Keep</b> Tentative. There are articles and categories like 'People connected to Plymouth' and this article could be tidied up by reviewing all of those items together. Napoleon would be a connected person, rather than someone from Plymouth. I can't confess to knowing on what basis someone is 'from' a place - I'll have to read up on policy and then maybe I can make a more meaningful contribution here.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevebritgimp_6161.html" title="User:Stevebritgimp">Stevebritgimp</a> 21:00, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename, Reexplain</b> I would suggest keeping the page but, a) renaming it to <b>People from Plymouth, England</b> and explaing what from means and clean up the list: born there, lived there, left and went somewhere else from there??? Can a person be "from" more than one place? All the from pages remind me of that joke: <b>"such and such" is a great place to be from"</b> but I like the from pages. Cool list, just thought Napolean was from an Italian island. 69.19.14.27 23:02, 17 December 2006 (UTC) sorry for the IP, I'm firewalled.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This list should be renamed <i>List of people connected to Plymouth, England</i>, since the only non-list entry states that the list entries don't have to be from Plymouth, England. However, there are already two categories for people, respectively, from and connected to, Plymouth, England. Since the only difference between the list and the categories are that the list has three word long bios, I don't think Wikipedia needs both.

<p>The Mammoth Tank is a tank in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Command_%26_Conquer_2a63.html" title="Command &amp; Conquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a> video games. The article is written very much in an 'in universe' tone, and I do not believe it is possible to rewrite the article to avoid this, as the only information about this fictional tank is within the game. Additionally, none of the fictional facts about this tank are verified, or verifiable, and it is very much original research.

<li>The data there collected is easily verifiable by game cutscenes, manuals, EA podcasts, screenshots, trailers, game data values and Mike Verdu's tech blog.

Inclusion of this article in Wikipedia makes it look thorough, as it allows an user curious about the tank featured on these materials to quikly learn of it's past and present. Not to mention that it's not a game guide but rather a presentation fo the Mammoth Tank, not the strategies associated with it or (<a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">God</a> forbid) direct transfer of game stats to Wikipedia. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikael_GRizzly_708b.html" title="User:Mikael GRizzly">Mikael GRizzly</a> 22:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I want to know why the game list has six games, when, according to the article, the fictional tank is only present in four of them.

<dd>Obvious nods? If a gamer look carefully at it, perhaps, but then it's original research. Also, all the links seem to be very much dependent of EA. Independent third-party sources? And, the in-universe style has to go, the game guide references to their cost in game currency have to go, the dual inspiration theories, Dune and real tanks, needs to be at least merged and sourced, and the real tanks that merely happen to coincidentally look like it... why? Really, find something not EA, not original research.<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecateur_0e1f.html" title="User:Secateur">Secateur</a> 10:31, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Completely rewrite, then keep</b>. All this article appears to be saying, effectively, is that nobody agrees on what exactly "organizational climate" means. Chasing a few Google searches yields <a href="http://www.weleadinlearning.org/mt05.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.weleadinlearning.org/mt05.htm" rel="nofollow">this paper</a>, which cites a few sources in defining organizational climate as "the way in which organizational members perceive and characterize their environment in an attitudinal and value-based manner". In simple terms, the phrase appears to be a bit of management-speak for "how good people feel about their job". I have no experience in business management, so I can't really judge how important it is, or write a sensible article on the term.

<p>This band hasn't released any music yet. Some of the members have some history, but it seems a bit premature to create an article about a band which may or may not ever release anything. Chasing sources appears to suggest that the source for this information is the band's Myspace (everything else appears to cite that!). While I understand that this has become a system of communication for many bands, it still seems a little shaky to base the entire article on that. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 23:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Your quote is out of context, since you didn't quote the entire sentence. It continues: "as most could be easily ranked as "walkthroughs" or "hint collections"." The editor was trying to say that strategy guides gives both a walkthough or a collection of hints. Yet, if you want to think this is a game guide you certainly are entitled to your own point of view. Yet, I beleive this is a just a collection of information and doesn't tell you how to play a game to completion. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 16:20, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, but it gives you details on a part of the game you would have to find by yourself otherwise. Lists like this are essential parts of strategy guides. They tell you what you have, what you have missed and how many there are in total. A quick thumb through a couple of strategy guides I own reveal plenty of lists in all of them. Incuding lists of collectibles from many games. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:25, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The major difference between this and your many strategy guides is that your guides show you how to find them. This is just a list of the cards found in the game. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 16:28, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nope, that would be the maps that tell me that. The list consists of just the card and box for checking off when you collect it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:30, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You seem to be forgetting that a list of cards does not give any information to anyone except those who are already playing the game, which can mean that it may be considered a game guide, but more importantly, that only a fraction of a fraction of the population would find this page remotely informative. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:54, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Aye; the list is obviously <i>useful</i>, but it is not within the scope of information that Wikipedia is interested in, and is the sort of the content that would <i>belong in</i> a game guide. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 00:51, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merged</b> It was already in the Rivals article, and split for length reasons. I have moved all of the data back to the Rivals article, and you lot can do whatever with the page.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmastergalvatron_cec6.html" title="User:Grandmastergalvatron">GrandMasterGalvatron</a> 23:57, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you are misunderstanding the point of this AfD. The information on this article is inappropriate for all of Wikipedia since it is only useful to such a small denomination of people and fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. I've gone ahead and removed it from the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Rivals_bcf6.html" title="Sonic Rivals">Sonic Rivals</a> article since it provides nothing to the general reader. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:36, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, find somewhere for it to go, and then you'll have something. I'm actually the one who mainly composed that list and it took a lot of time I could have put elsewhere. So, any sugesstions on where it can be placed? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmastergalvatron_cec6.html" title="User:Grandmastergalvatron">GrandMasterGalvatron</a> 01:48, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As it is now, the only place I can think of is userspace (someplace like User:Grandmastergalvatron/Cards in Sonic Rivals). This is because the info itself does not belong on Wikipedia. Actually, if you want to flesh it out a little more, I'm sure GameFAQs would be happy to accept it. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:50, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well...I suppose that can work. It could still be linked to from the article....correct?<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmastergalvatron_cec6.html" title="User:Grandmastergalvatron">GrandMasterGalvatron</a> 01:53, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unfortunately, no. That's why I suggested that GameFAQs would be a better host for your work. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 02:00, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>? Ok. Humor me...why would it fail to qualify as an external link or even a reference? After all Some of the information from those cards is being used as a reference for other articles. For example, the previously publicly unnamed <i>Heroes</i> variant of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Sonic_2d90.html" title="Metal Sonic">Metal Sonic</a> was revealed through these very cards to be called "Neo Metal Sonic".<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmastergalvatron_cec6.html" title="User:Grandmastergalvatron">GrandMasterGalvatron</a> 02:05, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It wouldn't be an external link since it isn't a link to an external site (ie not Wikipedia). Of course, a reference is completely fine. Just use the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_video_game_86e8.html" title="Template:Cite video game">cite video game</a>}} template to cite information from the game. The information doesn't have to be available on Wikipedia to cite it. In the case of "Neo Metal Sonic", just cite the video game and it'll be fine, regardless of whether the article exists or not. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 02:15, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No no, I mean if the data was hosted elsewhere, could it be linked to from the article? In this case, I could have it posted on GameFAQs or some other joint, and place a link within the article.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmastergalvatron_cec6.html" title="User:Grandmastergalvatron">GrandMasterGalvatron</a> 02:21, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In general, that's avoided because it still doesn't improve the article per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. People who are interested will search for it themselves. There is a {{<a href="../../../g/a/m/Template%7EGameFAQs_2f83.html" title="Template:GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>}} template to link the the GameFAQs page though. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 16:46, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>With is posted nowhere, you would rather have all of the data lost?<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmastergalvatron_cec6.html" title="User:Grandmastergalvatron">GrandMasterGalvatron</a> 22:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested PROD; local festival with no indication in the article of notability. Leading to addition of the PROD (I inadvertantly had been the second to do so) including searching the archives of the Corvallis local newspaper and consulting the Corvallis, Oregon tourist information site rather than relying on a broad google search. The festival might be quite important to the participants, but there is not an indication of why it would be otherwise notable to a broader audience.
