<li>The article has gotten a little more interesting but the references added are weak. One of them actually states Wikitree is a Wikimedia project. If the article is deleted and later recreated once more documentation is around, the article editors at that time might want to request history undeletion (i.e. recovery of the old, deleted version into the article's public history) so that any useful info in the current version can be salvaged for use in the new version. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 22:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The issue was brought to debate while a reform in the French Penal Code was under way in the Parliament. Many French intellectuals [1] - including Foucault, Danet and Hocquenghem - had signed a petition addressed to the Parliament in 1977 defending the decriminalization of all consented relations between adults and minors below the age of fifteen.</p>

<li>Comment: Foucault is significant, but this is a chapter. There should be an article on the book, perhaps, but Foucault is not at the same level as Hegel, and we haven't articles on all his works, nor on the level of Nietzsche. What is written is good, but it's far too summary, far too "remember this for the test," for my tastes. It's not actually localizing the philosophical themes. Just because Foucault is significant, that doesn't license misnamed, free floating summaries of his speeches. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:53, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think there should be <i>any</i> limits on articles that are in the realm of academics, even if the result is a disproportionate amount of information on a second-tier philosopher (it's one of my soapboxes that I use over and over). If someone wants to write 30kb on an obscure conversation regarding a famous philosopher, that's fine with me. What harm is there in this? When we sit at our computers and wistfully imagine Wikipedia in 30 years, don't we all dream of having so much knowledge on a such an obscure yet dignified topic? AfD is for deleting articles like "List of guns in Halo 2", not anything with such intellectual merit as this.</li>
<li>And regarding the style of the article, I have some qualms about the style being a bit on the OR side ("main ideas of the text"), but this can be edited and toned down to read like any other enlightened and neutral explanation of a text. I'll probably do it myself at some point today. So, although the organization is a bit superficial and non-encyclopedic, it can be changed to fit quite well in our encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 16:02, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, This is a conversation broadcast on the radio. Where is any evidence this had any sort of broad implications beyond the initial broadcast? I've heard several nationally broadcast discussions of sexuality and law on morning radio broadcasts in the U.S. Should we start articles for all of those? Best case scenario for those wishing to retain this info would be to move this to Politics, Philosophy, Culture – Interviews and other writings, 1977-1984 and expand it beyond that one chapter. As a standalone article about a radio conversation with no evidence of any broader impact or implications it doesn't pass muster in my opinion (and Wikipedia should never be "cliff notes).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:35, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> An Encyclopedia should cover all unique and relevant information on every issue. This information is undoubtedly unique and Michel Foucault is a renowned philosopher.

<dd><b>Comment</b> To hide relevant information from the public is simply dishonest (no matter if it's right-wing or left-wing) and disqualifies the intentions of those who oppose the content of the text. One may not agree with Foucault, but at least one should agree that it is the right of other people to know what he said. My impression is that some people are desperatly seeking any motive to hide a piece of relevant human knowledge from others. I live in a country where a whole generation of intellectuals fighted against censorship during military dictatorship for over 20 years, so I know how it looks like. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a> 23:45 July 24, 2006 (GMT)

<li><b>Comment</b> After looking at the talk itself, I've moved a little closer to Geogre's view that the article is mostly summary and could be made shorter, but that's just an editorial issue, the topic is still fine and deletion is not appropriate. Editorial issues should be discussed on the article's talk page, not afd. Simply moving the article is inappropriate since it's a split-out from <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Foucault_7519.html" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> about the specific topic. Further editing at <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Foucault_7519.html" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> might change that, but not something for afd to deal with. I'd rather leave it up to the article's regular editors who know something about the subject matter.
<p>I'm not worried about having an article about a chapter of a book in and of itself. We have lots of perfectly good multi-page articles (e.g. <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozymandias.html" title="Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a>) about 14-line poems. Also, we can't count on the talk being online all the time (for that matter, the reader might be using an offline copy of wikipedia), so having a non-copyvio summary of the talk in the encyclopedia helps the parent article considerably. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saga_Begins_a709.html" title="The Saga Begins">The Saga Begins</a> for another example. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 08:19, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>While the site itself is not the subject of much discussion in magazines, some of the various artists who associate themselves with the site have had their works featured in Japanese and Australian magazines including the creators of Marioween/Blue Twilight and Halo Zero, both of which were either displayed in magazines or on gamespot. Also, the article promises to feature a history of the community concerned with the site, so clearly the purpose of the article is NOT advertising. Both of the titles I was discussing earlier are distributed through channels that aren't directly associated with the site and both titles offer reference to the site in question... which makes it qualifiable under part III of the notability for webcontent. --DimensionWarped 04:28, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>To those who are simply saying "delete," state your arguments as to why, in particular, where it fails the Wikipedia standards test. In other words, substantiate your claims. Otherwise, you have no argument. My Arguments for non deletion: As mentioned, this site has been the launchpad for various notable projects as mentioned and is one of the most active fangame communities still around, and it has gone through quite a bit. Many other communities have come and gone, such as Zelda Fangames HQ and Megaman Fangames HQ, but despite the attacks on the site and its community which even took it down from the internet for a while, and demonstrates a fangame community which thrives on just that. Again, many have tried, but they have failed many times. SFGHQ again has a decent amount of success stories, such as the above mentioned games, compared to the other fan game communities, including the much larger Mario Fangame Galaxy.</li>

<li>Shadix here, it would be nice if you guys would at least give us a chance to put our article together some. SFGHQ is rich in history and remains one of the larger franchise Fangaming sites out there.

<li>I wholly support the non-deletion of this article. As previously stated, the article is a work-in-progress and just because you, as a non-Sonic fangamer think the site is non-notable doesn't mean it actually isn't. It's THE most active Sonic fangaming site to date, the longest-running and is associated with the Mario Fangames Galaxy as well as the Sonic Stuff Research Group (when it was on Emulationzone.org) and also is rich in history. As far as non-notable goes, I think you haven't had a toe in the ocean that is fangaming and really either didn't research it at all or only had a little look at it. --<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESuspchaos_6cd5.html" title="User:Suspchaos">Suspchaos</a> 06:08, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It goes without saying that people involved with the site would believe that the site is rich in history. That doesn't make it notable in a general-interest sense.

<li>Though not mentioning your case at all and just saying the site is "non-notable" doesn't give you a case to argue either.

<li>All that really matters is that it meets the criteria for notability. And it meets that criteria, so I really don't see how there can be any further argument on it. Atlus meets the criteria for notability simply for articles on games they produced. The magnitude-ignoring assumption there is that if a product of notability is affiliated with a group, then that group is in itself notable. And people, this isn't a bloody vote. It's a debate on notability. Either state legitimate reasons or don't state anything at all.--DimensionWarped 08:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't delete it. Everybody has their own opinions as to what and what isn't notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> DimensionWarped, I have in the past been a SFGHQ member, and no offense to you or anyone else, but all forums, no matter the notability, have their fair share of "me too" bandwagon hoppers. Simply being linked from a current forum topic is going to lead to people seeing the AfD and clicking on it. I prefer all information to be put forth out in the open, so I linked the forum topic and explained the situation so everyone knows as many facts as there are to know. After all, if the site truly is notable, linking a forum topic and saying a few meatpuppets are posting won't make any difference on the consensus. I will note that I'm perfectly happy to change my vote if I see evidence to the contrary, but currently all I see is "A bunch of popular fangames got their start here", which I don't see as notable in of itself. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 08:27, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The genre (which has <i>nothing</i> to do with bestiality, contrary to this article) actually has a history that is at least 30 years old. We have a proper article on one aspect of it at <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rishathra.html" title="Rishathra">Rishathra</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:45, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>See, that's the problem. In science fiction, there has always been that "Kirk kisses the alien chick" stuff, and there has always been a form of science fiction novel that takes it further, but for those bordered by the terrestrial "interspecies" means either <i>Clan of the Cave Bear</i> or, much more likely, bestiality. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:10, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not entirely clear what problem you're describing. Inter-species means between species, whether one is talking about science fiction or not. Arguing that there's confusion because to some this is a straightforward synonym for bestiality (which has the logical consequence that this article should be a redirect) contradicts your argument that this <i>isn't</i> such a synonym but merely a once-off joke in a movie. I argue that it isn't synonymous with bestiality at all, that the content of this article is based on a joke in a movie, and that thus there's no confusion. ☺
<p>Further to the point about the genre: Read <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written/tree/browse_frm/thread/f72b5b0c313b5a3b/9c5137d1daa17a14?hl=en&amp;rnum=31&amp;lnk=nl" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written/tree/browse_frm/thread/f72b5b0c313b5a3b/9c5137d1daa17a14?hl=en&amp;rnum=31&amp;lnk=nl" rel="nofollow">this</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:14, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"The problem" is that it is a term that means one things to science fiction fans and another thing to non-science fiction fans. To the one, it can be a genre. To the other, it's just a faux euphemism. Therefore, there's no way to keep it as a redirect to or parent of the science fiction "genre," because that term would be disturbingly inappropriate to people who think about <i>real</i> species. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:09, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's no need for it to be the parent of anything. The parent is <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_in_science_fiction.html" title="Sex in science fiction">sex in science fiction</a>, which can gain a breakout article on the subject of interspecies sex should it ever need to.

<li><b>Comment</b> the fire safety report isn't about this sofa in particular - in the report they use three custom built sofas based on the Klippan (probably because it is a common make) <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 17:38, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, it is. It's about this very sofa with various different flame retardants applied to it.

<ul>
<li>The study is about fire safety regulations, not about fire safety in the Klippen model, and the sofas are based on the Klippen model rather than being the Klippen: <i>Three different sofas were used for this study, all based on a standard, commercially available European model sold by IKEA (the “Klippan” model). This model is currently marketed with a mainly polystyrene rigid frame, but for this study a wooden frame was used because this is more representative of typical furniture on the market.</i> I'd say this amounted to trival coverage (even if it wasn't a fire safety report). - <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 23:39, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reference to the Kuwaiti Times is to source the previously contested point that the sofa is named after the place in Sweden. Not everything has the purpose of establishing notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> The gold standard for nostalgia is <i>Happy Days</i>. This T.V. show from 1974 was a nostalgic look back to 1954. Then, in 1978, Fonzi jumped the shark but that's not my point. The point is, you have to wait 20 years to look back on a decade. I mean, if they are still selling Pokeman Cards, then it isn't nostalgia, its just a continuation of the Pokeman thing, which I don't get by the way. Take the Viet Nam war for example. They were still fighting it hot and heavy in 1973, but that doesn't mean it was a nostalgic throwback to the 1960's, it was just the war continueing on. In fact, to reminisce about the Viet Nam war we created M*A*S*H, which was purportedly set in Korea but was really about Viet Nam and you know it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeccampbell_ddc7.html" title="User:Georgeccampbell">george</a> 06:09, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Try to assume the mind set of someone who would type in 1990s retro movement. They may be wondering if such a movement exists or not, that question is itself an iterestig and evolving question and should be covered in an expanded issue. There is also a theory about retro movements that they are the emotion responses of new parents to the pressures of adult life looking to reconnect with the existence of their childhood, that is retro is by its nature an effort to return to a more infantile state. Someone who was 13 years old in the mid 1990s is still a young adult and probably not yet old enough to turn conservative. A fuller discussion of if there is a 1990s retro, if one evolves (it will in about 5 years, they always do) and its history would be a breakthrough article for Wikipedia, the first time such a fine grained social event could be followed publically. Its the kind of thing Encyc Britannica could never do. Also having lived through the time I notice the kids are now waring 1987 retro, so we can see 1990s retro soon. Anyways I fail to see the damage this does if someone just edits it some.--<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhooker1236_22ef.html" title="User:Rhooker1236">Rhooker1236</a> 14:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is lame. Furby's are 8 years old. Tamagotchis are 9. These toys took a few years to dwindle away, so we're talking maybe things 5-6 years old are now "retro"?? Check back in 15 years and then we can maybe write this article. I knew a guy when I was in college in 1990 who had an Atari 2600 in his dorm, but we didn't call it the "1980's retro movement"... --<a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehcsif_9925.html" title="User:Rehcsif">Rehcsif</a> 16:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The German names of places in Latvia (like Libau, Mitau, Jakobstadt, Kircholm) are often used in older publications, not only in German.

<li>Comment - I added this page. This author clearly meets the Wikipedia citerion for biographies: "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". OK, he's a minor literary figure, but he was published, some of his archives are held in Cambridge University Archives, and he was reviewed in serious national newspapers ("The Onlie Begetter", TLS, 1936; "Spread no wings", Times 1937). Are we to purge Wikipedia of all minor writers and thinkers? That would remove one of its strengths - coverage of the unfashionable.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarknesbitt_5453.html" title="User:Marknesbitt">Mark Nesbitt</a> 09:43, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarknesbitt_5453.html" title="User:Marknesbitt">Mark Nesbitt</a> seems to be working on his family tree, which is okay if the subjects are sufficiently encyclopedically notable minor thinkers and authors. Unfortunately I don't think this author is.
<ul>
<li>I found three entries in the Cambridge University library catalogue<a href="http://hookec.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;Page=First" class="external autonumber" title="http://hookec.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;Page=First" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> (which is a legal deposit library<a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/readershandbook/C2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/readershandbook/C2.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, with minimal selectivity in what it archives - rather the library tries to catalogue all publications so its not a mark of distinction to be in the collection). The catalogue has a timeout feature, so direct links to searches won't work, but anyone can use the search function. I could not find "Spread no wings" in the catalogue.</li>
<li>Of the three I found - one title is a privately published book under a pseudonym, another is a book also printed under a pseudonym which had a print run of 250. The third is probably Nisbet's most notable book, The Onlie Begetter (1936), in which the author theorizes that the <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._W.H._da5a.html#Dedication_to_Mr._W.H." title="Mr. W.H.">Mr. W.H.</a> (the "only begetter" (i.e. patron, I assume) of the sonnets) to which an 1609 edition of Shakespeare's sonnets is dedicated is <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Powis_17fc.html" title="Baron Powis">William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis</a>, rather than <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Herbert%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Pembroke_06ae.html" title="William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke">William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke</a> who was and is considered to be the most likely candidate. This theory is probably why the book received attention in the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Times_Literary_Supplement_1168.html" title="Times Literary Supplement">Times Literary Supplement</a>. (But we don't know <i>how</i> it was received).</li>
<li>However, I can't find any relevant hits which discuss a connection between Powis and Shakespeare (searching for "William Herbert" and "Powis" and "Shakespeare" and "sonnets") in Google<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22william+herbert%22+powis+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;hl=en&amp;l" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22william+herbert%22+powis+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;hl=en&amp;l" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, Google Scholar<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22william+herbert%22+powis+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22william+herbert%22+powis+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> or Google Books<a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22william+herbert%22+powis+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;btnG=Search+Books" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22william+herbert%22+powis+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;btnG=Search+Books" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>(the national biography hit discusses William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke - the Powis mention is elsewhere on the page and is unrelated and not the right Powis anyway. and the biography dates from 1911.).There are 4 hits for "Ulric Nesbit" likely related to Shakespeare on Google Books<a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22ulric+nisbet%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22ulric+nisbet%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

<li>In comparison, there are a substantial number of hits (658 pages on Google Books; 157 hits on Google Scholar, 765 hits on regular Google) which discuss the relationship between Shakespeare and William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke however<a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22william+herbert%22+pembroke+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22william+herbert%22+pembroke+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22william+herbert%22+pembroke+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22william+herbert%22+pembroke+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[16]</a><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22william+herbert%22+pembroke+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22william+herbert%22+pembroke+shakespeare+sonnets&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The wikipedia article on Mr. WH also lists 5 other persons aside from Pembroke who have been discussed as likely candidates for the mystery Mr. WH. - but does not include Powis.</li>
<li>All this leads me to believe that while Ulric Nesbit's WH theory about Powis may have made a minor splash at the time, he has had little or no lasting impact on the Shakespeare scholarship, even in his own lifetime. I think Ulric's theory should be mentioned in the Mr. WH article, but he is not notable enough of a scholar for his own article <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 05:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Mulling it over</b></s> if this is the author of <i>The Onlie Begetter</i> (but if so, why isn't that in the article?) there's multiple hits for Ulric Nisbet on bookfinder.com. <i>The Onlie Begetter</i> was published by Longmans in 1936 and republished by Haskell House in 1970 and 1982; that there were enough readers to keep it marketable for that long is evidence of minor notability (unless Haskell House is a vanity press--I have a slight suspicion of that but haven't checked it out). However, there's also a 2006 print-on-demand edition which I'll guess is connected to Mark Nesbitt; if it is, then the article has a tinge of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> to add to the <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> already evident. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 03:01, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> based on Bwitth's link to MSG-Haskell which looks a legit press (at least these days). ("Scarce scholarly books" is actually what sounded to me like "vanity"). If <b>The Onlie Begetter</b> stayed in print for 46 years in the pre-POD era, that's enough notability for something like this.

<dd>Perhaps, but I only do speedy deletion tags when its really really obvious that an article is patent nonsense, obvious vandalism, or something along those lines. If there are doubts about notability, I prefer to run it through an AfD to make sure there's consensus about the lack of notbility. Speedy deletion is a bit unilateral, usually the opinion of one tagger and one administrator, and I've seen perfectly good articles thrown out because two people happen to make the wrong call. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamcuriousblue_e928.html" title="User:Iamcuriousblue">Iamcuriousblue</a> 23:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, if you click through the links on the Grand Opening site, you quickly end up on www.sextoysex.com.

<li>How is this India-related? It's only India-related in the sense that Indians have penises too. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 16:04, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's India-related inasmuch as there's a folk etymology for this word that has it supposedly derived from Hindi. Wiktionarians have discussed this in detail (Wiktionary being the place where etymologies of words are researched, discussed, and written about). See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:choad" class="extiw" title="wikt:Talk:choad">wikt:Talk:choad</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See Oxford <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>-<a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> dictionary <small>(R. S. McGregor, Oxford University Press, USA; New Ed edition (May 22, 1997), <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 019864339X</a>)</small> on the subject, or even <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom_cece.html" title="Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a>, where <a href="../../../a/m/r/Amrish_Puri_06c5.html" title="Amrish Puri">Amrish Puri</a> uses the hindi word with aplomb, much to the chagrin of Indian parents everywhere. It's one of the filthiest <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">hindi</a> words and the translation is quite coincidental. That's why it's related to <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> related deletions -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)"><font color="black">धर्म</font></a></small> 21:57, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What that dictionary says has been analyzed in depth and found <i>not</i> to support the folk etymology.

<ul>
<li>My comment was directed at Clyde. I'm not commenting on what the etymology is, but just saying that there's enough to suggest that it should be added to the list of India related deletions. As an aside, I also see no analysis in depth on the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:choad" class="extiw" title="wikt:Talk:choad">wiktionary page</a>, just commentary from one user who doesn't speak the language.

<li>That said, Uncle G's right: "it would be handy to have this in a glossary" is not a good reason for keeping the article around. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 13:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes I have (and linked it occasionally). The encyclopaedic content seems to me to be functionally equivalent to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden_%28media%29.html" title="Walled garden (media)">Walled garden (media)</a>. There are really two things going on in one article, one describing linked and exclusively self-referential articles, the other being the usage described at ~(media). What is wrong with advocating move? That said, having it in the glossary would be satisfactory I guess. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:05, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not truly self-referential; something like this could also be an article in the <i>Encyclopedia Galactica</i>. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:57, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The nomination reason is bunk: this is not in any way self-referential. There are plenty of websites, and even wikis, that aren't Wikipedia, so an article discussing a phenomenon on certain websites (particularly wikis) is entirely appropriate. There's no good reason to delete this thing. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 11:12, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see the slightest evidence that the topic is encyclopedic or notable in the usual sense. It's just internal jargon. We already have a whole wiki just for stuff about wiki culture, namely meta (or there's project space), either of which still seem to me like more obvious places to put the article. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 12:10, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll say again: <i>Wikipedia is not the only wiki on the Internet</i>. Neither meta nor project space have anything to do with wikis that aren't Wikipedia, and nor should they — however, there's an argument that some aspects of wiki culture should be discussed in main article space. Please realise this. Once you have become fully Enlightened on the sheer number of wikis that aren't Wikipedia (search Google, if need be), feel free to come back and talk about "notability" and "encyclopaedic". And when you do, <i>please</i> tell us why you didn't bother to mention all this in your nomination. Nominations are the core of any AfD discussion, and they need to be good.

<li>All three articles on things called "walled gardens" are pretty small and pretty similar. I think they could benefit from all being merged into the one article, and would be willing to do this later. There is still the issue of nothing being sourced, but so long as we can agree (I know the bits <i>I'm</i> familiar with are unobjectionable, and Uncle G's a fairly cluey chap too, so he could look over it as well) that it's all true, we could merge the content together and bung a "need references" sign in.

<li>Most of what I've found has been source material for content that fits in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden_%28media%29.html" title="Walled garden (media)">walled garden (media)</a> (I've added some further reading to that article.), which is in need of attention to bring it nore into line with what sources actually say walled gardens are. The third paragraph of this article is actually dealing with the walled gardens discussed in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden_%28media%29.html" title="Walled garden (media)">walled garden (media)</a>. It's no loss to lose it from this article, since that paragraph came from <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled garden</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Walled_garden&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46238554" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Walled_garden&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46238554" rel="nofollow">in the first place</a> and in fact should, according to what the actual sources say, have been moved to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden_%28media%29.html" title="Walled garden (media)">walled garden (media)</a> rather than to this article.
<p>Whilst in the wiki world there may be a concept of a set of self-contained pages that are cordoned off from the rest of the project (Indeed, they do this very thing at Wikinews.), I have found no independent secondary source material that addresses that.

<li>Hi, it is my article. As an article on Varieties of Capitalism did not exist and the concept by Hall and Soskice is important in the social sciences I thought I'd add it.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> So you are saying that the guy that recorded Eminem and Dido's "Stan" is worthless to this culture? What about the guy who taught Kid Rock what rock is.

<li>Please stop putting your recommendations in boldface. While AfD is not a vote, you have already stated your boldface recommendation for this article.

Furthermore, you currently have more in this article about Ebeling's work with <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethan_Daniel_Davidson_baa0.html" title="Ethan Daniel Davidson">Ethan Daniel Davidson</a> than his work with Eminem.

We are always pleased to make the necessary changes and expand on this entry. Also, we have removed a lot of the original content since the original deletion status was applied, because we deemed it trivial and unnecessary. &gt;&gt;&gt; I've made further changes and the entry now sits with me more comfortably. I've also noticed other websites/forums have wiki entries here &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what kind of sources Wine Guy expects us to use... surely the website itself is proof enough? All the information contained in the article can be found on the website itself. Therefore I do not see any issues here. If Wine Guy (or anyone else for that matter) can confirm to me what kind of sources we are supposed to be using, I will be happy to add them &gt;&gt;&gt; Tellier-Craig, as far as I can tell, has also not made any other contributions to wikipedia, besides his/her comment, so why has their comment not been commented on, like the others?

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm a member of that forum and that site. As wonderful as the site is, this entry here lacks.I find the Wikipedia entry of the Archives kinda sloppy and uninteresting. A generalization that pretty much serves to nothing.Very short, simple background. Section "Community" goes very casual, explaining general things. About the collaborators, decent stuff, still rudimentary. Features that express details (something not really important, in my opinion, of a view over the concept of Prog Archives. Miscellaneous things that serve the same thing. In my opinion, not the best way to highlight, within the archives of this site, the Progressive Rock website, forum, concept etc. &gt;&gt;&gt; I see modifications were made, just want to add to my opinion, that there is already an extensive definition of "Progressive Rock", the one given here is half-copied (first paragraph), half easy interpretation.

<li>I'd say <b>keep</b>, although I'm not quite up-to-date with en.wp's rules of the day. Even if the website is less notable today than it was when I started this article in May 2001, Personal Telco was an important part of an important "free wi-fi movement" around the turn of the millennium. <b>If the article is deleted</b>, Personal Telco should at least have a section in the broader article about this <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wireless_community_network.html" title="Wireless community network">wireless community network</a> movement. Several similar articles could be coalesced (sp?) into that one.

<li><b>Keep</b>. PersonalTelco's notability is that it is an important part of Portland's high-tech industry/community, as well as having influence in the larger Free WiFi movement. The article probably could emphasise this more, but even as it currently reads this article explains why the subject is notable. Liface has done a good job of providing cites for this article, but if there are any further doubts, I'd be happpy to sift thru my PTP maillist archive &amp; pull out more references: I expect PTP has been written up several dozen times by the press since its incorporation 5 years ago. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 18:12, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>: Watching the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wikis.html" title="List of wikis">List of wikis</a> page I suspected there might be a VfD on this one eventually as well, and since I wrote the article in the first place I'm going to stay neutral on the vote. The site is to Korean articles on Wikipedia as <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookieepedia.html" title="Wookieepedia">Wookieepedia</a> is to those on Star Wars, meaning that anything that would be of too much detail here can still be written over there, and the two aid each other in that way. That being said, that in and of itself may not make the article notable so I'm going to just let the vote go according to everyone else's wishes. If it is deleted though there should still be a clear limit for when it would become notable in the future. Should there be a few other blog entries, newspaper articles, if so what kind of newspapers and would those in Korean be acceptable, etc. The Wookieepedia article for example also only has a single blog entry as an external link, but its sheer article count seems to have kept it from deletion. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMithridates_47c8.html" title="User:Mithridates">Mithridates</a> 10:59, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<i>Owen</i>
BYLINE: By Jason Heller
BODY:
Nobody likes a whiner. And yet a whole troop of emo crybabies, from Dashboard Confessional's Chris
Carraba to Bright Eyes' Connor Oberst, has whimpered its way into the spotlight over the past couple
of years. <b>Mike Kinsella</b>, otherwise known as Owen (appearing Tuesday, November 26, at Club 156 in
Boulder), is at least partly to blame. As drummer of the mid-'90s Illinois group Cap'n Jazz, Kinsella
helped tame the wuss-rock frontier now populated by the likes of Modest Mouse and Jimmy Eat World.
The members of Cap'n Jazz, though, were always deconstructionists at heart, using feedback, caterwauls
and solipsistic wordplay to unravel their songs almost faster than they could stitch them together.
As Cap'n Jazz mutated into Joan of Arc and then OWLS, the players softened and refined their sound,
invoking the abstract groove of Tortoise and conceptual folk-blues as much as the cathartic abandon of
Rites of Spring. Kinsella himself ventured even further into the realm of accessibility with his side
project, American Football, a stunning exhibition of intricate, elegant guitar pop. With Owen,
Kinsella has switched to guitar and vocals, boiling down <b>American Football'</b>s melodic sensibility
to its purest essence. His self-titled debut album shimmers with wispy synth backdrops, bashful
strumming and his dandelion-puff voice, a plaintive sound stuck somewhere between Rainer Maria and an
unplugged Coldplay. Songs with titles such as "Declaration of Incompetence," with lyrics like "I can't
do anything/I can't do my hair right/Or have a good time/Or fall asleep with my girl," aren't going to
significantly distance Kinsella from the current herd of bleating emo troubadours. His finesse and
forbearance, though, already have.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia may not be a theater listing, but it is an encyclopedia; that means that all subjects - whether you consider them relevant or not in your elitist snobbery of what is acceptable - should be allowed to have an entry.—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.84.18.84 (talk •<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.84.18.84_986f.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.84.18.84">contribs</a>) 02:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article was added as what we felt was a notable entry for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dresden_Dolls_a465.html" title="The Dresden Dolls">The Dresden Dolls</a> and to people everywhere. The fact that a band signed to a major label would allow and encourage our production should be notable in itself. Citing WP:NOT is probably not the best method of recommendation for deletion. Nowhere in that article do I find anything that suggests our article is inappropriate to Wikipedia. This article was not meant to be as for a theatre listing, but to serve for reference as articles do for other plays and musicals. "An encyclopedia is a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge." Why must you be so particular?Alexbt 03:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Alexbt, I cited WP:NOT casually, but we actually have a formal <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">music notability guidelines</a>. At the moment there isn't a specific guideline for theater productions, but if there were, then some level of <i>national</i> media coverage would be part of it. The band's involvement appears to be largely passive cooperation, and while that makes it worth noting on their article, the article doesn't fit the level of notability that we've established to prevent Wikipedia from becoming, essentially, Geocities for anybody who wants an article on themselves. More on point, we wouldn't want it to fill with advertising pages, either. By asserting standards of encyclopedic value we ensure that our users can think of Wikipedia as something useful. While we can include more, much more, than a paper encyclopedia, we can't include everything. I hope you do not see this as judgement of the artistic value of the show, because it is not. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Arguments on whether content would appear in paper encyclopedias are frankly irrelevant. It would be inconsistent to delete this entry and not delete the entries of other finalists. Moreover, as a top six contestant in the show, there is even less logic in deleting his entry before the show's completion. It should be noted, that merging all the articles is <b>not</b> an option without having this same discussion for each of the other finalists, and such a move would be blocked for those contestants like Schwimmer who have lengthier résumés. <a href="../../../r/c/h/User%7ERcharman_55dc.html" title="User:Rcharman">Rcharman</a> 01:48, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. There seems no logical reason to delete the artice. Is it taking up unecessary space the Wikipedia does not have? It is a good entry that helps impart information on it's subject; just as any good article in an encyclopedia would. Arguments that this would not appear in paper encyclopedias are irrelavent because they have different concerns such as space and printing costs. If that was a valid argument, then all articles about all actors would have to be removed, all articles about schools and universities would have to be removed, all articles about singers would have to be removed, all articles about plays and movies would have to be removed, etc. This is not a paper encyclopedia so deletion would be quite unjustified.</li>

<p>According to the discussion at <a href="../../../h/e/a/Talk%7EHealth_care_reform_181b.html" title="Talk:Health care reform">Talk:Health care reform</a>, the creation of this group of articles appears to have been encouraged by a college instructor at Duke University, User:Conoverc, for his Politics of Health Care class to address why universal health care proposals have been defeated despite overwhelming public support for universal coverage. To me, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> appears to have been violated in that a <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="WP:OR">synthesis of published material serving to advance a position</a> appears in each article. He admitted to devising a common article template for his students to use in order to reach the conclusion "why the window of opportunity (for reform) closed", and the edit histories reveal a flurry of referenced assertions in the various sections of each article. In my opinion, the position being advanced is that reform or change is an "opportunity"; the synthesis is the A + B + C insertion of references to reach that conclusion. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedtopic_fe40.html" title="User:Medtopic">Medtopic</a> 10:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b> The synthesis to advance a position problem is still present. For example, it is noticable that only certain Presidents are part of the series. I seem to recall a few presidents in between and since like Kennedy, Johnson, Reagan, and a Bush or two (a couple of whom signed reform legislation like the establishment of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicare_%28United_States%29_b379.html" title="Medicare (United States)">Medicare</a> and the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicare_Prescription_Drug%2C_Improvement%2C_and_Modernization_Act_392e.html" title="Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act">Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> - While the quote presented from the article is probably POV, it seems that deleting (or rewriting) a bad sentence would be preferable to deleting an article which has some useful content. As for the issue of "missing presidents" from the series, your position almost seems to be that, if we don't have an article about United States health reform under Reagan then we should delete United States health reform under Nixon. As an encyclopedia, shouldn't our response be to write the "missing" article about Reagan rather than delete the one about Nixon? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 03:32, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> No the point is that the series was constructed as it is in order to advance a point of view, thus fauling afoul of the policy against original research. There is no excuse for a neutral series of articles on healthcare reform in the U.S. omitting coverage of the introduction of Medicare, which is one of the most important pieces of healthcare legislation. One could say that the 2003 reform act is too new to evaluate in an encyclopedic fashion. Why are all cases of significant reform omitted from the series? <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 12:44, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I find it somewhat ironic that I'm speaking in defense of these articles; 99% of my AfD votes are straight "Delete" because 99% of what comes through AfD is utter crap. These are not utter crap. They may be incomplete, POV, poorly written and partially redundant...but none of those are problems for which AfD is the best answer. The best answer is to rewrite, remove POV, and add <i>more</i> encyclopedic content, not to remove the useful information which is there.

<li><b>Keep all</b> I often see articles like this, with OR being the main premise for deletion, but invariably someone throws in the words "Inherently POV" or "Inherently OR". Not the case here. While I certainly agree that Wikipedia is not a place for "connecting the dots", I see no harm in making uncontroversial statements of the obvious theory behind such information. Perhaps our encyclopedia could just spew out facts and statistics with no correlation, but we must realize that the theory that binds these facts is as true, and is as much value to the encyclopedia as anything else that can be copied from an almanac, and the theory relating to this information is generally uncontroversial. What about the parts that are? Get rid of them. Like my history teacher used to say, "<i>Facts without theory is trivia. Theory without facts is bullshit.</i>" And who's to say that this <i>is</i> OR? Who's to say that it <i>is</i> connecting the dots? Do not forget that each of these articles contain something like 10-15 references (Take a look at United States health reform under Clinton), so an OR claim in itself is strenuous enough, and certainly not strong enough to warrant such an ill-considered and reflexive call for deletion. I think what everyone here is looking for is a bunch of these: <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, and I certainly am too, but I'm not going push for its deletion on those grounds. That, like everything else in these articles, can be improved.</li>
<li>Now I have a few reminders for us all. Firstly, there is something called <a href="../../../o/r/_/Template%7EOR_cecf.html" title="Template:OR">Template:OR</a>. It says, "Hey, let's work together and fix this". Secondly, AfD is not a substitute for cleanup. If cleanup is reasonable, which it most certainly is, then deletion is unthinkable. Thirdly, many of us are probably under the impression that the OR is much more serious than it is because of its non-encyclopedic tone, which reads like a tenth-grader giving a book-report. Let's fix this, not blow it up. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 19:07, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is certainly possible for editors to interpret Wikipedia policy differently, so calling this an "ill-considered and reflexive call for deletion" is unwarranted.

<li>I certainly understand <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>--as noted in my comment, I am <i>not convinced that this is OR</i>. The reason I suggested that the decisions of other voters was "reflexive", is because the issue here is unusually complex for AfD, and without an examination of the text, it may very well seem like OR on the surface. I'm no better than anyone else--sometimes I just jump on the dogpile and type "Delete per nom", but sometimes I see a flash of light in the article, and I investigate more carefully. Also, be assured that I am not accusing <i>all editors</i> who want to delete the article as being careless. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 21:48, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sure which of the four of us you <i>are</i> accusing of carelessness, however, I think it's fair to grant the benefit of doubt to others here and assume that they have investigated carefully, too. The fact that three of the four editors voting "delete" thus far have referenced a particular section of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (i.e. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="WP:OR">synthesis of published material serving to advance a position</a>) does not suggest that they have given only a cursory examination of the text, or that have voted reflexively, or that they are not capable of understanding the complexities of the AfD. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedtopic_fe40.html" title="User:Medtopic">Medtopic</a> 22:36, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am willing to say that the other editors probably spent about 2 minutes in reading the articles. I respect you and all of the other editors here, and I am by no stretch of the imagination insulting them or looking down upon them because, well, we all do it (as I said). But to assume that every editor took long and deliberate look at each one, and upon a long period of thoughtful contemplation reached his or her decision would only be a lie to oneself, unless by some miracle each one actually did-- in which case I will tuck my tail between my legs and go home. But all of this is rather peripheral to my main contention, which is that this <i>is not</i> OR, and it is <i>not</i> advancing a position. And if it is? Well then we'll take it to the cleaners, not the cemetary. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 23:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Besides its obvious brevity the article contains nothing but an amalgam of highly superficial catchwords without any explanative value whatsoever and displays a clearly non-neutral point of view.<br />
Many of the common complaints regarding articles on topics concerning "Socialism" apply here:<br />
1. No socialist country has ever proclaimed itself to be "communist" this being merely the final goal society strives to reach in the distant future.<br />
2. "'Lighter' version of communism" is highly tendentious, implying that "communism" as such would be "hard" only to be a bit "alleviated" in its "later stages".<br />
3. "Much diminished socialist propaganda" ("propaganda" here obviously but unduly used as a derogative term) is totally incorrect. As in every other socialist country the Marxist-Leninist ideology and the forms of its dissemination in Hungary underwent adaptations and modernisations, especially after 1956. But neverthelees it remained the official guiding thought and was propagated as such right until 1989.<br />
4. The introduction of some market elements (combined with planning) as was the case in Hungary (but not only there&#160;!) is in no way incomaptible with a socialist economy. Therefore no "aknowledging of a deviation" would have been necessary.<br />
This artificially magnified discussion of certain idiosyncratic features of the building of a socialist society in individual countries, for insthttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Goulash_Communism&amp;action=edit Edit this pageance in Hungary, should at best be avoided altogether. And if this proves to unfeasible, in the case of Hungary we already have the "Happiest Barrack" article (also fatally flawed but still far better than this one) of which this article is basically a shallow and useless reduplication.<br />
I therefore demand the deletion of the article on "Goulash communism" as quickly as possible.<br />

<li><b>Keep.</b> Its brevity may be due to its relative youth; it still has the "new article smell" on it. Fact is, the term is out there, and I'd like to see it explained better. I learned the term in high school history (although high school history tends to be a tad more simplistic than anything at the post-secondary level). I remember hearing the term as well on a TV documentary. I'd actually like to see the article fleshed out. It ranks up there with terms like "gunboat diplomacy" and "bamboo curtain" that people coin to describe a situation or concept that appears to be different from the norm. --<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigPig_e58e.html" title="User:SigPig">SigPig</a> 14:03, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> (if really necessary) If you insist on keeping the term (which, I will repeat, may be widespread in American High School history lessons but still doesn't become any more correct or useful) merge this article with the "Happiest barrack" article and add the term "Goulash communism" as a second "catchword phrase" there. We do not need both articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>--Elsmlie 16:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking about it a second time, I believe that when merging the two articles, it would be even better to keep the heading "Goulash communism" and delete the "Happiest barrack" heading instead. The content of the "Happiest Barrack" article should then be moved under the "Goulash communism" heading and this term be added as a second catchword there (as proposed in my previous comment). Despite its flaws "Goulash communism" as a term is in itself less offensive than "Happiest barrack" and should therefore be used as their common heading. --Elsmlie 17:06, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> again, let's fix the problems addressed rather than delete the article. I've heard of Goulash communism, and it is most certainly a valid phrase <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 18:32, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>OK, here's my proposal:<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. Repair the various problems in the article mentioned in my original deletion request. Since the article is not very long and it's been me who brought this all up I could do so, if you agree.<br /></dd>
<dd>2. Sometime in the future, merge the article with the "Happiest barrack" article and use "Goulash communism" as their common heading.<br /></dd>
<dd>What do you think&#160;? --Elsmlie 18:43, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Speedy keep.</b> I have now fundamentally revised the article conforming to the points raised above. I hope my revision will find your approval and we can close the discussion. --Elsmlie 19:57, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a common used expression for the 1963(?amnesty)-1989 period in Hungary. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelenbp_1155.html" title="User:Kelenbp">kelenbp</a> 21:46, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> - Merge the Happiest Barrack into this one, since "Goulash Communism" seems to be the more common term. I created the article out of "self interest", wanting to learn more about the subject. I am pleasantly surprised of the response, so far. I would like to see/add references to more or less similar situations, like Tito's Yugoslavia or present day China. Barabum 22:04, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (or <b>Merge</b> and keep a redirect); the term is clearly a notable one (see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22goulash+communism%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22goulash+communism%22" rel="nofollow">the Google test</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b> The League existed from 1970-1971 in England. I know its pre-google, but pre-google doesn't necessarily mean outside the realm of wikipedia. If you look at the (admittedly few) google references, they do provide a bit of information, and I've tried to fill it in to the article. Anyway, I'm voting keep for several reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. It was a professional league, even if only for a short while. It was also a professional league in England, the home of football and a major footballing nation by almost any criteria.</dd>
<dd>2. 1970 was a watershed year for sponsorship in football, with the introduction of 3 major sponsor events (<a href="../../../t/e/x/Texaco_Cup_bc04.html" title="Texaco Cup">Texaco Cup</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watney_Cup_903e.html" title="Watney Cup">Watney Cup</a> being the others), and the Ford Sporting League was an important part of the trend. This needs to be filled in better in the article, and I don't quite have the resources to do it.</dd>
<dd>3. It had a unique and interesting scoring system, about which much could be written. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVickser_b9a2.html" title="User:Vickser">Vickser</a> 21:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC) Comments updated further: <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVickser_b9a2.html" title="User:Vickser">Vickser</a> 00:05, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Neutral</b> It still seems that if the league was very influential, there would be more than 10 hits on google, as people would write about this league, regardless of when it was formed. If the scoring system, the ability to deduct points, is unique to football; then maybe the league is worth mentioning. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorqin_0917.html" title="User:Porqin">Porqin</a> 02:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a potentially interesting article about a professional league involving well known teams. (A quick google search yields not only <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham_Athletic_A.F.C._7ff9.html" title="Oldham Athletic A.F.C.">Oldham</a>, but also <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulham_F.C._53e7.html" title="Fulham F.C.">Fulham</a>- I'd certainly be interested in finding out which other teams participated.) I won't rehash the reasons Vickser has given, but I strongly agree with all of them, particularly the interest generated by the unique scoring system- are there any other tournaments in football where scoring was directly influenced by sportsmanship? True, the competition was short lived, but so was the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Cup_%28English_football%29_8f91.html" title="Super Cup (English football)">Super Cup</a>, and that (rightly) has an article. I'll admit, I hadn't heard of this competition before looking at this article- but that just shows one of the great things about wikipedia, the potential for learning about interesting things, just like this.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 23:32, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just as an aside to the above, the Oldham Athletic: Complete Record 1899-1988 by Garth Dykes might have results in the Ford sporting league (which would hopefully at least tell us just who participated), with possibly a final league table. Could be worth a look before deleting. I will get it out of my university library in a few days.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 23:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I know the teams playing will effect some votes, so it's worth noting that <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester_United_e9fc.html" title="Colchester United">Colchester United</a>, currently playing in the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Championship_daa1.html" title="Football League Championship">Championship</a>, also participated in the league. So far they, Fulham and Oldham Ath are the only ones I've found, but I'll also be doing some more research. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVickser_b9a2.html" title="User:Vickser">Vickser</a> 02:29, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - People are far too eager to sling around "non-notable", when you've got articles on quite a large number of more "non-notable" topics.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Meirleach makes a good point. It's disappointing to me when there is the appearance of being automatically dismissive of an article whose merits may not be immediately apparent. Peephole, your questions are worthy of consideration, but they are subjective: What makes a game notable or innovative? Whose coverage sets the standard for noteworthiness?

My questions were indeed very subjective and that is why the subject needs independent, external and reliable coverage, which doesn't seem to exist at the moment. So the article should be deleted. If the subject is truly notable and worthy of an article, then it will eventually be treated by a reliable source and then the article can be recreated. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 01:45, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The games only been in beta for 3 months and already has 8000 players and as for innovation, most browser based MMORPGs seem to either focus on running a big empire(Dark Throne, battlemaster) or running your character around levelling up killing things (Shartak, UrbanDead and Runescape), Nexus War is a very interesting fusion of the two due to the faction system.</li>

<dd>It has the more normal RPG elements, like finding weapons, gaining experience and levelling up, buy skills and all the usual RPG fair, but it also contains elements of the more strategic RPGs, you have to keep your weapon stocks up, so your faction members actually have stuff to attack with, you can hold areas by building barricades, make your faction bonuses stronger by infusing squares on the map.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: And therin lies the problem with browser based games, most accepted by the wiki reliable sources dont review browser based games, its very unlikey that you'll find a review of Nexus War in a newspaper or gaming magazine, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> has "The software is/was innovative, significant, or influential in some specific way, and this is verifiable from reliable sources independent of the software developer." You will be hard pushed to find a reliable source for any browser based game, due to their nature they don't fit properly in <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the two articles I linked above dont meet those two, which by the way are not policies, only guidelines, guidelines which due to the nature of browser based games, don't apply to them very well.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You're being a bit disingenuous. Browser-based games aren't typically covered by mainstream press, nor do I expect them to be. This doesn't make a particular game any less notable -- although perhaps it makes it less likely that <i>you</i> will have heard of it, which I suspect is the real issue here. As far as verifiability goes, I agree that it would be better for there to be abundant coverage by mainstream media sources, but the fact that this is a <i>web-based</i> game puts us in the unique position of being able to actually click on the link and see it with your own eyeballs.

<li><b>Comment</b>: They're not typically covered, because...they're not typically notable. W3c definatly belongs on wikipedia and guess what, it is extensivly covered by reliable sources. No one is contesting Nexus War doesn't exist but wikipedia just isn't a collection of links. So the sites that have an article should be notable sites. And Nexus War doesn't seem to have an exceptional number of users, it barely has any google hits, alexa barely notes any traffic and there are no reliable external sources covering it, so I don't see how it is notable.--<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 21:13, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> The question isn't "why should we keep it", but rather "why should we <i>delete</i> it?" The onus is on you to provide a satisfactory reason for deletion, which as far as I can see you have yet to do. The only criteria for deletion that I have yet to see comes entirely from proposed guidelines, and the assertion of "notability" itself can be seen to be NPOV. While your point of view is that a browser-based game is "not notable", from the point of view of thousands of very active players, it is quite notable. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#There_is_a_lack_of_objective_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> article itself states under the "Arguments against deleting articles for non-notability" section that "'Non-notable' is generally a non-NPOV designation."</li>

My point of view isn't that a browser-based game isn't notable, it is that this particular browser-based game isn't notable. And indeed notability is a point of view, that's why we need reliable, verifable and independent sources and that's also why there are guidelines for notability like <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and the proposed <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 17:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Without getting into an argument over whether gaming press coverage is necessary / sufficient for notability, I'd like to point out the game's virtues. To my knowledge, persistent-world 100-way capture the flag hasn't been done before. The game mechanics blend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_Of_the_Red_Dragon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_Of_the_Red_Dragon" rel="nofollow">LoRD</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradewars_2002" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradewars_2002" rel="nofollow">TW:2K2</a> in a way that is, in my estimation, fundamentally new. Other MMO's have done roleplaying and PvP, but long-campaign strategy (and the community it begets) is the emerging paradigm in the genre. This game does it better than its browser-based cousins, not to mention the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_warcraft" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_warcraft" rel="nofollow">most popular game in the world</a>. It's like somebody fused Axis &amp; Allies with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and then connected your kitchen table to every other house in the neighborhood.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Hi, I've contributed a great deal to this page (though as an exopedian it's not that obvious), and I'd like to vote keep because I believe the reasons for deletion don't fit in this case. It certainly doesn't fit <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as a browser based game, and it is notable regardless of its coverage in the press purely because of the sheer amount of players. If you're worried about the content on the page being lacking, I promise and doubtless others will also endeavour to improve the page further.

<li><b>keep</b>- When I look at the article I can see where it can be improved. I know as a player of Nexus War that maybe the article in question should be declared a Snub until it gets expanded. The information there is all correct, and compared to Urban Dead, the game that spawned Nexus War, Nexus War has the potential to grow past UD (Urban Dead). To me, the article is not about how much publicity the game actually gets, it's about having information out there. Information is the real meaning Wikipedia was created. Nexus War is complex enough to warrant having an article. I agree that the current article is lacking. But improvement is a much better than deletion. So I stand that it should be kept and improved. This sin't some Unclyclopedia article on bungee jumping, it's an article about a real thing.I'm certain there are people in the NW community who would be willing to improve the article. <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERivselis_3d3c.html" title="User:Rivselis">Infested-jerk</a> 17:10, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>- Having read many "keep" requests across this page, this is more of a comment to all of you. The issue here is not if the page can be proven worthy of deletion, but if it can be proven worthy of keeping. Despite what many of you seem to think, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is, in fact, a criteria and NOT a guideline. As, quite truthfully, Nexus War is not the subject of any reliable publications. Also, from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Internet guides - Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, which can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known." This is more an introduction to the game than anything else, and has nothing like dates of the beginning/end of alpha, or beginning of Beta that an encyclopedia entry would have. The only information is a summary of the game and Jorm's name. However much I enjoy this game, I also recognize that this entry is not encyclopedic, has no statistical information, and, therefore, does not belong on Wikipedia. 19:59, 29 July, 2006
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Rather than just saying delete it all, why not tell us what you'd like to see on the page to make it more encyclopedic? What statistical information or other information would you like to see? Surely by answering these questions and helping other people to expand the article, this would help more than deleting the page outright. --84.64.13.108 00:47, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - If there is an issue with the lack of encyclopedic information (and yes, I'm aware that that's not the only issue at hand here), then I would like to attempt to rectify that situation rather than delete the page outright. Give me a few days to see what sort of information I can grub up on the subject, and I'll see if I can at least alleviate the unencyclopedic concerns. Their user-base also seems to be growing at quite a clip (From playing the game, it appears that they generally have at least 200 players logged in at any given moment, and this seems to be increasing rather than dropping), though I don't have reliable figures for the true user-base figures. -- <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirby1024_888e.html" title="User:Kirby1024">Kirby1024</a> 00:45, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The userbase numbers are posted to a restricted section of our forums, but I've already stated them earlier on in my keep vote. They're as current as that comment.

Your best bet would probably be to PM Keolah, Maggah, Meirleach, or myself (Wyn). We'd be more than happy to answer any questions you need, and <a href="http://wiki.nexuswar.com" class="external text" title="http://wiki.nexuswar.com" rel="nofollow">our own wiki</a> can provide you with a great deal of information. -<a href="../../../w/y/n/User%7EWyndallin_b493.html" title="User:Wyndallin">Wyndallin</a> 01:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - There are thousands of people registered, with over 100 players online at any given time. As mentioned before, popular forums such as Penny Arcade and Something Awful have large in-game factions.</li>
<li>From what I've seen, the game is much more innovative then Urban Dead because it forces the player to specialize their characters to remain effective in their preferred task as they level up. This in turn makes it very beneficial to join a faction, as the skills of each faction member complement each other. As mentioned before, it really does boil down to a 100-way game of capture the flag. Large 40 man raids comparable to those in World of Warcraft are not uncommon.</li>
<li>This may be a somewhat weaker argument, but the game only went public near the end of May. For a new non-commercial game made by an formally unknown developer to gain such a large player-base in only three months is amazing. I don't really see the point of deleting, since the number of players will only continue to grow and even if the game is not notable now by the official guidelines, it will be soon. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesGecko_0bfa.html" title="User:JamesGecko">James</a> 22:34, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>2. Does NW need to, or already, fall under WP:WEB?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>3. If none of the above, is it notable?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I would argue that NW does not fall under either WP:SOFTWARE (as it is not a "software application", and in a category of games that is generally overlooked completely by ANY mainstream media. Whether it falls under WP:WEB is debatable, but it doesn't really seem to apply in this case. In addition, while I have participated in a good many AfDs that allege "WP:NOT a crystal ball", at this point it doesn't need to be. The site has thousands of unique users, with hundreds on at any given time. In addition, <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dead_f5a4.html" title="Urban Dead">Urban Dead</a> has an article as well. It is slightly fallacious to argue that it is not notable at this point by people arguing for a "Keep" as as stated above, Wiki is NOT a crystal ball. But I feel the article is notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>- But is is a place to learn about things. So tell me. Does the article act as a public relations ploy or does it actualy give out information? I feel it's the latter.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>-I'm well aware that people not familiar with NW are having to take the word of the players for it, but as someone who has personally watched the growth in playerbase from day one of beta, and before, I can say that if this is deleted now, because it is not "notable" enough, it'll only have to be restored later when everyone is convinced it is "notable" --Lancensis 16:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Judging by the comments here and the size of the community behind the game, it rides on the cusp of the "notable" definition, such that its notable status currently depends on how one defines notability. So at the current moment call the situation balanced. But since it shows signs of increasing membership, I think we'll have to nudge it in the direction of "notable". Or, if not that, we'll have to look at some clearer criteria. But I think that the continued existence of the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dead_f5a4.html" title="Urban Dead">Urban Dead</a> page at least invalidates the requirement for "respectable sources" coverage, because as far as I know there is no substantial coverage of that game in any respectable source.

I'm more of a Wikipedia reader than contributor, but it's my understanding that one of the main purposes of using the wiki format is to permit members to improve articles themselves rather than requiring them to be discarded. "It's not good now, so let's not give it a chance to become so" is not a valid argument by any stretch of the imagination. Speaking as someone who plays this game and is an enthusiast of games and browser games in general, I can attest that the growth in player numbers in Nexus War has been nothing short of astonishing and, if anything, appears to be accelerating. The design innovations it has introduced are remarkable as well. Finally, for those arguing that this can't possibly be noteworthy because it hasn't been covered by the press or other "reputable" sources, it's worth noting that internet phenomena in general tend to be poorly covered. The next mention I see of Slashdot in the mainstream press will be the first (not saying there haven't been any, just that I haven't seen them), and I'm a certified news junkie. --<a href="../../../m/c/s/User%7EMcSnatherson_00bc.html" title="User:McSnatherson">McSnatherson</a> 02:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Fans of the game, please do not argue against deletion using reasons below.</li>
</ul>
<p>1) This game has a huge player/fan base&#160;: Please do not quote large number of players unless you can prove it. I investigated into this matter and found out that there are only around 150 "characters" online at any one time. It is hard to see how there could be even 1000 "active" unique players in the game based on this data. (note: 1 unique player can own multiple "characters" in the game)</p>
<p>2) This game is "better than" another game&#160;: Please refrain from citing reasons like "this game is better than World of Warcraft" or the more general "this game is good/fun". All these are POV opinions and not facts. Wikipedia do not delete software entries based on POV opinions.</p>
<p>3) Using other wiki articles as examples&#160;: This discussion is about this article only. If you feel that there are existing wiki articles that "deserves to be deleted more" then feel free to nominate them for deletion on their respective pages. The existance of other articles is not an excuse to keep this one.</p>
<p>If this game indeed have a huge player base and thought to be good (or better than mainstream commercial MMORPGs like some claimed) then it'll eventually earn coverage and become notable. From what I understand, this game was heavily inspired by Urban Dead which earned itself three citation from notable sources. Remiraz 10:29, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It's an AP based game. For the most part, characters are only logged in for 5-10 minutes at a time to spend their AP. That does not mean that there "must be" fewer players than was stated. The data on the number of players came from the game admin himself. Also, I would like to point out to you the most similar games to Nexus War, <a href="../../../m/u/2A/Category%7EMU__games_6342.html" title="Category:MU* games">Category:MU*_games</a>, many of which have far fewer players than NW does. And I will state again that "notability" is not a viable criteria for deletion and never has been, in spite of what some people like to insist. --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 06:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not a fan; I'm a moderator on the wiki associated with the game, and also a playtester. Brandon Harris is the game creator, and is therefore on the shortlist of people who actually have access to the programming and the database, and he has a habit of posting current stats in the playtesters' forum. I have <i>access</i> to current numbers, but only secondhand. I posted them straight from Mr. Harris' post in the forums. If you wish, I could get screencaptures of the forum posts - but somehow, I think you wouldn't accept them as proof, either. Also, please keep in mind that any one player can only have three characters unless they donate to the game or were present in the Alpha phase, and therefore if you divide the total number of characters by three, you're likely to find a relatively accurate number of accounts with the game. Research, research, research! -<a href="../../../w/y/n/User%7EWyndallin_b493.html" title="User:Wyndallin">Wyndallin</a> 10:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - First of all I tried the game and know that it definately takes more than 5-10 minutes to spend all APs from full. Second, the only way to log into the game is through its website: if there are more than 8000 active unique players logging into the game twice or more everyday shouldn't there be a lot more traffic than those shown on Alexa? Finally, the existence of other similar wikipages has never been a deterrence from deletion. If you feel that those pages deserve to be deleted, please nominate them for delete. Otherwise, they have nothing to do with whether this wikipage stays or go. Remiraz 10:47, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - That is the current number of undeleted accounts, this is true. Regardless, 'playing every day' is misleading. Some people play day-to-day. I certainly don't play every day. With ten characters, I don't have the time or the inclination to play them all every day. I'll try and find out the number of accounts with at least one active character. -<a href="../../../w/y/n/User%7EWyndallin_b493.html" title="User:Wyndallin">Wyndallin</a> 11:21, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - There is good reason why Alexa is not an acceptable measure of a site's "notability". Alexa's traffic ratings only indicate how many people using Alexa's toolbar are using a site, which is extremely subjective and most people don't even use Alexa's crap. Plus there's been some talk of Alexa's ratings being compromised by people intentionally trying to boost their ratings on it. (The same can be said of Google to some extent, but Google tends to be more widely used.) Alexa was rejected as a method to determine "notability". --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 17:05, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Once again the argument devolves into dubious claims of "non-notability". Allow me to address your points individually, Remiraz:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) <i>Re: player base:</i> While I sincerely appreciate your effort to actually investigate the item in question, it would be nice if you'd also make an effort to understand how the mechanics of the game affect the number of concurrent users at any one time. In short, the AP mechanism means that users will typically only be online twice a day, and only for a few minutes at a time -- this happens to be directly mentioned in the article itself and should be apparent from a quick perusal of the game. The number of concurrent users you quote (150) is quite large when considered in this light.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) <i>Re: Comparisons to other games:</i> Agreed. NPOV statements and comparisons to other games do not belong in this discussion. However, this same standard should also apply to NPOV claims of "non-notability", e.g. claiming that a game can't be as good as others simply due to lack of mainstream media attention. To your assertion that "Wikipedia do not delete software entries based on POV opinions" I counter that this is exactly what you are attempting to do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) <i>Re: Using other wiki articles as examples:</i> Agreed on the point of comparing this article to others that may or may not deserve deletion. However, pointing out articles which have set a precedent by surviving similar AfDs is entirely acceptable. The mention of <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleMaster_2436.html" title="BattleMaster">BattleMaster</a> above is indeed pertinent to this discussion as it has just <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_BattleMaster_bf0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/BattleMaster">survived an AfD</a> proposed on the same grounds as that for Nexus War.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd now like to add my own items to your list if I may, for the benefit of those championing deletion:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4) If you're going to question the size of the player-base, at least make a passing effort to understand the game mechanics. If I were to claim that <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> is non-notable because I watched a game and never saw more than 2 players, I'd be betraying a flawed understanding of that game, and this instance is no different.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5) Don't resort to straw man arguments. When verifiability of an article is mentioned, don't couch your argument in terms of notability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>6) Don't use Alexa as a measuring stick (ever). To quote <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html#Alexa_test" title="WP:SET">WP:SET</a>: "Alexa rankings are not a part of the notability guidelines for web sites for several reasons." Ignoring Alexa results is especially important when measuring a game such as Nexus War or Urban Dead. Players of these types of game tend to favor Firefox since the game community releases Firefox extensions to aid gameplay, such as <a href="http://www.sl.ecwhost.com/nw/" class="external text" title="http://www.sl.ecwhost.com/nw/" rel="nofollow">NWTool</a> and the <a href="http://pete.nu/software/nwhoming/" class="external text" title="http://pete.nu/software/nwhoming/" rel="nofollow">Nexus War Homing Beacon</a>. Alexa, on the other hand, is compatible only within Internet Explorer and would therefore never register many, if not most, of the users.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) It would be nice if the people who have access to the secret player stats told us how many people were actually active in the game.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) Whether the game is as "better" than others is irrelevant. If someone claims the game is non-notable and that it must be a bad game, it's only the non-notable aspect that this AfD concerns itself with.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) No, this is just as bad. Battlemaster and Shartak seem to have survived simply because nobody who agreed strongly with the AfD happened to read the page, and because somebody who disagreed with it decided to close it. A couple of articles sneaking through AfD doesn't mean they should be kept forever (articles often come up for deletion multiple times), and particularly not that all similar games should automatically be kept.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4) Again, it would be nice to actually see some figures about the number of players, and the number of retained and active players.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5) That's fair enough.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6) It might be erratic, but even if players of these games mostly use Firefox, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=http://www.urbandead.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=http://www.urbandead.com/" rel="nofollow">Urban Dead has an Alexa ranking of 14,711</a>, compared to Nexus War's 200,691.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And to add my own:-</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>7) "I think this game might be notable one day" is an argument for deleting the article and recreating it <i>if</i> its subject becomes notable, rather than keeping it and waiting. (People should accept the possibility that this game may never become notable.) --Grole 03:27, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) Agreed, these figures should be published. However, my comment was in response to Remiraz's own investigation of the game, wherein he was able to see that there were "around 150" characters active just at that moment in time. I was merely pointing out the fallacy in Remiraz's use of a flawed extrapolation of this number to claim that there couldn't be very many real players in the game.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) Again, note that I agreed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) I do happen to agree with your points about the other AfDs not necessarily being set in stone, but must point out that doesn't preclude us from mentioning them. AfDs don't happen in a vacuum, and similar AfDs elsewhere on Wikipedia are most definitely valid points of discussion, whether or not you happen to agree with the outcome. We don't necessarily have to follow their precedent, but you can't just pretend those AfDs don't exist.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4) Agreed, see point 1.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5) ...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6) Please, <i>please</i>, read <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html#Alexa_test" title="WP:SET">WP:SET</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Internet_43d9.html#Alexa_rank_information" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa</a>. There is absolutely no reason to continue referring to Alexa. Continued mentions of Alexa just serve to distract from valid points of discussion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>7) Perhaps. My contention though, is that Nexus War is notable <i>now</i>, or at the very least can't be shown as "non-notable" by any honestly applicable guideline. Please refer to my comments on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pardus_%28game%29_8944.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pardus (game)">AfD for Pardus</a>. To summarize:
<ul>
<li>The only real notability guideline that has been claimed here is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> was designed to weed out trivial, easily created, sites such as vanity pages and web comics.</li>
<li>Nexus War and the other games in this category are not easily created, and do not easily attract a user-base of thousands.</li>
<li>Applying <a href="../../../u/c/s/WP%7EUCS_6cee.html" title="WP:UCS">WP:UCS</a> and considering <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_rule_making" title="WP:NOT">the spirit of the law</a> makes it apparent that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> wasn't intended to weed out non-trivial creations such as these.</li>
<li>There should perhaps be a notability guideline for these sorts of games, but until one exists it's better to err on the side of leniency rather than to delete legitimate information.</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The TV irritainment programs have <i>millions</i> of repeat viewers, sometimes tens of millions. Formula Dé has a few thousand or at most a few ten-thousands of face-to-face players, and big multi-game tournaments might have a few dozen FD players. There might be a few thousand more players at online sites like BSW if they have FD. That big difference in broadness-of-influence is what hits Wikipedia standards; FD has <i>narrower</i> notability no matter whether it does much more to make people think and interact and make their own fun. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 13:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reluctant but <b>strong Delete</b>. It's nice that it got cleaned up, but it's still an elementary school newspaper. Unless it "broke" one or more stories of major import, and/or served as the starting grounds of one or more extremely well-known journalists, it is hard to imagine ANY elementary school newspaper meeting standards of notability. The author seems to be asserting that notability is imparted by the paper's affiliation with/sanction by a governmental entity (i.e., a school), which would set a very sloppy precedent. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 17:32, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am inclined to think that the Carson Daily contract, and all the media coverage would make her at least marginally notable already.

<li><b>Comment</b> If a soldier gets the amount of press coverage that Brooke has got due to their actions as a soldier (heroic, illegal, immoral) then I don't see why they shouldnt have an article on them. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:46, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I read an article about Brodack in the Boston Globe a few weeks ago. I do believe she is notable, not only for the sheer amount of press coverage she gets, but also because of the impact her popularity has had on YouTube. The Carson Daly deal isn't altogether that notable until something actually comes of it. But she is a notable figure; her name is a household one at this point. If this article is deleted, information about her should certainly be merged into the YouTube article. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b>Srose</b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(talk)</font></a> 20:09, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> – I finally decided to try YouTube a couple of weeks ago. I almost immediately came across Brookers and her videos; she's really funny. However, I only read articles about her in the media once I found her on YouTube, mainly because her fans kept linking to those articles in their comments. I'd argue she's not even an internet phenomenon, but simply a YouTube celebrity. Someone argued Emmalina from YouTube also has an article and intimated that to be precedent for inclusion for Brookers as well. Nobody knows these people besides users of YouTube. If computer programmers are very active in newsgroups, end up getting jobs because of their contributions to those communities, and then end up in tech site articles (for whatever reason), that doesn't automatically warrant the creation of an entry on wiki. Remember the Star Wars Kid? He was notable. Whether people were part of a particular community or not, they found out about him. Brooke Brodack isn't quite there just yet.--Contrinewb 23:26, 25 July 2006 (UTC)contrinewb</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Seeing as she has been hired by someone in the industry, and she is the first to do so through YouTube, pretty much single-handidly, that makes her very notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.91.79.227 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.91.79.227_be97.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.91.79.227">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is not an advertisement. I have no connection with the firm who made it or with anyone who sells it. If Mattisse's argument holds, we will have to delete hundreds of articles describing manufactured tradenamed articles and tools and equipment including just about every article on gunshop-available guns and items of scuba gear and makes of vehicles and powered garden tools.

<p>Due to the fact that this article is only a microscopic part of the TV series "The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron" and barely even relevant, I nominate this article for deletion. In no way is this topic an important part of the series, and it has only been used in two episodes. Also, those episodes have not given any insight into what the Llama Love Society really is but instead has just shown that two characters (one is not even a recurring character) are members and have a membership card.</p>

During the creation of the article, the creator in question said that they would be returning to the article in an attempt to try and turn it into a Featured Article. It has now been four months since the articles creation, and the article has not been touched once by the creator since then, and has also been left in decay for the past two months at the least. The article also sets a bad precedent insomuch as the New Jersey Devils are only a 24 year old hockey team, while other, more storied teams (such as the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Six_43ce.html" title="Original Six">Original Six</a> of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hockey_League_6c9a.html" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a> do just fine without the need of a "History of the ..." article for their own team histories. While this article may have one or two things of particular note that the team's main article neglects to mention (for example the controversy over the team's name a year ago), just about all of the article is a carbon copy of the team's history on the main page with some minor tweaks on the wording here and there.--<a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResident_Lune_3e22.html" title="User:Resident Lune">Resident Lune</a> 14:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As the page's creator, allow me to explain. Several months ago, I began working on the main NJD article to bring it to FA status (or at least Good). Using several team pages that had made FA status as a template, I created a History page to allow a much more detailed history of the team on the sub-page, while keeping the main page broad (see: New England Patriots, Gotheborg, etc.) However, real life prevented me from working on the page for a week, then two weeks, then it turned into several months. At this time I do not know when I will be able to resume work on the main page. As such, when that time comes, I will work solely on the main page. When it goes up for peer review, if at that time the history section is too extensive to fit on one page, then and only then will it be split off into its own page. However, given the comments above (I'm aware the team is only 24 years old, same age as me), it may not be necessary to house a separate page. Therefore, I suggest deleting the History page (as there isn't anything on it that isn't on the main page), or, failing that, a redirect. Merge is unnecessary, since it's a carbon copy of the main page anyway. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFutureNJGov_e590.html" title="User:FutureNJGov">Anthony</a> <small><a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFutureNJGov_52f8.html" title="User talk:FutureNJGov">Hit me up...</a></small> 13:02, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not a place to "prove a point" however. The FSM is listed because it became a wellknown internet meme. This is a parody of that, that was just created, and is NOT NOTABLE.

<li><b>Comment</b> What is comes down to is that it appears this is a parody piece for one, two, the religion itself is not notable enough for inclusion. Look I could create a religion that believe it's God is actually a armoire in a self-storage unit in Buffalo, but if only me and a handful of my friends believe in this, it's not notable. The FSM has become an internet meme and is notbale, hence the article. If in time your "religion" becomes notable then by all means recreate the article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 16:16, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Of course, this page should be deleted. There is no religion associated with this article. The so-called religion's founder, Mike Wong, and his associates, are atheists who are using and abusing their privileges at Wikipedia for the purpose of attacking the Christian faith, which Mr. Wong refers to as "ludicrous", "absurd", and "nonsensical". Moreoever, it is being used to make his argument in debate in the ethos section of a website called The Total War Center, dedicated to Creative Assemblies' Total War series of computer games.</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly urge the deletion of this article, as it has no religious or historical value of any kind.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Length is not an issue, as it is a short film, and its place on IMDB is a testament to its significance (they have similar requirements for listing to Wikipedia).

<li><b>Delete</b>. IMDB does not have similar requirements to Wikipedia. Their only requirement is that something exists. (For projects in "development" or "pre-production" they don't even require that.) There is no distribution of shorts, outside of things like the Pixar shorts that accompany their features. Most shorts are only seen by only a tiny handful of people who attend small film festivals. The vast majority of people will never see this, never have the opportunity to see it, and never even hear of it.

<li>"The vast majority" of people probably haven't heard of hundreds of Wikipedia topics from hundreds of fields. "The vast majority" of people probably don't see a lot of movies. And perhaps you should re-familiarize yourself with IMDB's listing policy. They will only list <b>independent</b> projects if they are lined up to be shown at a notable film festival or have been recognized in other significant fashion. The "development" and "pre-production" films are all titles formally announced by "big name" studios, producers, actors, or directors. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorne_N._Melcher_ba8b.html" title="User:Thorne N.

<p>This article/list is essentially entirely <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced and speculative</a> <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and really could never be anything but POV and OR. The article currently uses three criteria to determine if a city is "endangered," thus warranting mention in the article: declining population, "most in danger of natural disaster," and "most outrageous crime rates." In my opinion, the first and last of these could be sourced then split into articles of their own (perhaps List of cities in the United States by population growth and List of cities in the United States by crime rate). However, this article is about "endangered" cities, which is a very vague concept. It cites no sources and is speculative in large part ("Enormous earthquake predicted within the next 100 years. City remains unprepared and buildings are not up to code. Towers as far away as Chicago expected to sway when this earthquake strikes"). Finally, note that New York and Washington, D.C. are conspicuously absent from the list. Though it seems that these two cities would be more likely to experience a terror attack than any other US cities, adding these to the list would be purely speculative. <b>Delete.</b> · <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">j·e·r·s·y·k·o</font></a> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 16:26, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I don't see where the criteria for a speedy deletion really applies here. This article is not up for a speedy delete.

<dd>'<i>Comment</i> The criteria for speedy deletion applies from here(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melissa_Elise&amp;oldid=65597414" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melissa_Elise&amp;oldid=65597414" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>) and here(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melissa_Elise&amp;oldid=65598478" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melissa_Elise&amp;oldid=65598478" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>) as he asserted that it should have been. Also the rules that contribute to delete an article are stated as this "The articles for deletion (AFD) process, supported by two companion processes, speedy deletion and proposed deletion". Deletion policy (<a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a>) refers also to proposed delete, which does not apply and AFD, which is currently under way. The reason that this is brought up under AFD is also because deletion guides and thus speedy deletion indicate to bring this to AFD as described earlier.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Basically policy indicates purely and simply to refer to AFD and thus AFD must make the decision, but because of this AFD cannot refer to policy for its reasons because policy directs to AFD. The need to delete this page doesn't come any non-AFD criteria, as described earlier, and is based entirely on wether or not this article is useful. Melissa Elise is a recent voice actress and she is soon to have many more roles. This page will have to eventually be made anyway, and is there really a reason to delete it? It isn't spam or anything else. This has started to become personal... --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 21:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>After all that, I the Author of the page Melissa Elise propose Deletion, under the simple fact that the aforementioned person has no biographical information available and that all information on the page is contained elsewhere and that no more information will be available as this only instance of voice acting was in 2002. I will contact an admin for deletion. (Thank you Fan-1967, your comment, though simple, was the simple solution.)</b></p>
<p><b>Comment</b> AFD is the way we Wikipedians get together to determine if an article is appropriate for inclusion in Wikipedia. Policies such as <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> and, to a lesser extent, guidelines such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> help to set the standards for these discussions so they don't fall into a free for all. While <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> tells us to list an article on WFD to gain consensus, it also specifically instructs us to use guidelines such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as an aid in determining notability. Trying to argue that policy doesn't apply to AFD is not likely to convince anyone but yourself. You state above that Melissa is "soon to have many more roles" but one of the tenets of Wikipedia is that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is Not a Crystal Ball</a>. Perhaps we should wait to see if she actually does get some more jobs instead of assuming that she will. If and when she does, that is time enough to add her. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 21:42, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A list of those little vanity stickers. As you can get them just about anywhere, this list is never going to be complete. While the little stickers themselves are a notable fad and certainly worthy of an article, an attempt to list every single oval sticker that someone might make is not overly encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:03, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't think any of them are official per se, but some of them like OBX are certainly widespread and seen all over the place. They're based on the stickers used to identify the origins of cars in Europe. Since they're simple black-on-white designs (an oval with 2 or 3 Helvetica letters in it), anyone with MS Paint and an inkjet printer could make their own. <b>Weak delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Yes, this is frighteningly trivial, but this list does provide a service, and a wiki is the right mechanism for this "service." And while anyone can print these, most of them do reference a particular place, are semi-offical, and widely understood in a geographic area. OBX, for example, is understood as the Outer Banks of North Carolina on the east coast of the US, and someone from outside the area could legitimately want to know this. <a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOriginalbigj_c382.html" title="User:Originalbigj">Originalbigj</a> 00:05, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>First it means "garbage dump" and now it means "vicinity"? Please cite sources to back your argument up. Please cite sources giving the real name of the place, given your contention that this is not its real name.

<li>You didn`t even read what I wrote. OKOLINA means VICINITY and DEPONIJA means GARBAGE DUMP. The story about vicinity or okolina bombing appeared on CNN which is a pure example that such a ridicilous mistake can be made. They reported the bombing of the Okolina, like if they said there was the bombing of Vicinity with capital V. So if CNN can make such a rough translation mistake those smaller sources you are citing could do it as well. Like I said the official name is "unhygienic settlement" and you will get results on these Roma settlements if you type it in google. Unofficial names can be kartoncity, deponija, ciganmala... but they are definately not something we should put into encyclopedia. Just type deponija in Google and you will get photos and texts about garbage dumps but not Roma settlement. And when you search Deponia among serbian text websites you get nothing as it is not even a correct spelling. This is not the official name and we can`t use it. We can make an article Unhygienic settlements in Serbia where we would cite all of the names but the article carrying a name like this is definately a joke. <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvala_c557.html" title="User:Avala">Avala</a> 12:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, that was not the point. There is a garbage dump there all right, but there are also some people that live there, thus it is also a settlement, not only a garbage dump.

<dd>The thing is - it is a generic name. We can`t call it a Deponija with big D as such a settlement exists in every town and it is not even a settlement but homeless people living on landfill zone. <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvala_c557.html" title="User:Avala">Avala</a>

<li><b>Keep but</b> rename to <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deponija.html" title="Deponija">Deponija</a> for the start or, better still, to Deponija (Belgrade); I guess many ex-Yu cities have something like that.

<dd>Well, many of the city quarters in the Serbian cities officially do not exist. Cities are usually divided into "mesne zajednice" ("local communities"), which may or may not correspond with traditional or known city quarters.

<dd>Hi Jeff. Which notabiliy criteria are you using? I have tried to fit it with the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">film criteria</a>, but can't. The Times article just seems to be a fairly random reference to a film found by the journalist and I'm not sure how important the MTV review is (does anybody know how difficult it is to get a review there?). Regarding the iFilm inclusion, they may not take rubbish but, again, how hard is it to get on there?

<dd>NOTFILM would not apply here anyway, as it's a nonbinding essay lacking broad support.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Well written article detailing history of this 50+ year old school, hardly a "vanity" article, which is inapplicable (from a policy perspective) to schools in any event. Further, "notability" (or the lack thereof) is not and never has been a valid deletion criterion for schools. 42 elementary/primary schools have survived the AfD process in the past 2 months alone, with hundreds of similar schools surviving the process in the previous 2 year period. While some of these elementary/primary schools resulted in "no consensus" closures, it is reasonable that a wikipedia reader would expect to find an article about this school when searching for it given the great perponderance of other elementary/primary school articles on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 21:04, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Undecided</b> - as it was I who wrote the article, I thought I'd add a few comments. Firstly, it's not a private school (not sure why that came up). Secondly, it was never intended to be recruitative; rather that it is difficult to find a central history of schools anywhere, and I have researched several; some of the older history info can be verified from the Victoria History series, so I can find a reference for that if that would make is saveable. Failing that, if consensus is that schools have to be of a certain size or notability, then what it that? And how broadly? It's notable locally since it has been threatened with closure on more than one occasion, and may well be again in the next 5-10 years. Does it need to be broader than that? <a href="../../../t/a/f/User%7ETafkam_3c4d.html" title="User:Tafkam">Tafkam</a> 19:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Adding more verified information to the article about its local notability would make for a better evaluation.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Do you seriously believe that 90% of those who vote to <b>delete</b> on this and all the other school AfDs are "working toward consensus"? Do you think that "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" actually have any respect whatsoever for the opinions of those who disagree with them? I can't see as how those who pile on with <b>delete</b> votes aren't treating these "discussions" as a vote, particularly in light of the fact that school articles are very, very rarely deleted through deletion processes on wikipedia. The fact is, that ALL attempts at consensus on this issue have utterly failed, and in fact, if anything the failure of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> simply codified the polarized positions that exist on this contentious matter. There is no consensus on what to do with schools and trying discredit editors who have well-known views on the subject, expressed in literally hundreds of previous AfD discussions is quite frankly, a cheap shot.

<li>I am sorry, but that is hogwash. When an editor creates an article about a school of which there are literally tens of thousands of such articles on wikipedia as well several organized projects to create and improve articles about schools, it is <b>not</b> an assumption of good faith to then suggest that the editor was creating "advertising". It is the opposite. It is obvious that the editor in this case created the article on wikipedia after seeing many other school articles and wished to contribute information about - not to "advertise" this school. Frankly, I find your lack of assumption of good faith with respect to the author and contributors to this article by suggesting that they are creating "advertising", offensive and uncivil. Your voting premise is faulty and malinformed in any case as this is a not a "private business". The article <b>clearly</b> states that this was founded as a Church of England school. In England, the Church of England is <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_religion.html" title="State religion">established</a>. The article goes on to make abundantly clear that school was later reorganized by the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_education_authority.html" title="Local education authority">Local education authority</a>.

<li>One para intro, three para history. It's not exactly lauding the merits of the school, I admit, but announcing the existence of a business offering services to the public is an advertisement, unless that article serves some purpose other than announcing the availability of the services. This article fails to anything else, and, whether or not it was intended as an advertisement, it is an advertisement.<br />
My knowledge of English schools is limited. (Does this school actively recruit students, or simply accept students from a district? In the case of the latter, my argument that this is an advertisement would indeed be incorrect.) I went to find out more, then discovered that <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_England_c7c5.html" title="Education in England">Education in England</a> is horrribly uninformative and badly written; it's mostly bulleted lists.

Students are organized into these STATE SCHOOLS by the LEAs, the school does not solicit for students. Perhaps your time would be better spent getting informed on a subject you are voting on and discussing before pronouncing that the subject is "a private school" and "a private business" which is clearly not the case. I hope the closing admin discounts your obviously and admittedly shoddily-informed comment. Irrespective of your unfounded assertion and continued weak defense of same, "advertisement" is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/advertisement" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/advertisement" rel="nofollow">defined</a> as "A publication produced in order to sell some commodity, service or similar." or "A commercial solicitation in a publication designed to sell some commodity, service or similar." This article is neither of those things, particularly since no service is "sold" by this institution.

<li>That last bit, at the very least, implies that the objections and opinions of editors who disagree are meaningless and without worth to the project, which I find nonconducive to the environment needed to create an encyclopedia. And further, yes, I believe that many of the people who have voted delete above have an interest in consensus, particularly when it comes to this article. The claim that people who would argue to delete an article like this are "piling on votes" is similarly thoroughly unfounded. I have expressed in my vote the reason I think that the article is inappropriate to include, and I am entirely open to discussion on my position as far as this article is concerned. Further, I have respect for the differing opinions of other editors who disagree with me- I extend this effort toward other editors in the name of not detracting from what Wikipedia needs to work, and it is this expectation that led me to voice concerns over what Alkivar had to say. Lastly, the concerns expressed by A Man In Black, I must admit, concern me as well. A civil environment in which editors assume good faith is similarly vital to the project. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 17:38, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. I usually hate joining AfD's, but this one seems to me to be misguided on a reasonably important topic. I dispute that this presentation is nonstandard, first of all. I have here on my lap a copy of Kolmogorov and Fomin's book <i>Introductory Real Analysis</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-486-61226-0</a>) which, on page 28, proves "strong" induction using precisely this argument. Since strong and weak induction are equivalent, the argument has seen print. Second, on page 29, they prove <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfinite_induction.html" title="Transfinite induction">transfinite induction</a> using the same technique. Now, regardless of your opinion of the axiomatic status of the principle of induction for the natural numbers, you will probably agree with me that said status is nonexistent for ordinals. It can, however, be proved that the ordinals are well-ordered and hence satisfy induction using this argument. However, the article is not so well-written. I think it should be improved, have transfinite induction included, and perhaps sourced (like, from Kolmogorov and Fomin) to avoid further accusations of originality. I also think the name is fine: the natural numbers have a pretty variable axiomatic status (you can define them from the ground up, with the Peano axioms, but you can also define them from the top down, as a subset of the real numbers, and in the latter case, well-ordering and induction need to be proven explicitly). <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 20:38, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> and improve. Variations of this content are found in standard literature, so OR is not an issue, <i>per se</i>. To be interesting and meaningful, this cannot stand alone.

I found a website for a Paul Becker bodybuilder<a href="http://www.trulyhuge.com/Paul_Becker.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.trulyhuge.com/Paul_Becker.html" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>; his picture there looks nothing like his picture on the cover of his video<a href="http://www.tlavideo.com/details/product_details.cfm?v=3&amp;sn=1&amp;id=188251" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tlavideo.com/details/product_details.cfm?v=3&amp;sn=1&amp;id=188251" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> or his picture at HisXpress (<b>caution:</b> <i>full-frontal nudity</i>)<a href="http://www.hisxpress.com/paul-becker.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hisxpress.com/paul-becker.html" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>. They could be the same person; 1984 was a long time ago and he's got on a lot more clothes in his wedding photo (odd choice of picture for a bodybuilding site, but I digress). Rather than run the risk of it not being the same person and creating some sort of brouhaha, I vote for deletion. Additionally, since the original author of this article is no longer around to question as to sources, unless someone can come up with a good reason to keep the page that I'm not aware of, I think it should go. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom">Chidom</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chidom_1873.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chidom">contribs</a>) 00:15, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd><i>Note:</i> My experience is that tlaVideo generally has the most complete filmography; even though they are a retail site, they still list films that are out of print or no longer available. Their credits list includes information (when available) for Country, Studio, Cast, and Director - clicking an entry in the list produces a filmography filtered by the contents of the link. Vivid and, to a lesser extent, HisXpress tend to delete films from their lists that are no longer available for purchase or rent (download), but they are still worth checking, although their search engines are not as robust or intuitive. Searching "Paul Becker" in the search box at HisXpress, for example, will get you a list of every film with someone named Paul or Becker. There is a drop-down list of performers to search by name. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom">Chidom</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chidom_1873.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chidom">contribs</a>) 00:15, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li>Perhaps you should rethink your definition of an "indiscriminate collection of information". The article in question does NOT fall under that category. (As a side note, I'd like to mention that you seem to be against keeping both this and another browser based game, Nexus War. It appears that you have a distaste for browser based games, and this would be in conflict with many of wikipedia's policies.)

<li>I was only simply stating that you seem to have dislike these games. Not once did I say that you *did* dislike them, just that it looks that way. It is by no means a personal attack, and I most certainly did NOT say it anonymously.

(The section consists mainly of a list of kinds of articles that should not be included in Wikipedia according to consensus.) Interestingly enough, <i>none</i> of the eleven items in that list concern this article, so I'm curious as to how a summary like "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" can be an argument for deletion when its explanation is clearly not. — <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElembis_b8b1.html" title="User:Elembis">Elembis</a> 04:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think we may have a disagreement as to where the burden of proof lies. To my knowledge there are no policies and guidelines that make statements like "articles about games are always okay" (<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> is just an essay), but there are plenty of policies and guidelines about what <i>isn't</i> okay (like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>). Doesn't that strongly suggest that any article is acceptable unless it violates a policy or guideline?

<li><b>Strong, strong, strong keep and expand</b> I've never touched a 360, and I'm a Playstation man, but to 360 gamers, one's Gamerscore is a HUGE deal. IGN and Gamespot have each written articles (one or the other, I can't remember which, has written multiple articles) about earning Gamerscore points. I know people who have rented games they couldn't care less about simply because they wanted to raise their Gamerscore. Achievement points are, for one reason or another, incredibly important to hardcore gamers. I think this article has to greatly expand on the topic, reference some reliable game sources, and get rid of the stupid external links to banner makers. I also think that the article should absolutely remain on WP. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The info in this article is important. Perhaps it should be at Wegman Committee, cast as the recommendations of the committee rather than as a "bio" article. Is there a "keep and move" option? I hesitate to move it while the afd vote is going on, but the relevance of the info is the challenge to the liberal "pro-global warming theory" point of view. I'd like to see Wikipedia avoid championing the liberal POV; opposing POVs should be mentioned, too. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 18:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable, verifiable as demonstrated above. I won't wade into the POV history; I just note that even if it is currnetly POV that is not a rationale for deletion, it must be irredeemably POV to have an article on the subject for that to be grounds for deletion, and I believe that that test can never be met for a biographical article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:59, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am this Author. Does 977,000 GHits (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Kiddy+Grade%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Kiddy+Grade%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>) sound minor? I feel really insulted by this, I really enjoy this series and wish to make a valid contribution to the pages related to it. I don't care, how big or small it is, I am interested in doing this. I just happened to put great effort into these pages and really wish to improve them. I have contacted several users for their help, and placed the article in several 'wikihelp' instances, note the <a href="../../../k/i/d/Talk%7EKiddy_Grade_140b.html" title="Talk:Kiddy Grade">Talk</a> page. I as one dont understand the obsession with not needing detailed articles on 'minor things'. I happen to note that you have no active interest in anime series. Unfortunately who are you to decide wether or not this article is relevant, irrespective of your admin title? All I want to do is write a damn good article and everything is getting in the way. Most of my argument is personal, I realise that. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 22:36, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Firstly, I should be clear that the fact I am an admin is not relevant to this discussion - anyone can nominate articles for deletion and I am acting as a regular user and not an administrator in that regard. Secondly, I am not (exclusively) trying to decide whether this article should remain on Wikipedia or not - this discussion will hopefully attract other Wikipedians who can contribute and make recommendations. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 22:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - Articles should be much more than they are now and give character relevance if they are to stay, but the pages <i>were</i> just created. As for <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a>, don't take things so personally, as while this isn't a vote rants are more likely to lose like-minded individuals than gain them. I do disagree with KG being considered very minor (while it is an average series), but if this is as far in detail as the articles are to go I'm more in favor of a <b>Merge</b>. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 23:00, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I was moving around information, i think that classes as moving, not creation. The information on all these characters was on, the now deleted, List of Kiddy Grade Characters, i was moving info to characters own pages. I wish to take things personally in this instance. When someone puts efforts into something, they dont want to see it deleted, that goes for every single person. Deletion is spiteful, I wish to only see this occur in vandalism and such cases. Also i wish to point out that it is a distinctly good series, it is the first 5 episodes that really let it down. Also a merge seems stupid as this information was shall i say, un-merged, as described earlier. Again I shall point out the <a href="../../../k/i/d/Talk%7EKiddy_Grade_140b.html" title="Talk:Kiddy Grade">Talk</a> page If people are going to refer to the quality of the article. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 23:07, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Venting is doing nothing to help your case here. My point of view of the series' quality has nothing to do with my nod to stay/go, and how long the text was around before doesn't change the fact the articles are very young (which was an argument to your benefit, not against). I will say though, after sitting through the show only once, I don't think that many characters could supply sufficent content to sustain an independent article. It <i>shows</i> they were taken from a list as of now, an expansion of detail and relevance on your part would do more to prove doubters wrong. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 23:23, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't want to be rude and please don't take this is gnawing the newbies or assuming ill intentions of an editor. I don't, it's not the editor, it's the culture. But there has been a pervasive explosion of these character articles in Anime articles. They contain little chunks of information, but only seem to exist to hold an image and an infobox on the character and to fill out a character navagation template... <i>[Note: this comment added by <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a>]</i></li>

<li>I have half a mind to say delete the lot of them and start from scratch .. but I'd only push for that if we could throw in the similarly formatted character articles from OMG, IY, and Tenchi as well. They were all created in the same manner, and it's not well suited to the wikipedia. First off, they contain way too many pictures and (some of them) seem to only exist because an infobox was able to be created for the article. But, I will not be mean to the information and I will push for a <b>SUPER speedy merge</b> These articles fall under the auspices of the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> which give a wonderful steps on how to create such pages. Also, a aticle like <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclair_and_Lumiere_%28Kiddy_Grade%29_19de.html" title="Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)">Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)</a> contains WAY too many photos and is a definite violation of the fair use policy. It needs a lot of trimming regardless of the outcome of this debate.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I wish to point out that I am not trying to do what fits in with policy best, but with what is easiest to read. This is an anime, and a anime is a cartoon and as a visual product, pictures are available and used. For this point i will use <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclair_and_Lumiere_%28Kiddy_Grade%29_19de.html" title="Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)">Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)</a> and will tell you that all the pictures are relevent. There is the main one of each character there, you can't argue with that. Then there is also one of their guard robot and ship, that La Muse and Donnershlag, each of these articles are important in the series, technically, I see that they should be placed on the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-human_Kiddy_Grade_Characters_ea3e.html" title="Non-human Kiddy Grade Characters">Non-human Kiddy Grade Characters</a> Page. But they are relevant to the people. Now the other 4 pictures of eclair and lumiere are ones of forms that we learn about later in the series, while these forms are relevant they are also spoilers. But again this is an anime, it is visual each picture is useful and each has a purpose. Wether or not this suits the wikipedia style. As I am trying to get an article that is easy to read and that gives lots of relevenet info. Now in terms of the info <b>the pages are very young, and haven't had time to accumulate information.</b> That said a merge should probably wait a bit at least. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 09:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've never heard that a fair use image may only appear once in wikipedia. I do, however, know that only a limited ammount of fair use images should appear on a page. The fair use image (screenshot) has one goal: "For critical commentary and discussion of the cinema and television." Furthermore, according to the <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">official policy</a>, "3) The amount of copyrighted work used should be <b>as little as possible</b>. Low-resolution images should be used instead of high-resolution images (especially images that are so high-resolution that they could be used for piracy). <b>Do not use multiple images</b> or media clips if one will serve the purpose adequately" and "8) The material must contribute significantly to the article (e.g. identify the subject of an article, or specifically illustrate <b>relevant points or sections within the text</b>) and must <b>not serve a purely decorative purpose</b>." For the page in its current for, the images of the the two charaters on that page could be done with two images.

<dd><b>Comment</b>YES.. It should be merged into a list of characters. If, after the article is merged into that list, there is a decent ammount of information, a <b>summary</b> should be left on the character's page and the article should be moved to its own page. The Keiichi article doesn't have much substance right now.. It's a lot better than some of the other one paragraph, two sentence, fluff that exists for some of the other OMG articles. Secondly, you're over stating the character's importance he's appeared in a lot of episodes, but only one franchise. The case could be made per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> that he deserves his own article because he appears in an OVA, the TV series, and the manga of the same exact series, but that's stretching it a bit.</dd>
<dd>I have told you this before, and I will tell it to you again: there are more benefits from merging these articles than keeping them seperate. The first and foremost is that they reduce the number of pages that need to be monitered to ensure that changes are made correctly and that no vandalism is occouring. They also make the articles easier to navigate and provide more succinct articles without the need to repeat the same information over and over and over. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 12:59, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Very tough call. The series and characters are notable, but the articles are, quite frankly, horrid, and do not even attempt to use an outside perspective on the series.

<li>Your points are null, you cannot make a call on wether or not to keep an article based on "looks," clearly stated in policy. There is no policy on fancruft so that isn't a valid reason.

We did something similar with a number of character articles from the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html" title="Bleach (manga)">Bleach (manga)</a> category who were either non-notable or had not yet proven their notability, and as some of them have turned out to be important, we have reinstated their articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> Can't you cite the series itself as a resource? I realize it's a primary source, but it's a published source and highly verifiable. We cite primary sources in the form of research studies in numerous articles. The biggest problem with citing external sources is that outside of Wikipedia, your review sites are basically a bunch of blogs and barely say anything other than "I liked it". I suppose there are probably some magazines that cover anime series as well, but that's only helpful for establishing notability. When it comes to actual information about a series, wikipedia is often the best source outside of the series itself, because while our articles are often written by cruft loving fanboys, everyone else's articles are written by cruft loving fanboys who don't have rules against speculation. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 12:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

In just the same way that there are people interested in language and typography. No anime has cultural impact in the way you suggest it, but that doesn't stop us from writing articles. I can't believe that you are prepared to make such a statement. -end of rant- Apart from that, I have already said that a merge is not ideal. Articles sit for long periods of time, wallowing around doing nothing. You take the list of character and split them into their own areas and people can easily focus on adding pictures and writing informative long articles about characters. having it in one least, means that they are encouraged to just put basic information down, not to give detail. Wikipedia is a resource an infinite one, while you may not think it's necessary, each little article isn't exactly a waste of space, they are like 2 kb each for crying out loud. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 12:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> He did give a reason: Lists allow for the exact same amount of useful information to be given as articles do, you do not need minor character articles. Seriously Crampy, you need to calm down, realize we aren't trying to remove any content, just place it in a list rather than individual articles. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 12:52, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> Yeah I do agree with Tjstrf's statement and besides one thing I learned when I helped with the making of character profiles is that those with one or few paragraphs should deserve to be on the same page and only those with a large amount of paragraphs into a page which is not only why I supported having <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiryo_Tennan_9d9c.html" title="Seiryo Tennan">Seiryo Tennan</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misao_Kuramitsu_8130.html" title="Misao Kuramitsu">Misao Kuramitsu</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seina_Yamada_c04c.html" title="Seina Yamada">Seina Yamada</a> to be made into their own pages. The point I am trying to make is that <b>since most of these profiles have minor summaries then it would be a better idea to merge them together</b>. I also agree that you should calm down, I mean even though I occasionally get stressed with things that occur on Wikipedia but I prefer to control my emotions and do the best I can to help even when something I worked for such as a type of category gets deleted. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 02:21, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, merge some</b>. The series doesn't seem to be minor, as explained above.

On the other hand I don't see why we should not merge the other pairs and characters into articles on 'GOTT ES Members', 'Villains', 'GOTT Command' and 'Others', most of those are stubs anyway and until they grow too big (if ever) I see little reason for a split.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus"><font style="color:#006400;background:#7CFC00;">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</font></a><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 16:35, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

My reasoning being that, these are mecha, not characters (only the few mecha with advanced AI, e.g. Donner and Wirbelwind, could be considered characters), and the information would better serve being merged with the relevant character articles (e.g. merge the CC and Dodo information with the Tweedle Twins page) - provided of course that the character articles aren't actually deleted. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiroi_Hane_f5af.html" title="User:Shiroi Hane">Shiroi Hane</a> 01:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Um what are you talking about? I created *this* article from scratch. This article on John Corvino is not the article on John's view of homosexuality or anything else.

To the closing editor, please note, that almost every comment above is referring to a different article than this article. I wonder if people even read what they write. At any rate, John posted a note on my talk page, and I've added that notability claim. "He has addressed over 100 university audiences" (see my talk).

<p>You appear to be confused about what article this AfD is about. This Afd is about the current <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Corvino_26fa.html" title="John Corvino">John Corvino</a> article, not any old historic article which no longer exists, and certainly not about some other article, which should have it's own unique AfD. It is the current article that I wrote from scratch. I have already stated several times, that the article on his view on homosexuality was cut from the edit war on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a>. Obviously I did not write that. That article no longer exists in this article.

<li><b>Comment</b> These types are the Top Level Bureaucrats since you can't get any higher in public service. Wages exceed $200,000 per year. They are responsible for managing budgets in the Billions of Dollars range. These are the people with the real Power in Canada. Politicians in Canada do not have the same level of power as they do in other democratic countries. These are important and interesting distinctions for Canada and Ontario more particularly which deserve Encyclopedic record and notoriety.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiWoo_a9f6.html" title="User:WikiWoo">WikiWoo</a> 18:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The character is the son of two prominent characters on the show. The identity of this missing child has been a major mystery that has gone on for almost the show's entire 7+ year history. He is related to several characters on the show.
<p>Presumably if the mystery ever is solved the need for the article would go away or it would have to be merged with whoever the person really is.</p>
<p>Also if someone has a better name than Unknown_Johnson I'm willing to change the name of the article. I picked that name because the child was born out of wedlock to a character named Eve Johnson. Unnamed_Crane or Unnamed_Child_Of_Julian_and_Eve might also work.<a href="../../../k/s/o/User%7EKsofen666_638d.html" title="User:Ksofen666">ksofen666</a></p>

Half of the listed characters are also nominated for deletion, mostly for fancruft, and the fact some of the monsters appear for about 30 seconds at the end of an episode (as reflected by the fact some of them don't even have -names-).
