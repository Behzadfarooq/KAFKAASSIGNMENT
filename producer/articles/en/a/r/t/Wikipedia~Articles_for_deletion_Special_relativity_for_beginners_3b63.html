<p>All articles should be approachable by laymen, or even high school students. This is the current Wikipedia policy: include as much details as possible, but explain them in the main article in simpler language. You move off details by topic, not move off simpler language by difficulty! This article is being used as a crutch for editors on its parent article <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> to continue writing about their formulas without providing context. In short, it is an excuse in order to continue editor laziness. I love the content. It is a good explanation, a good approach/analogy. However, it needs to be merged. The article title isn't even formal. <b>Merge and redirect</b>. Also needs to be merged with the Simple English version. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 16:50, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have just looked at <a href="../../../../simple/s/p/e/special_relativity_8a06.html" class="extiw" title="simple:special_relativity">simple:special relativity</a> and it is probably the right level of treatment for that section. loxley 11:48, 18 November 2005 (UTC) I did say the following but have changed my mind: <b>Move to a new title</b> (according to whatever Wikipedia rules apply such as moving to <a href="../../../../simple/s/p/e/special_relativity_8a06.html" class="extiw" title="simple:special_relativity">simple:special relativity</a>). .. The main Special Relativity article is an excellent whistle-stop tour of the subject that covers much of the field but does not actually explain it. In my experience the stumbling block for students is the raw assumption that the speed of light is constant so I introduced the geometrical understanding of Minkowski and others to help explain why c is constant. According to the Talk Page the article seems to have helped a few people to get the idea of SR. This explanation of the geometry of SR usually occupies half a page or less in advanced textbooks and is normally seen as an amusing 'aside' for those who are about to meet four vectors and tensor maths. In the same way it really is an 'aside' to the main SR article, but an indispensable aside if the subject is to be understood. The main SR article is well structured and has a global coverage so the problem with actually merging this text with the main article is it would damage the existing structure and detract from it as an overview of the field. loxley 19:34, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wikibooks, or possibly <b>move to new title</b> per Loxley. <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">Special relativity</a> looks fine to me. Encyclopedia articles should be as accessible as reasonably possible, but they're reference material, not instructional courses. I absolutely disagree that all material needs to be accessible by high-school students; that's effectively a ban on discussion of advanced topics. By the way <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity_for_beginners.html" title="Special relativity for beginners">Special relativity for beginners</a> looks quite nice; it introduces complex topics without dumbing them down or succumbing to the popularizers' temptation of making vague and grandiose claims. But I think it's a better fit at Wikibooks, with a prominent link from the WP article. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:30, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I meant "accessible to high school students", I really meant, the argument of every page should be accessible. For example, the points made (that is, the laws, the effects) should always be accessible; you can include the formulas and elaborate explanation of causes, that won't be understood, but that should not be the <i>only</i> thing the article contains. For example, if I wanted to know about the sun, all the basic detail, it works by nuclear fusion, it generates solar wind, should be there. If I needed to know about Parker spirals et al, then I would read more. But the basic explanation should not be replaced with advanced material, they should be <i>supported</i> by the detail. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 02:09, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not always possible. It probably <i>is</i> possible for <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, but frankly I'm not convinced <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> isn't already accessible. That's not to say some improvements couldn't be made, but they would be minor tweaks, not a wholesale expansion by pedagogical (rather than reference) material. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 03:38, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> or <b>rename</b>. This article and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> are more useful if they are separate. Please join the discussion at <a href="../../../m/a/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EMake_technical_articles_accessible_5c55.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Make technical articles accessible">Wikipedia talk:Make technical articles accessible</a>; there are unresolved difficulties in making all articles accessible to laypeople, and we should avoid hastily deciding in favor of one side of the issue. <a href="../../../e/e/q/User%7EEequor_b13d.html" title="User:Eequor">‣<font size="+1">ᓛᖁ</font></a><span class="venus"><a href="../../../v/e/n/Image%7EVenus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif_4db5.html" class="image" title="♀"><img src="../../../upload/shared/1/1b/Venus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif" alt="♀" width="9" height="12" longdesc="../../../v/e/n/Image%7EVenus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif_4db5.html" /></a></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../e/e/q/User_talk%7EEequor_c7a5.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../e/e/q/User_talk%7EEequor_c7a5.html" rel="nofollow"><font size="+1">ᑐ</font></a> 21:40, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> within Wikipedia's main namespace, and rename <i>Space-time invariance</i>, since that is what the article describes. (Article names such as "Introductory special relativity", which are more plausible candidates that readers might type in, can redirect to it). This is an article on an independently encyclopedic topic. My own feeling is that the problem lies with the lack of thought in the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> article. Merging this fine article would dilute it's strength (a considered explanation of physical reality) without adding a thing; <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> can include a link to it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 23:34, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, but the thing is special relativity is supposed to NOT be like that in the first place. If this article's existence is an excuse for special relativity not to be improved, then I'd rather have it deleted. We have the option of merging. The point is not "dilute its strength", this is an encylopedia. You write separate articles based on topic. These two articles' topics are the same. Similarly, I'm not even considering adding to this on the side, this could possibly be part of the introduction of the page. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 02:12, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Wikipedia structure is excellent because we can explain the relations of terms with sentences such as: "Use the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagrangian.html" title="Lagrangian">Lagrangian</a> to find the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Null_geodesic.html" title="Null geodesic">null geodesic</a>". The problem with this hyperlink approach is that although it explains "Lagrangian" and "Null Geodesic" it does not provide clear information on how to use the Lagrangian to find the null geodesic. What would be needed is another article on the technique. Should Wikipedia allow "Use the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagrangian.html" title="Lagrangian">Lagrangian</a> to find the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Null_geodesic.html" title="Null geodesic">null geodesic</a> (See Using Lagrangians to find null geodesics)"&#160;? or should it insist that all articles expand explanations such as: "Use the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagrangian.html" title="Lagrangian">Lagrangian</a> to find the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Null_geodesic.html" title="Null geodesic">null geodesic</a>. A Lagrangian is...., Action is...., extremal curves are.... etc..."&#160;? In fact "SR for beginners" is a specific explanation of a small part of SR and should, technically have been called "Space-time invariance and four dimensional manifolds in the early evolution of Relativity Theory" or "Minkowskian Relativity" for short, the problem is that this title would not have tipped off the high school reader to the fact that this is an essential stepping stone to understanding Relativity Theory (which, with general covariance, actually leaves this approach behind(!)). It is interesting to reflect that had the article been called Minkowskian relativity and a hyperlink been hidden in the text of the Special Relativity article this vote for deletion would not be happening. But would this have helped explain SR?loxley 11:48, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as-is. The two articles compliment each other very well. Special Relativity for Beginners bridges the gap between the more technical presentation of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_mechanics.html" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a>. As a seperate article, it avoids placing into the special relativity article a lot of detailed introductory material that would make the parent article overly long and highly tedious. This is an excellent arrangement and should be retained. (If any change is to be made, I would support transwiki-ing this article to Wikibooks.) As for <a href="../../../../simple/s/p/e/special_relativity_8a06.html" class="extiw" title="simple:special_relativity">simple:special relativity</a>, I built that up as a simple broad-brush presentation of special relativity, and referenced BOTH the parent article and the subject article in it. I really feel that the best presentations on this subject in Wikipedia are the ones that are not under the restrictions of simple English. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 05:11, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see that no-one so far, not even the nominator, wants an administrator to delete this article. Even <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> has only expressed the desire for this article to be renamed. Unless someone <i>who actually wants this article to be deleted</i> comes forward within the next 12 hours, I will be closing this discussion as a unanimous keep. Discussions of mergers, rewrites, and renamings are what <a href="../../../s/p/e/Talk%7ESpecial_relativity_for_beginners_2aa6.html" title="Talk:Special relativity for beginners">Talk:Special relativity for beginners</a> is for.

<li>Well, the other purpose of AFD is to have a formal process to determine consensus over whether an article should exist as a separate article, is it not? I want this article to be "deleted" in the sense that the content is moved somewhere else, and then the original namespace is no longer a separate article. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 11:05, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The purpose of Articles for <i>deletion</i> is to determine whether there is consensus for an article to be <i>deleted</i>. You don't want the article deleted at all. Article <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_ec58.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge">merger</a> and article <a href="../../../r/e/n/Help%7ERenaming_%28moving%29_a_page_4970.html" title="Help:Renaming (moving) a page">renaming</a> do not involve deletion at any stage. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:13, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're right, of course, about merging, renaming, and redirecting, but what about transwikying?

<li>Transwikification doesn't even require that one have an account, let alone that one be an administrator. I was performing transwikifications long before I became an administrator, and I still perform them today using an account, <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_%27bot_00ba.html" title="User:Uncle G's 'bot">User:Uncle G's 'bot</a>, that does not have administrator privileges.

<li>Maybe we're using the word "transwiki" to mean different things, or if not, maybe you could point me to a ref that explains how to do it. What I had in mind (in the hypothetical case that this article were transwikied to Wikibooks) is that the article would be there—together, ideally, with its <i>history</i>—and would <i>not</i> exist on English Wikipedia. Is that what you meant, and if so how do you do it? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:48, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Can we wind this up?</b> whilst the article has deletion box on it it appears to be unreliable. It is not unreliable so we need some way to move on.
