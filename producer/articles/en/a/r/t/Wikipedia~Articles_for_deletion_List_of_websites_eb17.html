<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Numerically, I have 19d-10k, which is fractionally below the two-thirds level, and I don't think any of the editors need discounting. Nevertheless, I'm inclined to give more weight to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> than to "oh but we have other articles [that are just as bad/good]". Driving everything down to the lowest level of quality is not the way to conduct an AfD debate. We should seek to haul standards up, not search for the weakest article and drive standards down towards to it. Anyway, that's too personal a reason to bend the threshold here, so I'll call a very close no consensus. If this is renominated in future, I do not think this AfD serves as a "keep because was kept before" argument. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:19, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> "This is a list of <a href="../../../w/e/b/Website.html" title="Website">websites</a> that are famous, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a>, or extremely popular and 'for which Wikipedia articles exist.<i>" Wikipedia is not a link farm,</i> but it can and should list the most common/popular/notable websites that have articles in wikipedia. If you want to make and apply a new category called Category:Notable websites that would be ok with me but listing them on this page is easier to adjuducate when spammers try to post non-notable sites. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 20:55, 17 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>and you could subcat things like Category: Search engine websites and Category:Social networking websites. You could also make one called Category:Possible spam websites and then it would be easier to search for them. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 05:40, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>To clarify: My vote is still <b>Keep</b>. People can do the category thing if they want another way to look at websites, tbu this list has cash value and I think it should stay.

<li><strike>While I agree that if the list sticks to websites that are notable and already have coverage on Wikipedia, then it might be useful, and certainly within Wikipedia guidelines. However, I know that's not how it's going to go -- this page will get spammed with every website address known to man. Also, I am not sure if a list form will add anything that isn't in an article. Therefore, I'll say <b>delete</b> and <b>create category</b>. (That is, if there isn't a category already. I haven't been able to find one in the 3 minutes I spent looking.) --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 22:51, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</strike> I have changed my vote to a <b>weak keep</b> due to the precedent that has been outlined below; I still suggest that a category be created, however, because if it does turn out that this becomes a spammer's paradise, then we have something to fall back upon. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 19:26, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with those above me. If we have lists for films, books, etc., there's no reason why we shouldn't have a list of websites. Keep in mind that this is not a list of every web site out there. It is a list of those that have Wikipedia articles already, which is much smaller and more maintainable. --<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 17:33, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm going to make one more attempt to justify why this page should be kept. While I do think that categories are great, they are not always a substitute for a listing page. For an example, I will point out the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dances.html" title="List of dances">list of dances</a>. This page simply lists each dance under certain headings with a short description of each one. If I want to see a list of dances, I can simply go to this page. This cannot be done in the category system. Because of the many subcategories that exist and branch off mulitiple times, I would have to go through many different pages to really see a list of all of the dances. Seeing them all at once is much more convenient. Furthermore, it is nice to be able to see a short description of a topic before going to the page. Wikipedia can be slow sometimes, and traveling from topic to topic can be annoying. A list would prevent that. Finally, I don't think that spam would be a major problem. This list is already quite extensive, and I haven't seen any spam on it yet. Even if there were, many pages get spammed routinely, and they have all been handled pretty well. I don't think that spam is a satisfactory argument against this until it makes the page virtually unusable. I know that I have found this list to be quite helpful, and I would be disappointed to see it go. --<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 17:57, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>By the way, although I do think that this page should be kept, I agree that a category should be created either way. --<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 23:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete and create category</b>. Although the abovementioned lists are good for wikipedia, I just have a bad feeling that this list is going to become <i>very</i> unmaintainable, <i>very</i> quickly. As soon as the more unscrupulous members of the Wikipedia community find this list, every man and his dog will be putting up personal websites, spamming links, etc, and it is going to be the mother of all headaches to keep under control. Also, every website on this list will also have a category on it, and when the non-notable websites are deleted, the redlink will remain, making it easier for someone else to come along and do the same. At least with a category, once an article is deleted, the link int the category will likewise vanish. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 00:32, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>; since an article is required to be listed, categories will be fine. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETregoweth_2a9b.html" title="User:Tregoweth"><font face="Georgia"><i>tregoweth</i></font></a> 00:54, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete and categorize</b> If a reader comes to WP looking for a specific site, they'll search for that site.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Lists like this are magnets for vandals who love to add their own sites to these lists. It then encourages them to write articles on them. AFD and CSD are overloaded enough without such encouragement. The potential harm this does outweighs any good (and I can't even imagine much what that would be). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:56, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: lists and categories are complementary. Categories are self-maintaining, updating when articles are added to or removed from them; they are incapable of displaying more than a list of article titles. Lists must be maintained manually; however as described above, they are capable of displaying explanatory text next to each entry, and are amenable to more flexible styles of display. Lists are not confined to simply sorting entries alphanumerically: entries can be grouped according to appropriate subject areas. This must be written down somewhere, but I can't recall right now… HTH HAND —<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> | <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Boswell_f2d3.html" title="User talk:Phil Boswell">Talk</a> 17:07, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> WAY too broad, and way too hard to navigate and/or load if it's to be anywhere near complete: how many pages would be required for the poor user to click through?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with those above me. I think many people have got confused about the purpose of the page. Its not about listing down all the websites, but listing only those for which there is dedicated Wiki page entry.
