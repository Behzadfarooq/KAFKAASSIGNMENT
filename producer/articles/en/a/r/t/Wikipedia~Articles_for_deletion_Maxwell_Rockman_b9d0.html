<li>Bobthefatass's comment illustrate one of the problems with this article, the lack of verifiability. Where is the documentation for his award as the "Amateur photographer of the year 2002" and who is this International Society of Photographers who awarded Rockman this title? Well a little research yields an a great deal of information about the group -- apparently they send out hundreds of these awards that come with invitations to attend their conventions where <a href="http://www.betterphoto.com/forms/qnaDetail.asp?threadID=8171" class="external text" title="http://www.betterphoto.com/forms/qnaDetail.asp?threadID=8171" rel="nofollow">"EVERY photographer who attends is presented with an "Amateur Photographer of the Year" award."</a> Click <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/scams/photo_contest/" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/scams/photo_contest/" rel="nofollow">here for a news article on this organization's sister group, The International Library of Photography.</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 13:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> As a Junior at the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU, we are given insight into young artists , some younger than ourselves, from all over the world who are creating notable works. Maxwell Rockman is someone whose work we have looked at. In fact he visited NYU this November and shared some of his ideas on capturing what he calls ' moments of reality' with a camera. His work is very intriguing and is certainly worthy of merit. As for the books, they are exclusive art books that were only available to art institutions. We have the books here at Tisch and from what I heard from some of my professors, the books were only printed for a short time. The gallery Roy was a small gallery that featured young and old artists alike. It closed two years ago because the owner died. From what I remember( I visited it 3 years ago) the owner, who was very old and had a ton of money( again, this is what one of my professors told me), displayed all many different pieces from different artists that he thought were outstanding. He had no website and the gallery was only open for a two years. I do remember a small article in the Times about it which prompted me to see it for myself. I believe I know who this bobthefatass character is. He may, in fact, be one of our professors who proclaimed, after Maxwell left, that someone like him should have a wikipedia page. I cannot tell you why there were two cases of vandalism, but I do know that our professors are not too fond of Wikipedia and one, I'm not going to name names, showed us a page he "reworked," which was quickly changed back to its original state. From what I have read, this article is fairly accurate, and I see no reason to remove it. [[User: photogdelriowiki] 4:22, 10 Jan. 2007

<ul>
<li>This is, indeed, my first "edit" for I came across this discussion when looking up Rockman just for fun on Wikipedia( after remembering what my professor said). I thought I might throw in my two cents, because this article is true( and humorous...I recieved the same award as did everyone else!). In small art circles, mainly fine arts colleges and photogrpahy groups, Mr. Rockman is considered one of the new age photogrpahers who is creating great art. Having his name, as well as a small bio, in such a public database, is an excellent way for him to become 'known.' As said before, he is recognized, but not by everyday 'casual' photogrpahers who would certainly get a kick out of his work. User:Photogdelriowiki 8:27, 10 Jan. 2007
<ul>
<li>This is exactly the point -- <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a> or forum for becoming known, Wiki is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> or repository of knowledge. If you believe so strongly in Mr. Rockman, then wait for him to become notable and we will all happily help you create a fine article on his work. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 02:15, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe you miss the point that the creator is trying to make. This is an article about an artist, that at least is known by professionals. If Wikipedia monitors, like yourselves, choose to delete it, then why not delete articles relating to things like certain bacteria that only a few scientists care about. He is a reference, just like bacteria. What I meant about becoming known is that he can be accessed by other individuals without knowledge of him to gain insight into new artists. User: Photogdelriowiki 10:45, 10 jan 2007
<ul>
<li>I'm not accustomed to the comparison of photographers and bacteria, but the novelty has a certain charm. Two things are involved here: (i) the verifiability of the facts claimed for the photographer/bacterium, and (ii) the meeting of notability criteria for photographers/bacteria. That a bacterium is unknown to anyone outside a group of scientists is beside the point. As for photographers, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Rossier_1b23.html" title="Pierre Rossier">Pierre Rossier</a> is probably very little known, but he gets an article because the claims made for him within it are verifiable and because of his roles both of pioneer and of teacher of photographers as notable as <a href="../../../u/e/n/Ueno_Hikoma_8f36.html" title="Ueno Hikoma">Ueno Hikoma</a>. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:16, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
