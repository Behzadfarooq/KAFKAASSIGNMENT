<ul>
<li>Just yesterday, there was a <i>majority</i> to delete a school article. Progress towards consensus may be slow, but it is not completely absent. There is no reason to pretend that we cannot continue to have the debate over time. After all, isn't that how WP works? School articles are only nominated occasionally, though there has been a bit of a spate just recently.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 00:58, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. What school was deleted yesterday? 2. I don't consider an average of a school article VfD nomination per day as "occasional". 3. It is not only not useful to nominate verifiable, expandable schools for deletion, it is also harmful by unnecessarily <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7Ebite_fe9c.html" title="WP:bite">biting a great number of newbies</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 03:22, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1.No, I could have put that more clearly: it wasn't deleted, but I thought there was a <i>majority</i> for deletion <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Sunshine_Coast_Grammar_School_7fdd.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sunshine Coast Grammar School">here</a>. <b>In fact I miscounted</b>, it was 15d, 15k since Lucky6.9 sort-of voted twice by accident. That is still no consensus to keep, however, unlike some school VfDs. 2. Is it really that much? It might be that I just skip over them. But even so, that's less than 1% of the VfD load today. 3. I do not agree that nominating a page for deletion is necessarily biting the author, whether they are new or not. <i>"If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly...do not submit it"</i> is right there on the screen as I type. Speedying it might be biting, but I would never condone that for schools. It <i>is</i> useful to continue the debate precisely because there is no consensus; no harm will be done if you expect the consensus to go your way. 3.1. Articles can be written on many things that are verifiable and expandable e.g. an article about the contents of my bedroom; but those attributes alone do not make their topic encyclopedic. Particularly not in the blanket no-consideration case that is made for keeping schools. I personally consider each article I vote on on its own merits and I thus voted to keep this one. Finally, there is no point getting annoyed about this process, as some participants do, since it is evident that schools <i>will</i> carry on getting nominated. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 04:29, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually I think there would be less consensus to deleting if some effort was being made to improve the non encyclopedic articles that are out there. Since that may not be happening, then editors who don't wish to have more low quality articles see a need to add them to a VfD. A side effect of this is to actually get articles that are nominated here improved. Those improvements are why you see so many keeps. If the articles were not improved you would likely see a consensus for delete. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:53, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, there <i>does</i> seem to be a systematic and ongoing effort by school-inclusionists to brings school articles up to some reasonable standard. I'm not sure about this history of this specific school, but in general it is probably a good idea to list schools on <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGRider_Schoolwatch_74ee.html" title="User:GRider/Schoolwatch">Schoolwatch</a> for a while before nominating them for deletion, and I believe I'll add this to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> if it is not there already. Articles do not automatically and magically "grow" and improve all by themselves, but they do grow if there is a support network of interested editors for a topic category. I think doing the work on this articles is more or less the obligation of those who <i>want</i> Wikipedia to include these articles. Two years ago I don't think this was happening, but now it looks as if it is. I'm also tempted to say that when a school substub is not showing signs of improvement the appropriate routine might be to delete it <i>but</i> make it a requested article. That is, treat low-quality school substubs as article requests. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:38, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While it has only been three days since listing, I would have expected that if your comments were supported by actions then more work would have been done on the articles listed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html#Collaboration_of_the_week" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Collaboration of the week</a>.

<ul>
<li>Well, I'm not really in touch with the school-inclusionists. Perhaps one of them will opine as to where problem school articles are best listed. I think they are still monitoring <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGRider_Schoolwatch_74ee.html" title="User:GRider/Schoolwatch">Schoolwatch</a>, which was set up for the purpose of rescuing school articles from deletion. I'm not sure whether they watching <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html#Collaboration_of_the_week" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">COTW</a>. GRider himself is, I believe, still prohibited from editing deletion-related pages so he can't respond here, but perhaps others will. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:12, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I did not know a COTW for schools even existed and, indeed, it appears to have been just invented this week. I think it's a good idea.
