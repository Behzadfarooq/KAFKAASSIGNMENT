<li><b>Strong delete</b>, for undue weight bordering on original research. When <a href="../../../v/2E/_/V._O._Key_a9f5.html" title="V. O. Key">V. O. Key</a> published this periodization of American history in 1955, he divided it into five "Party Systems", with the latest beginning with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a>. There has been some publication on the idea since, some two dozen articles on the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=Sixth+Party+System&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=Sixth+Party+System&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">Sixth Party System</a> (scholar.google). Some of these have been explanations of then current events as the end of the Fifth Party System, at dates ranging from 1960 to the present; some of them have been comments on the Fifth Party System still existing after so long. (The other four Systems all lasted about thirty years.) None of these appear to support the idea that he Sixth Party System has already come into existence, <b>and</b> has been replaced by a Seventh, as the article claims. Aldrich's article is a fringe variation on a relatively minor idea. There are hundreds of articles on <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=United+States&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=%22political+realignment%22&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=United+States&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=%22political+realignment%22&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">political realignment in the United States</a> (scholar.google). <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:45, 7 October 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 19:21, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Septentrionalis, would you be comfortable with removing this article from the template (or perhaps retitling it to reflect it's exclusion from Key's book), and boldly noting that it is not one of his original five? To me, this other scholarship makes the SPS not original research, though one might argue that it's poor research.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 19:44, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It should certainly be removed from the template. The present article is worse than poor research; it is asserting one opinion, from one paper, in Wikipedia's voice. Scholar.google.com shows twenty-three articles that use the term with various dates for its beginning; at least two of them mention the SPS to assert that it does not exist. There is no consensus on any other claim on the SPS either; I think all that can be said is presently in <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Party_System_844b.html" title="Fifth Party System">Fifth Party System</a>, which see. Wikipedia does not exist to abstract every academic paper in a separate article. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:00, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What if we heavily revised the article to reflect that this is one logical progression from Key's ideas, but that it has been rejected by scholars and is only referred to as a null idea?--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 10:27, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is still in error on two points: Aldrich's is clearly not the only proposal of an SPS, and it has not been rejected as much as ignored. (There also appears to be a British series of numbered Party Systems, which has a handful of papers.) If I see a rewrite, I will react to it (please notify my talkpage); but why is a null idea notable? Why have an article on it? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 14:57, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>After a couple of days, I agree with you in part, that a totally null idea mentioned by a few scholars isn't notable enough. However, Aldrich and Niemi (from the summary, which is all I can see), is making an argument for a sixth party system, although it lacks a party realignment. Unfortunately, I don't have time to rewrite this article, now.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 09:39, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per reasons given by people at the DRV, and per my reasons at the AfD for the Seventh Party System. This is a barely used term for which nothing even close to a fixed definition exists. A mention of these ideas (6th and 7th) in the last remaining article on the rest of the series (Fifth Party System or lower) will be more than sufficient.

All the previous party systems existed for ~ 30 years. It is now 73 years since the Fifth system. We can argue perhaps about the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh_Party_System_7c6d.html" title="Seventh Party System">Seventh Party System</a>, but all the above arguments regarding the Sixth are null when considering the sheer number of years since the Fifth. The original author of this system initiated it during the Fifth Party System. It would be entirely perposterous to persume that it (this system) suddenly ended with its initial authorship. That (that it was created by its author during the Fifth), would be the primary argument why it has not progressed past it. Is it reasonable to persume that when all the historical party systems lasted ~ 30 years, the Fifth is gowing strong at 73 years old? I strongly propose not. The Sixth certainly has begun long ago. <a href="../../../q/w/e/User%7EQwertyqazqaz_8af8.html" title="User:Qwertyqazqaz">Qwertyqazqaz</a> 17:36, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b>: your opinion is pure <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and is not an argument as to which guideline or policy would either favor keeping or deleting this article. If a description of American politics in "Systems" was moderately popular 60 years ago, and is very obscure now, then it is reasonable to have an article describing that old theory (the first five systems), and to delete an article describing later additions (sixth and seventh). Seventh is already deleted, and I see no reason in your "strong keep" why the sixth shouldn't go either. This is not about claiming that the fifth is continuing or has stopped or never existed at all, this is just noticing that further systems (sixth, seventh, eigth, ...) are hardly discussed and even then no agreement is reached on them. They are no viable, common scientific theories but the ideas of a very few scientists which do not get any attention and consequently have no place on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:19, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b>: Your comments are what reeks of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, as your only argument is that it has <i>less</i> scholars referring to the Sixth system than the Fifth system. And as I have demonstrated, that is because a) it is newer b) it came into existance after the initial author established the series. No one denies that the Sixth has scholars backing it. And as mentioned by others (above, and in the Seventh Afd) some scholars already have us in the Seventh Party System, let alone the Sixth. And logically you cannot argue with these scholars, given the time frame involved, and the series ~ 30 year per system. <a href="../../../q/w/e/User%7EQwertyqazqaz_8af8.html" title="User:Qwertyqazqaz">Qwertyqazqaz</a> 16:15, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is actually no consensus of a "party system" enumeration beyond the third one (see Poole &amp; Rosenthal quote below). The subdivision of the third, Democratic/Republican era into fourth, fifth, etc., systems is speculative and the higher the number, the less support it gets. The idea that the subdivision must follow a thirty year pattern is complete hogwash and unsupported by sources, as are most of the keep votes here. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 07:13, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Endorse deletion.</b> This series of article stubs does not describe a generally recognized system; it appears to be just one author's schema. I didn't see citations in other N-th Party System articles I checked (not all of them) to suggest that this topic meets WP policy. The others should probably be brought up for AfD as a group, so we can either identify sufficient sources or delete the articles in consistent fashion. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:41, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>This term scores a few tens of unique ghits, and seventh party system scores even fewer. There only apears to e one fountain source of these neologisms. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 22:28, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I quote from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Congress-Political-Economic-History-Roll-Voting/dp/019514242X/sr=8-2" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Congress-Political-Economic-History-Roll-Voting/dp/019514242X/sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">Poole &amp; Rosenthal</a>, which captures the mainstream reading of partisan eras: "The United States has had three periods with distinct two-party systems. The first, the Jeffersonian Republican/Federalist party syste, ended with the Era of Good Feelings. The second, the Democratic/Whig system, was organized after the Era of Good Feelings and lasted until the early 1850s. The third, the Democratic/Republican system, was organized by the late 1850s and continues today, although we will frequently refer to this system as having perturbed into a three-party system (northern Democrats, southern Democrats, Republicans) by civil-rights issues that arose in the mid-twentieth century." (p. 35) The split of the D/R era into sub-eras is certainly a minority position that hasn't caught on in the poli sci community. I get 17 article hits on <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> for "fourth party system", 13 for "fifth", six for "sixth" and one for "seventh". (Compare with 112 for "era of good feelings" and 302 for "republican revolution".) <b>Endorse Deletion</b> but if you want to start an AfD for all articles past the third I'd be glad to contribute. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 03:03, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
