<li><b>Weak delete</b>, possibly <b>merge</b> (with some updating &amp; sourcing) or... transwiki... or whatever. I <i>don't</i> think individual speedruns need articles of their own. At best, they're section-worthy in the game article.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, I've only started writing this article a few days ago. <i>I haven't been able to properly convey the importance of the subject matter in writing yet.</i> Please note that this is an extremely important speedrun; it's considered to be the most accurate and typical example of tool-assisted speedrunning and thus deserves to have its own article. I intend to make full use of this article in relevant context in other articles as well. If you say that this should be deleted, then you should look into speedrunning, since if you have any knowledge of the phenomenon, you should know that this is indeed very notable and keepable. <b>Note: there are no notability and verifiability problems; I simply haven't gotten around to editing this information into the article!! Please see the various sites that have mentioned this run; don't blindly assume it's not notable because it's difficult to find search terms for in Google!</b> I have written a lot of information of the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedrun.html" title="Speedrun">speedrun</a> article and thus know that this particular speedrun is <b>very important in the description of the phenomenon</b>! Reliable sources are, of course, on the way, but you must give me a chance, please! —Michiel Sikma (<a href="../../../m/s/i/User%7EMsikma_222d.html" title="User:Msikma">Kijken</a> maar niet <a href="../../../m/s/i/User_talk%7EMsikma_e16b.html" title="User talk:Msikma">aanraken</a>) 12:27, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>PS: the article, as it is right now, in its early form (only a couple of days old), has references to other articles, has proper headings and wikification, has lots of paragraphs which are going to be well-written and larger in the future, has screenshots that show interesting facts about both route planning and the usage of tools to run through a game (as noted in <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool-assisted_speedrun.html" title="Tool-assisted speedrun">tool-assisted speedrun</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedrun.html" title="Speedrun">speedrun</a>), has references, has notes... how could one possible suggest that it is a non-notable article when it has so many ties already, even in its early days of development? I really don't see the AfD reason here, and I also don't see why so many people have already voted for deletion. —Michiel Sikma (<a href="../../../m/s/i/User%7EMsikma_222d.html" title="User:Msikma">Kijken</a> maar niet <a href="../../../m/s/i/User_talk%7EMsikma_e16b.html" title="User talk:Msikma">aanraken</a>) 12:34, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>: As far my word as the author of the run can be trusted, there are no verifiability problems. The page is also beyond a stub. It is the embodiment of many tool-assisted speedrun -related concepts, which is why it makes a good article in my opinion, and provides informative content to those who read about the concepts. I do agree that it is not noteworthy on its own as a speedrun. There are no articles of other speedruns, that I know. As for "reliable source", the tool-assisted speedrun community, a member of which is maintaining the article, is as reliable source for tool-assisted speedrun related information as there can be. —<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBisqwit_6c3d.html" title="User:Bisqwit">Bisqwit</a> 12:38, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>You cannot be trusted. I cannot be trusted. Wikipedia doesn't rely on the word of its authors; instead, it uses <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, something this article is severely lacking. Can you cite a reliable source, preferably multiple, supporting the claims made in this article? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 13:08, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then I don't understand what's the deal. The techniques mentioned within are explained at another article (<a href="http://tasvideos.org/RockmanTricks.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://tasvideos.org/RockmanTricks.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) and they can be verified by testing them. As for things like "a bot was used", those things are reference to the movie author's (my) words, and do you really need to prove somehow that the author said so? Can you even do it better than linking to the original publication (as msikma is already doing)? What exactly is there that needs verification but is not verifiable? --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBisqwit_6c3d.html" title="User:Bisqwit">Bisqwit</a> 13:50, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is there any source outside of this one site to verify any claim made in this article about this speedrun? I think it's a phenomenon of interest only to posters on that site, frankly. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 13:58, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I cannot argue against that it's only in the interest of the posters on that site. Tool-assisted speedrunning happens to be quite centralized -- there is very little duplicate effort. That's why I said "weak"&#160;:) The "keep" comes from the opinion that it anchors many of the concepts of tool-assisted together. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBisqwit_6c3d.html" title="User:Bisqwit">Bisqwit</a> 14:28, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a well crafted article, it is comprehensive and properly laid out. However the sourcing is questionable, if exhaustive, and keeping an article on such a minor topic implies a dangerous notability precedent.

<li>But this isn't "thousands of speedruns for hundreds of games". This is one article about one speedrun which is incredibly notable. The fact that it has not been properly sourced is because <b>it's only a few days old</b>.

<ul>
<li>It's as fine of an examination of a specific speed run as I've ever seen, but it's not incredibly notable. A new development in cancer research is incredibly notable, a book that sells millions of copies is incredibly notable, a Mega Man tool-assisted speedrun is not.

<li>It is actually the absolute best example of tool-assistance and, as was mentioned, it anchors many of the different concepts of tool-assistance together. If tool-assisted speedrunning is a notable subject, then this could be seen as an explanation of tool-assisted speedrunning; an extension of an article due to it being in just a slightly other scope. That's why this article is useful to keep around. If you disagree with the notability, then please use a {{verify}} tag instead. I feel that deleting it straight away is paranoid. —Michiel Sikma (<a href="../../../m/s/i/User%7EMsikma_222d.html" title="User:Msikma">Kijken</a> maar niet <a href="../../../m/s/i/User_talk%7EMsikma_e16b.html" title="User talk:Msikma">aanraken</a>) 14:59, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please remember that use of the term "meatpuppet" can be offensive, and may scare away newcomers. (The very policy you cited states this.) Instead of accusing, try to welcome newcomers, regardless of their reasons for coming, and explain why their votes probably won't be counted. Remember, <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">we don't want to bite the newbies</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 18:59, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Michiel and I explained things to Anetode over IRC and decided that my vote would be better off not being counted either way as it felt somewhat like foul play. So the issue is resolved as far as I'm concerned. 70.80.29.62 22:17, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthieu_Savard_887f.html" title="User:Matthieu Savard">Matthieu Savard</a>, I assume? Thanks for your understanding. But please don't think of it as "foul play". You are new, and unfamiliar with our customs, but this does not mean that you're opinions aren't welcome (although they probably won't be counted by the closing admin). We hope you decide to stay! <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 23:12, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Whether the vote is counted is up to the closing admin, thanks to the discussion on IRC I was able to ascertain that the post was not a sockpuppet vote by sikma. Matthieu Savard is apparently a rather knowledgable gamer who has made contributions to the .fr Wikipedia. He was very reasonable about discussing my concerns over what appeared to be vote-stacking by a meat puppet - a view that I do not hold anymore. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╞┬╡</a> 05:11, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
