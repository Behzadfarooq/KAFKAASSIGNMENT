<p>Unsourced article. Google turned up multitudes of blogs and sites mentioning "Rowrbrazzle", but nothing that resembles a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, and hence an encyclopedic article cannot be constructed. <b>Delete</b>, per WP:ATT and WP:N <font face="stop" color="purple">K</font><a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKangie_2db6.html" title="User:Kangie"><font face="stop" color="green">@</font></a><font face="stop" color="blue">ng</font><a href="../../../k/a/n/User_talk%7EKangie_5fc0.html" title="User talk:Kangie"><font color="#EE0000"><i>i</i></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Kangie_9b4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Kangie"><font face="stop" color="black">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kangie_2584.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kangie"><sup><font face="courier" color="brown">meep!</font></sup></a> 07:14, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> pending sources. Right now the article fails the fundemental <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribution policy</a> and seems to be a amateur comic published by an amateur vanity press (the APA). Still, it makes three claims of notability: It's vast list of contributors, it's impact on the genre and its uninterrupted 24 year run (a long run for <i>any</i> comic). If <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> can be found to support these claims then I would say it be kept on the grounds that it is a notable comic <i>within</i> the furry community even if not the mainstream. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 13:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Definite Keep.</b> <i>Rowrbrazzle</i> was a seminal APA in <i>[ETA: what]</i> would become a dominant genre of independently published comics in the 1980's. It's highly notable, &amp; too historically significant <i>[ETA: for us to be able]</i> to keep the article from resurfacing on this site. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVentifax_9bbd.html" title="User:Ventifax">Ventifax</a> 07:35, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How can we go about finding <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> in order to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> this claimed <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>? Remember, it's not about what's <i>true</i>, it's about what you can verify through <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribution</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 13:48, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, what verification do you need? Does it have to be online? Do you need a scan of the actual thing? Testimonials from contributors? I don't have any actual issues of it myself, but I can dig up a reference in an old <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albedo_Anthropomorphics_23b1.html" title="Albedo Anthropomorphics">Albedo Anthropomorphics</a>. Here are the WikiFur pages on Rowrbrazzle<a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Rowrbrazzle" class="external autonumber" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Rowrbrazzle" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> &amp; its predecessor Vootie<a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Vootie" class="external autonumber" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Vootie" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Do you think that the furries are going to be <i>less</i> reliable about their seminal publications? It's not a catastrophe if this page is deleted; it's only pop culture stuff, &amp; already served by a more focused wikia site. But this zine Rowrbrazzle really isn't, in pop culture history, just some obscure guy in his garage. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVentifax_9bbd.html" title="User:Ventifax">Ventifax</a> 22:26, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Update</b> I have added source links, &amp; an admittedly <i>very</i> biased quote from one of the former editors explaining why he thinks <i>Rowrbrazzle</i> is culturally noteworthy.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> with fire. The only source is an external wiki with less stringent criteria for inclusion. Keeping would be a very bad precedent. Every moron who wants to get an article in wikipedia would jjust have to get it into other wiki's and cite them. <small>Note: I am not referring to anyone involved with this article or AfD as a moron, just a hypothetical future reference.</small>. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_f493.html" title="User:Jerry">Jerry</a> 22:36, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<dd>There is an additional issue here - an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_press_association.html" title="Amateur press association">amateur press association</a>, by definition, only distributes copies to its members. Therefore, it would rarely have had any press from being sold or reviewed, despite the fact that it was often viewed as <a href="http://chipotle.livejournal.com/150969.html" class="external text" title="http://chipotle.livejournal.com/150969.html" rel="nofollow">the</a> <a href="http://captainpackrat.com/furry/furry1.htm" class="external text" title="http://captainpackrat.com/furry/furry1.htm" rel="nofollow">very</a> <a href="http://ranea.org/falf/about.html" class="external text" title="http://ranea.org/falf/about.html" rel="nofollow">definition</a> of furry fandom material, or that at one point it reportedly had a <a href="http://home.kendra.com/mauser/what.html" class="external text" title="http://home.kendra.com/mauser/what.html" rel="nofollow">three-year waiting list for entry</a>. This was not some mere "comic" - the volumes ran to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.furry/browse_frm/thread/b4e3cbc3bd9de9a8/" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.furry/browse_frm/thread/b4e3cbc3bd9de9a8/" rel="nofollow">many hundred pages</a>, and I don't doubt that <i><a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Best_in_Show" class="extiw" title="wikifur:Best_in_Show">Best in Show</a></i> has some reference to it. Of course, <i>Best in Show</i> was written by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Patten_400b.html" title="Fred Patten">Fred Patten</a>, who was until recent illness the chief editor of <i>Rowrbrazzle</i>; one of the reasons he had the authority to edit that book. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 23:07, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure what additional issue we're talking about, that is if were talking about this article's compliance with wikipedia policy. I'll I see is a vanity press and a bunch of unreliable sources and reviews on blogs. Oh, and the Furry wiki, of course. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 23:46, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was replying to Ken's comment about online sources. Nobody in the furry fandom <i>needed</i> to review <i>Rowrbrazzle</i>, because it's not something that was commonly offered for sale, therefore there is a lack of published sources. In addition, everyone involved in the furry fandom knew what it was. Vanity presses don't tend to have waiting lists, nor do they run to 90+ issues of a single publication over the course of 20+ years. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 00:17, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It just occurred to me: Despite being a wiki (&amp; therefore a bit... unreliable in basic theory), WikiFur actually <i>makes sense</i> as a tertiary (maybe secondary) source in this case. The policy on using wikis is the same as the policy on using self-published sources, &amp; for the same reasons. But if you look at the reasoning in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia: Reliable sources</a>:</li>

<dd><i>They may be uninformed, misled, pushing an agenda, sloppy, relying on rumor and suspicion, or even insane; or they may be intelligent, careful people sharing their knowledge with the world. Only with independent verification by other sources not holding the same POV is it possible to determine the difference.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Rowrbrazzle is evidently still a going concern, &amp; there's a significant overlap between its membership &amp; the subculture of WikiFur. While I think that some of what WikiFur says about the significance of 'Brazzle has to be taken with a grain of salt, the wiki process at WikiFur is going to serve to bring the accuracy of their article up, <i>because of the presumed high interest in this subject by their readership.</i> In this case &amp; for <i>highly exceptional</i> reasons, <i>the wiki in question</i> is going to self-police itself enough to create a usable article (which we can edit to be more NPOV here). Ergo, we have a source right there. It's not a normal source, it's a hugely exceptional source, it's an imperfect source, but it's a workable one. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVentifax_9bbd.html" title="User:Ventifax">Ventifax</a> 05:57, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> clearly says no to wikis. If you don't like that fact then take it up on that policy's talk page. This is not that place to campaign for policy change, this is an AfD. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 06:01, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I firmly believe that rules exist for reasons, &amp; that if you find an exception where the rule can be broken while holding to the underlying principle, than it is a reasonable exception. In this case reasonable expectation of verifiability is the principle, &amp; "no wikis" is the rule. <b>To be clear: I am not campaigning for policy change. I consider this a rational exception in an exceptional case.</b> But it was a weak argument, I admit. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVentifax_9bbd.html" title="User:Ventifax">Ventifax</a></dd>

<dd>Again, no. You can tell by actually reading the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources policy</a> that the "sources" in the article do not cut the mustard. I'd also recommend you check out the <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribution policy</a>.

<li><b>Ugh</b> I really want to vote <i>keep</i> on this, because it's a long-running comic, among the longest-running of its kind, and certainly notable within its own genre niche. As much as I'd like to, though, the lack of anything resembling reliable sources is impossible to overcome, and a policy exception cannot be made just for this single article! What I don't get is that something could run that long and have that many notable people involved, but have absolutely <i>zero</i> attention from either the mainstream or comics press. There's <i>never</i> been an article or review of it in any newspaper or magazine, anywwhere? In almost 25 years of regular publishing? Hopefully sources can be found to resolve this, but if there's nothing out there to reliably base an article on, then deletion is likely the only way to go. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 14:44, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How would "the comics press" be permitted to give it attention? Periodical comics press is, ultimately, about comics for sale; it's a failure of their editorial policy to review apa's. But to extend that exclusion to our efforts when we lack the same interests is patently bizarre. <i>I suppose if we can dig up a published book (a memoir?) on indie comics &amp;/or the furry scene, that could be a source.</i> But I feel like the lines drawn between good &amp; bad source just aren't working here, by the nature of the subculture. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVentifax_9bbd.html" title="User:Ventifax">Ventifax</a> 19:58, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is kind of where I am going with my reference to <i>Furry!</i> (aka <i>Best in Show</i>). If anyone is qualified to say anything about the significance of a work to the development of furry fandom, it's probably Fred Patten. One could argue that he counts as a "well-known, professional researcher writing within his or her field of expertise." The tricky part is that he was also the editor of <i>Rowrbrazzle</i> at the time, which is part and parcel of why he's considered qualified to write about furry. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 20:06, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
