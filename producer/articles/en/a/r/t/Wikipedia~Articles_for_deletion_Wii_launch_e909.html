<p>About 99% of the information already on this page is duplicated in <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> article. The only part that contains unique information is the last section which still has some information from it in the Wii article which people are more likely to search for. I suggest <b>merging</b> the non duplicated material (not much) and <b>redirecting</b> to <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHairRef_3d4b.html" title="User:BigHairRef">BigHairRef</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHairRef_5c72.html" title="User talk:BigHairRef">Talk</a> 22:08, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Preferably most of the duplicate information at <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> should be summarized and then link to here. Eventually this will happen, as there will be far too much information at <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> to contain within a single article. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 22:37, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. For the time being, I vote for merging all information not already in the main <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> article and deleting this one. There is no need for an extra article solely about the launch. <a href="../../../g/o/z/User%7EGozel_3ad6.html" title="User:Gozel"><font color="blue"><b>Gozel</b></font></a> <a href="../../../g/o/z/User_talk%7EGozel_5bb5.html" title="User talk:Gozel"><font color="blue"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 22:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Merging the info, particularly the graphs, will cause the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> article to balloon in size. BTW, this article was nominated for deletion (under the name "<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wii_release_data_7992.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wii release data">Wii release data</a>") back in December. The result was to keep it. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust64helpin_7130.html" title="User:Just64helpin">Just64helpin</a> 23:05, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. High degree of validity. <font face="Edwardian Script ITC" size="5"><a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">Dfrg.</a><a href="../../../d/f/r/User_talk%7EDfrg.msc_187f.html" title="User talk:Dfrg.msc">msc</a></font> 23:25, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The length of a given Wikipedia entry tends to grow as people add information to it. This cannot go on forever: very long entries would cause problems. So we must move information out of entries periodically. This information should not be removed from Wikipedia: that would defeat the purpose of the contributions. So we must create new entries to hold the excised information. - from the content guideline <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html#Rationale" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary_style#Rationale</a>. The article <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_launch.html" title="Wii launch">Wii launch</a> is a good-sized article. The two tables on this article are a page long each. This article's reference section is a page long as well. Merging it into the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> article would add the much to the already large article. I think it should stay separated to keep the Wii article from growing too large. Here is a passage from <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Renominations_and_recurring_candidates" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Renominations_and_recurring_candidates</a> - In general, although there is no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations, articles that have survived a nomination for deletion should not be immediately renominated. Please ensure that nominations to delete an article which was previously voted "keep", are carefully considered, and are based upon policy. Repeated attempts to have an article deleted for non-policy reasons may sometimes be considered abuse of process and/or disruptive, and the article may be speedy kept. <a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJecowa_587b.html" title="User:Jecowa">Jecowa</a> 06:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A notable topic with wide coverage. Merging would increase the size of <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> too dramatically. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 06:25, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Xbox 360 and PS3 has one. I'll expand this article anyways (to be more like Xbox 360's) so the main Wii page won't be so cluttered. <a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDonaldsGuy_8da6.html" title="User:McDonaldsGuy">McDonaldsGuy</a> 07:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> the basics into <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a>. Specifics of launch price around the world, etc are unlikely to be particularly relevant in the long run. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 21:39, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the long run, all of this information will be relevant. It is the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, so there is no reason not to include this information. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 22:57, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Since the main article willcontinue to grow, it is appropriate to keep this separate, since it is notable in its own right.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge/redirect</b>. Most of the article is described on the Wii page (as the original editor stated). I see no "first weekends of movies" or launches of televisions or anything else, why should video games be an exception? Yes, a launch is a big deal: but Wikipedia isn't a place for articles like this. Put this on a Nintendo Wiki of some sort, not here. Merge the notable information that isn't on the Wii page already, then redirect this to the Wii page. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 07:44, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and consider splitting the main Wii article in more accessible pieces. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMausy5043_b713.html" title="User:Mausy5043">Mausy5043</a> 12:12, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The main problem is that <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_launch.html" title="Wii launch">Wii launch</a> and <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_360_launch.html" title="Xbox 360 launch">Xbox 360 launch</a> are both at AFDs with different results, while <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3_launch_ee26.html" title="PlayStation 3 launch">PlayStation 3 launch</a> is exempted. All three articles should have been grouped in a single AFD, otherwise there will be conflicts (this will be merged, and people will try to merge the Wii launch article having this as precedent, while others will try to recreate the Xbox 360 launch article because the Wii launch was kept). I suggest closing this and reopening the AFD with the three grouped as one. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:37, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with ReyBrujo, a grouped together AFD would work better. I put the Playstation 3 launch in an afd just now. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 01:02, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, as another nominator said themselves <i>"a launch is a big deal"</i>. Add onto that this is one of the biggest launches of last year, you get an article that has had massive news coverage and is highly notabile. There is a already a section on the Wii page, with a link to <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_launch.html" title="Wii launch">Wii launch</a> as <i>the main article</i>. Naturally the three newest would have articles about it, while older ones were launched in the early days of wikipedia (or even, long long before wikipedia existed). Thus this is just one reason why claiming "older consoles don't have and article for launch and thus this one shouldn't either" is not an argument at all. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 08:44, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The parent article is growing quite long. While I have no crystal ball, I do not forsee it shrinking massively in the next few years, and thus splitting it apart is a valid reason for this to exist. That said, if the parent shrinks a little, a merge is in order. —<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>χ</i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo">o</a> 09:30, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
