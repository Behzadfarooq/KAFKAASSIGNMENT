<li>Thanks for your comments. I'd still like to fight to hold onto this entry. In its current form, it is a factual description of a venture-backed company in Silicon Valley. The company has 13 patents issued and 12 pending. From the Wikipedia notability requirements for companies: "The company or corporation (is notable if it) has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself." Please see the 'notes' section of this entry. Thanks for your consideration. --<a href="../../../c/b/y/User%7ECbyeh_106a.html" title="User:Cbyeh">Cbyeh</a> 02:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Even if the company is notable but the Wikipedia article does not sufficiently bring that out. Its not enough that the company be notable, the Wikipedia article has to establish it. You indicated that the company has 13 patents, but that is not in the article so it cannot be considered in determining whether to delete the article. If you want to improve the article (or at least have the article survive this Article for Deletion), look at other Wikipedia articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Infobox_Company" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Infobox_Company" rel="nofollow">companies</a> and use those as a guide. (see, for example, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>). Basically, Wikipedia articles on corporations usually include a lead section, an Infobox_Company template, a history section, and other sections that may go into particularly notable events listed in the history section. Articles usually contain more than that. Please review <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContributing_to_Wikipedia_bc52.html#Create_new_articles" title="Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia">creating new articles.</a> To give you a time frame, this Article for Deletion (AfD) may close after five days (e.g., after 00:19, 10 January 2007). -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 03:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> - The Wikipedia article does not sufficiently bring out notability. (The article also lacks footnotes.) I reviewed the 'notes' section of this entry and the articles provided in the link do not seem to provide enough history about the company to bring out notability. They more or less relate to marketing events. A bigger problem is that the company itself does not see its history important enough to include on its own web page (see <a href="http://www.tacit.com/company/about_tacit/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tacit.com/company/about_tacit/index.html" rel="nofollow">About Tacit</a>). Since the article should be deleted as it presently exists and the company itself does not see its own history as important enough to include on its web page, the appropriate course of action appears to be <b>Delete.</b> Note to <a href="../../../c/b/y/User%7ECbyeh_106a.html" title="User:Cbyeh">user:Cbyeh</a> - If there are significant changes to the article in the next few days, please post a note on my talk page so that I may review my reasoning and vote in light of the new information.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Since the article still appears as an advertisement masquerading as an article, the article still is <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">spammy</a> as indicated in the nomination. It's no secret that Tacit Software's information gathering software is funded by the <a href="../../../i/n/-/In-Q-Tel_4b35.html" title="In-Q-Tel">CIA</a> and that Tacit Software gives away its information gathering software free to individuals. There are several third party articles that connect these two facts and conclude that the CIA can spy on individuals all over the world who use Tacit Software's freely issued, patented products. Despite my prodding, this information -- which would make the company noteworthy -- has not been added to the article. With a little help, the article could be rewritten from a neutral point of view per Wikipedia policy and thus I added the advert tag and have changed my vote to <b>Keep.</b> -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 19:36, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks again for your comments. Articles about a company that are not written by the company itself cannot be considered to be press releases. You may perceive some articles to be favorable to the company, but that is not because the company wrote them. Especially in the case of major news organizations, articles about companies are written from the unbiased, individual perspective of each reporter as formed by interviews with the company, its customers and independent analysts. Not all of these points of view are necessarily favorable to the company.

<li>To <a href="../../../c/b/y/User%7ECbyeh_106a.html" title="User:Cbyeh">Cbyeh</a> - Here is what the article reads so far: <i>The company was founded. The company’s first product was released. Tacit released its second product. Tacit released its third product.</i> Please note that every company has a founding date and just about all of them release some product. The article essentially is saying that there is nothing notable enough about Tacit to include in the Wikipedia article but if you are interested in learning more, here an a lot of external links. <s>The <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> requirement ensures that there exists <u>enough</u> source material to write a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, encyclopedic article about the topic.

<li>To <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> - thanks for your help and for your comments. I have modified the content of the page significantly so that it better states (and supports) the notability requirements (and hopefully the neutrality requirements) the community has cited in this dialog. Let me address your more personal questions. This is indeed my first posting in Wikipedia. Tacit Software is a company that has recently come under much more public scrutiny because of a new product it just launched. My goal for posting in Wikipedia is to provide a fact-based description of the company and its technologies so users can learn more in a neutral environment. If the article violates Wikipedia notability and neutrality rules, I think that's due to the fact that I'm a Wikipedia novice and not that the company itself is not notable. As always, your comments are welcome. I am particularly interested in community feedback on cleanup - what specifically should be worked on? --<a href="../../../c/b/y/User%7ECbyeh_106a.html" title="User:Cbyeh">Cbyeh</a> 02:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Cbyeh - The cleaned up article looks even more like an advertisement for the company's products, which makes it even a stronger deletion candidate (see <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html#Companies" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP#Companies</a>). Didn't anything notable happen to the company or was caused by the company between 1997 and 2007? Review this <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Tacit+Software&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Tacit+Software&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for notable items to include in the article. Did the company receive any legitimate awards for notable merit? Did Tacit best other companies to win any awards? A company having products or patents is not notable. Did the ActiveNet or illumio products make a notable difference in the companies that purchased the product? Was there some notable event in the development of these products? Were any of the Tacit patents subject to a notable legal fight? Did Tacit buy any of the patents for a huge amount of money? As for further clean up, you should review the cited external links for facts to include in the article and add the link as a footnote and remove it from the external links. - <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 06:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is more of a fact based environment rather than a neutral environment. You might want to include in the article information about the public scrutiny of Tacit Software that you mention above. I'm sure it will eventually be added and, if you don't do it yourself, you might not like the results. Also, I think it's great that you would like to contribute to Wikipedia beyond this one article.
