<li>That they have 146,849 articles, and yet somehow managed to overlook this particular snack food.

<li>They also didn't have an article for <a href="../../../k/y/a/Kyabetsu_Taro_69cc.html" title="Kyabetsu Taro">Kyabetsu Taro</a> until yesterday. After I translated it into Japanese it was put on <a href="../../../../ja/%E3%82%A6/%E3%82%A3/%E3%82%AD/Wikipedia%7E%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AD%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AB_%E9%A3%9F_%E6%96%B0%E7%9D%80%E9%A0%85%E7%9B%AE_e929.html" class="extiw" title="ja:Wikipedia:ウィキポータル_食/新着項目">a list of "new food-related articles"</a>. Maybe I'll do "Don Tacos" next. Another one today, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_map_symbols.html" title="Japanese map symbols">Japanese map symbols</a>, was not on Japanese wikipedia either, it was a red link on one of their pages, and I translated that into Japanese (it's since been heavily added to by another editor). If you'll look on my user page under "Japanese Wikipedia" you'll find two more examples of articles about Japanese language which didn't exist there until I translated them. As a matter of fact, several of the articles on Japanese language here in the English wikipedia are a lot more comprehensive than theirs. So, it seems, strange but true, Japanese Wikipedia is not yet the fount of all human knowledge. But anyway, thankyou for your comments. --DannyWilde 06:08, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why look, THAT article is up for deletion also. And the fact that <i>you</i> added it to the Japanese Wikipedia means nothing -- hell, it means less than nothing; having to gin up a rationale doesn't exactly help your case. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:21, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>I'm very sorry, but which article are you referring to? I have just checked the Japanese version of kyabetsu taro, the Japanese map symbols article, and the English map symbols article, and none of them have notices saying they are being put up for deletion. Is there something I'm not aware of? --DannyWilde 02:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Without putting words in DannyWilde's mouth, I think the point he was making is that using the presence of an article in the Japanese Wikipedia as a litmus test for cultural validity in Japan is not foolproof. Otherwise, we have to say that <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> is not culturally significant in Japan, since it doesn't have a page of its own in Japanese (but it does in several other languages -- are you planning an AFD for those too?). In Japanese, it is relegated to a catalog list of other pokemon characters <a href="../../../../ja/%E3%83%9D/%E3%82%B1/%E3%83%A2/%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7.html" class="extiw" title="ja:ポケモン一覧">ja:ポケモン一覧</a> from a redirect. I'm not against merging the snack foods in a similar way (or, the plethora of pokeon characters that populate the en wikipedia), but I am against deleting an article with &gt;30k google hits. - <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 08:19, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, exactly. For example, "<a href="../../../e/d/o/Edomoji.html" title="Edomoji">edomoji</a>", a type of Japanese lettering used in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo.html" title="Sumo">sumo</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabuki.html" title="Kabuki">kabuki</a>, and other Japanese arts like <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rakugo.html" title="Rakugo">rakugo</a>, was not in the Japanese wikipedia until I translated it. There were just some red links. <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edomoji.html" title="Edomoji">Edomoji</a> are undoubtedly culturally significant by any standards, and they just weren't there at all. Absolutely nothing existed in the Japanese wikipedia until I made that article. Whether it's in the Japanese wikipedia or not means nothing, really, since there is no guarantee that the Japanese wikipedia is comprehensive. I suppose Dforest would suggest deleting the edomoji article from the English wikipedia too, if he can't find enough links about edomoji in English on Google. --DannyWilde 02:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You, and others, might find out better if stubs like this one were moved to an article about Japanese snack food.

<ul>
<li>I agree that an article on Japanese snack foods would be a good idea (if it doesn't exist somewhere already), but how can you advocate either <b>deleting</b> stubs that have information of interest or <b>merging</b> the information with <i>an article that doesn't exist</i>? How can you merge one thing with nothing? Sounds the same as deleting it to me. If you're so concerned about the creation of an article on Japanese snack foods, why don't you create one yourself? That would be more productive than holding these votes where there is an obvious interest in the articles, as the vote count suggests. <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECES_5c5c.html" title="User:CES">CES</a> 11:47, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Right now there is very little to merge. Perhaps you could suggest a place?

<li><b>Comment</b>: I live in Tokyo, and, to be blunt, I find this whole discussion bordering on the insane -- <i>There is no cultural significance to this <b>particular</b> snack food,</i> any more so than Belgian or Dutch Doritos knock-offs (and yes, they exist and I've seen those).

<dd>I have no idea whether Don Tacos are culturally significant. If you are going to delete or merge articles based on their "lack of cultural significance", good luck, you only have about 700,000 articles on Wikipedia to delete until you are finished. Let's hope no one makes anymore articles about snacks in the meantime, otherwise you certainly will have your hands full. --DannyWilde 06:08, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

So your <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dichotomy.html" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a> is EVERYTHING is culturally significant or NOTHING is culturally significant?

<dd>As a matter of fact it was my poor attempt at humour. I'm sorry you don't like the article and feel it is not useful to you, but I think that this information could be useful for other people. It would be a shame if the information were deleted, I think. It could be merged into a larger article, perhaps, but I don't see what harm it is doing as a small article in its own right. Quite often, merged articles end up being rather unreadable and unfocused. Take a look at <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_of_the_Apes_683c.html" title="Planet of the Apes">Planet of the Apes</a>, where the article tries to extensively describe a novel and a rather different film in the same page, with rather poor consequences for readability and focus. As for significance, Wikipedia contains things like individual articles for every single episode of the Simpsons cartoons, individual articles on particular trees, and individual articles on streets and roads in cities. I don't see why it can't tolerate a few dozen articles on the snack foods eaten by a country with a population of 120 million people. Most of the Japanese snacks don't have particularly much in common with each other anyway. The <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagashi.html" title="Wagashi">wagashi</a> article already deals with traditional Japanese sweets, and then there are individual pages for most of the wagashi anyway. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japanese_snack_food_74e0.html" title="List of Japanese snack food">List of Japanese snack foods</a> could be extended into a longer article if there is some common point in all of these snacks which needs to be dealt with together I suppose. Anyway I say to people who are interested in doing that, why not go and edit the relevant pages, instead of discussing doing it here? Actions speak louder etc. --DannyWilde 02:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
