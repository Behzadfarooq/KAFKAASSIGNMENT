<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. Vociferousness of argument does not equal strength of argument. The raw vote total was 12-6 Delete, on top of which the Delete side had much the stronger arguments. Let us all recall that Wikipedia is basically a tool for scholarship, education, and research. No evidence has been presented that inclusion of this article would markedly enhance the encyclopedia. It appears from the one of the stronger Keep arguments is that she appears in her own frequently-aired TV commercials. As one contributor commented, "<i>I have seen her commercials on TV all the time, she is very notable."</i> That is not a strong argument. The remainder of the Keep arguments are not much stronger. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: It now comes to my attention that this AfD had been spammed trolling for Delete votes. These votes would not have changed my decision (which is mostly based on strength of arguments) but they did change the raw vote totals. If this AfD close is brought to deletion review, commentors might want to take notice of the tainted nature of the discussion. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:54, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> she is a notable person, and before claiming she is unnotable people should read the discussion about this article in the deletion review where consensus was to charge the article's title. There are nearly 10,000 results in google for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22roni+lynn+deutch%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search|" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22roni+lynn+deutch%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search|" rel="nofollow">roni lynn deutch</a>" and thousands more if you look at the results for common mispelt names.

<ul>
<li>Looking through the first 5 pages of google hits, I don't see any that are about the <b>person</b>; many appear to be ads for businesses she's been involved with. Others are ads for products from those businesses. I don't see any specific bullet of the bio standards that she would "easily pass". Perhaps you could point it out and give the reference that you feel satisfies it... <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a> 03:38, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would have to disagree with you on this one. When looking at the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22roni+lynn+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22roni+lynn+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for "Roni Lynn Deutch" the second and third results are both from rip off report.com which both mention her as a person multiple times. Also many of the results are from law related websites which mention her. This goes towards one of the BIO standards, "other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field." And try googling <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22roni+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22roni+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">Roni Deutch</a>, you will see many results in the first five pages mentioning her as a person. I would think that any result on google mentioning her goes towards fulfilling this requirement. Because of her aggressive television commercials she has gained some popularity on the internet, she is mentioned in many blogs and forums. She even has an entry at <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Deutch" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Deutch" rel="nofollow">Urban Dictionary</a> about her, and there is even some one who has started their own <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ricearoni5/" class="external text" title="http://www.freewebs.com/ricearoni5/" rel="nofollow">Roni Deutch Fansite</a> Also, if you would have read the articles entry in DRV, you would see that her name is very commonly misspelt. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutsch%22&amp;spell=1" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutsch%22&amp;spell=1" rel="nofollow">Ronnie Deutsch</a> yeilds over 13,000 google results (many of which mention her as a person), and there are many other spellings that also return many results, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22roni+deutsch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22roni+deutsch%22" rel="nofollow">Roni Deutsch</a> - 1870, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">ronnie deutsch</a> - 938, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">ronnie deutch</a> - 938, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronni+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronni+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">ronni deutch</a> - 759. I think that any mention of her online goes towards proving that her work is widely recognized, which is one of the requirements in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Also, look down to my comment on news articles, I think her inclusion in those articles (specifically the one from AP) help to fulfil another requirement "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)" I know that 10 news articles is not a massive amount, but I don't have any, neither does my neighbor, neither do my coworkers... I think that 10 articles would qualify as multiple sroties. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewguiver_0418.html" title="User:Mathewguiver">mathewguiver</a> 15:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Here's one: <i>Apparently super TV tax attorney Roni Deutch can settle your tax debt and civil penalties for pennies on the dollar.

<li><b>comment</b> - I would just like to point out that your numbers here are slightly incorrect. Actually a Newsbank search for Roni Deutch brings up 17 results, 10 of which I would say are relevent to Roni Deutch. Some of which include articles that discuss free seminars which she spoke at, some are from 1986 and discuss her athletic accomplishments, one talks about her company occupying a new office, one is about a lawsuit in NY that was pending against her, and one is about her company's halloween party. In regards to all but one article being for sac/fresno, actually one of the articles is from San Jose and another was an AP article meaning it was featured in news outlets across the country such as <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/060606/no_tax_help.html?.v=1" class="external text" title="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/060606/no_tax_help.html?.v=1" rel="nofollow">yahoo</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewguiver_0418.html" title="User:Mathewguiver">mathewguiver</a> 14:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Now I get 9 total. I corrected the number above. Between 1986 and 2006, that still amounts to nothing for a supposed TV personality. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 16:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There was never any claim that Roni Deutch is a "television personality." She is a tax attorney who is the head of a nationally recognized law firm. She is a busines professional and should be held to the bio standards for business professionals, not television stars. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says that "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." It says the person needs to be the subject of <b>multiple articles,</b> it does not say they need to have a hundred articles, infact it does not mention a number at all. I think that having 10 articles written about a busines professional could make them notable. I would also like to mention the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pokémon_test" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pokémon_test" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Test</a>and that everything included in wikipedia does not need hundreds of news articles. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewguiver_0418.html" title="User:Mathewguiver">mathewguiver</a> 16:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's perfectly up the discretion of the editors to assess the <i><b>quality</b></i> of the news items and draw their own conclusions about notability. I find them partly trivial, partly passing mentions, and all local.

<li>I hate to be argumentative, but I do want to point out that all of the articles are not local. First of all Fresno and Sacramento are not the same city, they are three hours apart. And in addition to the articles in sacramento and fresno, there are ones from the associated press, San Jose Mercury News (CA) and The Herald News (Joliet, IL). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewguiver_0418.html" title="User:Mathewguiver">mathewguiver</a> 19:38, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That is 100% incorrect. The article says that American Tax Relief has an F grade with the Better Business Bureau. The article does not mention Roni's firm's record. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewguiver_0418.html" title="User:Mathewguiver">mathewguiver</a> 23:08, 30 August 2006 (UTC).

<li>Oh, I misread that. I thought American Tax Relief was the name of her firm since it uses the pennies for a dollar slogan. So that's another passing mention then.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Wow, this one must have slipped through the cracks. It's not an advertisement--she's in advertisements. If it acts like an advertisement, well, then, edit the article. But she's on tv all the time, and we have to remember, as wikipedia is not paper, the quantifiable accountability we have for our edits. Almost no one has heard of a British law from 1850 banning segways on roads, but millions upon millions have heard of Roni Deutch in the English speaking world, in 30 second segments where she is the only speaker, speaking directly to the audience. People wanting to find out more about her, for example, to buy one of the products she is advertising, might very well indeed go to wikipedia to look up her rating in the BBB, as is mentioned here, or just some of the wider summary of what she's done. The article has to get better at doing those things--but I don't see anything horrible that suggests deletion is warranted here.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:51, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I am an attorney and CPA and I have been in tax practice for over twenty years. I'm sure Ms. Roni Deutch is a fine tax lawyer and a fine person, but in the world of tax law she is simply not notable. I am straining to think if I had ever heard of her before I came across this. I could make a list of notable U.S. tax lawyers based on pre-set criteria, but I can't think of how or why she would be on the list. Nothing personal -- also I would in no way make the list either. The article is an advertisement for her. Not encyclopedic, and the subject is in my opinion non-notable.

<li>PS: For what it's worth, a few minutes ago I ran separate searches on "Roni Deutch" and "Roni Lynn Deutch" on the <b>CCH Tax Research Network</b> website (it's a "pay" website used by tax lawyers, CPAs, etc.) including the text of nearly every reported Federal court decision (U.S. Supreme Court, the appeals courts, the district courts, bankruptcy courts, and U.S. Tax Court) involving Federal taxation since the year 1913. Both searches returned zero hits. That doesn't mean she's never been to court in a tax case (and most tax law practice is outside of court anyway), but it should at least be taken into account to the extent that she is supposedly "notable for" being a tax lawyer.

<li>Roni Deutch is a tax attorney, but she is the head of a national company (similarly to <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Hewitt_e726.html" title="Jackson Hewitt">Jackson Hewitt</a> and JK Harris &amp; Company, LLC) with many lawyers working under her. The reason ther should be an article on this site is because she is the head of Roni Deutch, a Professional Tax Corporation that represents thousands of people per year, and has tons of ads on television. Millions of people know who she is, google results for her name variations yeild thousands and thousands of results. She is mentioned and talked about in hundreds if not thousands of forums and blogs. And remember that just because you havent heard of her does not mean that there aren't people who have.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewguiver_0418.html" title="User:Mathewguiver">mathewguiver</a> 18:48, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, let me see if I have this straight. Because Roni Deutch is the head of an eponymous "professional tax corporation" that supposedly "represents thousands of people per year" and has purchased "tons" of TV ads, and supposedly "millions" of people know who she is (because of those tons of TV ads she bought), and because there are "thousands and thousands" of google hits for her, and she is supposedly talked about in "hundreds if not thousands of forums and blogs" -- that means there should be an <i>encyclopedia article</i> about her?

<li>I would have to think that yes, being the founder and head of a largely known company does warrent an inclusion in wikipedia. Again, just because you haven't heard of some one does not make them non notable, there are obviously plently people who know who she is... Per [WP:BIO] "other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse)." I would think that having thousands of google hits helps show that her work is widely recognized. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewguiver_0418.html" title="User:Mathewguiver">mathewguiver</a> 20:36, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>NoelleWiley makes a good point about the article on JK Harris &amp; Company, LLC. Looks like blatant advertising and copyright violation as well. The verbiage in that article was apparently copied and pasted from a website for JK Harris &amp; Company! And you have seen her commercials on TV all the time -- so therefore she is <i>notable</i> for purposes of an <i>encyclopedia article</i>?

<p>Dear NoelleWiley: At the expense of spelling out what is stunningly obvious to everyone, you stated: "I have seen her commercials on TV all the time, she is very notable." You yourself mentioned the "commercials." Sorry, but a reasonable person will infer that you are implying that her <i>being in a commercial</i> made her <i>worthy of any encyclopedia article</i>.

<p>Dear fellow editors: Actually, the language at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) <b>and</b> who are likely to become a part of the <b>enduring historical record of that field</b>" (emphasis added). Are we seriously trying to contend that Ms. Deutch's work is "widely recognized" in the field of tax law merely because she advertises? Who is "recognizing" her legal work? Legal experts and scholars, or the people who watch her commercials on daytime TV? Please show us where or how her work is part of the "enduring historical record" in the field of U.S. law, or U.S. tax law. <i>Advertising oneself on television</i>? Under that line of reasoning <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Jr._444e.html" title="Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.</a> could have rated a Wikipedia article had he never served as a Federal judge or written the scholarly articles and books he wrote, and had simply <i>advertised on television</i> (had TV existed back then). It seems we are saying that what is being recognized is not her legal work, not her contribution to legal scholarship or legal history, but rather the fact that she advertises and is <i>well known because she advertises</i>.
