<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Millions of people did <i>not</i> die in the holocaust. This list is far too vague by nature and - at worst - can end up being a list of almost everyone in the world who was alive in 1946. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a>
<ul>
<li>How is this vague? Merely being alive in 1946 doesn't mean you survived the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> – managing to survive encarceration in a Nazi concentration camp, or to escape from <s>Germany</s> Nazi-controlled territory before you were so imprisoned <i>does</i>. Of those that did, some are notable, and we have an interesting list. <b>Keep</b>, but suggest a move to List of notable Holocaust survivors. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 03:01, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>It is vague</b> in that it is <i>not</i> restricted to those who 'survived a Nazi concentration camp' (if it were, the title should say so) nor is it simply those who managed 'to escape from Germany before you were so imprisoned'. Even if those definitions are taken, it is questionable as to whether someone who was not incarcerated would have been. Why only restrict it to anyone who escaped from Germany - what about those who escaped from other countries the Nazis overran during 30s and 40s? Why only those who escaped from countries that <i>were</i> overrun - what about countries that <i>would</i> have been overrun if the Nazis had not been stopped by force (UK, Africa, Russia, Ireland, Iceland, Canada, USA ...)? --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 12:41, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Alright, let's change Germany to <i>Nazi-controlled territories</i>, which is what I should have said in the first place. Regarding countries that <i>would</i> have been overrun, that's absurd. The Nazis had a clearly definable sphere of influence during WW2, at least AFAIK. We could play this what-if game with just about any historical event to make any discussion vague and pointless. It seems to me your beef is with the title of the article and not the content. To me, "Holocaust survivors" connotes a clear meaning; to you, it does not. Perhaps a compromise would be to include a detailed explanation for criteria for inclusion in the list at the beginning of the article. List of people who escaped Nazi concentration camps, managed to survive in such camps long enough to await rescue by Allied forces, or were able to escape Nazi-controlled territory before being encarcerated is a rather unwieldy article title.
<ul>
<li>LOL, I agree with the unwieldiness of that title! However, I still think that including those who were <i>able to escape Nazi-controlled territory before being incarcerated</i> is far too vague and could include almost anyone who got out of the way - since they were almost targets just <i>because</i> they wanted to escape. Such a definition would include, for example, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> and dozens (hundreds?) of other 'notable' scientists as well as thousands of political, military and society 'notables'. The Nazis sphere of influence is not so clear to define in terms of Holocaust implementation: in some regions (e.g. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Islands_7556.html" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a>), they never quite achieved the political/military/social environment necessary even though they 'occupied' the land while in other areas (e.g. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and to some extent <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>) they had quite a lot of influence without occupation. This is not to say, however, that there is not a generally-accepted map of what territories were at some time Nazi-controlled. I also see no moral, ethical or encyclopedic reason to include those who avoided incarceration by fleeing and exclude those who avoided incarceration by fighting. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 15:06, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll defer to your greater knowledge of the general topic. Would a list limited to those that survived and/or escaped from concentration camps be more keep-able? I would imagine that the list would be mostly populated with people of this sort, anyway (although I do note that at least one person on the list currently was never sent to a camp). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 15:42, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A list of people who were once in a concentration camp and survived would be restricted and have some meaning. In this case, it should be <b>Renamed and edited</b> to comply: I would suggest the name of "List of notable people to survive a Nazi Concentration Camp." --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 23:51, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your point about playing the what-if game with historical events is, to me, exactly WHY to <b>delete</b> rather than keep this list. This list IS about 'what if': <i>what if</i> these people had been captured, <i>maybe</i> they would be dead. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 15:10, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm really not getting your point here. If, say, Mr. Jones <i>hadn't</i> gotten on your hypothetical sinking ship from your analogy below, <i>maybe</i> he wouldn't have drowned. The fact is, though, he's (hypothetically) dead, and that other people who were not on the ship, but <i>potentially</i> could have been on it, are not (leaving aside those that <i>were</i> on the ship but managed to not die). We can make a list of those that survived and one of those that died; what happened before the ship sank is rather irrelevant. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 15:42, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But presumably Mr Jones DID get on the ship. From the single, identifiable incident he can be said to have survived or died <i>as fact</i>. The Holocaust is not such a single, identifiable incident. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 23:51, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The discussion at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_Holocaust_victims_7b2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Holocaust victims">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Holocaust victims</a> is probably relevant here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:51, 2005 Jun 2 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is partially relevant but at least someone who died as a direct result of Nazi activity is much more identifiable, with the only possible grey area being whether that was the cause of death (for example, there were no doubt a few people incarcerated who were already near dead from other causes). --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 12:41, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - a Holocaust survivor is surely not anyone who happened not to die during WWII, and the list is restricted to famous (agreed that it should be moved to "notable") persons. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 04:15, 2005 Jun 2 (UTC)</li>
<li>When I originally saw this article a couple of hours ago I moved it to its current title from "List of holocaust survivors" but I agree that notable is a better word. <b>Keep</b>. Also, <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a>, isn't it inherently obvious that a list of survivors of a horrific event is only going to be comprised of people who were directly affected by that event? --<i><a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarfooz_0c12.html" title="User:Barfooz"><font color="#0355B9"><b>Barfooz</b></font></a></i> <a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarfooz_1a6c.html" title="User talk:Barfooz"><font size="1" color="#76A67D">(talk)</font></a> 04:39, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, clearly not obvious - see above comment by AиDя01D. Surviving the Holocaust isn't like surviving a sinking ship, where you are either on the ship at the time or not. The Holocaust was a political/social program intended to cover all parts of the world that Nazis intended to take over. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 12:41, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>At least this definition of "notable" or "famous" (whichever) will keep the list down but my objection to this list still stands in that identifying someone as a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Holocaust_victims_ffa0.html" title="List of famous Holocaust victims">one-time member of a concentration camp</a> is one thing but identifying them as having <i>not</i> been put to death by the Nazis is a totally different issue. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Milnes_7129.html" title="User:Douglas Milnes">Douglas</a> 12:41, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. this list will never be hard to maintain, because the "famous," or if you prefer "notable," qualifier will always limit it to a relatively small number regardless of how one defines "Holocaust" and "survivor." <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarmeld1_1b08.html" title="User:Carmeld1">carmeld1</a> 00:11, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> my personal definition of a holocaust victim would not require having been in or died in the camps, that is, both <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Benjamin_6f1b.html" title="Walter Benjamin">Walter Benjamin</a> should be included (as they are on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Holocaust_victims_ffa0.html" title="List of famous Holocaust victims">List of famous Holocaust victims</a>). even if benjamin (suicide at a checkpoint) is debatable, i think most people would consider frank a holocaust victim.

<li>Agreed. One of the minor difficulties I see with this list that I've not highlighted is that people such as Albert Einstein, T.Wonja Michael, Anne Frank etc. belong on both the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Holocaust_victims_ffa0.html" title="List of famous Holocaust victims">List of famous Holocaust victims</a> and this list.

<li><b>Delete</b> "Famous" is an inherently POV term, and even notability is arguable.

<li>"Notability" is just the criterion for having an article on a particular subject in Wikipedia.
