	    <p>'Mark Stephenson <b>(born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria.html" title="Victoria">Victoria</a>, British Columbia) is currently a student at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Victoria_4600.html" title="University of Victoria">University of Victoria</a>. Mark is a singer of pop songs that have become quite well known on Vancouver Island. Mark's breakthrough was a one man cover of "I Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys which received heavy airplay on 98.5 The Ocean and 107.3 Kool FM in the Summer of 2005. In the Autumn of 2005 Mark later released an original work called My Love (Is Real) that surpassed the success of I Want It That Way. My Love (Is Real) even broke into the countdowns of these stations reaching #14 on The Ocean and #11 on Kool FM. In March 2006 Mark Stephenson released a single called "Freedom". A self titled EP is expected in June 2006.</b></p>
<p>Here's a brief biography of Mark: Mark Stephenson is currently a student at the University of Victoria. Mark's noticeable characteristics how his red hair, 6'3" height and the lack of his Globe CT IV shoe. Mark is a strong supporter of the Vancouver Canucks. As a child, Mark attended Hillcrest Elementary School in the heart of the Hillcrest Ghetto. It was a tough thug life for Mark Stephenson, but this only made him stronger.He continues to campaign for the rights to fake D&amp;G for all. As a child Mark played several sports including Soccer (for the elite Gordon Head Soccer Association), Basketball and Baseball. After the 7th Grade, Mark attended Arbutus Junior Secondary School which was much safer than the Hillcreft Ghetto. At this time, Mark also took up racquet sports such as Tennis and Badminton. And cheerleading. In the 9th Grade Mark began his long running facination with Andrew's mother. Also in this grade, Mark was the city champion for Badminton. The following year Mark went to the Special Olympics. During this time he fell behind in remedial math. He was lucky that Andrew was so willing to help him catch up. Mark continued to play Arbutus Basketball in Grade 10. It should be noted that Arbutus's team name was the Aardvarks for most teams which does not strike fear into any opponent. They also had all rainbow uniforms that did not help either. Grade 11 meant that yet again young Mark would have to change schools. This time it was to attend the even better school, Mount Douglas that had a much better mascot (Ram) and more gay uniform colours. At this time, Mark discovered the sport of rowing. It highly likely that Mark joined rowing largely because of the spandex shorts that many female participants wear. In fact, in the 12th Grade, Mark met a long term girlfriend, Nick Carter, through rowing. At Mount Doug Mark was also introduced to the sport of curling. While he was far from being a Team Hall back up, he and Andrew attempted to revolutionize the sport by incorporating radio communications. This experiment was largely a failure. Someday Mark would learn that the true reason that one should curl is because of the beer (preferably Canadian brewed) closely associated with the sport. A notable event of Mark Stephenson's grad night is the drink he choose to consume. It was called "Bols Blue" and in fact was blue. Mark enjoyed asking the obvious question of "Is my tongue blue?" Next for Mark was the University of Victoria. While attending UVic, Mark was a member of the rowing team for a time. Mark did not stick to this however because he did not enjoy the lack of sleep that came with being on the team and the fact that University level women rowers were looking more like men than Mark. In the second year at the University of Victoria Mark was heavily involved in the Intramural sports program. He was signed to Permafrost in both Outdoor Soccer and Basketball. In Soccer, Mark was Permafrost's All Star retard. While Permafrost has yet to win a championship, they still were quite successful. In December 2004, Mark won an iPod from Pepsi. At this time Mark's Jukebox was no longer useful. Mark's iPod was later upgraded to a 5th Generation model in early 2006. During a party in August 2005, an infamous Mark moment occurred. While at the party, an unknown (likely drunk) individual removed Mark Stephenson's Globe shoe from the premises. As a result, Mark now only has one shoe of the pair. In a similar incident in late December 2005, Mark yet again had one shoe go missing at a party. Ironically, this shoe was returned to Mark a few days later wrapped up. An earlier incident at the same party location did not involve Mark's shoe, but rather a Van that looked like his. Mark once drove a very crappy VW van. Believing that a VW near the party was a Mark's, a certain Mormon convert decided it would be funny to do minor vandelism to it. What are the odds of two Vans looking so similar? Apparently better than thought. After two years at the University of Victoria, Mark finally decided he would pursue a degree in Economics. This pursuit will be relocated to Australia sometime in 2006.
