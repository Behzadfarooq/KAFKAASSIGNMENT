<li><b>Keep</b> I'm working my way through the article and trying to edit it to be more encyclopedic in nature and also show that Jesse has a bigger following in his own right than was initially laid out in the entry - i.e. his fan site that has only been going since March this year has had 1.4million page views in the past month (I've included links to references) - and that Shades of Gray is just a part of his works (all be it a major one), and not just his sole achievement. Please bear with me, today is my first attempt at editing a wiki&#160;:) 81.79.54.144 07:10, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am the creator and author of the Jeskid Fan Club website. Jesse brings more than the sum of his movies and online TV, obviously enough to warrant the creation and participation of a full scale fan community. I personally put hundreds of hours into the coding of the website alone, which in itself speaks to who and what Jesse stands for. There unfortunately are some somewhat disgruntled and jealous would-be writers, actors and film makers who have had little success and therefore feel the need to tear down something which is more than they could have hoped for - not to mention, we have come across some of these individuals who have made it their purpose in life to bring an end to Jesse's growing following - "just because". Since going live with the website in march, it has grown at a steady pace of 100+ members per week, and participation includes over 75% of all registered members on a daily basis - and half of that 75% participates every few hours. The fan site alone is anticipating a 2 million page view month, which includes nearly 450,000 site hits. This is, as I mentioned, only about a months time of being live. The most recent addition to JeskidTV, "SPAM" episode, sparked the same flurry of "water cooler" conversation that some better known network programming would. The idea that Jesse Coweel or his best known film Shades of Gray should be deleted in ridiculous, and I would encourage the individuals who requested such action be restricted and/or ignored for future deletion "requests". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.64.255.203 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.64.255.203_032f.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.64.255.203">contribs</a>) .</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I am not a "jealous would-be writer", nor have I made it my purpose in life to make Jesse fail. I'm just another editor. Like Jmh123 said, it seems GrahamGRA registered here with the sole intent of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrahamGRA_57c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrahamGRA">promoting Jesse</a>. I also took into account (but forgot to mention in the nomination) the fact that Cowell <a href="../../../l/e/g/User_talk%7ELegacystar3233_32fc.html#Jesse_.22Jeskid.22_Cowell" title="User talk:Legacystar3233">previously created an article on himself</a>. Do you have an independant source for those pageviews? I'm not trying to say that you are lying, far from it. What I mean is, I could just write something on my own site and make a claim, you know what I mean? Oh yeah, I was just checking the fansite, and noticed <a href="http://www.jeskidfanclub.com/forums/thread_view.asp?topicid=111&amp;forumid=1" class="external text" title="http://www.jeskidfanclub.com/forums/thread_view.asp?topicid=111&amp;forumid=1" rel="nofollow">this</a> encouraging people to "GO forth to Wikkipedia and FUCK THEM UP!"

<li><b>Comment</b> You yourself clearly are showing prejudice, you do not check your facts before posting suggesting that Jeskid has few Google hits. When infact he has over 30 thousand. You appear to take every attempt to sabotage this article dispite the obvious fact that Jeskid has a large respectable fanbase. <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_Pwnage_9d82.html" title="Pure Pwnage">Pure Pwnage</a> has a simmilar fanbase to Jeskid, but it's article is untouched. I feel you do not show considderation as to when credit is due, since Shades of Gray is only a small fraction on work that has been produced by Jesse. As far as Jesse Cowell and wikipedia themself go, he uploaded one image, there is no big deal in that. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by GrahamGRA (<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrahamGRA_8e03.html" title="User talk:GrahamGRA">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrahamGRA_57c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrahamGRA">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. People here are not recommending deletion because they have some vendetta against Jesse; they are doing so because they feel that the article does not or cannot meet Wikipedia's standards for verifiability. —&#160;<a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 01:21, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Not all of Jeskid's fame comes from his Shades of Gray work. JeskidTV is watched largely by his fan base as well, and his Fan Club website and chat are extremely popular. Sticking that all under SoG would be wrong, because they're not all related. He should have his own individual entry, where you can reach all of his works. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.81.79.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.81.79.187_0d1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.81.79.187">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The only suggestion is to edit the article to make it more encyclopedic. A seperate article should be made for Jeskid TV work since his work on Shades of Gray (film) has one. There's about 15 hours of Jeskid TV content on <a href="http://www.jeskidtv.com" class="external free" title="http://www.jeskidtv.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jeskidtv.com</a>. Q&amp;A articles reviews and director bios found within google searches when searching <b>Jesse Cowell</b> and <b>Jeskid</b>. The Google results tally over 30,000+. The Fansite has many numerous active accounts. Seems notable enough. --Microbefox 22:17, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The difference between <i>Shades of Gray</i> and <i>Jeskid TV</i> is that the former has been reviewed by independent organizations/critics and has won some well-known awards. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but <i>Jeskid TV</i> has not. Most of the third-party reliable (non-forum, non-blog) hits are about Jesse's role in <i>Shades of Gray</i>, right? The fact that Jesse has a fan club is great and all, but such doesn't contribute much to verifiable encyclopedic content because of the inherent bias involved. A Google search for <tt>+Jeskid -forum -wikipedia</tt> yields <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2BJeskid+-forum+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2BJeskid+-forum+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">517 results</a>, which seems to indicate that most of Jesse's popularity stems from forum communities, which are not citeable as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. If someone can provide some reliable third-party sources for Jesse's popularity/notability outside of <i>Shades of Gray</i>, I'd happily reconsider. —&#160;<a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 01:21, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
