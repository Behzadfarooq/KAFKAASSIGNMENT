<li><b>Keep</b> Despite precedence, this list does not seem way too trivial. It's not every other actor who gets to play the role of the President of US. Well, the list is virtually unsourced. If there is some doubtful entry, that may be questioned. But the list apparently seems to be well researched. Yes, Wikipedia is not a collection of obscure trivia. But this is not exactly <i>obscure</i>. --<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayan</a> (<a href="../../../d/w/a/User_talk%7EDwaipayanc_1f27.html" title="User talk:Dwaipayanc">talk</a>) 17:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not every actor who gets to play the role of Hamlet either, and in fact there are numerous sources that name Hamlet as the definitive role that an actor can play.

<li><a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a> is also not a particularly persuasive argument. One could justify a list of any sort of actor by role by saying "it's not any actor who gets to play..." whoever, including "it's not every actor who gets to play a guy named Bob" and "it's not every actor who gets to play a government employee" and both are every bit as objectively true as saying it about "the President."

<li>Taking cue from your own opinion this list seems even more significant. You have told <i>"it's not every actor who gets to play a guy named Bob"</i>. Correct. And bye the way, who is Bob? On the other hand, US President is someone. That's why this list is significant. Also, as <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> has stated below, <i>anyone who wants to study how</i> various actors have approached the role <i>of presidents, real and fictional, would find this list .... not insignificant at all</i>. As <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> has stated below, this list would be a sound candidate for a featured list, provided some more works are put into it, necessary references provided and lead is adequately expanded.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Dwaipayan. You certainly wouldn't want a list of "Actors who have played people named Bob" or "Actors who played government employees," but President of the U.S. is obviously more remarkable than that. Someone has put a tremendous amount of work into organizing this list. It's well done per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, good for information, navigation. It's also discriminate, verifiable. Not a lot of movies actually have the president as a character, so it's not impossible to keep on top of. Frankly, this list would be a sound candidate for a featured list. And, although it's not a criteria for deletion, I'd propose that in the absence of sound criteria, editors should take into mind whether or not they're destroying the hard, well-intentioned work of other editors. There's just no good reason to do that here. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 20:59, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Take into the account the hard work of other editors" is, as you rightly point out, an appeal to emotion with no basis in policy or guideline.

<li><b>Keep</b> well-laid out list (with more than just names) with finite membership criteria (so long as high school plays and class assignment movies are excluded). I expect that playing POTUS is a significant step in the life of an actor that is not taken lightly, therefore this is not pointless trivia.

<li><b>Keep</b> Otto4711 appears to be objecting to this list on the basis that playing the President is a <strike>trivial</strike> completely insignificant aspect of an actor's career, not as a list of portrayals of U.S. Presidents in <i>notable</i> films and TV shows (which it is). If this article was renamed and contained an inclusion criterion, would he still object? The nomination cites no policy or guideline and <i>one</i> AfD discussion as a precedent - not enough to convince me that this well-structured and easily manageable list should be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 23:59, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
