<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> pending verifiable information on accreditation and government licensing. I'm not clear on whether this is a real school, or just a collection of homeschooled kids in a church program. More signficant than its status, is the verifiability of status, which doesn't seem to exist yet. The links provided don't mean much. Also, I don't understand why the church web site, say nothing of this. I may well be missing something, so correct me if I'm wrong, and I'll happily switch to keep. The one place I could find a little info was at <a href="http://www.acsi.org/web2003/default.aspx?ID=2065&amp;ConstitID=0001304" class="external text" title="http://www.acsi.org/web2003/default.aspx?ID=2065&amp;ConstitID=0001304" rel="nofollow">ACSI</a> (which accredits K-12 Christian schools), but that wasn't helpful, as they're listed as a member, but not accredited. So, now I really have no idea what the status of this school is. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 11:24, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem isn't poor writing, or need of cleanup. Nobody can fix this article without verifiable information. Currently, there's no confirmation this church operates this school, as the church doesn't even mention the school it supposedly founded. It's worth noting that the Seattle Times entry for the school, mentions the church's web site, but gives a dead-link. If we can't tell people if the school is currently open, how can we tell them useful information? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 19:35, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Uh, "might be true", doesn't cut it. Verifiably true is the standard. There is something seriously wrong, when somebody makes an unverified statement about an organization, that's not sourced, which could do serious harm to the organizations reputation. Declaring in public an organization has financial problems has a great way of becoming a self-fullfilled prophecy. If somebody decided not to send their kids to a school, or not take a job there, because they read it was closing at Wikipedia, the school would be more than justified in holding us to blame for any such harm. I realize it is a harsh thing to say, but the original version of this article, should never have been written in the form it was, and was of net-negative value to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:36, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rob, I know you mean well, but please, try to stay calm for two seconds. See above where I said that <i><b>editing</b></i> was the solution. That to me is the better approach as opposed to deleting an article on a school based on a vague unreferenced line on "financial problems". <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> applies to newbies as well, so instead of tagging the article after two minutes, a further option would have been to question the submitting editor. You also need to realize that not everyone has your skills in concocting these school articles. People contribute based on their abilities. Until the wiki completely changes the rules regarding article creation, you are going to have to live with the fact that many articles start as pathetic little stubs that do not meet your lofty standards. That is the nature of the beast. It is a net positive. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:55, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Merging (such as with <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Seattle_24d2.html" title="West Seattle">West Seattle</a>) only makes sense if there is some coherent treatment within the merged article (<i>see</i> <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evanston%2C_Illinois_903a.html#Private_and_parochial_schools" title="Evanston, Illinois">Evanston, Illinois#Private and parochial schools</a>). Sticking a loosely connected fact in an inappropriate way in another article is a disservice to both articles. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 16:36, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
