<li><b>Keep</b>, but trim and provide with sources (which are definitely out there). There's no disputing the notability of the Naruto series. None whatsoever. This article is a page split from <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot_of_Naruto_59ec.html" title="Plot of Naruto">Plot of Naruto</a> for the purpose of size, and <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot_of_Naruto_59ec.html" title="Plot of Naruto">Plot of Naruto</a> was originally created to keep the main <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto.html" title="Naruto">Naruto</a> page size reasonable. So it fits notability criteria, but needs sourcing. I had it tagged at one point, but it seems that the tag had been removed.

<li>No one is disputing the the series' notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This came up last year with regard to one of the other Naruto plot articles -- see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Plot_of_Naruto_I_9202.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Plot of Naruto I">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Plot_of_Naruto_I</a>. Personally, I'm conflicted. (1) We don't normally delete articles that could be cleaned up; (2) I'm torn about just how much plot summary is appropriate for serial works. According to the notes, this article currently covers approximately one hundred serial chapters of the work -- how much plot summary is appropriate for 100 issues of the manga? (3) Ultimately, if the article had more out-of-universe info, I would probably be ok with about this level of plot summary, maybe a little less. Given that it doesn't, I'm torn about whether to delete the article to encourage editors to do a better job next time or to leave it in the hope that the editors eventually clean it up. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>TheronJ, I know you have worked on WikiProject Comics articles before, so I ask you to think about how many of those articles are merely plot summaries that cover 100 issues of a series in such detail. <a href="../../../5/2/_/52_%28comic_book%29.html" title="52 (comic book)">52 (comic book)</a> will cover 52 issues when it is finished, but the summary is maintained s at about ten paragraphs, and it has a lot of external sources that discuss the real-world details surrounding the series. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 14:30, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree, Chris. There's no question, IMHO, that the comics project has led the way on this problem, and articles like <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Spider-Man_%28story_arcs%29_a5ec.html" title="Ultimate Spider-Man (story arcs)">Ultimate Spider-Man (story arcs)</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_X-Men_%28story_arcs%29_f143.html" title="Ultimate X-Men (story arcs)">Ultimate X-Men (story arcs)</a> are much, much better that the Naruto plot articles - both because they make a concerted effort to include helpful, non-plot information and a concerted effort to keep the plot information limited. I'm mostly torn about whether deletion is appropriate for an article like this, which I agree (1) needs clean-up badly; (2) probably won't be cleaned up for years if ever; and (3) is very likely to constitute a copyright violation because of the depth of plot summary relative to non-plot information. I'll think about it and see if I can come off the fence. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Fan comments aside, I stand with my previous nom. of <i>Plot of Naruto I</i>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This is in no way a "grotesque violation of the subject's copyright" or a "clear violation of Wikipedia policies and fair use criteria." It fits perfectly with "a plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic." It takes a bit of plot summary to describe 400 magazines and 250 television episodes. It has to be broken down a bit, and that's what this is, see <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>. If you just glance at the page it looks like it's only covering a few episodes, but it's actually covering over 100 issues of the manga. I can see why someone thought it was too large when they thought it was a single film. You also may want to know this is <a href="http://hemlock.knams.wikimedia.org/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?wiki=enwiki&amp;ns=articles&amp;limit=100&amp;month=03%2F2007&amp;mode=view" class="external text" title="http://hemlock.knams.wikimedia.org/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?wiki=enwiki&amp;ns=articles&amp;limit=100&amp;month=03%2F2007&amp;mode=view" rel="nofollow">the 43rd most viewed article</a> on all of wikipedia. It's going to get a little bloated when 16,000 people are reading it every day. Naruto related articles account for 8 of our top 100 pages, with about 100,000 page views a day, so they tend to get big. People aren't saying delete because of notability, but just in case someone's thinking it, Naruto gets 32,000,000 google hits. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 16:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a plot of of a "larger topic", the franchise is large and thus there's a lot to cover, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">As Wikipedia is not paper</a> and I believe this fits in with our goals to create an encyclopaedia.

Also, we are informing people of the plot of <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto.html" title="Naruto">Naruto</a>, just in a seperate page because if combined, the article is very long.

<li><b>Keep</b> - While I agree that this page is way too large and goes into way too much detail, it can be cleaned up with a whole lot of work. The only real area that has considerable bloat is the area covering the Hidan and Kazuku arc. That arc just ended a couple of weeks back, so we can now take a knife to the section with the advantage of knowing exactly what was important to the storyline. However, I'm not really sure how we can source this besides citing the entire manga? --<a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostStalker_48d0.html" title="User:GhostStalker"><font color="gold"><b>Ghost</b></font><font color="black"><b>Stalker</b></font></a><small>(<a href="../../../g/h/o/User_talk%7EGhostStalker_6351.html" title="User talk:GhostStalker">Got a present for ya!</a>)</small> 16:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as it is an aspect of the larger subject of <i>Naruto</i> as a whole and thus not subject to exclusion by WP:NOT#IINFO 7 alone. Plot summary was deemed important to the subject, and forked from the main article, then from the Part I article in a natural Wiki process to keep pages readable and concise. That said, it could certainly use some improvement. It shouldn't be written from such a percise perspective, but rather a general one, focusing on what's important. More importantly, it needs to be well referenced to the source material so people researching the subject can trace their path back to the particular episode or chapter they're interested in. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 03:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

You can give me some line about how single episode summaries have some greater importance than an article with multiple episode summaries crammed together, but the only real difference is that one has cultural references/trivia, and the other doesn't. Also, something of a similar nature that I'd be interested to see if it's anymore acceptable: <a href="../../../d/r/a/Category%7EDragon_Ball_sagas_a5e9.html" title="Category:Dragon Ball sagas">Category:Dragon Ball sagas</a>. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 03:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Naruto is a long series, thus wouldn't it make sense, for the sake of a complete summary, that the summary itself would be long as well? Splitting it according to the arcs is one thing, but this article definetly shouldn't be deleted (somebody already tried, unsuccesfully). Viewtiful Rekk 12:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The page is obviously long and detailed enough to provide an alternative to reading/viewing the source material, and thus constitutes copyright violation. The Hidan and Kakazu section is particularly egregious in this. It's also a completely pointless page, as if it were shortened to a decent level (as has been done with longer series) then it would fit in a main Naruto: Shippūden article. That's the sort of article we need, not something that goes against numerous Wikipedia policies like this one. Stylish Alastor the Stylish 19:02, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and reduce</b>. While it's true that articles should not just be plot summaries, the existence of one adds to the meaning of the subject matter. Therefore, this article should not be thought of it's own article but part of the Naruto article. In response to claims that the article is too long, I fully agree, though, with the second-to-most-recent arc concluded, it is now possible to clean up that area, which is by far the largest.--<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrenchman113_bb46.html" title="User:Frenchman113">Frenchman113</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrenchman113_63b9.html" title="User talk:Frenchman113">on wheels!</a> 19:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Obviously, the article needs a trim, but there seems to be no one who is willing to do it, probably because of its size. Why don't we create a particular board of users who trim the article monthly?

<li><b>Comment</b> - People are complaining about the level of detail, but let's compare it to some other page on wikipedia. First, there's about 2 issues of the manga for every 1 episode. This page is covering 100 issues of the manga, so that's about 50 episodes. This page has about 11,000 words, so that's 220 words per episode. Now a Featured Article episode from House, <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_%28House%29_19e7.html" title="Pilot (House)">Pilot (House)</a>, has about 600 words in its plot summary. Those episodes are twice as long, so it has about 300 words per 22 minutes, which is 136% more than this page. That's a Featured Article, so people who know what they're doing have cut that synopsis down the best it can be done. If you compare it to some <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stargate_SG-1_episodes_00dc.html" title="List of Stargate SG-1 episodes">Stargate</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Heroes_episodes_cc09.html" title="List of Heroes episodes">Heroes</a> episodes, it's even smaller per minute. The more I think about it, this isn't even too detailed, it's just that being on all on one page makes people think it should be deleted. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 18:23, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's less detailed than the House episode featured article. I'd like to see a consensus on how long plot summaries should be. Until then, using featured articles seems like a good way to judge. Personally, when I write anime episode summaries, I make them about 150 words. See <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_of_Desire_6ca8.html" title="Star of Desire">Star of Desire</a> for an example. I think 220 words is pretty good considering the 16000 page views this aticle gets every day. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 21:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep/Spilt</b> i think this article may be two long and much controversy because of its usefulness to many users but i think recoomending it for deletion is a rash descision... A wikiproject may be in order to help fix this article. Spilting in to seprate parts can help as well. On another hand i think a good idea would be to trim the Sections to less detail after the episode pertaining to that section is released which can greatly shorten the article over time. Reccomding this for deletion isnt something to take lightly because its two long copyright violation doesnt seem like a pertaining issue as it just records without posting content. if you posted the manga here i assume it would be a different story Matthew2c4u 20:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> Peregrine Fisher, I think talking about something completely different from the suject is something that should be avoided. Please remember this is a manga/anime with more than 200 chapters not a televesion show with less than 50 episodes so please tell me how are we to shorten the article without splitting into various articles? I also believe that the article was put up for deletion because because the nominator thought this was a film so there is no need for this being here. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand"><span style="color: #ff0000">Sam</span> <span style="color: #000000">ov</span> <span style="color: #000000">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span> <span style="color: #808000">sand</span></a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_b823.html" title="User talk:Sam ov the blue sand"><font size="1"><span style="color: #ff0000"><b>X</b></span> please passover.</font></a> 01:32, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I believe that people who doesn't enjoy this anime or just hate it for some reason should not have a say on this, as it may only be to get this summary deleted, I also think that if it's too large of a summary then we could devide it into arcs. deviding this aummary into arcs might take a lot of work but I know it's possible and even if i'm not good at this i would gladly help devide it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Okay, enough with the hate accusations. I enjoy the series, but this article seriously needs to go (or at the very least, get split). Put things into perspective. It's not that I don't like the series; quite the contrary. This is the only anime I watch on a regular basis nowadays. However, this is not a Naruto fansite: This is an encyclopedia, and thus its articles have to be of encyclopedic value and must fit a certain standard. Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, articles that are strictly plot summaries are in fact not encyclopedic, and the article on its own is not near Wikipedia's quality standards in terms of its tone and excessive details. This could be fixed, but not without breaking the article into smaller parts. So, I maintain the split decision that I had above, but I am not opposed to an outright deletion. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!"><i><span style="color: #C0C090">You Can't See Me!</span></i></a> 03:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, but clean up</b>. This article is a great source of information for those who don't have the actual manga handy, but want to research it. However, the degree to which it covers the plot is a bit excessive, and I feel that it should be reduced to a basic summary of the plot's outline, leaving only the more important events of the series, rather than an in-depth explanation of every little thing that happens. Is it absolutely necessary to know that Konohamaru started fooling around with the Shadow Clone Jutsu after he learned it? No, not really. It does reveal more about the characters, but that's why many characters have their own articles. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazedNinja_4d7e.html" title="User:CrazedNinja">CrazedNinja</a> 05:42, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Though I do admit, this file is massive and would definitely hinder those with slower browsers and computers. However, I see no reason to remove it completely. If it does get too much, how about separating the article into the plot synopsis section of each character, like the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Bleach_8f0f.html" title="Characters in Bleach">Bleach</a> page, or, for example, <a href="../../../i/c/h/Ichigo_Kurosaki_d008.html" title="Ichigo Kurosaki">this</a> page. That way, we can all see plot details attributed to each main character and keep the file size reasonable at the same time. Stuntman15 17:09, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree. Kind of Like what the Other person had said. Trim it into other articles. But based on arc, Unless the arc is short, in which case group those ones with the longer ones. Look, plain and simple: I haven't gotten the subbed comic yet, I can't find it either, I like this to be used as a source until the chapter it describes Releases. That way, I know what is going on. Besides, Seriously, Like was also stated quite simply put: If you look at the length of everything that has happened in both the manga and anime of it, you'll see that this plot is actually VERY SHORTENED from what it could be. It needs to be trimmed into smaller arcticles. I tried to do so a few minutes ago, but Wikipedia wouldn't let me. Forgive me if that was wrong of me, I'm fairly new to Wikipedia and don't know all the rules in the back of my head.Chipmonk328 9:17 PM, 30 March 2007</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I also agree. This articles would be better off being separated into different articles. It is what they did for One Piece, so we should do the same. (undersigned)</li>

<li><b>Comment -</b> I find this funny, since it seems i can search wikipedia for several other shows which make a fortune on DVD Sales and the such, and yet their plot summaries are "Organized" yet give away about 500% the amount of details that this plot summary does, even with shows containing less content. I think half the people on this conversation are biased, hypocritical and should quit trying to rain on others parades just to agitate the situation, like the one who started this deletion suggestion- who everyone knows this person is.
