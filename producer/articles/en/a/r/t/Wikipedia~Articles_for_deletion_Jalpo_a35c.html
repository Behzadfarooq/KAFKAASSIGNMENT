<dd>Nat Krause, I'm reporting you to Wikipedia for the following "... undoing other people's edits without discussing them first. This is considered impolite and unproductive. If you continue, you may be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blocked.html" title="Blocked">blocked</a> from editing Wikipedia under the three-revert rule, which states that nobody may <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revert.html" title="Revert">revert</a> an article to a previous version more than three times in 24 hours. (Note: this also means editing the page to reinsert an old edit. If the effect of your actions is to revert back, it qualifies as a revert. That is what you did when you outrightly deleted 20 kilobytes of page at Jonang-Kalachakra Controversy see History&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonang-Kalachakra_Controversy&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonang-Kalachakra_Controversy&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
<dd>A pattern of wrongful deleting and of incorrect assumptions so as to create problems somewhat akin to vandalism is appearing with your assertion here that Gyalpo and Jalpo were not found on Google which is blatlantly a lie in view of the plethora of that. Add in gto your previous deleting manner, I found it right to warn Wikipedia of your deeds. I'm also filing for undeletion of Jalpo as your charges are unfounded here. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 14:03, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, article for keep. The Googling probably didn't work out right but I have references to Gyalpo-Jalpo all over the net. Just it's tough to see, because Gyalpo is also an ordinary name of persons like John or George in English. Here's one reference. I'll give more of such; and for good measure I'll also provide them on the page. It's not a hoax or other things that I've seen it here described as. I'm afraid I've not clearly understood what people read into the page. Corrected here with Google research. This is a case of msitaken identity. Jalpo is not at all what you suspect it of being&#160;: either inidentifiable, unverifiable or original research. None of that at all. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:kotyBgHyUrYJ:www.garchen.net/library/texts/smokeofferingr.phuntsog.pdf+%27Gyalpo+Sum%27+-+the+Three+King+Spirits&amp;hl=fr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=12&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:kotyBgHyUrYJ:www.garchen.net/library/texts/smokeofferingr.phuntsog.pdf+%27Gyalpo+Sum%27+-+the+Three+King+Spirits&amp;hl=fr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=12&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 10:54, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No one in their sane mind can keep on claiming that these spirits don't exist in the Tibetan Tantric Buddhist pantheon. I'm surprised that no one found these references on Google but I'm giving them here so it doesn't matter. But at least the error can be fixed. But undeleting is imperative. Making errors is OK but on condition of fixing them and not leaving unverifable things on the net. The person (Nat Krause) who said Jalpo-Gyalpo is not on Google said this but it's unverifable because I found a lot of Gyalpo Jalpos on it. So, he stands corrected. So, sorry, it's a mistaken identity there for you but I've helped out with references. There *is* a gyalpo-Jalpo on Google all over it really, in fact. There are tons on Google so if needed, I'll just give some more. Thanks. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 11:29, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Original objections that Jalpo is not on Google have been rectified so undelete in order. Then objections that neither Gyalpo nor Jalpo were there either also corrected. So, again undelete is in order. The two original objections disowned now; so undelete for all later delete votes that were added in order. Jalpo is a fact on Google and an important part of Tibetan culture and religion. No contest on that one. False case. No merit. People who can't find it by Googling doesn't mean one can't Google it. I've Googled it, came up with 185 hits and posted about a dozen here now. What part of this don't people understand&#160;? How can someone honestly come and say there are no hits when they can just click the host of links I provided here like a takeaway meal&#160;? <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 22:47, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the weak delete Aza Toth. The hoax claim is unfounded&#160;: the Gyalpo-Jalpo references are all over Internet and it's not a fiction nor a hoax. I think the page should have it's chance to get up some reference written on it concerning the nature of the Jalpo spirits in Tibetan culture. I didn't think of putting them there earlier, thinking the people reading it would all be Buddhists. But for the general public, the page needs just a few references to be written out...and needs a few days for that so weak delete is good if it can just have a few days to improve. Thus putting off a deleting agenda a few days to redo some references is good. Saying it's Original Research, I don't agree with, as I've put up other external links that support the phases of what I say on the page. While I do the new references gleaned from the links I've just given here newly (above), I'll look at the OR issue meanwhile. But the verifiability issue on Google has already been cleared up because evidence is to be found on search-engines. So, with these new links coming on and improvement on the way, a weak delete is proper, if not to say "just a beginning" of getting the page undeleted.

<li><b>Jalpo article changed</b>. The article has been changed and references added to make the article descriptive of the deity-spirit. I thus ask for the undeletion of the page as the objections to it not being verifiable on the web is lifted. Also, objections of original research based upon this are also lifted. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 23:18, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

He wrote a paper to Leiden University on that page which is just the support for it. So you'll have to revise your statement.

<li>J Smith, I am filing for the "delete" tag to be taken off the page. What do you see wrong in university theses to serve as reference for the page&#160;?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways it's not because Wikipedia doesn't recognize the existence of Gyalpos or Jalpos (for Tibetan Buddhism) that they don't exist&#160;: I have the proof multiplied by ten on Google. I don't think that fighting this will be right for you because the outcome is that. Also, I think that the university references that abound in my references links are very good, on the contrary. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 11:09, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Remove Delete tag</b></s> on Jalpo page. The objections of the two first nominations for deletion by ZoFreX and Nat Krause have been lifted as I've found, produced, and posted about a dozen links to Gyalpo-Jalpos from the web (even if it is just on this deletion-page). Thank you for obliging... as no proof of their claims exist. Given ample proof the onus is on the prosecution to answer. No one is considered guilty until proven to be so. False accusations must be dealt with without weakness. Wikipedia policy. It is against Wikipedia policy to let false accusations stay on Wikipedia and this page is proof of the facts that are put forth for the record. No doubt is thus left in this matter. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 15:34, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>J. Smith, Hi, I've changed the self-referencing links</li>
</ul>
<p>on the page at Jalpo and the Wiki referencing links have been backed up by non-WIki ones. I think this adresses your concerns and also opens up for the pages being brought into WIki policy constraints. Please keep it's vote. Go from a weak delete to keep. I'll also include shortly, in the references, the "Pehar Gyalpo" reference that you provided above; and the people.freenet.de one (Gruschke) from Leiden University that I think are both perfectly acceptable. Given the three other references from Wiki and E-Sangha; the one from Sussex University; that of sacred-texts.com (one to two million hits a day) that are all perfectly acceptable as references (I think), that makes eight *grounded* and researched references. I've excluded other site-references although they are perfectly clearly appearing on Google, and that may also well be perfectly authentified sources for all that. We're thus looking at a total throve of at least ten to twelve potential references boiled down to a conservative selected number of eight of them. So, as I say, keep it, it's right. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 09:20, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Thousands and thousands of words, and I still don't know what it is. This stinks of hoax or OR. If it is not a hoax or OR, I would still support a delete, or removal of all material and reversion to substub since current content is incoherent after more than enough time. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKAF_4851.html" title="User:AKAF">AKAF</a> 17:20, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Wait</b> I'm working on widening and making easy the search for people verifying the information and trying to make Tibetan language terms easy to scroll down by explaining the names and word meanings involved. I think I've done a good job on some of the links I added to the page today because they're trustworthy reliable sources and easy to understand (or see). The definition window when one opens the page first seems also to appear much clearer for the newcomer now.

<li>Someone to vote a <b>Keep</b> now&#160;? Time needed to streamline/outline article; so need some time to do that. But ZoFreX and Nat Krauses first reasons for nominating have been answered with ample Googling provided for the article theme and all impressions of it being a hoax dispelled by that. Just need put it in form. I think the description of Gyalpos/Jalpos gives newcomers a good idea of the article theme now, seeing I've provided new form to the page recently. More on the way now. If someone could put in a <b>keep</b> vote that would take the page off the hotline to deletion for the moment.
