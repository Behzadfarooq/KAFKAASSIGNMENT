<dd>I feel I need to interject for a moment to explain a point of wikipedia policy. The criteria for information in wikipedia is actually <i>not</i> truth. That's right - it doesn't matter if something is true. What matters is if it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>.

<li>Well, unlike myself, and the writer of this article, you obviously do not live in the Dallas area, which is why you don't know who he is or any factual information about him. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbinado_dd67.html" title="User:Arbinado">Arbinado</a> 21:50, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article is on a very popular Dallas radio figure. One source is the blog of the person in question. The other is his official radio show website. And one about the radio station which yes, apparently indeed, does employ the man. Let's hope that somebody whose spelling of words like "rumor" would strongly indicate that he lives nowhere near Dallas, TX, wouldn't be so arrogant as to think that simply because he's never heard of this man in his infinitely small section of the universe, that obviously in his mind Bob Sturm is not Wikipedia worthy. Could the article use a little retouching? Perhaps. But let's look at new articles with an open mind, not a "delete first, ask questions later" policy. - Monosylab1k (<a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonosylab1k_5b4b.html" title="User talk:Monosylab1k">talk)</a> 21:59, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Additionally, the stance on this article is grossly hypocritical. There is an apalling lack of sources cited for the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Parcells_a42c.html" title="Bill Parcells">Bill Parcells</a> page among many, many others, and yet no stink is being made of that. Every word of this article is taken from multiple sources that can't always be referenced seeing as how they were made over the airwaves of the miracle known as radio broadcasting, if you'd like to peruse the Ticket archives to prove me wrong then feel free. The attempts to delete this page are a clear example of Wiki-blowhards abusing their power. - Monosylab1k (<a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonosylab1k_5b4b.html" title="User talk:Monosylab1k">talk)</a> 01:29, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
