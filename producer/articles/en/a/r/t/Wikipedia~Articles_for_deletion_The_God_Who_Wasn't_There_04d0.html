<li>Ah - it wasn't <i>straight</i> to video (even if the theatrical release was only two weeks before the DVD), it interviews some notable people, and the part about how the DVD includes paid screening rights is definitely unusual.

<ul>
<li>What's with all these allegations of "sock puppets"? I know there are a lot of first-timers here, but that's different than a sock puppet, as I understand it. What's happening is that word has spread in the atheist community about this attempted deletion and the attempted deletion of the Atheists of Silicon Valley entry. But these votes are, to my knowledge, all real (my email inbox is full of a similar number of responses). These comments are opinionated as heck, yes, but they're <b>real</b>. Discounting them as "sock puppets" is just inaccurate, unless you have evidence that you are not sharing. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianFlemming_592b.html" title="User:BrianFlemming">BrianFlemming</a> 03:12, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just a note: sockpuppets or first-timers, while certainly different phenomena, have the same result on VFD, and that is uncounted votes. Certainly, "word has spread", and it seems to have been done with purpose, that being to keep this article (though seemingly on the grounds that deletion would be censorship, which is not something carried out on Wikipedia). So, accurate or otherwise, it won't really make a difference. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 03:23, August 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia votes for deletion</a>: "<b>Anonymous and new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion</b>, but their votes <b>may</b> be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith." (Emphasis mine.) I do not believe these votes are in bad faith. Nobody's trying to hide anything here. And nobody has asked that first-timer votes be given equal weight with veteran Wikipedians' votes.
<ul>
<li>That seems to settle it, then. Despite some attempts to poison the well against anon and first-time votes, they're welcomed by the rules, even if they don't carry as much weight as regular users. Much more in keeping with Wikipedia's "for everyone, by everyone" reputation.--69.212.54.145 13:50, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Uh. I have no problems with discussion for everyone and by everyone. I got tagged as a potential sockpuppet myself the first time I voted. that having been said, this particualr situation is ridiculous. Let me point something out about my statement "Can we move all the anon and sock puppet votes" Anons. Move them. Not remove them, but move them. My precise problem with the vast majority of these votes are: They make it hard to "count votes", and more importantly, they either say very little otehr than 'keep' or they start yacking about bookburning, censorship, and other such things. This is a breach of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and can be seen as an act of bad faith editing.

<li>Okay, I'm not going to vote at this point, although I'd like to point out that the issue of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyvio.html" title="Copyvio">copyright violation</a> is one which we take <i>very</i> seriously. If the text is copied from somewhere else, then that's grounds to blank the article. We simply can't take someone's word for it that "oh, it's okay", because everything on Wikipedia is <i><b>public domain</b></i>; so rather than being copied from somewhere else, it <b>has</b> to be reworded. Maybe the copyvio allegation is valid, maybe it's false, I'm really not in the mood to do a comparison just now, so I'll leave that be. More importantly, though, for those of you who voted but are not registered users, I politely suggest that you read my <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_First-timer_2efa.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven/First-timer">my article explaining what you've done wrong</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 16:09, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><small>I understand that you are not "in the mood" to do any research, as you say, but perhaps you could check out <a href="http://www.thegodmovie.com/press/" class="external text" title="http://www.thegodmovie.com/press/" rel="nofollow">this link</a> to see this statement: "Note: the text in this press kit is placed into the public domain and may be used elsewhere." We're talking here about re-use of a plot summary that is made freely available. Additionally, there is other material in this entry original to the entry. How could deleting this entire entry possibly be the right thing to do here? BrianFlemming</small>
<ul>
<li>Ah, so it does and so it is; objection withdrawn. In addition, I'm in a better mood now, and I've read through the article, and I've compared it to the press kit, etc, and I have to say, I don't see any problem with <b>keep</b>ing it. I would also like to kindly suggest to the many anonymous voters who are accusing us of being rabidly anti-atheist to please, consider that anyone can put any article up for VfD at any time (although if you do it maliciously, and repeatedly, you <b>will</b> be blocked from editing). All it takes is one person to suggest that it be deleted, and then we debate it, like we're doing now. And the process typically <i><b>works</b></i>; you'll note that the majority of the signed votes are pro-keep? So calm down, okay?<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 21:22, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>FYI, there seems to have been a coincidental crossover here with some users familiar with the <a href="http://universist.org/wikipedia.htm" class="external text" title="http://universist.org/wikipedia.htm" rel="nofollow">Universist controversy</a>. It's a separate issue, but the fact that every attempt to start <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universist" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universist" rel="nofollow">an entry about the Universist Movement</a> here has met with resistance from Wikipedia editors has fueled a perception that <i>some</i> Wikipedians organize to keep freethought from being acknowledged here. I'm not saying it's true, just noting the perception. I have to admit, I'm very perplexed about the multiple kills of the Universist entry. The Universists have had entire articles written about them in publications such as the <i>New York Times</i>, and as a member of the atheist community (but not of the Universists), I know that they are a major force. The assertion that the Universists are insignificant is clearly false, and it resembles the argument of Calton here that The God Who Wasn't There is an insignificant "straight to video" film. <i>And</i> it resembles Calton's false claim that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheists_of_Silicon_Valley" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheists_of_Silicon_Valley" rel="nofollow">Atheists of Silicon Valley</a> is an insignificant group of only "local interest." There is a pattern here. All three of these claims of insignificance are false, and all three are attempts to spike Wikipedia acknowledgement of non-theist projects. Yes, there's a lot of smoke here (some of it unproductive, unwarranted and clearly casting the net of blame far too wide), but there's some fire. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianFlemming_592b.html" title="User:BrianFlemming">BrianFlemming</a> 18:40, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This movie has attracted significant media attention and includes interviews from figures who also have their own articles on Wikipedia. It is notable. <a href="../../../e/b/o/User%7EEbonmuse_65e4.html" title="User:Ebonmuse">Ebonmuse</a> 02:21, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Since there seems to be no copyvio, I see no real problem with the article. Though I don't know that the movie is extremely significant, I prefer to keep articles on things that meet at least minimum criteria for significance because I think it makes Wikipedia stronger than a normal encyclopedia. As for sockpuppets, I think it's okay for someone who has been using Wikipedia but may not have had an account (or even a total newbie) to join and cast a <b>reasoned</b> vote, but there clearly has been a totally emotional campaign to keep this article by people who don't understand Wikipedia and don't participate in the community. I hope that Brian Flemming has learned from this process, as he instigated at least some of the campaign on his blog. From what he says, I think he has. For the record, I say all this as someone who would almost certainly strongly disagree with the movie itself.<a href="../../../t/o/x/User%7ETox_f05a.html" title="User:Tox">Tox</a> 06:36, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
