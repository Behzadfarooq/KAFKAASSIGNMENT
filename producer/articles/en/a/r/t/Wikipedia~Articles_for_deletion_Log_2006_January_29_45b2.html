<li><b>Delete.</b> Unimportant. Unknown outside of a narrow circle. Unsuccessful hoax that was immediately recognized and fooled few. Before finalizing this vote, I am going to do a reality check: I am going to see whether this was ever mentioned in The New York Times. If it was, I'll change my vote. I don't know the result yet. This is my own reality check to make sure this was not much more notable than it seems to me. I'm not saying this should be a universal criterion, I'm not saying we should never mention things that weren't in the New York Times. But we don't need to have articles on everything that was in Slate. OK, here goes. Between 2000 and January 28, 2005, the word "greenlighting" has appeared five times in The New York Times. All of them were usages in the show business sense (project approval). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:23, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have no idea why this page was nominated. Notable, verifiable. From the site: <i>My site has been featured recently in the Washington Post, and several other large newspapers here in the United States including the Chicago Tribune and the Wall Street Journal. It has also been featured in several newspapers all over the world, most recently (May, 2004) in the Malaysia Star.</i> Ifnord 14:05, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, I'm puzzled by the nomination. The web site clearly meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia guidelines for website notability</a> as evidenced by high Alexa rank plus media attention by national newspapers.

<li>In what way do you assert this article meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> guidelines? Nowhere is Alexa rank mentioned. If this site's Alexa rank qualifies it for Wikipedia inclusion, then you, Ifnord, have a lot of work to do - there are 29,999 other sites to be added. You'd better get cracking. And then, at the end of that process, you will have made Wikipedia into a Web directory, <i><b>in direct contravention of the guideline you cited.</b></i> -Ikkyu2 09:28, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Aside from Alexa rank, the article meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> guidelines.

<li><b>Note from Lissa at Lissaexplains.com</b> One requesting deletion is actually a moderator that I removed from my forum considering his heinous behavior - the site was created by me alone, and the article was written by members of my forum. Relative is no longer a moderator, and really has as much to do with the Web site as all moderators do. I, personally, have never touched the article, and only recently noticed a slanderous comment within the article posted by two members who left my forum. I ran an IP search within my forum, and four users here are ex-forum members. This is an obvious case of trolling. 3:58 PM EST 27 January 2006

<li>This one is easier than most. Usually a lengthy search involving some effort is required to find the non-trivial published works from independent sources. In this case, <i>they are handily linked to at the bottom of the article</i>. (The article could be improved further by citing the initial article in the Australian newspaper, as well.) I've read the subset of the news articles that are actually legible, and they are not mere incidental mentions or web directory listings. The primary <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion is satisfied. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:08, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. It wasn't vandalism. The article was updated to reflect the current state of the forum, and was factually accurate. Lissa is definately trying to influence the outcome of the vote by retaliating against those that vote against the article. I resonded to her first comment, but it was deleted. I pointed out that she was lying in her comments here, and since it was deleted, I feel as though she is being allowed to say what she wants (whether accurate or not), and nobody else is allowed to provide the truth- either because it will be removed or we will be retaliated against.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've been doing some research on the mall about some crimes that have taken place there. In the 1980s, there was a serial rapist that attacked women in the then-poorly lit parking lot. A man was tried and convicted, only to have his convistion quashed years later when it turned out that the DNA lab guy was a liar and a fraud. Furthermore, just a few years ago, a Marshall University student named Samantha Burns was kidnapped from the same parking lot and never seen again. Two guys have been convicted of her murder, but a body has never been recovered. Im looking to find more info before I spill any ink on the topic, since they are sensitive in nature and deserve the utmost care. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 02:59, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable block of concrete filled with too many people, without prejudice to Youngamerican recreating the article with something <i>interesting</i>. 'Largest in the state' for me is a statistic, not a claim of notability, and if it was it would beg the question of where we draw the line. Largest in a county? Largest in a bit city? What population city?

<li><b>Keep</b> per Youngamerican's response to Calton's opinion. West Virginia has few shopping malls in comparison to other states with comparable populations so most of them are notable in their own right. Oh, and I love how it's always an IP address (i.e. 64.12.117.10) that nominates articles for deletion...the real question here is which one of the above delete votes is 64.12.117.10? --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaponer_c591.html" title="User:Caponer">Caponer</a> 17:27, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as I have seen other shopping mall articles with much less information but because they weren't in West Virginia, but instead in some other more wiki-favoured U.S. state, were never nominated for deletion.

<dd>The nominator was from an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Aussie.html" title="Aussie">Aussie</a> IP, so I doubt they have any preference for any particular U.S. state. Second, articles on obscure subjects in larger states are more common because those states have more contributors. However, that doesn't mean those articles would survive an AfD either, it's just that very few people ever come across them because they're either orphan articles, or no one cares enough to search for them.

<li>I disagree with your statistics. yes, I am the owner and yes we are NEW, but you saying 12 hits is almost comical. Here are the correct stats from my server. Beginning January 1, 2006 to today, January 28, 2006, I have received 8,809 hits to the main page alone. Listeners to the stream equals 6,234. New or not, if you recommend deletion for every single NEW entry, I don't see how anyone can stand a chance for submission. <a href="../../../w/c/r/User%7EWcroradio_4e63.html" title="User:Wcroradio">Wcroradio</a> 01:51, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>internet radio vanity? I give the correct stats, which contradicts Vslashg's and you move to delete based on "internet radio vanity"? That is so lame. Even lamer? Longhair edited this page and made it a point to make sure his comments were above mine, especially after his comment originally fell under my first response. Go ahead and delete it.

<li><b>Comment</b> I was a little inprecise... by "12 hits" I really meant a search on "WCRO radio" returned 12 results. Also worth noting the page has no Alexa rank. <a href="../../../v/s/l/User%7EVslashg_16cb.html" title="User:Vslashg">Vslashg</a> 01:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As I said, delete it. But, it needs to be made known that it seems to be a popularity contest here and not "open" to "new" submissions, unless they meet a certain rank on Alexa (ever consider the no robots tag I use?) or a certain number of results via Google. Go ahead and remove the listing. I'll rely on my correct statistics and listener base. Can't wait to discuss this on the show. Maybe I can get Jimmy Wales to call in ...

<p>The article has been nominated before, but "saved". "Objectivity" does not rate article space in Dictionaries of Philosophy or Encyclopedias of Philosophy, thus there is no standard outside of original research. The article's past has been for editors to concentrate on what individual philosophers call "objectivity". You can enumerate all the philosopher's versions of what they call "objectivity", but neither this compilation, nor individual versions, comprise or define "objectivity (philosophy)" as a term within the discipline. That is the reason there is no standard for a NPOV article.<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 02:09, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Redirect to Ayn Rand is not a viable option. "Objectivity" is a technical term. The article <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_philosophy.html" title="Objectivist philosophy">Objectivist philosophy</a> is basically the position of an individual author using the term in a non-technical sense, and who is not recognized by most philosophers as a philosopher.

<dd>I'm not convinced that Objectivity is exclusively about propositions. I generally think of it in perceptual terms instead. I also try to avoid the term 'objectivity' altogether as is it confusing and go with something like 'observer-independent' or 'agent-independent'. Sure, objects can't be true, but they might be mind-independent. Intentional objects are (agent-dependent) phenomenal objects that may or may not correspond to mind-independent or noumenal objects, so that's completely different. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiok_b81c.html" title="User:Chiok">Chiok</a> 05:23, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Objectivity involves a mental act. Objects may not be and I fail to see the real direct relevance about mind-independence. True, propositions may not exist, but objectivity requires a mental act and communication between at least two individuals. Unless, of course, you have some solipsist tendencies or a private language and can relate it to objectivity in an isolated mental event. I don't like using the term objectivity either and the reason I describe it as a "propensity to be objective" is because of the mental act aspect, and an intended object. Sure, they make objects mind or agent dependent, but the mental act is the nature of objectivity. Mind -independent objects seem to be of no consequence if they cannot be the intended object of a mental act, which is the essense of objectivity (distinct from objectivism). You otherwise run the risk of having it confused with forms of objectivism. Intentionality is not a form of idealism, it is a form of realism. Whether or not propositions exist is really secondary to the assumption that they may exist. Otherwise you lapse into forms of relativism, which is its opposite. I'm not overly concerned with where the article is redirected as I am with the prospect of it being reintroduced and mutilated and confused. If you check in Macmillan's <i>Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> you will not find an article on "objectivity", but in the index to the eight volumes most references are directed toward language and intentionality, with little reference to individual philosophers or forms of objectivism. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 06:58, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a merely confused layperson- <i>Objectivity is a technical term.</i> - but <i>not found in Encyclopedias of Philosophy</i> - rather in what discipline is objectivity a techical term? Also - in lay views there are wooly(?) uses - which may at least appear to be philosophical in nature. My view is that even if philosophers have nothing to say about this term - the article may have merit just stating that. (Obviously this would be a special case). It is also interesting to see that the current article still sustains 20 odd links to it, and certainly not merely concerned with Rand. - I oppose deletion, but do not oppose a rewrite.

<dd>I do not think so. See for instance the quote "If they do exist, do they exist independently of the mind as do the objects of various objectivisms, or do they come into being when an object becomes the intended object of a mental act?" This is definitely setting up a sort of objectivity vs. inevitable subjectivity problem, which is just the sort of thing the metaphysical objectivism article deals with. We are talking about the quality of detachment, of a view on a particular object without the lens of subjectivity. I think the article is a bit too close to the metaphysical objectivism article, so my vote remains as a redirect/merge. I'd rather keep it than have it redirected/merged to the article on Objectivism, though. It really doesn't have anything to do with that. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrazyCaley_d294.html" title="User:KrazyCaley">KrazyCaley</a> 16:18, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Objectivity in sciences (maths or physics) is certainly different from objectivity in historic studies, which themselves can't be compared to <i>immediate history</i>, i.e. <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> which makes US press standards. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a></dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy delete</b> as re-creation of previously deleted content. The only substantial difference between the previously deleted article and this one is that the previously deleted article explicitly told us that the song was a hoax, whereas this article is a straight promulgation of the hoax. We would keep a hoax if it were a <i>well-documented</i> hoax (i.e. one that had been publicly debunked by reliable sources) and thus <i>were well-known as a hoax</i>, but in the earlier AFD discussion <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirGeneral_34ab.html" title="User:SirGeneral">SirGeneral</a> attempted to find such documentation and reported failure.

<p>Believe me I don't want to nominate this. I was going to edit it for accuracy, but then stopped because it seems so unsalvageable. To start with, it's purely speculation. There probably will be a 40th Canadian parliament one day, but when that day comes, will Harper still be prime minister going into the election, as the article suggests? What if Harper's Tories resign and the Liberals form a minority government without an election? It's happened before. Even if the Tories are still the government going into the next election, how do we know Harper will be consulting the Governor General as to when the election will be held, as the article says? What if Harper resigns or dies in office? That's happened before in Canadian history, too. Which brings me to my next point. This article isn't about the 40th Canadian parliament. It's about the <a href="../../../4/0/t/40th_Canadian_federal_election_62ce.html" title="40th Canadian federal election">40th Canadian federal election</a>, which already has an article.

<blockquote>
<p>Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented. Examples of appropriate topics include 2008 U.S. presidential election, and 2012 Summer Olympics. A schedule of future events may also be appropriate.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this list partially because neither "red herring" or "MacGuffin" properly covers this particular film device. The device is perhaps important only to film theorists and enthusiasts but it has a rich history in early avante garde cinema and became progressively more popular in mainstream films. The fact that it has been a device employed by a wide variety of important directors from a multitude of countries also lends it some legitimacy. I was unable to find a decent list anywhere else on the internet and so I decided to begin compiling one on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I had written up my explanation and then must not have saved it. Whoops. Anyhow, I think this list is great. This article is useful for anyone trying to learn about film devices. Also, how is the list an indiscriminate collection? The list is pretty clearly defined and not very vague: how is a list of films with an object whose contents are never made visible to the audience hard to define? It's a limited list that is verifiable and mildly notable. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolkor_00a7.html" title="User:Folkor">Folkor</a> 09:49, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy delete</b> as a combination of three criteria: vandalism, short article with no context, and attack page. Although each criterion is only weakly satisfied on its own, I take the view that in combination they warrant a speedy deletion. The article purports to give the expansion of an acronym that was coined (by my clock) just over an hour ago. Reviewing its history, I see that the article appears to be the fallout from a war that has spilled over from some other place into Wikipedia, as several versions of the article are attack pages on some pseudonymous people on some discussion forum. Clearly, Wikipedia is being mis-used as a public scribbling board by some discussion forum participants to write attacks on one another. For future reference, I also note that expansion of acronyms into phrases is dictionary article territory, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:26, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. This is less obviously a hoax than the Adriana Brady page, but I still think the page is bad-faith. The body text claims this is an article for someone named "Adrienne Nesser", not "Adriana Rogers", and indeed some searching shows Adrienne Nesser is the wife of Billie Joe Armstrong from Green Day. However, Google News searches make the Slash rape charge seem highly implausible: <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22Saul+Hudson%22+rape" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22Saul+Hudson%22+rape" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22Adrienne+Nesser%22" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22Adrienne+Nesser%22" rel="nofollow">2</a>. IMDB shows no record of either an Adrienne Nesser or an Adriana Brady performing in any movies. The history of this article reads like evolving fiction, and the future (in my opinion) bad-faith edits made by User:Billie joe121 point to hoax. <a href="../../../v/s/l/User%7EVslashg_16cb.html" title="User:Vslashg">Vslashg</a> 08:41, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>- Adrienne Nesser may exist and be Billy Joe Armstrong's wife. However, this article still appears to be a hoax. Adriana Rogers, according to the article, would have been 10 when she helped form the band and been 15 when she married. The dates of the children's births and names are inconsistent with information on Billy Joe Armstrong. So, weaving one Nesser's name seems to be something to add some seeming truth. However, this "biography" does not ring true -- no verifying sources. ‚Äî<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 06:03, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't see why it should be deleted. The Board of Directors of GIC and Temasek Holdings number no more than 20 people and as far as the GIC is concerned and unlike the Hong Kong Monetary Authority which publishes its investments on a regular basis, the Singapore Government Investment Corporation, does not even account to Parliament for its investments performance, let alone its composition.[User: Singapore Citizen]</p>

<dd>(Well, at least you didn't delete my comment this time. That's progress. I'm glad you're talking instead of vandalizing.) No, that just means that you can't use Wikiepedia to argue for a particular political position--an encyclopedia is for communicating facts about a subject, not inspiring people (except indirectly) to political action. Did you read the page I linked to? An article reporting, in a neutral way, about the makeup of PAP or the GIC--about which I know nothing, so please don't think I'm against you politically--would be welcome, and, who knows, having those facts out in the open may do more to make change happen than some random witticism like the Papareto Principle. The point here is not about what's good for Singapore, it's about what's good for Wikipedia.</dd>

<p>Just to clarify, I have NOT deleted anyone's comments here. To Wikipedia ADMINISTRATORS: I am not into semantics as far as the title of the entry is concerned. Although what is stated is not verifiable, the content of the entry is CONSISTENT with the following FACTS: Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's Prime Minister from 3 June 1959 to 1990, then Senior Minister until August 2004 and now Minister Mentor, gave an interview, on the occasion marking the 20th anninversary of the GIC, to the Asian Wall Street Journal which published it on 22 April 2001. The AWSJ article listed the Directors of GIC - Government Investment Corporation of Singapore - for the first time, as far as I know. The then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was NOT on the list of Directors of the GIC Board which was then, and I believe still is CHAIRED by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, with the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, who is current Prime Minister, and son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, as the Deputy Chairman of GIC. Any rational thinking person would want to know why was it that the Prime Minister of Singapore at that time, Mr Goh Chok Tong, was not even on GIC's Board, since as Prime Minister he was the HEAD OF GOVERNMENT. Although the Singapore Constitution was amended by the PAP administration under Mr Lee Kuan Yew giving the President of the Republic of Singapore a DUTY to protect Singapore's reserves, the former ELECTED President who had prior to his election as President had served under Mr Lee Kuan Yew's administration for around 14 years with his last Cabinet post as the Deputy Prime Minister, had PUBLICLY let known that he was not given the list of Singapore's reserves when first taking office and it was only three and a half years later that he was given an incomplete list, with the excuse from the then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's administration that it would take 56 man years to have a complete list. As for the veracity of whatever financial statements which might be available to the other Board Members of the GIC, no one really knows, as according to Mr Lee Kuan Yew in the AWSJ interview, the financial statements of GIC were "CHECKED" - PLEASE NOTE: NOT AUDITED - by the Auditor General of Singapore, who is a CIVIL SERVANT. Mr Lee Kuan Yew had been PUBLICLY reported to have said that the "PAP IS THE GOVERNMENT", which would mean that there was/is NO INDEPENDENCE. Incidentally, the Auditor General is Mr Chuang Kwong Yong, whose first degree is in PSYCHOLOGY and had been a civil servant since his graduation and later studied obtained his Master's in Business Administration. His last most senior ranking positions were as the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Labour, which is now known as the Ministry of Manpower, and as the Chief Executive Officer of the Housing and Development Board. As far as is known, Mr Chuang had NO EXPERIENCE as an auditor before his appointment as the Auditor General, although the public do not know who in the Auditor General's Department, actually did/does the "CHECKING" of GIC's accounts and financial statements and to what degree of "CHECKING". Despite the huge losses suffered by a computer disc drive manufacturer, Micropolis, which was shut down within two years after it was bought with a total loss exceeding S$600 Million; and the accumulated loss of over US$1.0 BILLION, currently - although the loss of around US$750 million in FY2002 - suffered by Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is listed on NASDAQ and the Singapore Exchange, Ho Ching, the wife of the current Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong and who was directly responsible for the purchase of Micropolis and was directly responsible for the start up and management of Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, was appointed as the Executive Director and thus EFFECTIVELY the Chief Executive Office of Temasek Holdings, which is responsible for the managing of assets worth around S$180 BILLION.[User: Singapore Citizen]</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are lists of films set in Quebec, Dallas, New Jersey, Budapest, Sicily, Morocco, Miami and so forth already on Wikipedia. I feel that a list of films whose setting is unnamed (which has thematic and artistic interest) is at least as important as specific settings (which has personal and at best geographic interest). This topic came up during a discussion in one of my film courses and I could find no pre-existing lists on the web. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalrus125_62ad.html" title="User:Walrus125">Walrus125</a> 11:16, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> if expanded explaining the thematic signicance in a few specific films. Also definition says <i>location</i> while title says <i>city</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Localism as a term is a widespread one, however there is neither in the article nor in the sources provided here or there evidence of the use of the term as a specific political philosophy. The references in the article do not even use the term; the Guardian link above defines it solely as "the proposal that everything which can be produced locally should be produced locally" without further discussion of the other issues that 'localists believe'. I don't think this article should be deleted (although it's a close call), but it does need to be considerably rewritten to emphasize that this is an amorphous set of philosophies that may or may not include the positions that the current article seems to imply are universal. In any case, it needs citations that link the term to the ideas, otherwise it is Original Research and should be deleted. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 23:42, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Elena Roche: Please reconsider deletion. This entry would facilitate the public whereas Elena Roche receives inquiries several times a year from collectors trying to establish the identity of the artist vis a vis signatures "E. Roche" on their paintings. Elena Roche was the subject of a documentary that has been aired continually on Discovery Times Channel since 2003, and consequently she has been sought out by viewers. This listing would facilitate their search. Elena Roche has first page position in Google for her most pertinent keywords, for example: "floral watercolors" and "portrait commissions". Her website contains in excess of one hundred pages. In her "hometown" of Tver, formerly Kalinin, Russia she is a local celebrity.

<li><b>Comment</b> Looks ok to me, it's well written and informative. Who cares if it's not one of the most visited sites for Runescape? You definitely give a very bad impression when you admit stuff such as the "Liger" article and that stuff. That article is not an advertisement and it's informative enough. These people tell what it is, it's purpose and some background information on it. It should stay I think. --Cotusa 17:28, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am terribly sorry about the actions of my fellow crypters. I'm trying to edit the article now and I've eliminated whole sections of the article. I have started citing sources and following wikipedia guidelines. I can clearly see where you would think this was an ad, so I've completely changed the tone of the article. I don't know if I can change the article to conform to Wikipedia standards; it's written from as neutral a perspective as I can get, and research is backed by some sources, though it is not possible to verify some bits of material. Kevin; Original Writer</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Delete</b>: There have been many improvements to the article on 30 January. These deal with many of the criticisms above. I would have voted to delete the original version (and the flaming above doesn't help its cause), but I think the current version is not a bad article. I don't feel qualified to judge about the notability of the subject matter, but that is often subjective anyway.

<li>This is not a speedy deletion, unfortunately. CSD:G4 only allows re-deletion of something which was already deleted by AFD or other consensus.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Paxomen has at least two points that have convinced me. First, there are plenty of <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_Categories_and_lists_f710.html" title="User:Paxomen/Categories and lists">other lists</a> that are much less useful than this one (for example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japan-related_topics_8848.html" title="List of Japan-related topics">List_of_Japan-related_topics</a>). Second, Paxomen says he is willing to address many of the complaints that have been lodged against the page during this vote. Therefore, to vote to delete this page <i>now</i> is tantamount to purging an incomplete page on the grounds that it isn't very useful when incomplete. That is true of <i>every</i> page on Wikipedia! My <i>personal</i> preference would be to use categories and subcategories for this, because I won't myself find this page all that useful, but I don't vote to delete pages that I don't find useful. Perfecto pointed out that this violates the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guidelines; this is true, but I think that the genie was out of the bottle a year ago and a deletionist philosophy will never win at Wikipedia. I'm a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mergism" class="extiw" title="meta:Mergism">Mergist</a> myself, but we can't have true Mergism until Wikipedia software can force an unadorned link to redirect to a subsection of another page.

<dd>How so? Please provide an example of a time when you would need to find something about the Buffyverse and need an alphabetized list. If you already know the name of the topic, just go straight there.

<li><b>Edited/Editing</b>: Check out the article, I have added <i>discussion</i>, and <i>history</i> to each topic this kind of thing <i>cannot ever be done with categories</i>. This article can hugely benefit even more by annotation (although i have already semi-annotated many of the articles by using '|' after the link and using a more appropiate entry for the index e.g. '<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes_594e.html" title="List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes">List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes</a>' is entered into the article as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes_594e.html" title="List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes"><i>Buffy</i> episodes</a> to make more sense of the indexing system. Annotation, 'discussion' links, and 'revision' links are all impossible within categories, lists are supposed to complement categories and help the wikipedians to navigate topics. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 22:05, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have only just begun the process of annotation, and feel that an annotated index with all topics in one place is seeming more useful than even i had imagined, there are hundreds of opportunites for cross-referencing between completely different sub-categories, yet because it's a list, the reader/editor can go straight to associated topics. Just one example is annotation has the potntial to link the Buffyverse actors to their characters, and the Buffyverse characters to those who portrayed them. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 18:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would apply the same reasoning for their retention in Wikipedia to many other businesses which have grown from small independent shops to become a focal point of town and city centres and local communities. In the case of 'House of Fraser Victoria', whilst it might appear to be just another outlet of a retail giant, its history is in fact unique. For example, it was a main supplier of goods and services to the British forces in India during the 19th Century and similarly to South Africa during the Boer War. The store was established as 'The Army &amp; Navy Co-operative Society Limited' and changed its name again before being re-named 'House of Fraser Victoria'. I believe it is sensible to write my entire entry for the store under its present trading name and not former names as its history is continuing. I am in the process of expanding the aforementioned stub. <b>Please do not delete</b>. <b>Keep</b> Andrew Fife 21:00, 29 January 2006</p>

<p>If anyone wants to come to Saint Louis and attend a blood ritual and let me drink your blood so you can know I am actually a real vampire please email me (I am always looking for new donors provided you are HIV negative, No hepatitis and No Staph) because I am very careful about my health and my donors health. You are more than welcome to fly to Saint Louis, Missouri and do so. My vampirism is in my medical record as well, unlike most so call notable vampires. The isbn numbers for my books are isbn 1-59971-040-4 and Isbn 1-59971-268-7. Just becaue you Andrew, ERcheck, Meegs, and Capitalistroadster do not know me personally does not mean everything on the planet earth is a lie. The are real vampires in almost every country of the world. Some live in tribes, covens like the Massai or maybe even right next door to you. I take great offense to you saying that I am a liar, you could have easily went to my web site and emailed me or googled my name and the word vampire before you took it upon yourself to call me a liar. Also if you put in the isbn for Exodus From The Den of Demons it does show up at Borders Bookstore Nationwide in the United States but I guess Borders is just a mom and pop operation. I can gurantee you that in the future if anyone adds anything about me to wikipedia I will ask that it be deleted because I do not like being called a liar especially when I am standing up for my vampire community who hates talking to the general public because of untrue hollywood movies, and folklore stereotypes that plagues the real vampire vice the myth. Funny how everyone wants to believe the folklore and the movies but actual real vampires are demean and belittle by strangers.</p>

I'm guilty too for my edit above, but these last two edits are nothing but personal attacks.

<li>Meegs, her main claim to notability is that she is a vampire. If she actually was a vampire, she would certainly be a notable subject for an encyclopaedia, so the fact that she is not a vampire is, I feel, entirely germane to this discussion. I'm not going to defend Batman's wording though. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 09:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

So there is likely to be more entries on a DAB page. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 00:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I will add more content. And it does not make sense to me that there is a wikipedia article on Hira (since April 2005), a famous sungazer, but no article on sungazing. --<a href="../../../m/m/m/User%7EMmmsnouts_0261.html" title="User:Mmmsnouts">Mmmsnouts</a> 21:37, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hira.html" title="Hira">Hira</a> article doesn't mention sungazing at all, but I feel I must apologize. I thought the article as posted at the time -- <i>Sungazing is the practice of staring directly at the sun to receive the sun's nourishment.</i> -- was intended as a joke; I honestly didn't imagine it was something folks actually <i>believed</i>. But Google searching does turn up some pages on the subject. If you can site some references published from a reputable publisher per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I'll withdraw my nomination. <a href="../../../v/s/l/User%7EVslashg_16cb.html" title="User:Vslashg">Vslashg</a> 21:51, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Nomination Withdrawn</b>. I still think the whole notion of staring at the sun for nourishment is dangerous and silly. That said, there clearly exist communities that believe in it, and the author of this article is obviously acting in good faith. Article needs some NPOV balance but I withdraw my nomination for deletion. <a href="../../../v/s/l/User%7EVslashg_16cb.html" title="User:Vslashg">Vslashg</a> 04:23, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My Opinion(from a local punk) I'm personally from Poughkeepsie and I know Ryan Ward and see him all the time. He's a very influential person through out the scene and everyone knows him. Hes friendly with pretty much everyone and has brought unity and solidarity to a shattered scene. I believe his article should be left up as a tribute to his work in the scene of dutchess county.</p>

<p>To be fair, just because it's still in beta, doesn't mean it won't make to full stage. It has a large amount of growing players every day and it's quite possible it will continue. Just give it a while; if the game fails, obviously this will be removed. MattShipwrighter 23:04, 29th January 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Weak Delete</b> I nominate this primarily since the game is still in Beta, and therefore may be somewhat non-notable.
