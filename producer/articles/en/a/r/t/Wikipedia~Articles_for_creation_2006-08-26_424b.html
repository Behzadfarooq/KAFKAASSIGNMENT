<p>Ryan Slattery has a deep dark secret or two. Number one, he is getting very angry at the authors of this page. Number two, he thinks that an essay on Humanism will be everyone's downfall. In the Sacred Trinity of MCC, he is the Holy Spirit, because he has to intervene the coolness that are the Father and the Son. He did 5 practice maps of the city-states of Italy, and he believes he is going to ace the quiz. Which he probably is. He likes when rock stars sing songs about coffee, pour scalding hot coffee on the audience, and then makes them scream for their cream.</p>

<p>Ammonium Dinitramide is an ionic salt that decomposes under heat to leave only nitrogen, oxygen, and water. It was originally invented by the Soviet Russians, but remained classified until it was rediscovered in the United States in the 80s. It makes an excellent solid rocket oxidizer with a slightly higher specific impulse than Ammonium Perchlorate and more importantly, does not leave hydrogen chloride fumes. The salt is prone to detonation under high temperatures and shock more so than the perchlorate. 1 Synthesis can be carried out with ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, and super concentrated sulfuric acid, to whick a nonammonical base must be added before the acid dintramide decomposes. The final product comes by fractional crystallization. Currently the chemical is very expensive but mass production should reduce the cost. 2</p>

<p>The frullet is a haircut which has become popular in youth who are experimenting with their personal image. It consists of a shaved head with a large fringe which hangs over the face. The fashion started in the small town of Kojonup and has branched out since.</p>
<p>The Frullet represents social frustration at the current situations happening in the world. The haircut is also starting to take hold in the "EMO" sub-culture.</p>

<p>Autopsy Prophecy is a Folk Viking Death Metal band from the Port Huron region of Michigan. They are well known for their use of groove guitar rhythms, death metal growls, Viking and Norse imagery, and multi-layered keyboards. The band was created when Dave (Vocals and Bass) and Scott (Guitar) got together through a drummer they both knew. While trying to get a feel for each others' style, they decided to take the band in a different direction then they had at first tried. Michigan wasn't exactly a place for Norse mythology, so the two decided to make it one. Neither of them had heard of any folk metal from Michigan, and wanted to be the first. Both were fans of the European Metal Scene and were mainly interested in bands from the north, suck as Norway and Finland. After a few months, they band decided to add keyboards to their sound, and recruited Rachael Gardner for the job. The are considered one of the premier metal bands in Michigan from the past ten years. It is said that they will influnce death and folk metal for many years in Michigan and elsewhere. Through the internet, they were able to create a worldwide fanbase and were invited to play many open-air fesitvals across Europe. In July of 2006 they disbanded, before they had the chance to make it over seas. While the band never had the chance to record a true album, they have recorded 4 demos and planned on one live album (Crucified Alive) which was not recorded do to problems with the venue. The 4 demos that they recorded are highly sought after by metal fans from across the world, though it is said that if you can find a member, they are more then happy to give you free copies. Common lyrical themes include Norse Mythology, Cthulu Mythos, "Forgotten Realms" books, Death, Horror Stories, and the protesting of George W. Bush.</p>
<p>Members: David F. Phetteplace - Vocals, Bass, and Lyrics. Scott Hayden - Guitars and Lyrics. Rachael "Raye" Gardner - Keyboards</p>
<p>Former Member(s): John "Rocker" Cox - Bass</p>
<p>Trivia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dave is often refered to as "Drizzt" or "Wulfgar", popular characters from his favorite book series. Sometimes fans refer to him as the "Norseman" or "Northman" do to his Viking look and interest.</li>
<li>Autopsy Prophecy was Rachaels first band. She didn't know how to play keyboards until she was asked to join the band.</li>
<li>Dave (Vocals and Bass) and Raye (Keyboards) are married to each other.</li>
<li>The members consider themselves best friends and family, even after the breakup.</li>
<li>Their final demo is considered one of the most sought after recordings due to their rarity.</li>
<li>Were known for their confrontation of Nazis and Right-Wing Conservatives after their shows, which sometimes resulted in violence.</li>
<li>Although many people believe Dave to be a Satanist or a member of the Norse religion Astru, Dave is an atheist.</li>

<p>Kiesa Kay, author and educator, created book UNIQUELY GIFTED: Identifying and Meeting the Needs of Twice Exceptional Students, published by Avocus in 2000. At that time, she began speaking across the country on the subject of how to parent and educate gifted children who have learning differences and disabilities. Her next book, HIGH IQ KIDS, will be published by Free Spirit Press in 2007. She co-edited that book with Deborah Robson and Judy Fort Brenneman, and it addresses the needs of profoundly gifted children.</p>
<p>Kiesa, a former crisis counselor and shelterhouse manager, has been a creative writer and social activist for many years. Her first play, THUNDER IS THE MOUNTAIN'S VOICE, was performed at Rocky Mountain National Park and Park Village Playhouse in 1998, and she has been researching a second play on the sculptor Camille Claudel. PATC Press in Canada has published two chapbooks of Kiesa's poetry, CARESS: POEMS FOR LOVERS, and WINDSTORM: POEMS OF DIVORCE. In 2006, in memory of her friend Robin Carrington, Kiesa founded Oleander Cottage in the South of France as a self-catering retreat for writers and artists. She recently completed her memoir there and titled it TORNADO ALLEY. Kiesa's work consistently embodies strength in times of adversity, and she has been a reviewer, reader, and contributor to several magazines.</p>

Why 3D pixel?<br />
There are many websites on the Internet, which offer for advertisement "pixel" space. All these websites offer the same simplicity. BuildBestVirtual3dCity.com is completely something different!</p>
<p>To have the building, 3D space with own ad in the best and the biggest virtual space will be an important milestone of development and use of the Internet space.<br />
The reason why page gives 3D Buildings is that anybody have the chance to have a place in the best and the biggest virtual 3D pixel City. 3D pixel City will become a big part of the Internet history.</p>

<p>A folk art, exclusively practiced by the Nair community of Palakkad area, it owes its origin to the pursuit of martial arts in this region, which was under the constant threat of an attack from neighbouring Konganaadu(now a part of Tamil Nadu). Dance and comedy were pitched in to add vigour and colour to these training practices.</p>
<p>It combines the agile movements of martial arts with the rhythmic grace of folk dance. It is performed during March-April in temples as well as places called Thara, a venue for informal gatherings. The performance is accompanied by folk songs and percussion instruments.</p>

<p>Chittur Konganpad</p>
<p>Kerala, once a land of small kingdoms, had witnessed several pitched battles. Few in the state commemorate the war victories of their forefathers. However, people of Chittor in Palakkad district had assimilated a story of triumph into their cultural veins and in every February (on first Monday after the dark lunar in Kumbam, Malayalam calendar) they remember a war they had fought and won; Konganpada, the only war festival in the state. The history of this festival is interwoven with myths.</p>
<p>Konganpada recollects a war the Chittor Nairs fought against King Rajadhi Raja of Kong dynast from Coimbathore in which the former won. Chittorians believe that Goddess Bhagavathy saved them from the Chola King.</p>
<p><br />
(According to historical version Kings of Kongu attacked Palakkad and the King of Kochin with the help of Zamorins defeated them. and Konganpada is being celebrated to keep alive that great victory. The festival begins with chilambu; recalling Konganpada’s declaration of the war and a perturbed Chittor people thronging the Goddess Bhagavathy pleading to save them from the ordeal. Next morning a flag is hoisted indicating their readiness for the war.</p>
<p>When dusk falls, people gather near the temple premise ands after three popgun shots march to a place supposed to be the battleground. Oracle leads the procession while others hold torches. At midnight the procession returns from the battleground.</p>
<p>Next morning procession resumes from a nearby kavu, this time with colour and festivity. Girls are being paraded in men’s wear (kolam) on the ground that the Goddess encountered the Konganpada in man’s robs. Cultural programmes are also staged in the pageant. In the evening the procession encircles the temple and a messenger from Konganpada reads scroll declaring the war.</p>
<p>About 10pm Kongan appears and the symbolic war begins. Rival groups run the horses to and fro to recreate a battlefield- like situation. After this Kongan team retreats. A few persons feign death whose bodies are being taken back to their wailing relatives. Later the festival ends with an hour-long percussion. This may be one of the bizarre festivals in the state.</p>

<p>This system is used in industries, handling fluid in pipelines, to avoid disaster because of human error. this system ensures a particular sequence in valve operation. eg. someone by mistake first open the tank inlet valve and pump fluid into the tank forgetting to open the tank PSV and bleeder vent valves may cause a pressure rise inside the tank. and a consequent disaster. The concept is, you operate the first valve (open/close) by inserting a key with you, after this valve is open or closed (as required) it release the key of the valve second in this sequence. and this key does not fit any other valve except the second. and so on. thus a sequence is ensured.</p>

<p>Jennifer Bolender was a teenager who was murdered by her boyfriend and two friends in Niagara Falls, New York on December 14, 2002.</p>
<p>Daniel Pardee, Christopher Cummings and his brother Kyle, all teens themselves at the time of the slaying, were each charged with second-degree murder and first and second-degree conspiracy for their roles in a crime that left many in the Falls shaken by its brutality.</p>
<p>The trio took a blood oath and promised to take their secret to their graves, but quickly turned on each other when the cops confronted them. The Cummings brothers both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified at Pardee’s trial.</p>
<p>The testimony at the trial showed that Pardee, a one time boyfriend of Bolender’s, attacked her on the pedestrian bridge as she was walking with him and Kyle Cummings. Pardee punched Bolender, knocking her to the ground at the base of the bridge and then kicked Bolender repeatedly, stomped on her face and, with Cummings, dragged her more than 100 feet back up on the bridge.</p>
<p>"Once she was there, he (Pardee) hung on to the railing and jumped on her head until her face was unrecognizable," Caroline Wojtaszek, the lead prosecutor in the case said. "Then he stabbed her again and again in her throat."</p>
<p>After leaving the crime scene, Pardee and Kyle Cummings returned about 45 minutes later, with Christopher Cummings, because they were concerned that Bolender might not be dead. They were right, she was alive, but just barely.</p>
<p>At Pardee's direction, Wojtaszek said, Christopher Cummings then cut Bolender's neck "almost in two."</p>
<p>A jury took just three hours to convict Pardee of murder and conspiracy. He’s now serving a 25 years to life prison sentence.</p>
<p>Kyle Cummings is serving a six years to life sentence. Christopher Cummings is behind bars for a nine years to life sentence.</p>
<p>There is a memorial in honor of Jennifer on the pedestrian overpass above the LaSalle Expressway in Niagara falls, New York. Jennifer is also recognized at the New York State Crime Victims' memorial located in Albany, New York</p>

<p>I</p>
<pre>
                Titan! to whose immortal eyes
</pre>
<p>The sufferings of mortality Seen in their sad reality, Were not as things that gods despise; What was thy pity's recompense? A silent suffering, and intense; The rock, the vulture, and the chain, All that the proud can feel of pain, The agony they do not show, The suffocating sense of woe, Which speaks but in its loneliness, And then is jealous lest the sky Should have a listener, nor will sigh Until its voice is echoless.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Titan! to thee the strife was given Between the suffering and the will, Which torture where they cannot kill; And the inexorable Heaven, And the deaf tyranny of Fate, The ruling principle of Hate. Which for its pleasure doth create</p>
<pre>
           The things it may annihilate,           
</pre>
<p>Refused thee even the boon to die: The wretched gift eternity Was thine -- and thou hast borne it well. All that the Thunderer wrung from thee Was but the menace which flung back</p>
<pre>
           On him the torments of thy rack;
</pre>
<p>The fate thou didst so well foresee, But would not to appease him tell; And in thy Silence was his Sentence, And in his Soul a vain repentance, And evil dread so ill dissembled That in his hand the lightnings trembled.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Thy Godlike crime was to be kind, To render with thy precepts less The sum of human wretchedness, And strengthen Man with his own mind; But baffled as thou wert from high, Still in thy patient energy,</p>
<pre>
           In the endurance, and repulse
                  Of thine impenetrable Spirit,
</pre>
<p>Which Earth and Heaven could not convulse,</p>
<pre>
             A mighty lesson we inherit: 
</pre>
<p>Thou art a symbol and a sign</p>
<pre>
             To Mortals of their fate and force;
                Like thee, Man is in part divine,
</pre>
<p>A troubled stream from a pure source;</p>
<pre>
           And Man in portions can foresee
</pre>
<p>His own funereal destiny; His wretchedness, and his resistance, And his sad unallied existence: To which his Spirit may oppose Itself -- and equal to all woes, And a firm will, and a deep sense, Which even in torture can descry Its own concenter'd recompense, Triumphant where it dares defy, And making Death a Victory.</p>
<p>Diodati, July, 1816</p>

Eduard Opitsch (1900-1991), quarry owner. In his <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarry.html" title="Quarry">quarry</a> in Langenaltheimer Hart was founded the so called Maxberg specimen of Archeopteryx litographica. Opitsch gave the <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil.html" title="Fossil">fossil</a> to the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxberg_Museum_081a.html" title="Maxberg Museum">Maxberg Museum</a> at <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solnhofen.html" title="Solnhofen">Solnhofen</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> he integrated the fossil again into his private collection. When Opitsch died in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeopteryx.html" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a> was no part of his collection anymore. So the Maxberg specimen in missed since 1991. People who knowed Opitsch personally described him as a bit strange, queer person. The destiny of the precious fossil is still unknown. Just some photographs are still existing.<br />

Productization is defined as the process by which an organization takes as internally<br />
developed application, process or procedure that was not originally intended for<br />
commercal use and converts it into a package or offering that can be sold to customers.<br />
Typically, this would involve simplifying installation of the product or service and/or adding<br />
documentation and help support to the package. In some cases, it may involve setting up<br />
customer and technical support services.<br />

== Scarlet Soho (band) ==<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scarlet Soho was formed in 1999 by former Elementary4 members Jim Knights (vocals/guitars/programming) and Lee Kinrade (guitars/synths/programming) and bassist Scarlet, who they met at the Reading Festival that year.<br />
<br />
In October 2002 Scarlet Soho released their low-key debut single Disconnected through Vivid Records and toured the UK extensively, including support slots with The Faint, Lolita Storm and Delays.<br />
<br />
In 2004 the band signed to Human Recordings, although Lee left the band shortly before the release of the band's debut EP for the label, Isolation.<br />
<br />
Despite this, Jim and Scarlet re-grouped to begin work with Delays producer Justin Callaway in Southampton.<br />
<br />
The outcome, Divisions Of Decency, was release in November 2004. The album sways between the up beat, theatrical, electro rock of Magazine and the starker pop sensibilities of their contemporaries Interpol and The Sneaker Pimps.<br />
<br />
For the album tour Nick Haynes was hired to play guitar and synths.<br />
<br />
In May 2005 the band released Modern Radio as a single to officially mark the end of six months of touring (culminating in a headline slot at the Marquee in Leicester Square at the same time at the premier of Star Wars Episode 3).<br />
<br />
Scarlet Soho then took off several months to work on new material but returned to the live arena in 2006 with a one-off support slot with Razorlight as well as several dates with Delays on their UK tour and IAMX on the German leg of their European tour.<br />

The name of this village is not correct in your article. the correct name is Oxylithos, which comes from the combination of two words: "oxys (sharp)" + "lithos (stone)".

== The Life and Times of a Criminal: Max Baird ==<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Born in 1988, Max grew to instant stardom in his playground, often preying on weaker children and taking their clothes, money and candy, along with the ocassional dignity. At the age of 8 Max was seen roundhouse kicking his history teacher, Mr. Hasapis, in the face, then stealing his wallet. Max seems to be accustomed to crime and the world of it suits his quite well. Now at the age of 17, living in Boston Mass. the city is at his mercy and a FBI federal task force has been formed to capture him. Due to his unique dispositon, they have found that shooting him with bullets only makes him angry and have loaded all their guns with elephant tranquilizers. Max is such an addict for surfing that he has been known to do unseemly things for rides to the beach, another board in his quiver, and the occasional makeout session. Max enjoys surfing, LSD, candlelit dinners, tequila, girl scouts, ninjas, automatic weapons and fast cars. I have seen many things in this life, the rise and fall of great people, I have even seen a full grown man satisfy a camel, but I have never seen anything like this guy....<br />

Bharra<br />
<br />
In the beginning of the 9th century A.D., the Gurjara Pratihara king, Nagbhatta II, overthrew the Ayodhyas who was then ruling at Kannauj, and made this city the capital of his growing empire which rose to its greatest height in the reign of the famous Mihirbhoj (836-885 A.D.). From the time of Mahipal the power of Kannauj become to decline and Avadh was divided into small chieftainships, but all of them had ultimately to yield to newly growing power of Gahadwals of Kannauj. Jaychandra(1170-1194 A.D.), the last important ruler of the dynasty was killed in the battle of Chandawar(near Etawah) fighting against the invading army of Shahabuddin Mohd. Gauri. Soon after his death Kannauj was occupied by the Turks. His grandson Mr. Crooke says, afterwards fled to Kantit in the Mirzapur District and overcoming the Bhar Raja of that district, he founded the family of Gaharwar Rajas of Kantit, Mirzapur, which was recently still in existence. All the Gaharwar Rajas of Kantit trace their origin to Benares or Bijapur,. The predecorrors of the Gaharwars were the Bhars, an race of great enterprise, who build forts, dams and the like.<br />
<br />
Bhar are a a Ancient Rajput clan from the Benares district, of whom the Raj-Bhar and the Bharpatwa are sections, though they do not eat nor intermarry. They are said to have ruled the tract from Gorakhpur to Bhundelkhand and Suagor, and many old forts they are ascribed to them; but in that part of India they are now filling the meanest situations. On the hills to the east of Mirzapur, the principalities of Korar, Kurrich, and Huraha are, however, each held by Bhur rajas. Many of the old stone forts, embankments, and excavations are in Gorakhpur, Azimghur, Jonpur, Mirzapur, and Allahabad, and remnants of the people are still there. The celebrated fortress of Vijayagarh is still recognised as a Bharawati fort; and a pargana in Benares is called Bhadoi, properly Bhar-dai. It is sometimes said that they might have a connection with the Bharatas.<br />
<br />
According to legends, for centuries Basti was a wilderness and that greater part of Avad was occupied by the Bhars. The capital of the Bhars , 5 miles from Mirzapur , is said to have had 150 temples. Elliot (Supplemental Glossary, art. Bhar) remarks that “common tradition assigns to the Bhars the possession of the whole tract from Gorakhpur to Bundelkhand and Saugor, and many subterranean caverns in Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Mirzapur and Allahabad which are ascribed to them, would seem to indicate no inconsiderable advance in civilisation”. Mr Smith argues that the Bhars adopted the jain religion, but there is no evidence for that. The Gaharwars were probably derived from the Bhars, and the Chandels are said to be a branch of the Gaharwars.<br />

== Global village 2006 ==<br />
<br />
<br />
Global village 2006 was a camp that took place in Kent show ground between 29th of july and the 8th of augaust 2006.<br />
<br />
==<br />
About the project ==<br />
<br />
This project aims to empower young people to become actively involved in achieving the Goals. The information and activities on this website are open to youth groups, schools, and young people everywhere. The Global Village project is being undertaken by the Woodcraft Folk on behalf of the International Falcon Movement (IFM-SEI).<br />
<br />
Through the Global Village programme, young people will explore ways in which such a human-centred, democratic approach to future peace, development, and justice can be constructed by children and young people.<br />
<br />
Adversities such as conflict, poverty, infectious diseases and human rights violations threaten the survival and dignity of millions of people today. Communities and individuals are unevenly affected by the challenges of globalization. These problems are not adequately addressed by conventional approaches alone. The UN Secretary-General has called on the world community to advance the twin goals of 'freedom from want' and 'freedom from fear'. A new human-centred approach has to be developed if these issues are to be addressed in an effective and comprehensive way.<br />
<br />
-- United Nations Commission on Human Security<br />
This idea is closely linked to the work which the Woodcraft Folk and IFM have already undertaken on sustainability which has looked at, for example, the idea that the major conflicts the world will face in the years to come will result from the inequitable access to, and use of, the world's resources.<br />
<br />
Similarly, 'freedom from want' for large numbers of the world's population will only be possible if more sustainable lifestyles are adopted by those who currently take more than their fair share.<br />
<br />
Conflict, imperialism, racism, underdevelopment and exploitation are not problems that have disappeared with increasing globalisation - they have worsened. The impact of these evils on the future for children and young people around the globe is devastating. Millions of children suffer horror as labourers, prostitutes, soldiers and refugees.<br />
<br />
Global Village 2006 will aim to raise awareness of what needs to be done if future generations of children are to grow up 'free from want' and 'free from fear' and empower young people to pursue this goal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Participants</b><br /></p>
<pre>
Around 4000 young people (aged 6 - 20) and 1000 adults will participate directly in the project. Approximately two-thirds of these will be from the UK with the remainder coming from Europe, Africa, North and South America, and Asia. <br />
</pre>
<p><br />
These participants will come from the Woodcraft Folk, other member organisations of the International Falcon Movement, and other invited groups working with young people.<br />
<br />
It is estimated that around 20,000 young people will make use of the internet-based part of the programme and many of these are expected to come from the UK as the project will be promoted here. The Woodcraft Folk's on-line Education for Sustainable Development resources have been widely used in schools and youth groups around the world and we anticipate a similar take up.<br />
<br />
<b>1946 - 2006</b><br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
In 1946, in the immediate aftermath of global war, the Woodcraft Folk hosted an international camp in Brighton. It brought together children and young people from previously warring countries, to create, for a fortnight, a community of hope for a better future and a better world. The event was instrumental in helping restore the shattered international links between children's and youth organisations dedicated to peace and social justice. <br />
</pre>
<p><br />
Sixty years on, in 2006, the Woodcraft Folk will be hosting another major event, on behalf of the International Falcon Movement, the international organisation which the 1946 camp helped rebuild.<br />
<br />
Children and young people continue to be the victims of war, of poverty and exploitation, and of racism. Today, however, we live more than ever in an interlocking world, where solutions have to be found to the problems created by globalisation, by international co-operation and understanding.<br />
<br />
Because of our strong belief in equality, co-operation, internationalism, world peace and the protection of the natural environment, the Woodcraft Folk and its sister organizations in the International Falcon Movement are firmly committed to playing what part we can in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.<br />
<br />
We recognize not only that failure to reduce global poverty levels will have serious consequences for us all but that our own actions are amongst its causes.<br />
<br />
We have strong links with young people's organizations in countries in the developing world and believe that the involvement of these young people is vital in the development of appropriate solutions and outcomes.<br />
<br />
We have a proven track record of successfully introducing young people to the serious issues facing our world, and of motivating them to take practical action to help solve these.<br />
<br />
Global Village 2006 will build a community of young people and adults working together with optimism and determination to change the world for the better.<br />

== Arcapita Ventures ==<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcapita Ventures, a $200 million dedicated investment fund launched in October 2005, focuses on growth stage enterprises primarily in the United States. From its offices in Atlanta, Arcapita typically acts as the lead investor in companies operating in the (i) healthcare, (ii) information technology and (iii) industrial technology sectors. The investment team looks for businesses that have established technologies and customer bases, and where its investment capital, network and expertise can be applied to scale a proven business model. Typically, the Fund invests between $4 and $8 million in an initial round of funding, with the capability to invest up to $20 million over the life of a portfolio company. Where appropriate, we partner with other leading venture firms who can bring additional capital, market reach and overall support to our portfolio companies. In addition to providing growth capital, the Fund selectively considers venture buyouts of companies with enterprise values of less than $40 million<br />
<br />
Within our targeted sectors, we look for companies that have at least $2 million in revenues over the prior twelve months. We seek businesses that have proprietary technology, clear value propositions, referenceable customers, robust margins and strong management teams. We are attracted to markets that have clear growth dynamics and strong profit opportunities. As the lead or co-lead investor, we expect to have significant influence with our portfolio companies as board members and strategic advisors. Finally, we seek to work with management teams that are aligned with our need to achieve liquidity with our portfolio companies through an IPO or strategic sale within three to seven years after our initial investment.<br />
<br />
Arcapita Ventures is led by a seasoned investment team that has collectively invested in more than 100 portfolio companies over the past 25 years. Collectively, the team brings more than 60 years of experience in our sectors from a number of different perspectives: venture investing, start-up operations, senior executive management, business development, investment banking and corporate governance. The team operates the Fund under four key principles: (i) we will evaluate all investment opportunities with an aggressive, yet highly-disciplined approach; (ii) we will work tirelessly with our management teams to ensure the most effective utilization of our investment capital; (iii) we recognize that long-term success will only happen if we make our entrepreneurs, co-investors and service providers successful as well; and (iv) we will treat all our stakeholders with fairness and respect.<br />
<br />
Active portfolio management is the hallmark of Arcapita Ventures. Our investment team has a national and international network of strategic partners, co-investors, senior managers and potential customers. Where appropriate, we leverage the existing portfolio companies and networks of the broader Arcapita network. While we do not expect to be involved with the day-to-day operations of our portfolio companies, we provide critical operational and strategic support to our companies. These activities include making introductions to strategic partners and potential customers, assisting in the creation of properly aligned sales force compensation structures, identifying and evaluating potential acquisition opportunities and setting overall corporate strategic priorities.<br />

A cartridge save refers to a gaming console which saves its data on the gaming cartridge, not the console itself. A CD cannot save data onto itself, so CD based consoles do not 'cartridge' save.<br />

The oranged finned loach, (Botia modesta) is a blue loach with orange fins. They are shy, and grows to a size about 20cm. They must have worms in their diet, otherwise their fin will turn yellow. Do not dip this fish into dyes, since it i very, very sensitive to chemicals. (Source: Aquarium fishes) (Book)<br />

<p>The magnificent French comic actor Louis de Funès demonstrates his talent in this French-Italian film.He plays Charles Bosquier- a grumpy principal of a reputable boys college.Bosquier always controls his students very strictly.His problems start when an exchange program sends an attractive 19 year-old girl to his college in order to spend the summer vacation there and learn more about the French culture.Bosquier's son falls in love with her and they run away.So,the principal is on the verge of madness and he starts chasing them. The film contains lots of funny scenes and humor and of course the superb acting of Louis de Funès.Honestly,the scenario has some weak points.Definitely,"Les Grandes vacances" is not one of the best films of Funès but it is worth seeing.<br />

== What is a Replacement Window? ==<br />
<br />
What is a replacement window?<br />
<br />
A true replacement window is a window that's custom built to fit within the opening of an existing window. It is a custom measured item designed to fit exactly and can be normally installed without removing or disturbing the interior and exterior stops/trim work around the window.<br />
What are various windows made of and what will work best for me?<br />
<br />
Basically there are three types of materials used. Aluminum windows, with their easily scratched painted surfaces, conduct both heat and cold, so they're very poor insulators. Wood windows, which require constant painting and caulking, can absorb moisture, making them difficult to open and close. They can even rot. Suburban Construction's solid vinyl windows, however, never need painting and won't show scratches, because the color goes throughout the material. This is why vinyl windows are quickly becoming the most popular choice for both new construction and replacement applications. In addition, you should certainly consider custom-sized windows for the very simple reason that they'll fit better. Stock-sized windows require extensive carpentry work both inside and outside your house. That can be very costly and inconvenient. Suburban Construction's custom-sized windows, on the other hand, are manufactured to fit your existing window opening. You get the style and options you want while maintaining your glass area.<br />
Why do I want a custom measured replacement window system?<br />
<br />
Do you want your home "just good enough" or "I think that will work? The answer is of course not! Standard or lumberyard windows are always cheaper, but when you take into consideration, the increased costs of labor and the problems with how to trim or finish out the inside of the window opening. Who wants a stock size window? Custom windows are CUSTOM! These will provide the upmost energy performance, therefore you should see some energy savings and will install with ease. Plus, what is more entertaining that custom designing your own home!<br />
If I do put new replacement windows in my house, will they really improve the value of a home?<br />
<br />
Yes, for a variety of reasons. First, you may realize savings on your heating and cooling bills. Second, they're virtually maintenance-free, which eliminates painting costs. And finally, the transferability of one of the strongest warranties in the business may easily add to the resale value of your home. Many of the considerations that future homebuyers look for in a new home are kitchens, bathrooms and windows. Let's face it, curb appeal is very important to your home and by investing in new energy efficient windows will definitely be a great buying tool if you ever want to put your home up on the market.<br />
Can I install just 2 or 3 windows at a time?<br />
<br />
Of course - many of our jobs sold are partial orders. Many people can only afford to install a few windows at a time. Suburban Construction will always let you work around your own time frame and within your own budget.<br />
Is there any difference in how windows are made?<br />
<br />
There are two basic types of construction: Mechanically fastened windows are screwed together at the corners. And welded windows, becoming more and more popular, that use a chemical or heat process for joining. Suburban Construction's uses mechanically fastened and welded windows. Our mechanically fastened windows feature a unique overlap corner design for extra strength, while our welded versions utilize state-of-the-art heat welding equipment. Beware of windows with mitered corners screwed together or chemically welded corners, as they probably won't perform as well for you.<br />
Can I replace my old windows with different styles or types?<br />
<br />
Certainly, since all Suburban Construction replacement windows are part of Suburban Construction Window System. You may want to consult a design specialist to find the type of window that best complements your home's natural design. No matter what style or combination of styles you choose, however, Suburban Construction can custom-manufacture it all for you.<br />
What is the process of getting new windows installed?<br />
<br />
Three easy steps and you can have your windows installed from Suburban: 1.Have your appointment date assigned with a Suburban Construction designer to get your detailed project spec sheet. 2.After you have authorized your contract agreement, Suburban Construction will have a measure-man measure each opening, so you know you get a perfect fit designed just for your home. 3.We will contact you to set up your installation date and you can relax and enjoy your new purchase!<br />
Can I have new windows installed in cold or in the hot summer weather?<br />
<br />
Yes, that's when most homeowners will experience the best results from new replacement windows.<br />
What about noise reduction?<br />
<br />
Homeowners with Suburban Construction Window Systems say there's a noticeable reduction in the amount of noise that enters their homes.<br />
Do Suburban Construction windows require a lot of maintenance?<br />
<br />
Because our frames and sashes are made of vinyl, you can say goodbye to painting and caulking. Suburban Construction windows won't stick, and you don't have to remove storm windows in order to clean them. In fact, you can do it all from inside your home. An occasional wipe with a damp cloth will keep your windows looking like new for years to come.<br />
What is more important in saving energy, the frame or the glass?<br />
<br />
Since 80% of a window is glass, real heating and cooling savings come from what is known as "improved glass performance," not a high R-value on the frame. Suburban Construction uses the latest technology, known as a Super G insulated glass spacer system. This spacer system helps to improve the performance and the longevity of the insulated glass unit, and is standard on all Suburban Construction windows.<br />
What energy-saving options should I know about?<br />
<br />
You should give careful consideration to Suburban Construction's Insulated Glass Package, featuring Stay Clean Glass, Tuff Glass or Tuf Glass, Low E2 glass and argon gas. Low E2 glass is an excellent barrier against ultraviolet rays which fade carpet, furniture, draperies, and even woodwork. Argon gas is colorless, odorless, nonflammable, nontoxic, and above all, a safe, inert gas that is heavier than air. Not only does argon gas help to increase the energy efficiency of a window, but helps to make your home quieter as well. When Suburban Construction windows are equipped with the LoE2 glass and argon gas, they automatically meet or exceed the energy-saving requirements for all three climate zones set forth by the Energy Star Window program.<br />
What is the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) and why is it so important?<br />
<br />
The NFRC is an independent, non profit organization made up of representatives from manufacturers, suppliers, builders, specifiers, architects, state code and energy offices, utilities, consumer groups and the federal government. NFRC offers a single, uniform system for standardizing the energy performance of the glass, as well as the entire window. NFRC provides independent, credible and accurate energy performance information that you need to make an informed choice about your windows.<br />
What is the Energy Star Program?<br />
<br />
The Energy Star program was created by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy to help consumers in the recognition of energy-efficient products. This program also promotes the environmental and economic benefits of these products through the Energy Star label and other program activities.<br />
Aren't all window warranties practically the same?<br />
<br />
Not really. There are as many warranties as there are window manufacturers. Some brand name factory warranties cover just the sash and frame. The rest is left up to the local fabricator who may or may not cover it. Your warranty is only as good as the company behind it. With Suburban Construction's manufacturers, your unit is warranted from the extrusion and parts to the glass and construction by a Lifetime Limited Warranty*, with transferability provisions. It's one of the most comprehensive available, just what you'd expect from an industry leader.<br />

== Kudos Game ==<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Kudos Game was produced in 2006 by small software developer Positech Games. Kudos is a turn-based strategy game which simulates ten years in the life of year character. Gamers start out by developing a character of their choosing based on the provided avatars and four characteristics; IQ, culture, Happiness and Confidence. You then have to develop the characters skills and abilities through reading books, attending evening classes and performing. These in turn effect your employability, allowing you to gain jobs with higher salaries - however beware as the higher paid the job, the greater the effect on your stress and fatigue.<br />
<br />
It has developed a small following who help test the latest versions of the game and produce custom content such as character avatars.<br />
