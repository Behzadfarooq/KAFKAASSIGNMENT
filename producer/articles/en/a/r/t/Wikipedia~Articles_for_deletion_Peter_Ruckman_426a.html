<li><b>Keep</b>While every suggestion deserves to be examined on the basis of its own merit, one cannot (or should not) separate this one from the edits that the above user has made to this page.

<li>Changing my vote to <b>Keep</b>. The more I look into this the more it seems "Ruckmanism" is an honest-to-god notable issue for many fundamentalist/KJV-only Christians.

<li>User Arbusto has made numerous inconsistent edits (removing links because Wiki "is not a links page" and then adding his/her own choice of links) and seems to have a poor handle on the language (failing to see repetition in the presentation). In addition, User Arbusto objects to links to notable graduates of the institution - a standard feature of colleges and universities on Wiki. While the institution in question is not accredited (something the entry itself admits), it is mentioned on several other Wiki pages, none of which have been edited by any of the individuals User Arbusto singles out. Thus, the singling out exercise is a mere distraction, and a sily one at that. Clearly User Arbusto has not done his/her homework regarding the significance of this institution and its presence on Wiki apart from this entry. Wiki would do itself a great disservice to allow someone of this mindset to have any influence over the decision to retain an entry. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 172.152.119.232 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.152.119.232_7e4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.152.119.232">contribs</a>)].--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:22, 28 February 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>Appreciate the coaching, but what you have written does not having any bearing on the inconsistent edits or poor use of the language. If he/she has a "known" for this sort of thing, he/she should be suspended. While you are dismissing factual considerations as personal attacks, note all of the time, energy and effort the "known" Arbusto has put into editing a page that he/she now wants removed.

<dd>My "paranoid user routine" addresses a common -- and frankly pathetic -- tactic employed by new users who, lacking valid arguments for or feeling insecure about notability, neutrality, importance, verifiability and other such normal encyclopedic and scholarly standards for self-promotion, original unpublished research, or obsessive fancruft they try to introduce here, feel the need to resort to out of clear and apparent desperation. But, being new, you don't realize how transparent and ineffective these attempts to bully opinion are -- indeed, they often backfire -- because, being new, you don't realize how moldy and hackneyed the tactics are -- the suggestion that they be numbered is for the convenience of experienced editors who are responding to them, to save typing. Your particular act, I'm afraid, is so old it has whiskers, and if you're frustrated that it's being challenged...well, learn to cope. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 13:55, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> since it seems that Ruckman's principal claims to fame are heading an unaccredited college (unaccredited? who'd have guessed?) and being an author; his books are published by a publisher which looks very much as if it exists primarily to publish his books. This looks like a walled garden to me. I see no credible evidence of wider coverage (zero Google News hits, for example) and though he may indeed be a figure of some note within the KJ Only movement, that is itself a minor movement. Above all, I am having serious trouble finding appropriately neutral coverage of him from reliable sources, I'd say the article is functionally unverifiable from a neutral POV, and the subject is in any case of questionable notability. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:50, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm amused by the idea that only editors with hits on Google should be able to argue to delete articles. I still think the article should be kept, but I sort of wish some people weren't on my side in this. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 16:38, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> Ruckman's statements are well-documented. He is one of the best-known polarizing figures in Christian theology. He appears to carry a lot of clout in this field. He is almost certainly notable. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 19:30, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> After doing a Google search, I found lots of articles about, referring to, opposing, supporting, villifying, and canonizing Ruckman and his teachings. There's hundreds of different sources regarding him and discussing his theological viewpoints (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is definately NOT a problem here). I really can't see any reason why this should be deleted. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 21:05, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course, the notion that the person was not notable was not based on any empirical evidence. It was based on personal ignorance, animosity toward the topic, or immaturity with respect to editing. Arbusto (is that is his real name? oh it just HAS to be!) would like to frame that as a personal insult, but, really, what are the other options, given the empirical evidence. Notability should be based on information, not personal bias, ignorance or animosity.</li>

<li>Agreed. I assume PSRuckman and our prickly anon are the same, and a quick google will tell you the likely identity.
