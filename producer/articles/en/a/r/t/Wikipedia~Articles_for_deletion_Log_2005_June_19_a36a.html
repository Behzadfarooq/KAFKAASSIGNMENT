(Rubric at the start of the article could set out what would count.) There are many notable historical examples of remarkable coincidences, some of which had important consequences (and are worthy of collection in one place).

Re the encyclopedic point, if <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_coincidence.html" title="Mathematical coincidence">Mathematical coincidence</a> is legitimate (effectively a list of mathematical coincidences) then surely a more general list of coincidences (including reference to the mathematical ones) also should be. <a href="../../../b/f/i/User%7EBfinn_cf83.html" title="User:Bfinn">Ben Finn</a> 00:59, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's not what I said at all. I was making the point that you were defending this page of genuine coincidences on the basis that there was another page of coincidence, which the maths page is not all. The maths 'coincidences' are not coincidences at all, but hard facts, and approximations of encyc value because they are widely used within the numerate-sciences. See the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Talk%7EMathematical_coincidence_4a24.html" title="Talk:Mathematical coincidence">talk</a> page for some others' feelings on this point.

<li><b>Keep</b> Amazon lists over 350 BOOKS on the subject and Google yields over five million hits; obviously there is a strong interest in this topic that nothing else in Wiki satisfies. I think the problem is that the article at this point is nothing but a stub. Once people begin improving it, it should be a fine addition to the Wikipedia. Anyway, the poor thing has only been alive for a few hours, IMHO youâre being a little quick on the trigger in trying to quash it, and pretty viscous on the attacks.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I might consider keeping a page about books about coincidences because that would be maintainable for a start.

<li><b>Comment</b> My final word on all this (having done a little more beefing up on the article) is that while I don't claim a list of coincidences would be of great <i>academic</i> worth (which is I think what is meant by the 'not encyclopedic' criticism), it would be of considerable <i>curiosity</i> value, which is a legitimate (though admittedly lesser) purpose of quite a few existing Wikipedia articles. I cite as examples of this the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_strange_units_of_measurement.html" title="List of strange units of measurement">List of strange units of measurement</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaths_by_accidental_drug_overdose.html" title="List of deaths by accidental drug overdose">List of deaths by accidental drug overdose</a>, which have little academic value but considerable curiosity value. And I argue that a list of coincidences would be of greater interest to many readers than some of the existing lists. I am happy to spend time myself adding to and maintaining it (as I have already done on the curiosity-value <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_premature_obituaries.html" title="List of premature obituaries">List of premature obituaries</a> which I started recently). The existing <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coincidence.html" title="Coincidence">Coincidence</a> article cites a couple of <i>examples</i> of coincidences (which could be moved to this new page), and links to some See Also topics, but is not itself a <i>list</i> of coincidences.

To my mind the whole stupid myth could be exploded by simply pointing out that the papal tiaras don't have any inscriptions. Two lines instead of an article.

<li>Some background: The user above is a <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll.html" title="Troll">troll</a> who is the subject of Request for Arbitration hearing for the POV interpretation he tried to force onto <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Australia_74b0.html" title="Government of Australia">Government of Australia</a> (including doctoring articles to state that Australia is a republic!). On that page he ignored the unanimous opinion of everyone over months. (The RforA is on the brink of voting to ban him for a year from writing on Australian government topics.) Because of that he has been waging a campaign of harassment against me for the last week (because I was one of the many people who stood up to him on <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Australia_74b0.html" title="Government of Australia">Government of Australia</a>).Of 102 edits carried out in one period, 100 were to pages I had edited a short time earlier, many of them trivial, with abusive edit summaries attached. He also added in abusive comments about on other users' talk pages. Tonight I added in images to this page and made some minor textual corrections. True to form, 42 minutes, the troll in question visited the page.</li>

<dd>Regarding the article in question, his view that the stuff in the article is "trivial" is symbolic of the comic ignorance he has shown all over Wikipedia. It is not covered in <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Tiara_a10b.html" title="Papal Tiara">Papal Tiara</a>. A summary is contained on that page. Users wished the detail to be moved to a separate page to allow it to be covered in detail there, and a short summary to be kept at PT. That was done. It is a perfectly valid, well researched and well written page to which 34 users have contributed over two years. It nomination here is nothing more than the latest game being played by a troll trying to harrass people who refuse to allow him to POV insertions elsewhere.<b>Keep</b> <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÃIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">04:37, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: The article does need copy-editing, sure. The writing could be stronger, you bet. That's not a matter for VfD.

Anyway, the article should be kept, as it's quite good. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:03, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: That one source fails to mention this myth does not discredit this article, especially since many others do.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I wouldn't call this advertising:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>It reports factually what the company does. It does not offer glowing reviews of its products and services.</li>
<li>There is no link to a website where an interested potential customer might go shopping for flooring and tile, which is the first thing I would add if I were going to try to use Wikipedia to promote a business.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Having said this, I don't really know how this adds to Wikipedia, or what a reader would gain from reading this.

<li><b>Delete.</b> The music of one band plus "a few others (sic) similar (and sometimes related) groups" does not a genre make.

<li><b>Rewrite</b> I've already written a review for Stimpy's Big Day/The Big Shot myself. It's a formula for episode reviews that I also continued in my review for Robin Hoek/Nurse Stimpy. I plan on possibly re-writing this eventually with that format, as I feel this is currently an unimformative and extremly basic review. I'd appreciate it if the entries tried to adheare to that format i've written in the other entries as well, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I can't make anyone, but I plan on probably writing more myself, so if people could use that same format, and re-write this one completly, i think the result would be much better. Also, there's also a review for Black Hole/Stimpy's Invention that similarly bad, and i'm hoping that either someone else or myself can re-write it with a similar format to the other ones i've done as well. I've tried to be as extensive as possible with info on every episode i've done reviews for, and may probably write more, this way. Also, I've written these myself, and my info comes from several things, such as magazine articles (like WIld Cartoon Kingdom) and whenever possible from DVD commentary and from John K quotes himself. ALso, when there is something that is speculation or something notable that is popular speculation, I list it as such. I don't have an account with Wikipedia such as of yet, but I come from the Members Of The Loyal Order Of Stuppids, Message Board and my name there is The New X.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is an encyclopedia, a forum for truth and accuracy. These "troll groups" support the very opposite of truth and accuracy. I am not aware of any encyclopedia of any merit that suspends integrity and allows the publication of lies, nonsense, vindictiveness, and fluff, just because those things can be "funny". The fact that something is "all in good fun" (a matter of opinion) does not excuse any indiscretion and make it automatically acceptable for every venue. There are many appropriate places for anarchistic comedy but a serious and fact-based encyclopedia is not one of them.
<ul>
<li>So the pages about frauds and impostors and terrorism should be removed too? Mind you, they don't contain any frauds or lies at all, nor does this article. Can you prove otherwise?</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If you want an encyclopedia to be a "forum for truth and accuracy," you really should prevent people from anonymously making edits to it. Also, as I am sure you're aware, because of this open nature (not preventing anonymous edits to articles), Wikipedia is considered a bit of a joke when it comes to content that encyclopedias are traditionally consulted for. This is simply an attempt by whoever started this VfD to stifle and suppress a certain demographic. If we only have articles about Slashdot, CmdrTaco and the editors et al., we're showing a certain amount of bias toward that side of site. Like it or not, Trolling is definitely a huge part of the Slashdot culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With all due respect, you are absolutely missing the point and also, I think, compromising Wikipedia's mission. Of course we do not want Wikipedia to include "lies, nonsense, vindictiveness, and fluff". If the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolltalk.html" title="Trolltalk">trolltalk</a> entry contained LNVF I would support its deletion. But it most certainly does not. The article is NOT itself a troll. Rather, it <i>describes</i> the activities of trolls. This is a crucial difference, and, honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult to grasp. It's the same difference between an article on <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Qaeda_48e2.html" title="Al Qaeda">al Qaeda</a>, and a piece of al Qaeda propoganda. Wikipedia would obviously include the former, but exclude the latter. Would you argue for deleting the al Qaeda entry because "Wikipedia is not here to wage jihad"?? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 21:23, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While I think this article should go, I believe judging the merit of an article by whether or not sockpuppets vote to keep it is absurd, and such votes should not count. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:12, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If an article's support comes almost entirely from sockpuppets, that's strong evidence that it's nothing by a vanity article created &amp; maintained by the very people the article is about. Vanity articles can sometimes be hard to identify but the character &amp; identities of the persons editing/supporting them can help to determine if an article's only purpose is self-promotion.</li>
<li>Yes. It might sound absurd in theory, but in practice any article that deserves to be kept on merit, won't attract sockpuppets because it doesn't need them. Only articles that "should go" will atrract socks supporting them, because they're the only ones that need them. It's a useful rule of thumb. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> â <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson"><small>(talk)</small></a> 21:20, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that's a crap rule of thumb. With that as our standard, we would delete every article related to Islam, the Holocaust, Ukraine, Sino-Japanese relations, and god knows what else. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 21:28, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Good point, but how often do serious articles about Islam, Sino-Japanese relations, etc. get nominated for VfD in the first place? And when they do, it's usually socks wanting them deleted for not supporting their POV. And then the corollary applies: If the sockpuppets want to <i>delete</i> an article, it deserves to be kept. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> â <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson"><small>(talk)</small></a> 21:58, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh, I didn't realize the rule of thumb only applied when an article was already up for deletion. I thought it was a general way of determining which articles (in VfD stage or not) were worthy of deletion. Okay, so even in this more tightly circumscribed form, and even when we invoke the corollary you describe (in which sockpuppets are voting for deletion, thereby guiding us to "keep") we must still recognize the mutliple exceptions to both the corollary and the proper rule. For example, some articles go to VfD (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-semitism.html" title="New anti-semitism">new anti-semitism</a>, for example) and have POV pushers and sockpuppets aplenty on both sides. In these cases we must invoke an exception to the corollary of the circumscribed form of the rule. It is at this point that I think we should realize that we're better off trashing the rule altogether, and voting not based on a dubious rule-of-thumb regarding how other votes have been placed, but rather <i>according to the merits of the article</i>. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 23:09, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- The close affiliation between Trolltalk and the GNAA is obvious to anyone who is familiar with either of them and can be easily proven by searching the Trolltalk Archive for GNAA and taking a look at some of the results. Although the archives don't go back this far, many will recall that the GNAA was born on Trolltalk, and even though they now have off-site forums most Trolltalk people are still GNAA.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- Can you provide proof that most "Trolltalk people" are GNAA? If not, I suggest you attempt to keep your comments to facts next time, please. This is a serious matter and it's not right for you to lie in an attempt to keep your POV the dominate one.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> We are here because Afcassidy has some sort of vendetta against Trolltalk. More than likely, he will continue to attempt to delete this article until he succeeds. I think someone needs to possibly scrutinize his motives in this deletion attempt.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This is a lie -- you've failed to produce any evidence that Afcassidy was even <b>AWARE</b> of the previous VfD, or that Afcassidy has any personal interest in the article or that any form of bias or vendetta exists. It seems to me to be a case of someone who sees an article that he/she feels shouldn't be there and takes the logical step. Please stop with the unsubstantiated allegations; you're just making the entire pro-Trolltalk crowd look foolish.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not a member of the "pro-Trolltalk" crowd; I am a member of the "pro-Impartiality" crowd. I was mistaken about the Afcassidy link. However, there is much more logical grounding in keeping the article than in deleting it. I could see deleting this article if it were somehow consuming a large portion of the Wiki's resources or if it were obscene in some way, but this article does neither. By deleting this article, you're showing that you're biased toward the entire "Slashbotism" thing that most trolls are against. In regard to failing to provide any evidence that bias exists, look throughout this page. Many accusations are made linking Trolltalk to GNAA. This is obviously not the case, yet I do not see you policing these edits as you have mine. That alone shows some bias (perhaps not much) on your part.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The last VfD was over a year ago; many things can change in a year. Furthermore, last time around there weren't a lot of people who wanted to keep the article -- more supported deleting it and some others wanted to merge the information into other articles. But with the vote split like that, there was no clear consensus and thus, for the time being, nothing at all was done.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Correct, and now there is a significant number of users who want to keep the article, and a lot of spirited debate around the VfD. That alone speaks in favor of keeping the article, since the only legitimate reason for deletion now would be a vendetta against the subject matter. If Trolltalk wasn't notable there wouldn't be half the number of votes and comments here. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> 02:40, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with that completely. There is clearly plenty of strong feeling on the part of genuine Wikipedians that we should keep the article. If the article is now deleted on the outrageous grounds that some Wikipedians dislike the people who the article describes, I am immediately going to nominate the articles on <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Qaeda_48e2.html" title="Al Qaeda">al Qaeda</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bush_24e4.html" title="George Bush">George Bush</a>, and <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abba.html" title="Abba">Abba</a> for VfD.

<li>The KKK is way more notable than these guys. I don't know how many times I've said this: It's not about because a dislike of TrollTalk.

<li>The KKK article: 1. Was not written entirely by KKK members. 2. Contains information that can be verified by non-KKK-members. 3. Isn't being championed &amp; defended by KKK sockpuppets. If, on the other hand, the KKK article WERE written entirely by the KKK, presenting their own highly distored version of their official "history" (i.e. how they valiantly and unselfishly saved the innocent women &amp; children of the south from being raped and murdered by rampaging gangs of violent negroes after the civil war), and no REAL information on their history was available because nobody but themselves gave a shit about them, then I'm sure their vanity Wikipedia article would wind up deleted.4.89.246.65 13:52, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I should like to point out however that you are all being trolled by the nominator, who also posted the comment on trolltalk about this vfd, keeps vandalising this page through anon proxies and vehemently replies to all keep votes with his typical "blah blah wikipedia is what I think it should be" bullshit.

<li><b>Del...</b> I mean, <b>keep</b>, or er, <b>comment</b>, I guess, since I'm inevitably going to be accused to be a GNAA sock-puppet. I think you're all a bunch of retards. All of you who take this internet crap seriously. Honestly, what the hell? Go out to a club, get some woman drunk and have sex already. Trust me, you'll feel much better after you dip your shlong into a female creature for the first time, and suddenly, you won't care anymore if there's an article about trolltalk on your crappy internet encyclopaedia (which I've subtly vandalized in several ways btw, just for fun). Uh oh, but what have I just done? This comment is against wikipedia guidelines! Quick, someone nominate it on Comments for Deletion! Hahaha. Jesus. -- Who The Fuck Cares 00:01, 1 Jan 1970
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- votes from anonymous users are not counted, also, everyone should be made aware that the term "female creature" is taken directly from the movie with a very offensive title (which I won't repeat here) which the GNAA is based around. The heroes of that movie have never encountered women before, and when one of them does encounter one, they all make a big show out of shouting "female creatures!" in shock and alarm.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- Why should we be aware of that? I can't see why anyone should care. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVacBob_2e63.html" title="User:MrVacBob">MrVacBob</a> 17:18, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> -- It is evidence that Trolltalk is part of (or at least strongly aligned with) the GNAA, a group that has abused Wikipedia quite extensively and gone to great measures to keep its vanity articles up and that has publically announced itself as an enemy of Wikipedia.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- There is no evidence that trolltalk has anything to do with GNAA, other than the fact that they both troll slashdot. By all accounts GNAA hardly uses trolltalk at all, other than crapflooding it when a GNAA member is insulted. Stop with the paranoid generalizations. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> 20:45, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A counterexample to invalidate your point: the KKK talks chiefly about blacks, but they aren't affiliated with them. Thanks for playing though.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- Congratulations on demonstrating that GNAA members post on trolltalk. It is a PUBLIC forum, genius. Anybody can post there. By your logic, the dozens of forums that have been vandalized by the GNAA are also affiliated with the GNAA. Search slashdot for GNAA and you will find similar results. But that's not what this is really about is it? You people have a vendetta against trolls. Stop deleting perfectly accurate, valid and valuble information just because you hate trolls.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Congratz to whoever just deleted a string of legitimate comments, both Keep and Delete. Here was mine: Obviously no one who believes in Wikipedia believes, as Paul M claims to, that Wikipedia should include articles on anything and everything. But it really is starting to feel like Wikipedia is being taken over by people who think the project should only include articles on topics like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_the_Great_9da3.html" title="Frederick the Great">Frederick the Great</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_theory.html" title="Atomic theory">Atomic theory</a>, because these are the types of articles contained in dinosaur, Gutenberg, pre-internet encyclopedias like Brittanica. Like the hidebound architects in Ayn Rand stories who use fabulous new materials in the same tired way they used older, weaker materials.

<li><b>Comment</b>, My ISP, Comcast has a dynamic IP system. Just because we share the same IP doesn't mean we are the same person. Wikipedia is pretty popular you know. You've grown so paranoid with vandalism you've lost your ways Wikipedia. Anyway my comment was not to keep everything. But to keep things that are useful. And indeed trolltalk is a useful article that contains information on a well-known subculture. Also I'd like to add I'm a long time slashdot user (<a href="http://slashdot.org/~Stalyn" class="external free" title="http://slashdot.org/~Stalyn" rel="nofollow">http://slashdot.org/~Stalyn</a>) - Paul M.

<li>The deltionist tendencies of Wikipedia as a whole can be <b>clearly seen</b> from the consensus decisions to: a) keep every single school, regardless of notability, because some people like them, and b) keep pokemon, digimon, and whatever other irrelevant fancruft may be out there. So, although I am a deletionist, Wikipedia as a whole is, perhaps, not so hide-bound as is claimed.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 15:45, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> How can you have a category Internet Trolls (which Wikipedia has) and exclude Trolltalk from it? Trolltalk is a place where trolls converse, thus being a part of this category. I don't see anyone trying to delete <a href="../../../m/e/o/Meow_Wars_55bb.html" title="Meow Wars">Meow_Wars</a>, which is most definitely not as notable as Trolltalk.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Trolltalk has next to nothing to do with trolling, it's just one of millions of no-topic social discussion boards out there, with the major difference that it's even smaller, more obscure, harder to find, and of even less consequence than the majority of the aforementioned millions. And if you think the "Meow Wars" entry should be deleted you're free to register an account &amp; nominate it for VfD (I think anonymous VfD nominations don't count).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> And when <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Meow_Wars_a0f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Meow Wars">Meow Wars was nominated for VfD</a> we didn't have various Meowers and their socks trying to disrupt the vote. I think that's one reason why it survived. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> â <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 21:32, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You're part of the reason why Wikipedia has problems. This deletionist frame of mind isn't helping anyone. Again, the article survived a VfD before, so why are we even here? I predict that if the VfD fails this time, someone will just attempt one again and will keep trying to delete this article until they succeed.</li>

<p>Please do not refactor the discussion into lists or tables of votes, however much you may think that this helps the process. Again, the votes are not the ends in themselves (Wikipedia is not a democracy). Both the context and the order of the comments are essential to understanding the intents of contributors, both at the discussion closure and during the discussion. Refactoring actually makes the job of making the decision at the closure of discussion much harder, not easier.</p>

<li><b>Question</b>: as I look around Wikipedia and see a vast number of articles that are infinitely less notable than <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolltalk.html" title="Trolltalk">trolltalk</a>, it strikes me as patently absurd that many of the delete votes claim "non-notable" as their justification. It leads me to wonder: does Wikipedia have any suggested criteria/guidelines for determining whether an article is notable or not? Otherwise people are free to vote "delete" for selfish, prejudicial reasons (e.g., "I hate trolls!" or "I hate Abba" or whatever) and then claim "non-notable". <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 19:35, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Are you kidding? A person could work a 40-hour week for a year and not ferret out all the Wikipedia articles less notable than <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolltalk.html" title="Trolltalk">trolltalk</a>. For the first five, how about <a href="../../../f/n/o/Fnord.html" title="Fnord">fnord</a>, or <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_A._Grout_d630.html" title="Daniel A. Grout">Daniel A.

Since Wikipedia by its very nature has the ability to be wonderfully capacious in its subject matter, I think all those articles should be kept. But if we'd prefer a boringly traditional encyclopedia that only covers topics likely to be found in Brittanica or whatever, and if we are going to delete anything as or less notable then <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolltalk.html" title="Trolltalk">trolltalk</a>, then we have A LOT of deleting to do. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:08, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Firstly, I don't consider <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_panic.html" title="Penis panic">Penis panic</a>, a condition documented by the World Health Organisation, less notable than a thread on Slashdot.

<li><b>Comment</b> This isn't a referendum on "Do trolls behave appropriately in Wikipedia?" The issue here should be purely whether or not the article "Trolltalk" should be deleted--and whether Wikipedia would be diminished by removing it. I think Wikipedia is uniquely well-placed to cover topics of great interest to small groups, because those topics will also interest people who want to learn more about such groups, Pokemonians, Plushies ... or even trolls. The non-notability criterion makes sense for deleting pieces about someone's high school band--it is destructive when it gets used to try to remove articles of real interest to many people (even trolls). <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 04:05, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Betsy, you are of course absolutely right. This VfD is the most disturbing thing I've yet seen on Wikipedia: a strong push to delete high-quality Wikipedia content because some Wikipedians personally dislike those who are described in the article. Even more disturbing, the "delete" crowd includes an administrator (<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg">Jayjg</a>), who should really know better. I'm so disappointed in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: the term "undisclosed location" has been widely parodied and has, in this country, recently become synonymous with Cheney. The Onion even did an article centered on it. While I agree with some of Uncle G's comments, I think much of this can be salvaged and turned into a decent article. No vote yet, but leanign towards keep. Also, I thought I reclled hearing on some news report that his undisclosed location was revealed and was an air force base somewhere (I forget which one). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:07, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>An intelligently written article about politically corrupted/convenient scientists; I don't take issue with what it says. The main trouble is that this is a neologism -- as the author admits. For a neologism, it seems at first to do fairly well at Google, with over five hundred hits. However, it's clear that many of these hits are for a nonce-word welding "scientist" and "mathematician" or other whimsical applications. A search for "scientician" plus "ethical" gets a mere 41 hits.</p>
<p>The term does seem to be useful, for, say, that rare kind of biologist whose opinions are conveniently compatible with those of the Bush administration and its plutocrat paymasters. But the term barely exists. So hang on until "scientician" <i>with this meaning</i> gets at least five thousand hits; if/when that happens, reconsider.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, scientists who are convenient for or corrupted by governments seem to me to be no different to those who are convenient for or corrupted by tobacco interests, etc., even when those interests lack government support. But I digress.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:12, 2005 Jun 19 (UTC) [Wording slightly tweaked 08:28, 2005 Jun 19 (UTC)]</p>

<p>I am a fan of PokÃ©mon, so this is not a spiteful nomination. This article is about the four regions in the PokÃ©mon world, but all four of them have their own page. They are even linked to in this article. I was originally going to tidy this article up (present it in a more encyclopaedic way), but I do not think this article can give any more information than the separate articles on each region.</p>
<p>However, I hope that any votes to delete are because of the reasons above, and not just because it is a PokÃ©mon article. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Lawrence_67fa.html" title="User:Daniel Lawrence">Daniel Lawrence</a> 10:22, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As the number of regions is only likely to increase, it's a good idea to have an article describing them and their differences. Since the bulk of the information belongs on each region's individual page, this should be kept like a small annotated list, much like it is now. My advice, however, is to have it list the games (or whatever) where each region appears. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 11:03, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the article's talk page, if it exists; or after the end of this archived section. The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 8 "delete" votes, 2 "merge"s and 1 "keep". However, I find some of the delete votes to be at odds with our policy and practice of preserving all edit history. Since this content was used to create at least one other article (and I believe contributed to more), I am going to exercise my discretion and keep this as a redirect. Yes, there are other ways to preserve GFDL but with the confused history of this discussion, this is the easiest. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 8 July 2005 00:24 (UTC)</p>

<li>A few editors' efforts, while fully appreciated, don't show the full the ability of the wiki. This article is probably in the current state because it was shuffled off to a subpage, instead of placed in plain view and <i>edited on directly</i>. With the copy &amp; pastes of only the edits done on it, I can't say for sure where I would find this in its original form in the page histories, other than this article. There is a lot of remaining content of value. Again, I ask, is the 1911 Brittanica on Wikisource or somewhere else online where this could be as easily accessable to someone editing and/or reading Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 20:08, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>First of all, if this is a copyvio, the orginal author should be too embarrassed to complain.

Also, to Radiant's comment, the term "mise" existed long before the card. The articles archives go back to late 2001, but this is even a little late since the site underwent a redesign that reorganized those. The forum was a nod to the term, the card's creation came later.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As far as I'm concerned, this page has survived one VFD: nothing has changed so that another VFD would be meritable. Also, this page includes other aspects of the site, not simply the forums. Radiant, apparently you have not done enough research since MiseTings is the newer version of MiseTingsGasEtc, the first site created by MB. Just because you consider MTGnews to be a primary MTG site (which it isn't anymore, thank you MTGSalvation) doesn't mean an inclusion of MiseTings is unnecessary. And if you're so concerned about "vanity", why don't you begin a VFD for every other website because apparently those pages only exist for "vanity" and promotion. <a href="../../../s/i/d/User%7ESidar_3598.html" title="User:Sidar">sidar</a> 03:11, June 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> it is true that Listservosphere is my 1rst Wikipedia entry + that i have just registered + that i intend to contribute in good faith to the Wikipedia project. i did coin the word Listservosphere yesterday aka 2005.06.18. the 1rst occurance of the term Listservosphere was on the -empyre- listserv in the following post: [<a href="https://mail.cofa.unsw.edu.au/pipermail/empyre/2005-June/msg00152.html" class="external autonumber" title="https://mail.cofa.unsw.edu.au/pipermail/empyre/2005-June/msg00152.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a><a href="https://mail.cofa.unsw.edu.au/pipermail/empyre/2005-June/msg00152.html" class="external free" title="https://mail.cofa.unsw.edu.au/pipermail/empyre/2005-June/msg00152.html" rel="nofollow">https://mail.cofa.unsw.edu.au/pipermail/empyre/2005-June/msg00152.html</a>]. so it is a new New Media neologism (therefore no Google results) + so perhaps it is too new for Wikipedia. Listservosphere will have encyclopedic relevance, esp in relation to the term blogosphere b/c as lists predate blogs in New Media + Network cultures, lists should be noted as having pre-existing cultural hystories. btw, jonCates is less of a screen name + more of a name i go by all the time, on screen + off. jonCates</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the guide states that coining neologisms is not allowed, but this neologism was coined on june 18, 2005 as is recorded in the -empyre- archives as linked above by the author. therefore it is not being coined here but rather being recorded &amp; explained here. it will be verifiable by context as soon as google catches up with -empyre-'s archives.--Jakeelliott 19:48, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the article's talk page, if it exists; or after the end of this archived section. The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The nomination is a clear "delete" vote. The merge vote is clear but looking at the two articles, there is absolutely nothing to merge (a home address being utterly unencyclopedic). The suggested redirect target is more of a disambiguation page than a real article.</p>
<p>The "keep" vote is clear and offers some suggestions of possible avenues for expansion. However, I note that this article has been in place for a year already and has had no substantive content added in all that time. It has a single inbound link - the disambiguation page <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_St_Leonards_2028.html" title="Baron St Leonards">Baron St Leonards</a>. If the article were deleted, no content would be lost.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my judgment and call this one a "delete" but without prejudice if the article is recreated with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> and substantive content. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 7 July 2005 23:52 (UTC)</p>

<p>A quick google search has shown me it has to do with the "22 reverse Tarot paths on the Tree of Death" by Crowley. This article doesn't refer to that and I doubt it's smart to make an article on each of the 22 paths. I suggest a <b>merge</b> into one big article with others if possible or a <b>delete</b>.

<li>I've got to say <b>Delete</b>, even if it gets my capitalist "comrades" (grin) angry at me... these multiple forks of the Anarchism article aren't doing anybody any good, and the title "Anarchism (theory)" is pretty meaningless... is there supposed to then be another article "Anarchism (practice)" to balance it?

Let's get it down to a few articles with sensible titles, and then try and see if we can actually (somehow) come to a reasonable consensus about what <i>content</i> is in them, but don't keep multiplying senseless articles in order to get "our" faction's preferred content in <i>somewhere</i>. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 23:31, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>From that link: <i>"Several TV characters, household names in Sweden are here to win the prize money in the Club Goa show.

<li><b>Keep</b>, neither categories nor offline sources are a suitable replacement for wikipedia lists. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 07:20, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> â lists have additional information that categories do not, including names that do not have full articles. It'll always be a partial list, but in this case I don't see that as an issue, so to speak. â <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 14:50, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Completely unmaintainable list that will inevitably be edited to include zillions of extremely non-notable "omg I got a <a href="../../../x/e/r/Xerox.html" title="Xerox">Xerox</a> machine here's my zine" entries. Would <i>support</i> a List of notable zines which includes only publications which have gained some sort of recognition beyond five people in a college dorm. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 19:16, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and merge to category. Zines that don't have full articles are not notable/verifiable enough to be listed anyway. â <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 03:40, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
