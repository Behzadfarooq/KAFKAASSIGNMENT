<ul>
<li>Since, generally, objects that number zero are pluralized (i.e. "there are zero sources"), saying that there are no sources is flatly misleading. Furthermore, that it is Internet-only is irrelevant - we're dealing here with an online magazine owned by the Washington Post. And we're dealing with a full feature on the subject, not a mention or a paragraph. This isn't Joe's Blog Shack. This is well-sourced by any standard. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 21:58, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think you would find very few objections to adding information from Slate into an article with other non-trivial sources. Good people can disagree over articles sources <i>only</i> to Slate, however. It's really second-tier as sources go. It's certainly not such a gold standard as to preclude the skepticism you attempt to rule out. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 02:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not policy, and the "multiple mentions" was really created to head off various forms of "was mentioned once in passing in the New York Times." This was the subject of a full-length piece on Slate. This is a reasonable exception to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 15:03, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> How is a single one-page article in Slate a year and a half ago any different than, as you said, being "mentioned once in passing in the New York Times"? From reading <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2123673/" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2123673/" rel="nofollow">the article itself</a>, I get the impression that it seems to be more of a focus on the (somewhat self-aggrandizing IMO) adventures of the journalist "exposing" the hoax and getting ganged up on by the SA goons, rather than actually being an expository piece describing the hoax itself. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 20:23, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, since Slate didn't adopt pagination until this year, the page length isn't exactly relevant - it's a full-length article. As for the focus, I'm sorry that you're not fond of its writing style, but that does seem rather beside the point to its notability. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 20:37, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never said I "wasn't fond of its writing style" let alone use that as an argument against its notability; you're heading into straw man country here. However I would say that the focus of the article is very relevant. It's a first-person narrative of the author finding and "exposing" the hoax, and being messed with by the hoax's perpetrators afterwards, more of an entertaining piece than an informative piece. I noted that the style is self-aggrandizing because it suggests that elements of the story could have been fictionalized to some degree for all we know; we have no other reliable sources at all, because this hoax was simply not notable enough. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 01:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's still a subjective judgment of the piece that is far beyond what is appropriate under <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The piece was published by Slate as non-fiction - that's sufficient to establish its relevance. If you have any objections to its content, they should be sourced, not original research. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 01:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that this illustrates the reason why we need <i>multiple</i> non-trivial sources to write an encyclopedia article. Especially for an article with "hoax" in the title. This is a common sense issue for me. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 02:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But in this situation the Slate article is written by the person claiming to have debunked the hoax; not really a qualified person to determine its notability. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 02:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would be relevant only if Slate were self-published. But it's not - the editors of Slate (and thus, by extension the Washington Post company) have vouched for the event's notability. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 18:34, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree with the implication that Slate/Wash Post is "vouch[ing] for the event's notability." Even the New York Times does human interest pieces on things that obviously aren't notable. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 21:57, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You do realize that totally goes against the entire distinction we make between self-published and independent sources, right? Slate thought the event was significant enough to pay for an article on it and publish that article. Slate is a highly notable publisher. In judging notability, I consider Slate's judgment that it was worth publishing on very important, and your judgment that Slate was wrong more or less irrelevant. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Slate's credibility is an entirely separate issue from whether everything that they write about is "notable" in the sense of the Wikipedia guideline. It is unlikely that Slate's editors took a look at our notability guidelines before publishing this article. This is why <i>multiple</i> non-trivial articles are necessary to establish notability. For example, in the current issue of Slate, there's an article by this guy about his wife's post-partum depression <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2158735?nav=tap3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2158735?nav=tap3" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. That doesn't make her notable enough for a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 00:14, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it's multiple non-trivial mentions. One mention of this kind of substance is also, I think, significant. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 02:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Show us a second source, then. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 02:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You seem to be missing my point, which is that a full-feature coverage is at least as significant as two "non-trivial mentions." <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 03:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's pisses the point of having <i>multiple</i> non-trivial sources, i.e. not having to rely on a single source. We can dress this Slate article up all you want. The fact is that this greenlighting hoax is no more notable than the average internet meme and definitely not up to the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which doesn't say "multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself <i>or one really sweet full feature coverage in an internet periodical</i>." <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 03:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's also a guideline, and we're allowed to sod it if it seems poorly phrased, off base, or otherwise not useful. They're guidelines, not rules. Especially not WEB, which is disputed on the relevant section. And especially not since we're not talking about a website here, so it's not even clear to me that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is the operative guideline. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 04:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>WP:WEB is definitely the operative guideline for an internet hoax. In this case the article violates both the letter and the spirit of the guildine because the purpose of requiring mulitiple non-trivial sources is to limit out minor internet hoaxes which never achieved significance in the non-internet realm. We seem to just be repeating ourselves here. Why don't we just let some other people weigh in. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 07:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that [{WP:WEB]] probably should cover internet memes. But no text in it does, and the website rules don't necessarily translate well. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 14:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Pare down heavily</b> then <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../t/o/o/Toothing.html" title="Toothing">Toothing</a> as a section (title it "Further impact" or "Attempt to duplicate" or something of that nature). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 07:48, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>An interesting suggestion, but ultimately one that succumbs to most of the same problems as having a full article, I believe. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 17:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I think this is a really good idea - there is not a two source minimum, to my knowledge, for inclusion, and the Slate article would surely provide a reliable source for the addition to <a href="../../../t/o/o/Toothing.html" title="Toothing">Toothing</a>. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 20:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
