<p>Where do I start? Firstly, I think as it stands, this is borderline nonsense. It's not true, and not even verifiable. If someone calls a Bulgarian a "bugger" one time, does it go on this list? It's unmanageable too, not to mention POV. The existence of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a> ought to be enough to satisfy anyone <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 04:37, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I suspect there is a misunderstanding here. If someone calls an <b><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a></b> a <a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugger.html" title="Bugger">bugger</a>, it is an insult; moreover, the word used as an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insult.html" title="Insult">insult</a> has an interesting <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a>: it comes from "Bulgarian", which is an ethnic group name. That is what this list is about; this is very different from ethnic slurs; in the example the fact that the insultee is Australian is entirely irrelevant or (presumably) not the reason why he was insulted, but rather the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">fact</a> that he finished the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacon.html" title="Bacon">bacon</a> from the fridge that I bought for <b>my</b> <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakfast.html" title="Breakfast">breakfast</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 04:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This explains what the criteria for inclusion on this list are better than the page itself does. But most of these words surely are not generic insults. I mean, "Aussie"?

<dd>Once public awareness that Australians are habitual bacon nabbers reaches a critical threshold, yes, then people might start calling actual or suspected bacon thieves "Aussies", and not as a compliment but by way of insult, something which need not involve ambulatory motion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Listen a sec, people. The entries Paki, Muzzie and Aussie were added recently, on March 31, 2006, by an anon who apparently did not understand the criterion for inclusion on the list. I've removed them. This list has basically been stable since the end of 2004. If some anon adds the Danube, Drau and Mur to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_rivers_of_Australia_7d6f.html" title="List of rivers of Australia">List of rivers of Australia</a>, unaware of the difference between <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> and Australia, that does not make that list nonsense and a candidate for deletion. It is just an erroneous edit like so many, that can be fixed. This is a list with a clear criterion, it is not indiscriminate information, it is obviously never going to be very long, it is not nonsense, and I don't see a good argument why it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:31, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm truly lost here. Isn't semantics supposed to be about the meaning of utterances? So saying it is "pure semantics" is saying that it concerns the meaning of what we are saying, rather than the typography. Is there something wrong with that? Further, do you seriously want to maintain that calling someone who, say, added lots of <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four-letter_word.html" title="Four-letter word">four-letter words</a> to your user page a "vandal" is an ethnic slur? I say that you are really stretching the meaning of "ethnic slur" beyond reason. But maybe you don't care what words mean, because that is pure semantics. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:07, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What I'm saying that that there is no reasonable distinction in my opinion between "ethnic group names used as insults" and "ethnic slurs" despite the editorial claims on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_group_names_used_as_insults.html" title="List of ethnic group names used as insults">List of ethnic group names used as insults</a>.&#160;; "ethnic group names used as insults" would fall under the canopy of "ethnic slurs". Saying that they are 2 entirely different things is, in my opinion, a semantic division. I don't see any logical reason being advanced why "ethnic group names used as insults" would not fall under a reasonable definition of "ethnic slurs"... and yes I would consider "vandal" to apply as it is ethnically derived though it has no current ethnic stigma attached to it. On a side note... I predict a keep for this on at least a "no consensus" so interpretation of the terms is kind of a moot point.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As long as you agree that to say that "asphalt" and "butter" are different things also constitutes a semantic division, there is at least one thing on which we agree.

<li><b>Keep, do not merge</b>. This topic has nothing to do with slurs <i>for</i> ethnic groups, they are the <i>actual names</i> of ethnic groups which have come into use as general pejorative terms with no racial context. I'm not a big list fan, but this is an interesting, verifiable, and notable subject. Obviously, the title is confusing, and there are still some mistakes (<a href="../../../k/a/f/Kaffir.html" title="Kaffir">kaffir</a> went the other way, becoming an ethnic slur after being coined as a general term for an infidel). But words like <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandal.html" title="Vandal">vandal</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thug.html" title="Thug">thug</a> are not ethnic slurs. â€” <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <a href="../../../a/k/a/User_talk%7EAKADriver_2c54.html" title="User talk:AKADriver"><font color="#FF0000">â˜Ž</font></a> 19:47, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> - how is it original research? The etymologies contained here are verifiable. Again, these are not racial slurs. These are the names of ethnic groups that have become words in the English language. In fact, I change my opinion to <b>Keep and Move to List of ethnic group names that have become English words</b>. That would stave off the confusion with ethnic slurs, add more interesting etymologies (Bohemian really isn't an insult), and give less encouragement for people to add trivial slurs like "Jew". â€” <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <a href="../../../a/k/a/User_talk%7EAKADriver_2c54.html" title="User talk:AKADriver"><font color="#FF0000">â˜Ž</font></a> 22:24, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Many of the entries in this list are not technically insults (and the descriptions are even prefaced as such). I know people can use "Goth" as a pejorative, but I know just as many people self-describe themselves as "Goth" or see it as a positive term. Moving content to List of ethnic group names that have become English words would make more sense based on the current content of the list if this is indeed kept (which it looks like it will be).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:48, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>strong keep</b>. All votes for merging into ethnic slurs don't unserstand the basic difference: "<a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian.html" title="Bohemian">Bohemian</a>" is <b>not</b> an insult for Bohemians, i.e., Czechs. It is an insult for something else, even <b>not for any ethnicity</b>. The suggestion of AKADriver about renaming/extending the scope is very reasonable, but it doesn't require AfD intervention. However we should be careful with renaming here: the name suggested by AKADriver opens the door to, e.g., <a href="../../../a/u/s/Aussie.html" title="Aussie">Aussie</a> and the ilk, which are out of question in the current article. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 23:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> â€“ Renaming may be a good idea, but this specific proposal has a problem that the present title also has, which is that it does not suggest that the meaning has changed and that the ethnicity of any designees is irrelevant to the applicability of the terms on the list. Is "Gypsy" in the meaning of Roma/Sinti an English word? One could argue that it is, and then the new title is an invitation to add it. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:28, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've revised the lead paragraph to better cover the actual list (as well as the intention). The first sentence reads now: "This is a list of words used in the English language whose etymology goes back to the name of some, often historical or archaic, ethnic or religious group, but whose current meaning has lost that connotation and does not imply any actual ethnicity or religion." Perhaps this will inspire someone to come up with a better title for the article. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
