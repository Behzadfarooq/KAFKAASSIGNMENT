In some of these cited "sources", the phrase "Chewbacca Defense" is never even used, in many others, the reference is back to Wikipedia itself! Regardless, none of them are discussing the phrase or verify anything said in the article.

<li>Ladies and gentlemen of the supposed AFD discussion, you must now decide whether to reverse the decision from the previous AFD discussion. I know that it seems as if this has not <a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-5905088.html" class="external text" title="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-5905088.html" rel="nofollow">been documented</a>. But, ladies and gentlemen, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Image%7EChewbacca.jpg_a702.html" title="Image:Chewbacca.jpg">this</a> is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one moment — that does not make sense. Why am I talking about Chewbacca when I should be discussing <a href="http://www.e-evidence.info/905.html" class="external text" title="http://www.e-evidence.info/905.html" rel="nofollow">sources that document this defence</a>? Why? I'll tell you why: I don't know.
<p>It does not make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must <b>keep</b>!</p>

<li>Then why didn't you actually use that source? Finding a reliable source is one thing, using it in the article is completely different. The whole point of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is that anyone who read the same research you did (in other words, the credible sources you cite) would obtain the same information that the article presented. Citing a source without using it in writing the article is worse than leaving the source out altogether - it sends researchers looking in the wrong places to verify the information you presented in the article. As such, I removed your reference. If you want to use this book as a source: 1) Acquire a copy of the book. 2) Read the chapter in question, and make sure it's pertinent to the article. 3) Using the book as a source, rewrite the article using only credible information. Until you do that (and maybe even after you do), the article still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is non-negotiable. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 18:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Point partly taken, maybe I will move it to "Further reading" until it can be properly used and cited. The reason I did not rewrite anything is because the article makes no "claims" that require sourcing from it. One might ask exactly what in the article you would consider to be "unverifiable". A fictional legal strategy used in an episode of <i>South Park</i> and what is essentially a transcript of the scene in question? Surely that is beyond doubt, and verifiable from the episode as a primary source. Then a small section on external usage which cites only those cases (OK, mostly blogs) where other editors have found sources. I will, by all means, get the book and add anything interesting I find. I might also point out that the nomination represents that the subject is "not the subject of third party sources", I was merely pointing out that it is. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 21:07, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Let me see if I've got this straight. A "Chewbacca defense" is one where the prosecution's side is presented as too complicated to be convincing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...or use a "Chewbacca defense" (thanks to the South Park TV show for this phrase) and try to razzle-dazzle the jury about how complex and complicated the other side's evidence or probability estimates are. <a href="http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/425/425lect15.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/425/425lect15.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, wait. It's a defense that's "based on physical possibility that someone else committed bad act" <a href="http://www.scilawforensics.com/presentations/wookie.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scilawforensics.com/presentations/wookie.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flcourts.org/gen_public/stratplan/bin/Kenneally_presentation.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.flcourts.org/gen_public/stratplan/bin/Kenneally_presentation.pdf" rel="nofollow">This source</a> seems to agree; though it never explicitly defines it, it gives an example of a Chewbacca defense as a "prevalence of computer vulnerabilities and malware technology that allow unknown persons to access one's computer [presumably to commit a 'bad act']."</p>
<p>But no, wait. The "Chewbacca defense" is <i>actually</i> a postmodernist's dream, "in which someone asserts his claim by saying something so patently nonsensical that the listener's brain shuts down completely."<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellis-weiner/d-is-for-diabolical_b_39491.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellis-weiner/d-is-for-diabolical_b_39491.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Maybe the experts at <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/news/view/141" class="external text" title="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/news/view/141" rel="nofollow">the Purdue U. conference</a> can help me understand? Nope, all they give is the title of a lecture: "Poking the Wookie: The Chewbacca Defense in Digital Evidence Cases".</p>
<p>Then, <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20031024/1420209.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20031024/1420209.shtml" rel="nofollow">this unreliable source</a> suggests that an essential element of a Chewbacca defense is the use of "technical jargon" that most juries wouldn't understand.</p>
<p>Ah, <i>now</i> I understand! What we've got here is a classic <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> that's not even fit for Wiktionary.</p>
<p>Now, it is conceivable that even without a coherent definition of "Chewbacca defense," we could still support a Wikipedia article with this title, if various reliable sources were found that discuss the concepts denoted by the various meanings of "Chewbacca defense."

<li>(reply to Geuiwogbil) The "commentators" cited don't discuss the term or whatever the term is supposed to denote. The citations are merely references to the term. The lecture notes, for example, don't define the term or comment on it; they're just appropriating a pop cultural item to lighten up the lecture. It seems to me that collecting these and other references to the term is original research, unless it can be shown that an external source has already taken note of these references. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
