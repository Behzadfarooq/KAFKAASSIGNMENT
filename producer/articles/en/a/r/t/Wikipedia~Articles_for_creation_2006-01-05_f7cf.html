<p><b>Paleolinguistics</b> is the study of human prehistory through linguistic evidence. It is identical in goals and methods with historical linguistics, differing only in application by concentrating on deeper and older relationships between languages. (The difference between paleolinguistics and historical linguistics is analogous to the difference between paleoanthropology and anthropology in general.) Some applications of paleolinguistics are classification (the organization of languages into language families, and subsequently the organization of families into macrofamilies), reconstruction (reconstituting the lexicon, grammar, and phonology of hypothetical proto-languages), and glottochronology (the estimation of linguistic time-depths on the basis of preserved vocabulary, analogous to the radiocarbon dating of archeology). Some eminent paleolinguists of the past were Karl Bouda, Joseph Greenberg, Karl-Heinrich Menges, V.M. Illich-Svitych, Edward Sapir, Robert Shafer, Sergei Starostin (†2005), Morris Swadesh, Alfredo Trombetti.</p>

<p>West Coast Phreakers is a hacking and phreaking group (or h/p) based in British Columbia, Canada. While it is Western Canadian based, the group does have members from the Western Seaboard of the United States. The co-founder of the group, smes, is quite illusive of where exactly he is from usually only making vague statements such as “Vancouver Island”, or south of Drunken Duncan. Maniak on the other hand resides in Vancouver as well as Prince George, BC for some of the year. The third member of the group, El Jefe, lives in a suburb of Seattle, WA. West Coast Phreakers publishes a text e-zine known as West Coast Phreakers magazine, or WCP 'Zine, tri-yearly. Topics in the e-zine usually revolve around exploiting and exploring computer and telephone networks. Although there have been some articles in the past about Urban Exploration, and Social Engineering, and some on social commentary. It is believed that West Coast Phreakers will create and publish a print magazine, similar to BinRev Magazine and 2600 later this year.</p>

<p>Stolen Youth is best described as a 5 piece fast, hard Punk band reigning from Adelaide, South Australia. Stolen Youth formed in the year 2000, and didn't play until the first show in 2001. Since then Stolen Youth have been playing shows non-stop and has managed to build a very good reputation in the music scene locally and Australia wide. As a band there is one thing Stolen Youth has always focused on and that's the "DIY" ethic. Stolen Youth play shows from clubs and pubs, to halls and alleyways. Stolen Youth are really passionate about its music and have worked extremely hard to get where they are today.</p>
<p>As a guide, some of Stolen Youth's main influences include bands like Propagandhi, MYC, Good Riddance, Strike Anywhere, Strung Out and many others. Stolen Youth have three releases, all through independent record label Two Bucks Records. The first one is an EP that was released in 2003 called "Smurfer", which is a 5-track cd that was recorded in two days. This release stayed in the independent music charts for a number of weeks, debuting at number 2 and remaining there for weeks to come. The next release was a Demo Tape called "Demo 2004" which was a limited release to show the punters where the band was heading with their music. The latest release has been the best to date. The title of this EP is "When Spiders Unite" and has done really well since its release. "When Spiders Unite" has sat at number 1 for the first 12 weeks and looks to remain in the charts for a while to come.</p>
<p>As well as playing with numerous local and interstate bands, Stolen Youth has also had the privilege of supporting international acts such as Good Riddance, Lagwagon, Ignite, Champion, Madball, The Bleeders, Anti-Flag, Lawrence Arms, Suicide Machines, No Use For A Name and Rambo. Stolen Youth has also had the privilege of being on the road and touring around Australia and playing a number of cities such as Melbourne, Sydney, Newcastle, Canberra and Tasmania plus other big shows like Resist Records show case, All Systems Down Fest and more.</p>
<p>Stolen Youth is a very politically charged band. As a band, Stolen Youth have very strong beliefs and it is a main focus when the band writes music. Because of this, Stolen Youth has managed to gain a lot of respect from a large crowed which has made them a strong driving force in the Adelaide music scene.</p>

Some of my interests are music, writing, reading, and more recently, politics. (Thanks in part to The Hour, on CBC news world, hosted by George Stroumboulopoulos) Oh, and the CBC, though I'm sure you've noticed that by now.</p>
<p>The topic that I'd like to talk about in this post is the National Playlist. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/nationalplaylist/" class="external free" title="http://www.cbc.ca/nationalplaylist/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/nationalplaylist/</a> (Known as NP from now on)</p>
<p>I started listening to NP sometime in the fall of 2005, and was immediately hooked. Jian's knowledge and cleverness, combined with the opinions of his panelists is constantly entertaining and interesting, and the music is phenomenal. This broadcast has opened my eyes to bands and musicians that I may never had heard otherwise. And it made Apple some money too. My Christmas wish list this year? About 65 books and an iPod nano.</p>
<p>The NP is the top ten songs for this great nation (Canada) updated every week. Each week, Jian brings in three new panelists, and they each bring two songs to the platform. They present their songs, and argue why it deserves a spot on the list, and I believe that Jian has begun presenting a viewer pick each week in lieu of one of his own picks. The listeners go onto the NP website, and vote on which songs simply have to stay. By the end of the week, four songs have to go, and new ones are added in.</p>
<p>I can say that I'm truly grateful for this program. And while I don't always agree with Jian or the panelists, I can send in my rant through the programs website. Songs that I had already known were given new life when argued by their representative on the show. Jian and the panelists are so knowledgeable when it comes to music, and they notice the smallest, most minute details, things that I may never have picked up on my own. It feels like my birthday when I discover something new about a song I've loved for years.</p>
<p>The only thing that I would change about the NP, is, in addition to airing on CBC Radio One, have it as a podcast! Then, it's ok if I miss it. I can simply download it from iTunes, throw it on my nano, and listen in delight any time I like; on the plane, driving in my car, while reading. It would be a thing of pure beauty.</p>
<p>Either way, the NP is a quality show, and would highly recommend it to any music lover, regardless of age.</p>

<p>History The Big O and Dukes show began on the old 99.1 WHFS station as the evening talent. They filled the spot of Matty when he left for a job in NC after he got married. Chad Dukes began as a fan of the Sports Junkies on WJFK and eventually became a familiar character of the show. Through years of "paying their dues" as they call it, both Oscar and Chad worked their way up to eventually become DJ's. When 99.1 WHFS flipped to Spanish they were given a tryout for the midday spot on Live 105.7 WXYV in Baltimore. The current "Out to Lunch" hosts, Miles and Thrill were negotiating, and eventually signed a contract with a station in Seattle, WA. After many DJ's tried out Big O and Dukes were given the midday spot on the now Live 105.7 WHFS. The show was called "Out to Lunch with Big O and Dukes". For a period of time the "best of" clips of their show were played on 106.7 WJFK on Saturday nights. Former NYC, Baltimore, and MD State Police Chief Ed Norris joined the show in mid 2005. Once Norris was finished his home arrest he came to Baltimore and the show was then renamed "The Ed Norris Show with Big O and Dukes". Shortly thereafter Oscar was let go and just weeks later Chad was as well. Chad has been heard on 1300 WJFK-AM in Baltimore and Oscar has been DJing at BAR Baltimore. They continue their efforts to get the show on XM radio.</p>

<p>I don't know what an "empty construct" is, and I am hoping someone who does know will create this article. It is either a term from formal logic, or from post-modern criticism, or some other similar field.

<p>The <b>United States Indian Police (USIP)</b> were organized in 1880 by the Union Agency in <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muskogee%2C_Oklahoma_7afb.html" title="Muskogee, Oklahoma">Muskogee</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Territory_1bdc.html" title="Indian Territory">Indian Territory</a>, to police the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_Civilized_Tribes_2f13.html" title="Five Civilized Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a>. The USIP recruited many of their policemen from the ranks of the existing <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lighthorse_%28American_Indian_police%29_ce4a.html" title="Lighthorse (American Indian police)">Indian Lighthorsemen</a>. Unlike the Lighthorse who were under the direction of the individual tribe, the USIP was under the direction of the the Indian Agent assigned to the Union Agency. Many of the US Indian policemen were given Deputy US Marshal commissions that allowed them to cross juridictional boundaries and also to arrest non-Indians.</p>
<p>In 1886 two Indians killed <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Sixkiller_47bd.html" title="Sam Sixkiller">Sam Sixkiller</a> who was the popular Captain of the US Indian Police and a Deputy US Marshall comissiond by the Judicial District of Western Arkansas. After the killers escaped indictment by the tribes, Congress passed a law (24 Stat., 463.) giving the district Federal courts juridiction over any Indian who commited a crime against a federally appointed Indian policeman or United States deputy marshal.</p>
<p>==Other Indian police==</p>
<p>There were basically two other types of policemen on the reservations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tribal police.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Several Indian tribes replaced hereditary chiefs with constitutional governments. These tribes hired policemen under a number of different titles—sheriffs, constables, regulators, lighthorsemen, etc.—to enforce tribal laws.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_police.html" title="Indian police">Indian agency police</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Many tribes had no recognizable governments and therefore no tribal laws. On these reservations, the Indian agent assigned to the tribe hired Indian police from among tribal members to effect law and order according to Federal, agency, and treaty rules. These were considered federally appointed policemen. The Indian police that killed Sitting Bull were of this kind.</dd>

<p>The term "trimble" is believed to be a phonetic condensation of the Saxon phrase "Terembel", referring to the mythical artifact of Galatian lore (Terem's Bell or The Terem Bell). Through an unknown path of transmission, English mariners of the colonial period began to employ this term to describe the brief comic outbursts amidst otherwise unbroken periods of doom or despair. When the First Vicar of H.H.R.N, Thomas Waddington, introduced the mystic tradition of Trimblism in his tome "Kaluma! Upanishad of War" he interpreted explicitly as " ...a divine chortle. A moment of vision and disgrumblance. Such as a long awaited bloviation or alieviation of the bowels or loins." Waddington's demise after attempting to retake the island of Anatahan from the British in whose service he had previously helped conquer led to the forbidden status of the practice in the Royal Navy,\. American privateers, however, some of whom had previously been held prisoner by the Royal Navy, began using the term as a perjoritive reference to British officers.</p>
<p>Take for example the following excerpt from the rutters of American Captain Johannes Jornmeinnes of the frigate <i>Locust Eater</i>:</p>
<p><i>The prisoners we had ta'en that day we good men and true and put the back into the rope. Ho'ever the trimble who had the honour and the freedom of my own Cabin and Company did suffer me and my men with the most rank abuses unbecoming a gentleman of his stature. I had previously been under the mista'em impression that trimbles were of the landed class of gentry, yet this man's tongue had clearly seen the darkest corners of the darkest tavern wenches darkest folds. And so we see how a trimble truly a trimble in his heart will always be.</i></p>
<p>The term is all but forgotten today but is used in some regions of the Southern United States as a slang term for the salt-water taffey popular at many seaside resorts, perhaps alluding to British officers alleged fondness of sweets.</p>

<p>Power requires a great deal of timing in the backfield and a lot of physical play by the linemen. Power is only run to the strongside of an offense, usually on the side of the formation where the TE is lined up. On the playside (strongside in this case), the center, guard, tackle and tight end will all block down, that is to block the defender closest to them on the inside. For the center, this generally means blocking back on a DT or making a combo block on the NT to one of the linebackers. This "blocking down" creates great angles for the offensive linemen and allows them to make their blocks relatively easily. However, it creates a problem at the end of the LOS, where the last man is left unblocked...but not for long.</p>
<p>At the snap, the FB will attack the defensive man on the end of the line, usually a DE or LB, with the intention of sealing him to the outside, creating a crease between himself and where the TE was originally lined up at the snap. The weakside guard will pull through this hole and act as a lead blocker for the RB who will be reading the guard's block.</p>
<p>Power is generally good for a few yards, but it can be defeated if the FB makes a poor block or the guard cannot get in position quickly enough to make a block for the RB.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-05_f7cf.html" title="Edit section: Mildred Hubble">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mildred Hubble</span></h2>
<p>Mildred Hubble - Young apprentice witch featured on the British fantasy comedy THE WORST WITCH/ITV/1998-2000 and the sequel series WEIRDSISTER COLLEGE: THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF THE WORST WITCH/ITV/2001. Mildred attends a special school for witches called Miss Cackle's Academy where she lives in a cold, windowless room with her cat, Tabby. Mildred earned a scholarship to the school by writing a creative essay. But, she herself was not born into a family of witches, but she aspires to master the arts of magic and earn her Witches Higher Certificate. And even though the school's gentle-nature headmistress, Miss Cackle, dubbed Mildred "The Worst Witch" she overlooks Mildred's mistakes because she sees that Mildred has the potential to be a truly good witch one day.</p>
<p>The first day of school Mildred started off on the wrong foot by flying into a bunch of dustbins. But, she was rescued by fellow student Maud Moonshine, who along with Ruby, Enid Nightshade (a prankster) and Jadu Wali became her friends.</p>
<p>Mildred's nemesis is teacher's pet, Ethel Hallow. She belittled Mildred by telling her "You have to come from a witch family to be a real witch." Drusilla Paddock is Ethel's nasty sidekick.</p>
<p>The Academy staff consisted of Miss Cackle, the headmistress (Agatha is her evil twin sister), Miss Constance Hardbroom (a strict disciplinarian, former headmistress and potion mistress), Miss Davina Bat, (Chanting Teacher), Miss Imogen Drill (P.E. Teacher), Mrs. Tapioca (school cook), Edgar Hellibore, the Chief WIzard of Hellibore's Academy (a visiting professor), Algernon Rowan-Webb (a wizard in training who used to be a frog) and Mr. Blossom (the Handyman)..</p>
<p>After passing her basic witch training, Mildred Hubble transferred to a special school for witches and wizards called Weirdsister College to further develop her unique and emerging abilities and hopefully learn to cope with her fear of the dark.</p>
<p>UNIFORM Jill Murphy has said that the very smart uniform that the young apprentice witches wear is based on the one she use to wear in her schooldays (without the witch hat), the uniform is made up of a pinafore, blouse (long sleeve at first, but made shot sleeve later much to Miss Hardbroom's disaproveal) and a tie. the colour of the uniform is orange and black in the 1986 Fairuza Balk film, in the the tv series starring Georgina Sherrington the colour of the uniform is balck and blue with some gray trim (on the tie and hat)</p>

<p>Dune: Butlerian Jihad Trilogy of Books</p>
<p><br />
Seurat was a robot in the employ of Omnius during the era known as the Butlerian Jihad in the Dune Universe. Seurat's primary function was to co-pilot the spacecraft: The Dream Voyager, delivering copies of the many Omnius everminds for synchronization with each other. This was known as an Update Ship.</p>
<p>Seurat, like Erasmus is an independent robot. Seurat's independent nature comes from two main sources. The long voyages in space that Seurat has to travel to deliver the copies of the Omnius evermind gave Seurat plenty of time to think independently. Also, his companion during these voyages was Vorian Atreides, son of the Titan Agamemnon and a human trustee under the jurisdiction of Omnius. Seurat's games of strategy, attempts at humor and conversation with Vorian also gave Seurat insight into humanity and thus allowed further independent development.</p>
<p>Seurat was betrayed by Vorian during the human's escape from Omnius at Corrin. Seurat was de-activated by Vorian and left to drift in space in the Dream Voyager. He was however later found by the Titan Agamemnon and forced to serve Agamemnon until his escape. Seurat makes an appearance in the Battle of Corrin by attacking Vorian's ship damaging it heavily. He is thought to have been destroyed during the fight.</p>

<p>Pet stars in the books "Rare Beasts" "Tourist Trap" "Under Town" "Pet's Revenge" "High Wire" "Nod's Limbs", as well as 12 two minute shorts on Nicktoons Network.</p>
<p>You can also find Pet at the Edgar &amp; Ellen website: www.edgarandellen.com</p>
<p>Pet likes television, napping, and avoiding the twins, Edgar and Ellen, at all costs. It may seem like a victim at first-- But don't count Pet out... It has powers all its own, and It always comes out on top!</p>
<p>The Edgar &amp; Ellen series are written by Charles Ogden and illustrated by Rick Carton.</p>
<p>Pet lives in a 13 story tower with the twins, Edgar &amp; Ellen, on the edge of the town, Nod's Limbs. Pet seems simple and sweet in the first three books, but has an agenda of its own by the time Pet's Revenge rolls around-- and Edgar and Ellen will never look at Pet the same way again!!!!</p>
<p>Tricycle Press first released the books in 2003, but now Simon &amp; Schuster have the publishing rights. A company called Star Farm Productions helps the books grow.</p>

<p>Ben Grauer was born in Staten Island, N.Y. in 1908. Grauer was a child actor in the 1920s, both in film and on Broadway. Among his credits were roles in films directed by D.W. Griffith. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School, he received his BA from City College in 1930. Ben Grauer started as an actor in radio, but soon became part of the broadcasting staff at the National Broadcasting Company. He was the main announcer for the NBC Symphony Broadcasts on radio and TV from 1937 till 1954. Arturo Toscanini said he was his favorite announcer. Grauer's other close personal associations in broadcasting included Walter Winchell, Eleanor Roosevelt and of course, Arturo Toscanini. Starting in 1932, Grauer covered the Olympic Games, presidential inaugurations, and international events. He married interior designer Melanie Kahane in 1954 and retired from NBC in 1973. For most, Ben Grauer is best remembered as the NBC radio and TV host of the annual New Year's Eve broadcasts Live from Times Square.</p>
<p>For decades, these broadcasts were part of the NBC Tonight Show, where he worked not only with Johnny Carson, but his predecessors. During his 40 year broadcast career, he hosted over half a dozen TV programs on NBC including game shows, quiz shows, concerts and news programs. His career at NBC ended in 1973. In the decade before his death, Grauer also collected material for a projected history of prices and pricing, with special attention to book prices. He was active in several professional journalistic organizations as well as the Grolier Club. He died in New York City in 1977.</p>

<p>The Corliss engine os a type of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_engine.html" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a> developed by George H. Corliss. Prior to the development of the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_turbine.html" title="Steam turbine">steam turbine</a>, Corliss engines were the most efficient type of steam engine and the preferred type of engine for large constant-speed stationary power applications. The most famous Corliss engine of the 19th century was the central exhibit in Machinery Hall at the great <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centennial_Exposition_0807.html" title="Centennial Exposition">Centennial Exposition</a> of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>.</p>
<p>A double-acting single cylinder Corliss engine was characterized by the use of four rotary valves,one exhaust valve and one admission valve at each end of the cylinder. An ingenious <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cam.html" title="Cam">cam</a> in the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linkage.html" title="Linkage">linkage</a> for the admission valves controlled the cut-off of the admission valves. This allowed the admission valves to admit only a brief puff of high pressure steam when the engine was operating at low load, or a long blast of steam at high load, with automatic regulation by a <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor.html" title="Governor">Governor</a>.</p>
<p>Large Corliss engines are preserved today at a number of museums, including the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_Museum_f6ec.html" title="Henry Ford Museum">Henry Ford Museum</a>.</p>

<p>A form of underground dance started by Don Campbellock during the early 70s in California. Its style is easily recognizable because of the signature "funky chicken" inspired elbow flapping, pointing, and wrist rolls. The uninitiated often confuse this style with <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popping.html" title="Popping">popping</a> or pop n'lock or poplocking. The latter two words do not refer to any particular form of dance but were used because popping and locking originated so closely to one another in time and space that the public had trouble discerning the two.</p>

<p>In less than one year, in three Australian states, Australia’s hottest burlesque troupe, the <b>Voodoo Trash Dolls</b> have performed over 20 sold-out shows, appeared at festivals, on DVDs, TV shows, radio programs and magazines, opened exhibitions and posed for numerous photo shoots. They've started a national phenomenon that extends beyond their onstage performance antics.</p>
<p>They’ve been rewarded with a nomination for a Rainbow Award, rave reviews from media, industry and fans, upcoming DVD appearances, bookings Australia-wide and a flurry of international interest.</p>
<p>The <b>Voodoo Trash Dolls</b> quickly trashed the fantasy world of burlesque with their individual interpretation of the genre, bringing in their wild hair, tattoos, piercings and outrageous costumes, all the while delivering professionally powerful and consistently entertaining shows.</p>
<p>The dolls are all professionally trained performers (some are even teachers of their fortes) who have extensive international performance experience. The <b>Voodoo Trash Dolls</b> is the latest incarnation for these girls, who have spent years often working with each other in stage and film with mutant cabaret and wild installation pieces.</p>
<p>They combine a unique blend of choreographed dance, song, acting, butoh, on stage piercing and other wild pieces, and dramatise it more with crazy props like washing machines, anglegrinders, knives, needles, chairs and poles.</p>
<p>Don’t expect the twirling pasties to a slinky old song – expect the tittie tassles to be on fire to the beats of Rammstein or Marilyn Manson.</p>
