<p>Strange article, mixing completly disparate concepts with no NPOV common denominator. 'Fascism', is in modern political context almost exclusively used as a pejorative, and the common denominator of all tendencies mentioned in the article is that they have opponents that have branded them as such. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 16:02, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> As the quotation from Orwell in the article says: "...the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless". Not entirely true, but any encyclopaedia article on "neo-fascism" has got to define its terms more thoroughly than this one does. The only section that deals with actual neo-fascist groups and religion is the section on paganism - and that has no references. Parties that might reasonably be described as "neo-fascist", such as Alessandra Mussolini's outfit in Italy or Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National are conspicuous by their absence. Instead, we get a lot of stuff about extremely conservative religious groups with possible theocratic tendencies being called "fascists" by their opponents. Did Mussolini or Hitler aim at theocracy? No. So it's just "fascism" being used as a generalised insult for anything perceived as politically undesirable. Not encyclopaedic enough in its present state. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 10:56, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Re "conspicuous by their absence": Of course they're not mentioned in this particular article -- why would they be? They have nothing to do with the subject of the article. Ms Mussolini is mentioned in <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-fascism.html" title="Neo-fascism">Neo-fascism</a>, as one would expect. <a href="../../../c/g/i/User%7ECgingold_abdb.html" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> 15:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Maybe because they are among the most notable "neo-fascist" organisations currently around and the first term in this article's title is "neo-fascism". As far as I can see, this article doesn't even try to define that term. It mostly merely reports vague allegations that certain religious groups have some things in common with old-style fascism. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 16:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Of course there might be material in the text that might be relevant in other articles. Church-state relations in Italy, Germany and Spain during Fascism would certainly deserve independent articles. Particularily the relations between German Nazis and religion is very interesting and complex. However, there is no common denominator of all movements inspired by Fascism regarding religion. In some cases, Fascists (or people widely accused of being Fascists) have had a strong religious profile, whilst in other cases promoted secularism. There is no common denominator on which to build this article, the is no universal phenomenon to describe. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 11:14, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree the article needs work. There is also a general wikipedia caution against articles about "and" topics. But the article draws together important material that should be here. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 15:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> - I've had a day to reflect on this (rather than just jumping in and reflexively arguing against deletion). Judging from the comments I've read here, there seems to be a serious misunderstanding of what the article is actually about. People seem to have misconstrued the title. (Possibly it could be modified slightly, if that's the case.) If the title were, say, <b>"Neo-fascist religious movements</b>", then I could easily understand the objections -- in fact, I would almost certainly <i>agree</i> with them. But the actual title -- <b>"Neo-fascism and religion"</b> -- indicates that the purpose of the article is to discuss <i>whatever connections there may be</i> between those entities. It doesn't <i>presume</i> that all of the religions that are discussed in the article do, in fact, <b>have</b> neo-fascist elements. The whole point, as I see it, is to help readers sort out which, if any, of them really <b>do</b> have such elements.</p>
<p>My impression is that some of the people who are supporting deletion really just want the subject to go away, because they find it offensive. But whether anybody likes it or not, it's a <b>fact</b> that countless such assertions are made about one or another religion, sect, etc. To simply delete this article -- rather than improving it -- would be to pretend otherwise, and would be a real disservice to Wikipedia readers, depriving them of an opportunity to learn about such issues from a <i>neutral source</i>. This article has a number of serious editors who in my judgement are committed to the need for an evenhanded and impartial article. Whatever flaws there may be should be eliminated through the usual WP editorial process. Deletion is far too extreme a "remedy" -- in fact, it would just be a copout, taking the easy way out, instead of doing the work to improve the article. <a href="../../../c/g/i/User%7ECgingold_abdb.html" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> 15:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> "My impression is that some of the people who are supporting deletion really just want the subject to go away, because they find it offensive". Would you please avoid using <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> speculation like this and stick to the arguments people have made here. My objection is much the same as Soman's: this article is impossibly vague and disparate and has too much material where "neo-fascist" is used as a loose synonym for "totalitarian", "authoritarian" or even "theocratic". The bit that could be saved (the section which notes connections between genuine neo-fascists and neo-paganism) is unsourced. Get some references and save that and use it as a core to rebuild the article. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 17:38, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - unacceptably POV. It's high time Wikipedia got rid of all of these concept articles, as most of them are little more than highly POV/OR/OR synthesis essays, like this one. OR synthesis is the big problem.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This page has a history. Its creation allowed for a serious discussion of the issue (see the cites) in a context that defused heated and lengthy edit wars over several pages that looked only at one religion, especially Islam. (See the battle over <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> for example). There are serious scholars who look at this question. See, for example, the <i>Journal of Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions</i>, especially Vol. 5, No. 3, (Winter), special issue on Fascism as a Totalitarian Movement: <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tmp/2004/00000005/00000003" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tmp/2004/00000005/00000003" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. See especially Roger Griffin's Introduction: "God's counterfeiters? investigating the triad of fascism, totalitarianism and (political) religion." Sure this page can be improved, but it does not confuse "totalitarian", "authoritarian" or even "theocratic" concepts, it attempts to tease out how they relate or do not relate using a framework developed in a peer review scholarly journal.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 14:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Lots of delete voters are saying this because it contains OR and POV material.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - this article appears to have been started as a NPOV way of addressing this subject in a well sourced and scholarly way, and to replace the previous articles (Christofascism, Christian Fascism, Islamofascism etc) that had serious POV issues. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> has remained a separate article but the others now redirect to this one. A good case could be made either way but I'm not sure if the alternative to keeping this would be worse - the proliferation once again of articles with far worse POV issues than this one. Probably worth keeping provided it can be kept well sourced, neutral, and free of unsourced personal essays <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 22:08, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further comments</b> - I think it's worth noting that, even while this Afd discussion has been taking place, three editors (Rumpelstiltskin223, Bobfrombrockley, and Dragomiloff) have engaged in serious editing and the addition of numerous references. The section re <b>Hinduism</b> is already <i>much improved</i> over where it was previously -- which is notable, because this Afd nomination seems to have been a <i>direct outgrowth of the dispute</i> that was going on with regard to that particular section. This ongoing progress bears out one of the central points I made above:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"This article has a number of serious editors who in my judgement are committed to the need for an evenhanded and impartial article. <i>Whatever flaws there may be should be eliminated through the usual WP editorial process.</i> Deletion is far too extreme a "remedy" -- in fact, it would just be a copout, taking the easy way out, instead of doing the work to improve the article."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Returning to another point I raised above, regarding the <b>title of the article</b>: I believe that the current title inadvertently raises certain expectations, on the part of some readers, in terms of the primary focus of the article, which is not so much on <i>Neo-fascism</i> itself, as it is on <i>religions</i> -- more correctly, <i>religious movements</i> -- which may have <i>fascistic elements.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While it's certainly true that changing the title wouldn't eliminate all of the hard work that will still be needed to improve the article, I do think that we should give serious consideration to modifying the title to better reflect the subject/issues that the article is intended to address. Perhaps something along the lines of <i>Fascistic currents in modern religious movements</i> (or more completely, <i>Claims of Fascistic currents in modern religious movements</i>). No doubt that can be improved upon, but I think it does more accurately denote the intended focus of the article.</dd>
