<li><b>Delete</b> - <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, unsourced, indiscriminate.

The first part is valuable analysis, many parts of which can be sourced. The portrayal of the article by the nom as "seeking to capture every appearance in every medium of not only a katana, but of any sword or sword-like weapon" is <i>highly</i> misleading as it describes only one part of the article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Based on the other articles wiki-linked here, this obviously can't all be "original research."

Since I believe this article violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and stated so in the nomination, I am puzzled at your suggestion that I have acted inappropriately by nominating it.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Black Falcon already said why. Otto4711's idea that AfD is how we "hash out" what's wrong with an article does not follow our policies/guidelines/essays. His AfD criterion seems to be if an article has "List of" or "in fiction" in the title. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 07:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Er, I didn't say that AFD is for hashing out what's wrong with an article. AFD is for determining (or hashing out, which is a synonym for determining) whether an article meets or fails Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Nor have I ever said that "List of" articles automatically violate policy. Please don't misrepresent me.

<li>I'm sorry if that assessment of your recent debating style hurt your feelings, but I'm afraid that I agree with it too. All too much of your "reasoning" when arguing to delete these many articles has seemed according to your personal feelings rather than Wikipedia policy, and your personal feelings do seem to be heavily against "list" and "popular culture" articles. Plus, you do bring up a lot of flaws in articles that are not deletion criteria. A film list with a few erroneously listed films does not need to be deleted for that reason alone, nor does an article need to be deleted simply because the introductory paragraph is an abomination of bad grammar and unsourced assumptions. Please try not to bring up everything that is wrong with an article during an AfD; try to stick to problems that actually meet (or come close to meeting) deletion criteria. AfD is not the right place to discuss fixing an article unless the flaws are inherently something close to deletable level. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 03:56, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It has nothing to do with "hurting my feelings." I did not say one word about my "feelings" and I have to wonder if your bringing "feelings" into this is an honest misreading of my comments or another in your long string of questionable comments in response to these recent AFDs. It has everything to do with not misrepresenting my words. Why you are bringing up the idea of deleting articles because of such things as bad grammar is a mystery, because I did not suggest that this article be deleted for bad grammar or for any other reasons of style. I nominated this article for exactly the reasons I stated, so it would probably be more helpful, not to mention refreshingly honest on your part, to respond to the things I actually wrote instead of responding to phantom allegations that were never made. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In your recent mass AfD of many articles, aimed especially at "list" and "pop culture" list-like articles, you've mostly (but not entirely) argued according to small flaws and also used emotionally-charged language and personal opinions in many cases instead of using actual reasons from <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> that an article should be deleted. In saying that I hoped I wasn't hurting your feelings, I was trying to be polite, that was just a polite opening sentence because you already seemed quite worked up and I knew I'd go on to say some things that would sound less than flattering. It has nothing to do with my later statement that you keep bringing up criteria that are not deletion criteria, but rather wanting to delete articles according to your own personal feelings and interests. Trying to conflate those statements together makes it seem as if you aren't really paying attention when you read (something I'm beginning more and more to suspect is true of you) or that you're insistent on trying to <a href="../../../o/b/f/Obfuscation.html" title="Obfuscation">obfuscate</a> my points. As to the fact that you seem to be anti-list, your own statements on many of these AfDs support that, as does the fact that nearly everything you nominated was a list. I've asked you before, and I'll ask you here again, two questions. (1) Can you point out any instances in which you've voted in favor of keeping a list? (if you're afraid I'll miss your reply, you can drop a note on my talk page) and (2) If you want to continue calling me a liar instead of addressing the points I've brought up, will you please put your future accusations on my talk page? It really clutters up these AfDs. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 01:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, in the recent mass AFD of many articles, I pointed to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and in some cases noted <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. I'm not sure why exactly you continue to try to misrepresent these nominations. As for your false claim that I am not citing actual deletion policy, I refer you to the chart at the policy page you linked entitled <b>Problem articles where deletion may be needed</b>. If you look at the very first box it states quite clearly that for articles in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> the solution is to prod them or AFD them. I have acted entirely in line with Wikipedia policy, including the deletion policy, and for you to say otherwise is untrue. As for whether I'm paying attention, I'm not the one who voted on the athletes in film article without realizing what the article actually was. As for trying to obfuscate your points, I find that accusation laughable in the face of your repoeated distortions and untruths. As for whether I've voted in favor of keeping a list, the three-part answer is 1) whether I have or not is irrelevant, 2) <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_adaptations_of_The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray_165c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of adaptations of The Picture of Dorian Gray">yes I have</a> and 3) not only have I voted in favor of lists, I've even created some. As for calling you on your lies, no, I'll continue to do so where you lie. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:58, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not claiming that you never cite Wikipedia deletion criteria policy. You usually have some sort of nod to deletion criteria policy in the canned phrase that you typically used on most of these mass AfD nominations, but then (except on those articles where the policy concern cited really applied) you typically have a flood of editors who agree that the policy you've cited simply doesn't apply to that article, at which point you tend to bring up every little flaw the article has or could have in the future, flaws that are not deletion criteria themselves, and then you try to argue that the article should be deleted on the basis of those flaws. The most obvious point raised in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> is that normal editing concerns are not deletion criteria. That's why I keep telling you to stick to deletion criteria and use <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> instead of your personal dislikes. You should also note that I don't use emotionally-charged language such as "liar" to apply to you, despite that you keep seriously misunderstanding what I've said even when I've been quite plain. Instead, I point out the flaws in your tactics, and I sometimes call you "impatient" or "hasty" instead of saying that you are trying to cause trouble on purpose. Thus, I tend to describe you in <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_faith_4adf.html" title="Wikipedia:Good faith">good faith</a> terms, as if you have done various things through accident, or through a genuine misunderstanding. In asking you to resrict the name-calling to my talk page, I was trying to keep all these AfD debates from being flamed. You can attempt to illustrate flaws in my arguments without resorting to such strong language. Please, if you cannot stay civil, I may eventually start assuming <a href="../../../b/a/d/Wikipedia%7EBad_faith_5b43.html" title="Wikipedia:Bad faith">Wikipedia:Bad faith</a> on your part, as some others have already been leaning towards, but I'd rather not do that. If you think that it's so obvious that I've described you as doing something you're not, you can let others judge on their own (your statements above are plain for all to see) or you can use less emotionally-loaded language such as "Mermaid from the Baltic Sea is not describing my actions as I see them, in fact I think that what I did was ....". Please do stop it with the name-calling. The term "liar" is especially offensive. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 18:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry if being called on your statements hurts your feelings. And I'm sorry if you choose to interpret nominating multiple articles with the same problems with the same or similar language as "canned responses." As for assuming bad faith, it's pretty clear from a number of your comments that you already do, which is fine by me because I know it's not true. And there is really no need for you to keep linking to the deletion policy. I have read it, and it says right on it in big ol' English words that the solution to articles which fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is to prod them or AFD them. I don't nominate articles by accident, I don't do it out of "misunderstanding," I do not make nominations based on what I do or don't "like" and I don't do it to solve editing problems. Your constant insistence that I do has gone past the point of being tiresome. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:02, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
