<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. This page contains much sexuality in its contents and quite a few inappropriate images. A normal encyclopedia would not have an article about this ridiculous erotic spanking. I think it is safe to assume that not too many users view this article, except those who are... unlike most, no offense. It is quite useless, in my humble opinion, and merely taking up space in Wikipedia. I did not expect many people to object. I am sorry if I have done something wrong by proposing the deletion of this article, it is just that I did not expect too many people to oppose my opinion. Please consider my suggestion to remove this article. I doubt it will greatly impact your life in a negative way if this article is gone, but I fear it is possible that the same cannot be said for others, especially younger users. Please support my suggestion. Thanks! <a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUioh_b3e0.html" title="User:Uioh">Uioh</a> 23:22, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Neutral</b> I have changed again to Neutral. I shall admit it, I am not such a big fan of erotic subjects, but it is my habit to participate in every issue. You are right, Uio, this article DOES contain sexuality and it DOES have images that are not too pleasant. However, HalJor is quite right, Wikipedia is NOT censored. I understand your concern that this page could have a negative effect on certain people, especially minors, and, though I WOULD want to delete the article, it simply does not directly defy the rules and regulations of Wikipedia. Uio, YOU must kindly understand that Wikipedia does NOT censor its articles, though I repeat, your suggestion that this page should be deleted is certainly understandable. <a href="../../../n/t/y/User%7ENtyfj_7530.html" title="User:Ntyfj">Ntyfj</a> 22:04, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The initial nomination basis is invalid because it is not based in policy. However, think <b>the policies</b> people. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. This article not only violates but radically violates <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>RATIONALE:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>This article does not establish notability, verifiability, or neutrality per how those are defined <i>in Wikipedia policy</i></b>
<ul>
<li>"A topic is notable if it has been the subject of <u>multiple</u>, non-trivial, <u>reliable</u> published works, whose sources <u>are independent of</u> the subject itself" (from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>).
<ul>
<li>The article uses only <u>one</u> book reference. That is INSUFFICIENT to establish notability. Moreover, the one reference in itself fails to meet standard of being a reliable independent source so as to establish notability, and it violates NPOV:
<ul>
<li>"In order to have a neutral article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will be <u>from unbiased and unaffiliated sources</u>; and that those interested in the article will not be exclusively <u>partisan or fanatic editors</u>" (quote from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). Clearly, this article violates that because:
<ul>
<li>1. The lone reference is of a book that is VERY clearly NOT from an "unbiased and unaffiliated source". The author, "<a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Green_58fa.html" title="Lady Green">Lady Green</a>", is very clearly a partisan practitioner of Erotic spanking. Her book cannot be used in this article but only in an article about herself (see #5 below).</li>
<li>2. The publisher of the lone reference in the article is <a href="http://www.greenerypress.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.greenerypress.com/" rel="nofollow">Greenery Press</a>. Nice sounding, but have a look at their website and tell me if you really think they meet the standard of being an "unbiased and unaffiliated source", or whether it is "independent of the subject itself". Not even close! Thus, even the lone book reference cited in the article fails to establish notability as that is defined in Wikipedia policies - it is not from "an unbiased and unaffiliated source".</li>
<li>3. "Those interested in the article," who have written the article, have very clear been "exclusively partisan or fanatic editors." This is evidenced by the product they have produced that uses the lone book source they have used in the article which is clearly NOT an "unbiased and unaffiliated source" that is "independent of the subject itself". As well, by the act of editing, editors implicitly consent that they know and author within Wikipedia content policies. This article has existed for almost 5 years and been subject to nearly 500 edits yet it violates said policies as just described and as will be described more below. This evidences they are "exclusively partisan or fanatic editors."</li>
<li>4. "Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy" (from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). Does anyone want to claim that "Lady Green" and Greenery Press tally to a "reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy"?? Hence:</li>
<li>5. The lone book used to justify this article is, per Wikipedia policy at <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Sources_of_dubious_reliability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources_of_dubious_reliability</a>, is a source "of dubious reliability", which are defined in the policy as "sources with a poor reputation for fact-checking or with no fact-checking facilities or editorial oversight." It continues, "Sources of dubious reliability should only be used in <u>articles about the author(s)"</u>.</li>
<li>6. The dubious reliability is evidenced throughout the article. Here is a <u>radically</u> dubious, and controversial, claim from the article: "Examples [of <i>spankophiles</i>] include the poet <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algernon_Swinburne_a890.html" title="Algernon Swinburne">Algernon Swinburne</a> and the philosopher <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_3039.html" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>." Wow!!! But per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, "Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources." Yet here in this article we have only a dubious source that, by Wikipedia policy, can not even be used in this article but only be used in an article about the author, i.e., "<a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Green_58fa.html" title="Lady Green">Lady Green</a>". Yet here we have it as the lone source!</li>
<li>7.<a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT#Wikipedia_is_not_censored</a> has a crucially important caveat. Yes, articles some find offensive are allowed, <u>"provided they do not violate any of our existing policies"</u>, it says. <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT#Wikipedia_is_not_censored</a> is not a trump card to every other policy.</li>

<dd>It might be worth noting that <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> didn't actually say <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> had nominated this article, but was pointing out all the sexually-oriented articles you have nominated for deletion, as a means (I think) of putting your rationale into the context of your actions. Further, your notability rationale extends what the policy means beyond what it says. "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself" does not mean that the multiple sources need to be referenced in the article, but that they have to exist. The article should assert the notability of its subject, but it is not called on to prove that assertion. Pursuing a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" class="extiw" title="meta:Deletionism">deletionist agenda</a> does not strike me as being in the best interests of the project.

<p>LOL. The recent "reference additions" is what is called <i>reference-padding</i>.</p>
<p>The willingness to reference-pad further evidences that "Those interested in the article," who have written the article, have very clear been "exclusively partisan or fanatic editors."</p>
<p>Here is how reference-padding works:</p>
<ol>
<li>You write an article based on one book that, per policy, can only be used in the author's biography</li>
<li>Someone calls you on it (me)</li>
<li>You quick scramble and stick some other references into the article <i>while leaving the text intact</i></li>
<li>You magically think that fixes the article</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the funniest tactics of this was including <a href="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=XNNEFH7GDDQA9GALKUSDEG5XU50D71H2&amp;ID=65902" class="external text" title="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=XNNEFH7GDDQA9GALKUSDEG5XU50D71H2&amp;ID=65902" rel="nofollow">this URL</a> in the reference. It screams, "I have never actually read this article". But I <i>have</i> read the article, because I have access to it from my major university's library (the direct URL to the journal article is <a href="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/E-Text/View_EText.asp?sid=7PB1EGG8PJDJ9HS24WE5KJHPMVNK1LN5&amp;a=3&amp;s=J082&amp;v=50&amp;i=2%2F3&amp;fn=J082v50n02%5F04" class="external text" title="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/E-Text/View_EText.asp?sid=7PB1EGG8PJDJ9HS24WE5KJHPMVNK1LN5&amp;a=3&amp;s=J082&amp;v=50&amp;i=2%2F3&amp;fn=J082v50n02%5F04" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Guess what. <i>Nothing in the journal text provides support for the text in this WP article.</i> Thus, reference-padding.</p>
<p>If you want to prove reference-padding has not been further done, although anyone with integrity and sense will admit what I am saying is true and that this padding is as plain as day, I want to see <i>page numbers</i> to the "extra" references you added <i>keyed by footnotes to assertions in the text</i>.</p>
<p>Here is <i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3913/3913.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3913/3913.txt" rel="nofollow">The Confessions of Jean-Jaques Rousseau</a></i>, the complete book available to anyone because it is public domain. Perhaps you can start there. Surely if you have even actually read this book (VERY unlikely, of course) you will know where to find the text where he reportedly "confesses" to being a <i>spankophile</i>. Good luck.</p>
<p>However, please be assured <u>I will check the references and call you on it</u>, as I did <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_AfD_Original_Research_of_Wanker_and_non_Verfiability_of_claims_b54b.html" title="User:CyberAnth/AfD/Original Research of Wanker and non Verfiability of claims">here</a>. Surely, if no hocus-pocus reference-padding has gone on, no one would fear doing this.</p>

<dd>The first thing that you just have proven is that <i>you</i> have not looked at the actual reference. There is online access to the article and it is an article dedicated to "sexual spanking" (and more precisely, about how people practicing spanking see themselves), which states (let me quote <i>from</i> the article): <i>The specific activity described in this article is simply called erotic spanking.</i>. The second thing is that I did not include the article in a section "References", but in a section called "References and further reading" (I hope you appreciate the difference). Finally, <i>inline</i> citations are currently NOT required by Wikipedia (although they are encouraged), please read <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>. Yes, in time inline citations would be better, but at least now this very applicable article is already linked to from the Wikipedia article, allowing also others to more quickly find it.

<p>I know it has been reference-padded. That is what I said.</p>
<p>The purpose of the journal article is to delve into the <i>ontological identify formations of erotic spankers and how they psychologically guide themselves through stigmatization neutralizations</i>.</p>
<p>The piece asks, "How do spanking aficionados understand and explain themselves?" It seeks to understand spankers' "sexual scripts, neutralization of stigma, impression management, and the development of the sexual self". It uses interviews as its primary research method.</p>
<p>It is not about exhibitionism.</p>
<p>Here is a quote that captures much of the tenor of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About spanking aficionados, he did say, "We wonder about ourselves and our 'perversion' endlessly" ... Newer participants were especially prone to these musings. Andrew said, "You know, I can’t believe that I’m here. I look around and wonder what the hell I’m doing here. I mean, I'm not like these other people. This isn’t all I do or anything." He was trying to neutralize any stigma to himself by comparing himself to the other party-goers. He implied that the others had a single-minded focus on spanking–but he was "normal," his interest in spanking was just a small piece of his identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article then expands the above description of stigmatization neutralization, by showing it is done through comparing one's own behavior with others':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One group denigrates another "fringe" group in order to mitigate the stigmatizing effects: "are more normal than they are; they are the true deviants."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't "write an article" citing one unallowable reference and then "get it referenced" via reference padding with allowable ones, while keeping the text intact based on one unallowable reference. You scrap the text, go to the reliable references, and then write the article based solidly upon them. You might call that "bad faith", but I call it "how to responsibly write an encyclopedia."</p>

<dd>First of all, I didn't write the article. Second, you don't have to copy/paste random, beside the point quotes from the article to prove that you have access. Finally, although admirable, what you consider "how to responsibly write an encyclopedia" is not how Wikipedia currently works. All the time people are adding unsourced information. Given time and attention, that information will be sourced (by the same people, or by others) or removed <i>íf sources cannot be found</i>. You want to remove information without even having looked if sources exist (as proven above by the fact that you fully disregarded the mentioned article as a source). There is (in Wikipedia) nothing wrong with searching references for statements made by others. It happens all the time and is (part of) how Wikipedia works. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 22:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Random text? You're kidding, right? I gave a brief review of the whole article. The only thing it does is verify a few basic facts, e.g., "spanking often occurs on the buttocks". If you want to have entire books reference material, place the page numbers with footnotes at the bottom so people can actually verify it. Otherwise, no one can tell it from reference padding. Would you like people to have to read the entire book to verify some sentences? If you have the book, place the page numbers and reference them to specific portions of the text. That way I can (and will) verify (or falsify) it. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 23:02, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No I was not kidding, you are cluttering this discussion with unrelated things. The article is (as you yourself stated) based on <i>interviews</i> with people engaging in spanking. <i>They themselves</i> have stated they were "solely interested in “the bottom,” or the buttocks". This is the <i>perfect</i> source for that statement in the Wikipedia article. And yes, those are basic facts. Are you now saying that the basic facts do not need sources?

I am speaking of the rest of the article that I cannot verify. If whoever added the Koetzle and Marcus book did not just reference-pad with them by just finding a book listed at amazon.com or something, it should not be too much trouble to post page numbers footnoted to article text so I can verify (or falsify) the content. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 23:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment on the "reference padding"</b> Okay, I'm the one who added the new paragraph on the Victorian spanking, the new book references, and the phrase about Rousseau's <i>Confessions</i>. I was relaying facts from a term paper I wrote three years ago for a class on Victorian pornography. If that makes me partisan, then so are many other people working in sex and gender studies. I'm sorry if I don't remember exact page numbers from books I read in 2003, but to impugn someone's integrity without knowing all the facts is cruel and insulting. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.224.105.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.224.105.69_996e.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.224.105.69">contribs</a>) 22:38, 5 January 2007.</small></li>

<dd>In the article, is it worded as an interpretive claim by so-and-so author or is it asserted as fact that can plainly be read in Confessions? <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 00:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Those interested in giving or receiving erotic spankings are sometimes (rarely) known as spankophiles. Examples include the poet Algernon Swinburne (as implied repeatedly in his poetry) and the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, <b>as detailed in his autobiography "Confessions"</b> [emphasis mine] So, I'm guessing the latter. But the wording could be improved - how would you do so?</dd>

<li><b>Comment - My rationale for speedy keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the fact that this topic is extremely notable and has historic significance, it's a part of healthy and consensual sexuality. Wikipedia is not censored for children, and furthermore, children are not idiots. Any minor with access to an unlocked computer (how many of <i>those</i> are around, I wonder) or a <i>library card</i> can and <i>will</i> get whatever information they need on just about any topic.</p>
<p>If they have a couple of bucks and an older friend, they can get everything they need to know in the way of pornography. On any topic related to sexuality, I personally would prefer they got their info <i>here</i>, rather than <i>there</i>. Erotic Spanking doesn't need to be deleted, it needs to be expanded and improved. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinaOdell_d40b.html" title="User:NinaOdell">Nina Odell</a> 01:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - the article is on a valid subject, notable enough for Wikipedia. If people want to see more references the way to go is to add an appropriate clean-up tag to the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:06, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy &amp; strong keep</b> - The original rationale is not only not supported by policy, it is opposed by policy. The detailed arguments of <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> speak to a need to improve the article. Given <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a>'s concern about the article, my suggestion would be that his/her energies be turned toward improving it. The subject is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> (close to 200,000 Google hits on the exact phrase "erotic spanking"). It's been the subject of book, magazine, film, and scholarly research. Notability is so clearly and objectively established in popular culture as to render assertions to the contrary doubtful at best. Certainly, the article needs improvement, but deletion is unwarranted. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 05:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>, <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">snowball's</a> chance under this dogpile. Fram and Ssbohio have said all that needed to be said.
