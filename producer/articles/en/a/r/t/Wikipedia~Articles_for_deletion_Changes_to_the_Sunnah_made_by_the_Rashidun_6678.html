<p>Striver created this article as part of his new strategy -- instead of facing community criticism of his changes to the "established" Islamic articles, he's just going to write his own Shi'a POV articles and then link them to the main articles.</p>
<p>This article can't be kept because even the TITLE is a Shi'a indictment of the first three caliphs -- they say that the first three caliphs made law and changed custom, whereas the community should have adhered strictly to the sunnah, or custom of the time of Muhammad. There is no way that a traditional Sunni Muslim can argue that any changes were OK -- the Sunni Muslim is going to have to deny any changes whatsoever. At which point the article just becomes a catalogue of "did" and "did not".</p>
<p>There is a secular, academic argument to be made about the extent of the authority ceded to the first caliphs -- best exemplified in Crone's book, <i>God's Caliph</i> -- but it should be made at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a> or <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> or possibly <a href="../../../u/l/e/Ulema.html" title="Ulema">Ulema</a>.

<p>The <b>Sunnis believe</b> that the words and deeds of the Prophet, who is, according to the Quran (XXX, 21), the uswah hasahah (noble paradigm), must be followed in every walk of life, as they were followed by his sahabah (companions), tabi'un (followers of the companions), and atba' al-tabi'in (followers of the followers of the companions). "It is incumbent upon you," said the Prophet, "<b>to follow my Sunnah <i>AND</i> the sunnah of the righteous caliphs</b> (al-khulafa' al-rashidun) (<a href="http://www.sunnirazvi.org/sunnipath/sunnism/beliefs.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sunnirazvi.org/sunnipath/sunnism/beliefs.htm" rel="nofollow">ref</a>)</p>
<p>Why do you think Ali did not get choosen as the second Khalif?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>After such consultation, Abdur Rahman formed the impression that the majority of the people favored the election of Othman. Contacting the two candidates separately he put to them the question whether they would <b>follow in the footsteps of the previous Caliphs</b>. Ali said that he would do so as far as possible subject to his best judgment in the light of the Quran and Sunnah. <b>Othman replied to the question in the affirmative without any reservation</b>. Thereupon Abdur Rahman gave his verdict in favor of Othman who was acclaimed as the Caliph, and the people ordered the oath of allegiance to him.

<p>Notice the Sunni twist to it. Ali refused to Follow Umar's changes, hence Uthman was selected.</p>
<p>Zora, you really know how to annoy me. Why did you start a vote for deletion when you only meant to change the name of the article?</p>
<p>All Sunnis that are going to vote, could you also include in your vote you view on what the Sunni schol says about the issue, Did Umar change anything in the Sunnah, Are Sunnis expected to follow the Sunnah of Muhammad (sa) AND the Sunnah of the four caliphs?</p>
<p>Do Sunnis regard <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_talaq.html" title="Triple talaq">triple talaq</a> permisible, yes or no?</p>

It also makes incorrect claims about Sunni belief (for instance, with remarkable chutzpah, it claims that "Umar took the solitary prayer of the month of ramadhan and changed it to congretional] prayer. (Muslim, Bukhari)" when just 3 hadith down from the Muslim citation (by Abu Hurairah) is a hadith via Aisha confirming that congregational prayer was indeed practiced in Ramadan by the Prophet.

<dd>It's not that I don't want to have the Shi'a view represented. I want it represented WELL, and readably. I have incurred the anger of the three Shi'a working on Wikipedia (Striver, Zereshk, and Ya Ali) by objecting to arguments that consist mainly of hadith dumps, copyvios, and misspellings.

<ul>
<li>To exile <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwan_ibn_al-Hakam_8123.html" title="Marwan ibn al-Hakam">Marwan ibn al-Hakam</a> is Sunnah, simply because <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> (as) did it. But if you dont agree, we can move it down to the shia view. And of cource, in shia view, its Sunnah to not exile Abu Dharr, Muhammad (as) called him the most truthfull man betwen heaven and earth!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>About the solitary prayer, that is why its under Shia view and not Sunni view. We Shia belive that it is not Sunnah, and Ali dispersed those who did it during his Caliphat. As goes for Muslim, whe dont consider all of it as Authentic.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no pov problem, except for maybe Marwan. Ill toss down Marwan to the Shia view. Is there any more POV issues left after that?</p>
<p><br />
And by the whay, POV is not solved by deleting the whole article, its solved by NPOVing or in worst case, deleting. I know that Sunni dont like to see that list. But not liking the list does not warant a deletion.</p>

<p>What we've got here is two Shi'a insisting that Wikipedia be their soapbox, that they get to have articles devoted to their "personalistic" view of history, in which everything is reduced to piety and personality. The <i>good</i> pious Muslims followed Ali, and were persecuted for it; the <i>bad</i> worldly Muslims followed the Sunni path. Anyone who did not choose Ali was a bad person, which is to be shown by oral traditions (possibly folktales or bazaar gossip) collected hundreds of years later, showing the Sunni leaders as monsters of depravity and hatred. Really -- this is history as comic book material. It IS possible to present history from a Shi'a viewpoint without turning it all into personalities. I was quite impressed with Reza Aslan's 2005 book <i>No God But God</i>, which is based on extensive academic research, and shows the early Muslims as making choices based on conflicting interpretations of Islam, views of how the political process was to be managed, etc. Aslan presents a Shi'a POV without turning it into hagiography/demonology.</p>
<p>The insistence on stuffing this material into a frame which ASSUMES that innovation is bad is also inherently POV. This is the POV of current traditionalist Islam, of "fundamentalis", of Wahabi, Salafi, and Islamist Muslims -- but it is not the POV of non-Muslims, or of Muslim liberals and reformers. Part of the material in the article could go into the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Islam_4b8a.html" title="Shi'a Islam">Shi'a Islam</a> article, as describing Shi'a belief, and part of it could go into <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a>, discussing early Muslim views of the authority of the caliph.</p>
<p>Crone makes a good argument that current-day Muslims fail to fully understand the fluid situation in the early days of the Islamic empire, in which the caliphs believed themselves to be entitled to deliver legal judgements and set precedents just as Muhammad had -- because they were his successors, and wielded his authority. Crone also points to the tremendous challenges faced by the new Islamic empire, in dealing with situations that were completely outside anything faced by Muhammad and raised questions not easily or quickly answered. The response, as many secular, academic scholars have observed, was to grant the early caliphs a great deal of legal authority, and also to adopt customary Byzantine and Sassanid law.</p>
<p>Crone is not the ultimate authority, and there are many academic historians who would disagree with her, but there is a dimension of this argument of which Striver and Ya Ali seem to be unaware. The article is basically a traditionalist Shi'a indictment of the first three caliphs. It deserves to be presented in Wikipedia, but in context, and in articles where alternate POVs can be presented. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:00, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you feel you it, go ahead and add all that to the article. But fact stands: Shia and Sunni agree that Umar reinstituded <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_talaq.html" title="Triple talaq">Triple talaq</a>, fact stands: Shia belive he banned <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikah_Mut%27ah_1acf.html" title="Nikah Mut'ah">Nikah Mut'ah</a>. Fact stands: That belife have the right to be represented. And since they are related, in a list.</dd>

<b>coment</b> actually, i now also oppose to change the name of the article. See<a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7EChanges_to_the_Sunnah_made_by_the_Rashidun_a02b.html" title="Talk:Changes to the Sunnah made by the Rashidun">Talk:Changes to the Sunnah made by the Rashidun</a>, it proves that Umar was acting beliving that he was in charge of the Sunnah.
