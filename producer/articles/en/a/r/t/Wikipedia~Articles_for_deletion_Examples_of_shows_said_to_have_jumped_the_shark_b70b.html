<p>The result of the debate was <b>work out some way of merging this with another article</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Keep it but change the title to "List of shows said to have jumped the shark." It's an interesting read and without reading it, I really had no idea what jumping the shark meant. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrim_2417.html" title="User:Brim">Brim</a> 22:23, Feb 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Inherently POV and a copy of the "Jump the Shark" website's lists. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 00:30, Feb 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Rename as per <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrim_2417.html" title="User:Brim">Brim</a> and <b>keep</b>. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 00:33, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_the_shark.html" title="Jump the shark">Jump the shark</a> article. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 00:36, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Inherently POV and unverifiable. This is not only another dumb list, but there are no clear criteria for inclusion on it. Anything encyclopedic that can possibly said on this subject can be said in the article on <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_the_shark.html" title="Jump the shark">Jump the shark</a>. How many articles on this minor meme are there going to be? Wikipedia is not a chat room. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:28, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, POV unnecessary list, article as it stands is un-encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:58, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Abstain, but note that the title of this article and what it concerns itself with are incongruent. "Jumping the shark" (sorry for the spoiler) refers to the point when a show's ratings show it has passed its prime; the article concerns itself with casting changes. Not the same. The title, though not the body of the article, also raises POV concerns. If this discrepancy can be rectified, worthy of an article. We have dumber lists. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 04:58, 2005 Feb 9 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_the_shark.html" title="Jump the shark">jump the shark</a> but be careful of POV. Also, I'd be cautious to make sure there's no copyvio with any Jump the Shark book/website that contains a similar list. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:51, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Entirely POV. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 06:47, Feb 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_the_shark.html" title="Jump the shark">Jump the shark</a>. This content is still worthy of being here because it is a synopsis of widespread consensuses of viewers of the various shows at the <a href="http://www.jumptheshark.com" class="external text" title="http://www.jumptheshark.com" rel="nofollow">JumpTheShark website</a>. For example, of course the Monty Python one was a no-brainer; since John Cleese has been highly praised for his work in the troupe, the show would have had to jump the shark if he ever left; and he did, so it did. In addition, I would expect that most of these reasons for jumping the shark would be mentioned in the articles on the shows. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 05:00, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A visit to jumptheshark.com shows that every show has been said, by someone or other, to have jumped the shark. <a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETacoDeposit_8aab.html" title="User:TacoDeposit">Taco Deposit</a> | <a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETacoDeposit_4b46.html" title="User talk:TacoDeposit">Talk-o to Taco</a> 18:35, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC) P.S. The term "jump the shark" has jumped the shark.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Unavoidably subjective (as the various discussions on jumptheshark.com show). And please don't merge with <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_the_shark.html" title="Jump the shark">jump the shark</a> - we just deleted about five pages of this stuff from there. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 18:40, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The original author now seems to have removed the page and redirected it to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_television_show_casting_changes.html" title="List of television show casting changes">A list of Television Show Casting Changes</a>, which is different in nature. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 19:40, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is funny; the title has changed, but clearly not the content to match. "Sanford and Son, when the show started using Grady too much." How is that a casting change? Aaron Sorkin quitting the West Wing? There was a brief discussion on the <a href="../../../j/u/m/Talk%7EJumping_the_shark_a898.html" title="Talk:Jumping the shark">Talk:Jumping the shark</a> page about the removal of the list that used to be part of the article. It was generally seen as a good move, as the list had ogtten ridiculously long and subjective. Mentioning a few of the best examples in the body of the article would be best (not as a list that people will feel the need to add to <i>ad nauseum</i>). This article, as it now stands, <i>might</i> be made encyclopedic, but presently is not. Most shows have had some sort of casting change at some point, and a mere list is pretty useless. Delete. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:28, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Hopelessly POV and potentially infinite as every show usually ends up jumping the shark. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 05:34, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with Jump the Shark, and edit to keep only famous examples from really well-known shows (which I realize is very subjective) 212.206.63.108 10:38, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The link to jumptheshark.com is fine. That site maintains the concept and it's list well. IMO, we don't need to mirror/fork their content or create our own version. See also <a href="../../../j/u/m/Talk%7EJumping_the_shark_a898.html" title="Talk:Jumping the shark">Talk:Jumping the shark</a> for some discussion--<a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESketchee_ce7e.html" title="User:Sketchee">Sketchee</a> 04:06, Feb 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. A lot of these are good examples of popularly percieved examples "shark jumping," and should be condensed and moved into <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_shark.html" title="Jumping the shark">Jumping the shark</a>. <b>Redirect</b> too maybe, although that's less important. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUserGoogol_896d.html" title="User:UserGoogol">UserGoogol</a> 10:36, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
