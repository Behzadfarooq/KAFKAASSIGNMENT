<p><b>Koushi (こうしくん Kōshi-kun) / Oxnard (Seiyuu: Rikako Aikawa) -</b></p>
<p>Maido (まいどくん Maido-kun) / Howdy (Seiyuu: Yuu Sugimoto) - He has a job at the registation desk. (However, it turns out to be volenteer work, unknown to Howdy)</p>

<p><b>Mafura (マフラーちゃん Mafura-chan) / Pashmina (Seiyuu: Rei Sakuma) -</b></p>

<p>Torahamu-kun (トラハムくん Torahamu-kun) / Stan (Seiyuu: Kouki Miyata) - He arrives late for the games.</p>

<p><b>Kaburu (かぶるくん Kaburu-kun) / Cappy (Seiyuu: Ai Uchikawa) -</b></p>
<p>Tongari (トンガリくん Tongari-kun) / Jingle (Seiyuu: Yuu Asakawa) -</p>
<p>Lapis or (in Japan) Lapis-chan (ラピスちゃん Rapisu-chan) (Seiyuu: Saeko Chiba) - owner unknown, has not yet made her television debut outside Japan. She, along with Lazuli, has magic powers. Her powers stem from her indigo cape. They try to be helpful, but sometimes their powers get them into trouble. She and Lazuli joined the Ham-Hams in the Japanese 3rd season.</p>
<p>Lazuli or (in Japan) Lazuli-chan (ラズリーちゃん Razuri-chan) (Seiyuu: Akane Omae) - owner unknown, has not yet made her television debut outside Japan, but she was in "Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Games." Like Lapis, Lazuli has her own magic powers. Her power comes from the blush on her cheeks, and usually makes sweets appear. Unfortunately, this power does get the Ham-Hams into trouble from time to time. She and Lapis make their appearance in season 3.</p>
<p>Nin-Ham/Ninhamu-kun/ニンハムくん: a Ninja hamster who comes from a far-away valley. Being the worst ninja in his home, he left so he could be appreciated by non-ninja Hams. He gives tips on some of the events.</p>
<p>Stucky/Nekenai-kun/ぬけないくん: A run-away hamster stuck in a hamster tube toy. He chants "roly-poly" as he rolls to get around. Rivals Cappy in hide and seek, though the two have become the best of friends lately. Stucky is also known as a terrible flirt when it comes to girls. If you talk to Cappy early in the games, he can be heard wondering where Stucky is.</p>
<p>Sparkle/Kururin-chan/くるりんちゃん: Owned by Glitter. Sparkle is a spoiled pop star hamster. She did not like the Ham-Hams at first, but she gradually became attached to them. In the Japanese episodes, Sparkle began to have a crush on Hamtaro, and has since then been trying to get him to notice her. She has been unsuccessful, perhaps because Hamtaro loves Bijou. For this and many other reasons, she sees Bijou as a rival. She is a sportscaster in the game.</p>
<p>Robo Joe/Mecha Jirou/メカージロウ: Created by Laura's Grandfather, Robo Joe is a robot hamster whose appearance seems to be based on Hamtaro. Robo Joe's main function is the ability to learn and mimic what he hears; both human language and Ham-Ham language. In a later Japanese episode, Laura's Grandfather places a slightly modified Robo Joe in a Battlebots-like tournament.</p>
<p>Flora/Nasu-chan/ナースちゃん: A nurse hamster who never made an appearance in the English TV show, but made an appearance in Hamtaro: Rainbow Rescue (Video Game) and Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Games (Video game). She is willing to cure any hamster she sees, with the big needle she carries around. She also seems to like Stan.</p>
<p>Prince Bo/Nijihamu-kun/にじハムくん: Prince of Rainbow Land. Never appears in English TV series (with the exception of the Ham-Ham Games episode), but appears in Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Games(Video game) and Hamtaro: Rainbow Rescue.</p>
<p><b>Note: Many other characters appear.</b></p>

<p>Heterosexual Agenda</p>
<p>In much the same way that people propose there is a Homosexual Agenda, there must exist an equal and opposite Heterosexual Agenda. This "agenda", supported by all of our ancestors, encourages traditional family of a man and a woman coming together in marriage to have children.</p>
<p>This article only exists because there is one about a Homosexual Agenda, but there was no article for its opposite. Now there is!</p>

<p>68.58.80.162 02:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC) The Warren Township Fire Department was established in 1937 when the eastside of Indianapolis was mostly rural. When Fred Kiethley watched his home burn to the ground, he could do nothing about it. He joined Fred Clark, a banker, Russ Kirk, an insurance salesman, Doc Mahall, a dentist, and Bill Sewell, a laundry man to form the Warren Township Civil Defense Volunteer Fire Department. Throughout the course of events, a resident donated a Jeep to the department. The five men covered the areas east and south of Downtown Indianapolis, Castleton, Wanamaker, and Mt. Comfort. Most of the fires in 1937 were caused by lighting and fueled by green hay. In 1942 a local area church donated funds that were used to purchase a fire-engine and build the first fire station. The Warren Township Fire Department was born. Five fire-stations and 96 paid career firefighters now protect our citizens. We are also joined by 30 volunteer firefighters who so generoulsy donate their time and efforts. Over 8,000 fire and medical emergencies are responded to every year. In 1999 the department purchased a new ambulance, increasing the ambulatory service to one apparatus per station. Four trained and certified EMTs are on duty 24-7-365. Our department is now trained in hazmat and counter-terror actions. Our emergency response vehicles include five front line engines, five ladder trucks, a water tanker, five ambulances, a hazmat truck, among many other support and reserve vehicles. In addition to responding to emergencys, the department takes pride in traveling to local schools and teaching students fire safety and prevention. Source: www.warrentwpfire.com</p>

Darlene May served as Head Women's Basketball Coach at Cal Poly Pomona for years (1974-1994). She was a no-nonsense, tenacious leader who guided her teams to three Division II National Championships.</p>
<p><br />
Coach May's first assignment at Cal Poly was to build the team she inherited into a winner, at least at the local level. Of course she accomplished much more than that, ending the first season at 16-6 and ranked fifth in the nation. That first season set the tone for what was to come.</p>
<p>The Broncos won their first National Championship in 1982. Coach May added two more national titles in 1985 and 1986, placed second nationally in 1983, 1987, and 1989, as well as finishing third in the nation in 1990. She coached 16 All-Americans, four of whom were named Division II National Players of the Year.</p>
<p>Coach May was forced to retire following the 1994 season after being diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. The campus gymnasium where her dynasty began was renamed "Darlene May Gymnasium" in January 1996. She passed away on November 15, 1996.</p>
<p>Coach May leaves a legacy that may never be equaled; a winning percentage of .813, an overall win/loss record of 519-119, and a conference record of 199-8 (96%). At the time of her death, she was the winningest coach in Division II history.</p>

<p>Thank you for your submission! unfortunately, since almost nothing is known about the movie, it simply does not have enough context for inclusion right now. We suggest waiting until more verifiable details are revealed. -- <font color="blue"><a href="../../../c/c/o/User%7ECcool2ax_5c31.html" title="User:Ccool2ax">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/c/o/User_talk%7ECcool2ax_7ce5.html" title="User talk:Ccool2ax">chat</a> <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ccool2ax_93c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ccool2ax">edits</a> <small><a href="../../../c/c/o/User%7ECcool2ax_Essays_2d75.html" title="User:Ccool2ax/Essays">essays</a></small></small></small></font> 05:52, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tel-Hai Academic College is located in the "Galilee Panhandle" in the northernmost portion of Israel, close to Kibbutz Kfar Giladi and north of the city Kiryat Shemonah.</p>
<p>The college offers academic and continuing education program for approximately 4,000 students from the entire nation of Israel. According to the school's Website, "The high level of studies, personalized approach to teaching, and institution-wide standards of tolerance, community service and environmental protection have made it one of the fastest-growing schools in the country."</p>
<p>The college sees itself as "an agent of social and economic development in the highly strategic Upper Galilee region." Because of its location at the country's farthest northern border, Tel Hai's mandate extends beyond the area of education, to include opening of opportunities for individual and community development – and closing of the social and economic rifts in the remote region.</p>
<p>About 60 percent of the school's instructors live in the region. Some teachers from other Israeli universities fly up from points south on a weekly basis to teach at the College as well.</p>
<p>According to the College's Website, there is a steady annual increase in the student population. More than 70 percent of Tel Hai's students come from outside the Galilee. Minorities comprise about 10 percent of the school's student body.</p>

<p>In addition to offering courses in life, social and computer sciences and the humanities, in 1995, the college created The Center for Learning Disabled Students at Tel Hai Academic College, the first of its kind in Israel. The Center has been helping students with learning disabilities acquire the skills to thrive and excel in a competitive academic environment and realize their full, individual potential.</p>
<p>The Tel Hai Center for Learning Disabilities serves students with dyslexia, difficulties in organizing and processing written materials, in writing (dysgraphia), in expressing themselves in writing, in learning a foreign language, and many other types of learning disorders. Sophisticated diagnostic tests are used to pinpoint areas of difficulty, so that maximal time and energy can be spent on learning how to overcome them.</p>
<p>In 2003, the number of students at Tel-Hai Academic College had learning disabilities, and 22 percent of the school's Honor Students had learning disabilities.</p>
<p>During the 2006-2006 academic year, work began on a new campus and new dormitories for approximately more than 450 students in Kiryat Shemonah.</p>

<p>During the month-long war between Hezbollah forces in Southern Lebanon and Israel, the school closed and student went south. Summer courses and tests were cancelled, as well as the College's annual open house.</p>
<p>After the hostilities ceased, rebuilding the Galilee and repairing the damage inflicted by Hezbollah's rocket attacks became a national priority, and the school is taking a leading role in this effort.</p>

<p>Arturo Belleza Rotor was from the Philippines, trained at Johns Hopkins University, and later served as dean of the medical school of the University of the Philippines. He was an accomplished musician, and a internationally respected writer of both fiction and non-fiction--arguably the best of the Filipino short story writers of the period 1930's-1980's. He was a charter member of the Philippine Book Guild, its initial publication was Rotor's "The Wound And The Scar", despite his protests that someone else should have been selected.</p>
<p>During World War II Rotor served as secretary to Manuel Quezon (1878–1944), the Philippine president in exile. He was also an orchid fancier and breeder and had an orchid species named after him as well.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-16_08c2.html" title="Edit section: Fast Car Magazine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fast Car Magazine</span></h2>
<p>Fast Car Magazine is an UK-based woodpulp publication that has been in circulation since the mid-1980s. Up until recently, the magazine was published by Highbury Leisure, but it - and a series of other publication - was bought up by Future Publishing in mid-2005.</p>
<p>Fast Car Magazine is known as FC or FUK (Fastcar United Kingdom) among friends. It started off as a performance car magazine, but has been through several significant re-vamps and is currently aimed at readers interested in modified cars. These are generally nominally cheap vehicles that have been modified with body kits, performance modifications and ICE (in-car entertainment) systems. The modified car scene is arguably connected to chav culture, but this is normally not directly reflected in the magazine.</p>
<p>As part of the modified car culture, Fast Car magazine is a lads' mag: It features highly modified vehicles, but is also taking a line involving a lot of lifestyle features, and will generally include up to three "honeyz" - scantily clad models for titilation purposes.</p>
<p>Quite unusual in the magazine-publishing world, Fast Car's tone is very conversational. Fast Car staff are often featured in the magazine themselves, and much of the copy is interjected with comments made by the editor or other members of FC staff. The conversational tone and self-ironic image means that Fast Car is a refreshing read compared to many more 'serious' publications.</p>
<p>The magazine has taken an active role in the modified car culture, by participating, sponsoring and covering events.</p>
<p>Fast Car's main UK competitors are Max Power and Redline. Circulation-wise, the Audited Bureau of Circulation (ABC) reports that Fast Car sells 100,000 copies of its magazine every month - including a not insignificant international circulation. Historically, Fast Car has sold fewer copies of their magazine than Max Power, but in recent months, Max Power's sales have plummeted. While Fast Car have also seen a slight decline in sales, they have been able to hold on to more readers than their competition.</p>
<p>The magazine is operating a mighty fine web-site, available on www.fastcar.co.uk.</p>

A microquasar is a type of black hole with jets of high-speed particles shooting perpendicularly from the plane of matter that orbits it.</p>
<p>This Black Hole is approaching our planet at a speed of 250,000 miles an hour, luckily it's many light years away and won't reach us for another 30,000 years.</p>
<p>Matter can orbit GRO J1655-40 relatively stably but occasionally it wobbles at certain precise frequencies. This supposedly is a result of how the black hole deforms space and time in a four-dimensional concept that <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a> called <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spacetime.html" title="Spacetime">spacetime</a>.</p>
<p>The black hole was formed in the disk at a distance greater than 3 kpc from the Galactic centre and must have been shot to such an eccentric orbit by the explosion of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progenitor.html" title="Progenitor">progenitor</a> star. The runaway linear momentum and kinetic energy of this black hole binary are comparable to those of solitary neutron stars and millisecond <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulsars.html" title="Pulsars">pulsars</a>. GRO J1655-40 is the first black hole for which there is evidence for a runaway motion imparted by a natal kick in a supernova explosion.</p>
<p>GRO J1655-40 was recently used to prove that Black Holes spin.</p>

Harjinder Singh Sidhu, who lives in the UK and is a British passport holder, bought Air Slovakia, a small privately owned airline based in the capital, Bratislava last week, it has emerged.</p>
<p><br />
His son, Riqbal 'Rocky' Singh, told the BBC News website that his father wants to transform the 60-employee Air Slovakia into a "Punjabi experience".</p>
<p>That means using crew, food and in-flight entertainment from the northern Indian state of Punjab and using regional headquarters based in the Punjabi city of Jalandhar.</p>
<p><br />
There will be "dedicated" planes flying into Punjab too, he said.</p>
<p>"The bulk of our passengers are from Punjab and Punjabis from Europe. So we want to brand Air Slovakia as an airline with Punjabi ambience and flavour. Our stewards, airhostesses will be from Punjab as also the in-flight food," Mr Singh, who is a director at the airline, said.</p>
<p>But what does Mr Singh say about an airline catering to passengers from Punjab still being named Air Slovakia?</p>
<p>"The airline will have a second name of sorts when it comes to India. All tickets to and from India will be sold under a Punjabi name which will also be branded on the planes," Mr Singh said.</p>
<p>The airline's newest London Stansted to Amritsar flight, carrying its new 56-year-old owner, takes off on Friday evening and is due at its destination on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Passenger complaints</p>
<p>Air Slovakia presently has a three plane fleet - two Boeing 757s and one Boeing 737. It was founded in 1993 by a group of Slovak businessmen.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
Punjab and Slovakia will be taken global 
</pre>
<p>Harjinder Singh Sidhu</p>
<p>The new owners now plan to buy or lease six more planes by the middle of next year and expand operations.</p>
<p>The 'Indian' Air Slovakia will fly to Milan, Bratislava, Birmingham, London, and Cologne in Germany. Return ticket prices are expected to range from $530 to $1100.</p>
<p><br />
Airline passenger websites do not report a very happy experience of travelling on Air Slovakia so far.</p>
<p>"My advice would be not to travel on Air Slovakia, very poor service, very cramped, not enough leg room, staff rude, food poor.. Air Slovakia leave you stranded and offer you no help," complains a passenger on one website.</p>
<p>Another passenger wrote: "The air stewardesses grasp of English was very poor and they had no concept of any other languages like Punjabi or Hindi which was very unusual considering all the passengers were of Asian origin."</p>
<p>Mr Singh admits that there are "service issues with passenger satisfaction" that need to be addressed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Air Slovakia was started in 1993</p>
<p>"I think the Slovakians did not fully understand the needs of Punjabi passengers. But things have improved after we took over the airline."</p>
<p>The new owner, Harjinder Singh Sidhu, is a Punjab-born businessman who left India at the age of 16 and has "commercial properties and petrol" businesses based in UK, his associates say.</p>
<p>He has also been running chartered flights between London and Punjab for the past three years, and selling Air Slovakia tickets out of the UK since last year.</p>
<p>Riqbal Singh says his father began "financially assisting" Air Slovakia this May before deciding to buy it out.</p>
<p><br />
"'There's no fun in running an airline like this. Let's take it over,' my father said. So we took it over."</p>
<p>One report says the father paid $30m for the airline, but the son is not confirming that - "Let's say its in that region."</p>
<p>What is also unclear is how Air Slovakia was faring financially when the Singhs took it over.</p>
<p>"Let us say it is about to enter puberty. It needs some tender love and care," says Mr Singh with a flourish</p>

<p>"MICK SOFTLEY - SUNRISE / STREET SINGER (CD on BGO, www.bgo-records.com) Mick Softley was a troubador in the classic mould; a drifter with a guitar slung over his shoulder, his songs drawn from his surroundings and his wonderful singing voice inflamed by social passion (a Londoner, his mother had worked for a time in the offices of Sylvia and Christabel Pankhurst). In the winter of 1959 he lost his job as an apprentice engineer and set off for Spain to follow his muse, with a mate of his, another Mick, on the back of a motorbike - which with almost tidal inevitability broke down. Eventually Softley found himself in Paris where he hooked up with numerous other dispossessed British beatniks, including Wizz Jones, Clive Palmer and Alex Campbell, who encouraged and mentored the inexeperienced singer. Returning to the UK in the early 60s, Softley discovered that the folk-protest movement was in full swing, and gripped by artistic fervour he started up a folk club in Hemel Hempstead, soon to be home to the likes of Mac MacLeod, Maddy Prior - and a young singer named Donovan Leitch, who by 1965 rapidly, meteroically almost, became a bona-fide star. Luckily Donovan remembered the favours he owed to Softley and it was through him that Softley’s debut album ‘Songs for Swinging Survivors’ came to be recorded – Donovan also recorded a couple of Softley songs on his debut records, including ‘The War Drags On’ on his EP ‘The Universal Soldier’ which made the Top Ten."</p>

<p>Imperial College Old Boys AFC is an amateur football club established at the beginning of the 2005/2006 season.</p>
<p>Although initially the constituent members consisted of Imperial College Alumni, today the club has been expanded to include many other associates and is still growing. Due to the demand for places, a reserve side was formed at the start of 2006/2007 season and was entered into the senior reserve division.</p>
<p>In their first season, Imperial College established themselves in the Middlesex County finishing in 2nd place and were subsequently promoted to the 2nd division. Additionally, they distinguished themselves in the Division 3 cup by defeating Harrow and St Mary's Youth Old Boys 4-0 at the Yeading AFC Football Stadium.</p>

Mr. Baboon is a man monkey. He very strongly resembles a baboon, whether it is because he is constantly frowning or maybe just the general vibe that he gives off. At the beginning of everyday he eats down an entire bunch of bananas and even during class he can be seen eating 10-20 of them at a time.</p>

<p>De stella nova - Livro publicado por Johanes Kepler, no qual descreve a explosão de uma supernova na constelação da Serpente observada por ele em 17 de Outubro de 1604. Este fato, juntamente com a observação por Tycho Brahe em 1572 de outra supernova, desta vez na constelação da Cassiopéia, abalou a concepção vigente acerca do Universo e do Sistema Solar, apontando mudanças no que se chamava então "a esfera dos fixos"</p>

<p>When The World Ends is off the Dave Matthews Bands' pop hit album Everyday. The Song was scheduled to be released as one of the singles off the album; however, the events of Spetember 11th 2001 changed the fate of the song. It was considered too edgy to have as a single, because of the songs major theme of two lovers watching the world end. Instead the upbeat title track Everyday was released. Dave Matthews continues to site it during shows, "This is a tiny little song that no one would play on the radio because they thought it was too violent, but its just a love song." This song still makes regualr apperences every tour since 2001.</p>

<p>The Board of Immigration Appeals ( “BIA” or “Board”), an executive agency of the Department of Justice, holds that misdemeanor convictions fall within the definition of aggravated felony as set forth in Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Int. Dec. 3411 (BIA 1999) (endorced by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (hereinafter “Fifth Circuit”) in Zavala-sustaita, 214 F.3d 601 (5th Cir. 2000)). See INA § 101(a)(43)(A). However, the issue presented in Rodriguez-Rodriguez, was whether a felony offense under Texas state law met the definition of § 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act, and not whether a misdemeanor conviction can be an aggravated felony. The Board also relies on the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Urias-Escobar, 281 F.3d 165 (5th Cir. 2002) as support for the proposition that misdemeanor offenses are always encompassed by the aggravated felony definition under § 101(a)(43). In Urias-Escobar, the Fifth Circuit held that a misdemeanor assault conviction for which the alien had been sentenced to one year constituted an aggravated felony within the meaning of § 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, which defines an aggravated felony as a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. However, Urias-Escobar should not be determinative in issue presented here, because the aggravated felony definition in § 101(a)(43)(A) makes no reference to any specific sentence length, or to any federal provision of law.</p>
<p>In Matter of Crammond, the Board, sitting en banc, in an 11-9 decision, addressed the exact issue presented, and determinated the matter in alien’s favor. However, Crammond was subsequently vacated on jurisdictional grounds after the Board learned that the alien had departed the U.S.. Matter of Crammond, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 9 (BIA), vacated, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 179 (BIA 2001).</p>
<p>Subsequently to the former Attorney General John Ashcroft’s reorganization and downsizing of the Board, which left only conservative members seated on the Board (see, Courts Criticize Judges’ Handling of Asylum Cases: Pattern of BIAS Alleged, by Adam Liptak, The New York Times, December 16, 2005. See also, Article from Immigration Bulletin, October 1, 2004), a three-member penal decided Matter of Small, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 448 (BIA 2002), in which the Board reconsidered its position in Crammond. There, the Board held that a misdemeanor conviction was an aggravated felony within the meaning of § 101(a)(43)(A). Such desperate measures not only violate equal protection of the law, it smacks discrimination based on alienage. In effect, the same offense which might be a misdemeanor for U.S. citizens is classified an aggravated felony for foreign citizens, a crime that is not even a felony. Moreover, the traditional rule of lenity should be applied to reach the conclusion that misdemeanor offenses are not to be included within the aggravated felony definition in that section. See e.g., INS v. Errico, 385 U.S. 214 , 225 (1966) (indicating that doubts as to the correct construction of a statute affording relief from deportation should be resolved in the immigrant’s favor “because deportation is a drastic measure and at times equivalent of banishment or exile”) (quotation marks omitted); INS v. St. Cry, 533 U.S. at 320 (same). Further, the due process clause of the constitution requires that statutes defining criminal offenses set forth prohibited conduct with sufficient specificity so as to provide fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that there conduct is included within the definition of an offense, and that they are subject to penalty for violation. The finding of the Executive Office of Immigration Review (“EOIR”) that alien’s misdemeanor convictions are to be included violates due process, because lawful permanent residents are not given fair notice that in pleading guilty to a misdemeanor offense, they are subject to removal from the U.S. as aggravated felons, barred from discretionary relief from removal, and permanently barred from ever returning to the U.S.</p>
