<p>The starships listed here are not notable. The vast majority of them never even once appeared on screen, they were either mentioned in a single throw away line of dialogue or appeared for a couple of seconds on a display screen on the Enterprise bridge or somewhere similar. Wikipedia is not the place for pages devoted to extreme trivia. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 22:20, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related pages for the same reason:</p>
<pre>
   * <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Starfleet_ship_classes_6a27.html" title="List of Starfleet ship classes">List of Starfleet ship classes</a>
   * <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Ships_of_Starfleet_47d3.html" title="Lost Ships of Starfleet">Lost Ships of Starfleet</a>
</pre>
<p><b>Update</b> I think people are missing the point here. I didn't nominate because of the lack of sources. The problem is notability.</p>
<p>Take as an example the first starship mentioned on "List of Star Trek ships", the USS Adelphi. The only time the Adelphi appeared in Star Trek was in dialogue from the episode <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin_Man_%28TNG_episode%29_bc72.html" title="Tin Man (TNG episode)">Tin man</a>. Specifically this dialogue... GEORDI: "I've heard something about Ghorusda. Weren't about forty people killed --" RIKER: "Forty-seven, including the captain of the Adelphi -- and two friends from my class at the Academy." And that is that. Never appeared on screen, never mentioned again in dialogue.</p>
<p>How about the second starship mentioned on "List of Star Trek ships", the USS Ahwahnee. It appeared briefly (seconds) as an item on a list of starships on a display screen in the episode <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redemption_%28TNG_episode%29_28dc.html" title="Redemption (TNG episode)">Redemption, Part 2</a> and appeared briefly (seconds again) as a wreck in the background of a battle ground in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_of_Both_Worlds_%28TNG_episode%29_310a.html" title="The Best of Both Worlds (TNG episode)">The Best of Both Worlds</a>. Never once mentioned in dialogue.</p>
<p>The various starships Enterprise are notable, the Reliant, Defiant and Excelsior, etc play significant parts in various movies/episodes. The ships listed on these pages do not. Even among Star Trek fans, ships like the Adelphi and Ahwahnee are extreme examples of trivia... is that what Wikipedia is for now?</p>
<p>To those who say we should have lists of ships, we have articles on the notable ones (<a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Defiant_f372.html" title="USS Defiant">USS Defiant</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Reliant_%28Star_Trek%29_7374.html" title="USS Reliant (Star Trek)">USS Reliant (Star Trek)</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Excelsior_%28Star_Trek%29_b3b8.html" title="USS Excelsior (Star Trek)">USS Excelsior (Star Trek)</a>, etc) and categories to collect them for easy reference <a href="../../../f/e/d/Category%7EFederation_Starships_69cc.html" title="Category:Federation Starships">Category:Federation Starships</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 14:53, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>(After edit conflict)<b>Strong Delete</b>. Most of this info that is 'right' must have been copvio'd out of the Star Trek encyclopaedia, and the overwhelming majority is <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">non-verifiable</a> - e.g., the 'USS Interceptor' allegedly from <a href="../../../f/i/r/Star_Trek%7E_First_Contact_51ac.html" title="Star Trek: First Contact">FC</a>. Never mentioned in dialogue, no Nebula class ships seen close enough to make out a name, far less an NCC. Much as I'd love to burn this article and its ilk, delete is the best we can do.

Most of what is in the articles needs to be deleted, but the Lists themselves are probably valid. However, if kept, the list of ship classes should list the ship classes, not the ships by class, and lost ships of Starfleet would only serve redundant to Ships of Starfleet (put an 'x' or something by the destroyed ones in the Ships list and then Lost ships is totally useless). <b>Keep</b> List of Starfleet Ships and List of Starfleet ship classes, <b>delete</b> Lost Ships of Starfleet. --<a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_807a.html" title="User:Mnemeson">Mnem</a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_Esperanza_c3bd.html" title="User:Mnemeson/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnemeson_24d9.html" title="User talk:Mnemeson">son</a> 10:14, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but rewrite. There have been many ships in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> and the idea of creating a list of them is perfectly encyclopedic. However, it should be confined only to ships that actually appeared on the show, so much of this article's content should be removed.

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Ships_of_Starfleet_47d3.html" title="Lost Ships of Starfleet">Lost Ships of Starfleet</a>, which is more or less redundant to the other lists. <b>Weak keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b> the other two lists. These badly need sourcing, <i>at least</i> give the episode they were in or something. I agree with Wikipediatrix that only ships that actually appeared in an episode should be listed. In addition, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Starfleet_ship_classes_6a27.html" title="List of Starfleet ship classes">List of Starfleet ship classes</a> seems misnamed to me, as it really sorts ships by class instead of listing classes. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 04:34, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've tried to improve some of the Star Trek articles on Wikipedia. This started out as one article that I was never happy with. Now, instead of improving, the article has grown even worse and spawned... Please look at the edit histories of these articles, there is a constant effort needed to keep out fan cruft. People adding the starships they have invented for their own fan clubs and fan fiction... The articles are a mess and unless someone is going to dedicate a large portion of their time to tidying and maintaining them they aren't going to improve. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 14:58, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - While they may not be needed for the vast majority of casual reads of wikipedia, I know from my own Trek gutter days [who am I kiddin'; I'm still in those 'gutter days'] that these lists do interest a great deal of people. In the end, as long as the qualification for making the list (onscreen text, mention or appearance) is consistent for all listed ships, then it holds some value for some citizens of Wikipedia; afterall, its a list of all known ships in Starfleet, and how do you cut ships that weren't used as characters and achieve that goal? Note: I have not been a contributer to the list, did not know it existed until exploring today's Tip of the Day (topic lists) nor was I led here as a <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatpuppet.html" title="Meatpuppet">meatpuppet</a>, but I have definitely appreciated having this list when compiled elsewhere. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyteWolfer_61e5.html" title="User:LeyteWolfer">LeyteWolfer</a> 03:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

We might as well have lists like Names dropped on the Tonight Show, French words used by Rush Limbaugh, Places Scotty has beamed me up from and the like...It's a pity we spend lots of time deleting things that are or were and will no doubt end up keeping things that never were and are barely mentioned in the fictional universe in which they purport to have been. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 03:58, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep/Merge</b>. The list is useful for fans (yeah, I know that's not a wiki priority), and is a good trivia reference. I think that it should be kept, or merged with another trek related page or topic.</li>

<li><b>Condense mercilessly</b>. I agree with the sentiment at the top of this list. Can't a link be provided to the startrek.com web site, which has a database of ships?</li>

<dd>We might as well not be an encyclopedia at all, then, since we can always just link to websites with information, right? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:24, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Ensure data retention then delete</b>. The page for most of the classes of Federation ship includes a list of the known ships of that class, along with references to the episodes in which they were mentioned. It would seem to me to be a good compromise that we ensure that the current data is replicated on the "ship class" pages, then the list of classes removed and replaced with a Category. This would be exactly as easy/difficult to navigate as now for a fan interested in this as a resource, but would remove the duplicate data, and conform more to Wikipedia standards.
