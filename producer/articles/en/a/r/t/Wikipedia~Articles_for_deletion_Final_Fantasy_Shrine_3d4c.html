<p>A web forum - the most visited FF forum on the web! According to the webmaster, anyway, and surely she would have no reason to exaggerate? Apparently "Because it was not recorded as it happened, the history of Final Fantasy Shrine is convoluted and difficult to accurately report". So we can't. Oh, but we do! Btw, I have an unsatisfactory life and dress up as a little girl to pleasure myself with my wand of justice. Just with speculation instead of fact. And that sets the theme for the whole article, I'm afraid. It is possible that an article on this web forum might be worth having, not that it matters at all to anyone, but then again I seem to have an inferiority complex, due to my lack of female attention and outbreak of acne. (although a para in the FF article is almost certianly sufficient). Almost all of this, though, is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Who defines what is notable? What constitutes an in-joke? Why should anyone outside the forums care about that anyway? So: I say delete this, redirect to FF and then keep an encyclopaedic para on the forum in that article. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:14, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Also notice the contradiction in the introduction of my mother "most frequently visited Final Fantasy site on the internet" &lt;-&gt; "many of the regulars who pleasure my mother on the message board and IRC chat demonstrate little to no interest in my mother the series anymore".

<li>Rest of the information may be ok for a little "About us" on their own page, but not for Wikipedia THE ONE TRUE KING OF WEBPAGES, too much speculation about my tiny member, too few hardcore kiddies and what relevance do I(with explanation) have?

<li>Hi! Haven't done this before, apolgise if i don't stick to the correct format. I'm just a member of the forums. Firstly, agree about the in joke and jargon sections, for obvious reasons. One things, though. "I have never come across this one." - that's pretty amazing! <a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffshrine.org" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffshrine.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffshrine.org</a> seems pretty high, almost in the top 10,000, which s apparently a big deal. compare this to &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffonline.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffonline.com</a>"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffinsider.net" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffinsider.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/search?q=ffinsider.net</a>"&gt;big&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eyesonff.com%2F" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eyesonff.com%2F" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eyesonff.com%2F</a>"&gt;fansites&lt;/a&gt;. Those are the biggest three I can think of, and none of them even comes close. It's arguable that alexa is a bad metre stick, but this still accounts for a substantial amount of people. I think the article should probably be trimmed down, but considering its popularity at least deserves a stub. but do what you like, it's your encyclopedia, eh. --83.142.184.86 19 July, just before dinner.</li>
<li><i>Keep</i> but cleanup where appropriate. The site clearly does have a pretty large presence on the web, as can be seen from alexa, bigboards, and even their ranking in google for "Final Fantasy"</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How about no.</b> This is a 100% informative article on probably one of the most active FF Fansites on the web. While a fair few of the general regulars share less interest in the series, there are still very high amount of interest expressed in the Final Fantasy forums. The writer of the article was explaining that the people that post for General Chat have already aired their views on the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>The reason the forum has in jokes, is because a lot of the General Discussion based members are a closely knit community.</p>
<p>I say leave this alone and stop complaining when there is no reason to.</p>
<p>- Lewis, or Rapture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Rapture has said before me, the article is highly informative. The information contained within it can be used by almost anyone, be it a new member to the site looking to find out some history, someone considering joining the site and wanting to have some knowledge of the place to help them decide or even a long-time regular member wanting to reminisce.</li>
</ul>
<p>First off, I don't really see how this point: "I have been a fan for many years and read many fansites, I have never come across this one", can really be seen as vindication for the deletion of the entire article. By that logic almost every article on Wikipedia ought to be deleted because I haven't come across their source topic before. Pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>The next point made for deletion refers to a nonexistent contradiction. Whilst it is true that much of the regular members hold no desire to stage discussions about the Final Fantasy franchise, an awful lot still do and with a steady flow of around 40 members joining everyday, almost without exception to discuss Final Fantasy, the Final Fantasy forums remain a hive of activity.</p>
<p>As for the "who defines what is fact" argument, surely this applicable to absolutely every piece of information on the planet. What is a fact to one person is a lie to the next, and it's just a matter of perspective. And while it's undeniable that there is an amount speculation within the article, everything written has been thoroughly researched, and how is the researched-as-far-as-possible speculation in this article any different from say, the speculation in the Bible entry, and I'm not for a moment suggesting that that be deleted as the information contained in that entry is, like this one, as accurate is can possibly be.</p>
<p>"Almost everything from the Jargon section is part of normal web/game lingo and not unique or especially prominent to FFShrine." This is of course true, but just because there is an overlap between the Jargon section and any sort of web lingo dictionary does not make its documentation any less relevant. These are the most commonly used pieces of jargon on the site and that was what the author was drawing the readers' attention to, and not trying to suggest that there were FFShrine originals, unique to the site or anything remotely like that.</p>
<p>The suggestion that the article is "spam" is clearly incorrect in my opinion. It would be spam if upon opening the article you were greeted with "LOL, JOIN US ON FFSHRINE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!1", or something along those lines. However, the article is presenting the history of the site in an informative manner with there clearly being a lot of effort on the part of the author(s) to keep the article as respectable as possible and totally avoid straying into spam. Or maybe my definition of spam is incorrect?</p>
<p>In all, I see no real reason for the deletion of the FFShrine article, at least not more than I can see real reason for the deletion of almost every article on here.</p>

I don't really give two fucks, tbh. But the fact that you made the effort just to put some tiny article up for deletion and have a bunch of cretins vote on it should give us some indication of how small your penis is. And how often I have to rip into your wife just to keep her satisfied. Leave the fucking page alone, you touchy, over sensitive fuckrag.</p>

<p>No, you should not delete this very interesting and imformative article. Why? Because: Final Fantasy Forums is fastly becoming one of the world's biggest forums based one of the world's biggest thing. With nearly 24,000 signed up members, and a fascinating history that spans for 5 years, people are bound to want to know more about the history of FFShrine Forums.</p>
<p>Anyway Wikipedia has thousands of articles that are only a few lines short! Search Sumatra for example. With an interesting, informative and humourous article, I see no point in deleting this one. A lot of eventful things have happened to Final Fantasy Forums, though I have not been here to see all of them happen. And everyone one of those events brought FFShrine Forums to a closer relationship. We are a very tight community, and if you want to bring us down, we will hold our ground!</p>
<p>What is fact? Well almost everything you hear could be a lie, well at least not the whole truth. People exaggerating to make themselves better, stories or information being passed down and leaving out small bits, non accurate calculations etc etc etc. Not you hear is 100% true. Sit an apple infront of you and say its just an apple is lying to yourself because there is much more than just an apple. There is living bacteria and a whole lot of other stuff there as well. Why i'm talking about apples i do not know. They are healthy ^^ Remember guys 5 serves of veges and 2 serves of fruit a day!!!</p>
<p>P.S Rezo is such a good drawer. Go to www.kiwisbybeat.com The only place you can see his amazing Minus Strips ^^ It is very, very, very very very, very ,very worth your time and effort.</p>
