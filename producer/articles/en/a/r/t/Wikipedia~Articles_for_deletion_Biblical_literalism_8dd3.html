POV - the purpose of the arguments presented in the article seem to be written to poke fun at or proove points against certain beliefs the author sees as related to BL. Other reasons - Unscholarly, un encyclopedic, POV fork from previous pages, previous attempts at discussing the issue on thetalk page failed.

<p>OK, here's where we stand so far.. in all of our discussion, and from allof google, we've been able to have people pull up many citations from people against BI (per the straw man argument), one has demonstrated a Christian organization refering to themselves as literalists but only in regards to Genesis and with no definition. (it's likely they are inerrencists working with a different def of literalism). And we have one source of a historical usage of the word with no text.. This leaves us with no notable, refrenceable, citable definition of the word literalism other than from those who use the straw man definition that literally no one has owned up to. If our examination into the notable teachers on the subject reveals no additional insight..where do we go from there? Peace. and thanks for input. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 14:43, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>close.&#160;:) Inerrency = what the author was relaying is without error. If an author tells a parable as such, the meaning of the parable is factually true not the historical facts of the characters involved. The assertation of the literalism article is that literalists do not believe in parables. Jesus taught in and explained the meaning of his own parables. There is no such thing as a person who believes the Bible and does not believe parables. And certainly there is no reputable doctrine or teaching as such. --<a href="../../../d/j/s/User%7EDjSamwise_6d61.html" title="User:DjSamwise">DjSamwise</a> 22:20, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Whitewash or Delete</b> The article was originally prod'ed on 29 August 2006. I deproded because I believed both that biblical literalism was a real, incorrect hermeneutic and that the article was repairable. I still think biblical literalism is a real hermeeutic. I no longer believe the current draft is repairable or helpful. Evidence from the talk page is that this may have started as a POV fork from <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a>, where the section on biblical literalism (now gone) had its own problem with a lack of a neutral point of view. Multiple editors have been expanding the OR bilbical exegesis, and declining to listen to multiple other editors that have been trying to educate them on the talk page that biblical exegesis with citations directly to scripture does not constitute what is expected as an article. I believe their intentions are good, but that they don't yet adequately understand the Wikipedia standards, and dramatic action is needed to demonstrate that the standards are real. This dramatic action could be by whitewashing or deleting. A whitewash needs to totally replace the content with a stub adhering to our policies. An example is what happened here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slavery_and_religion&amp;diff=62626386&amp;oldid=61399866" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slavery_and_religion&amp;diff=62626386&amp;oldid=61399866" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as a result of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Religion_and_slavery_b5de.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Religion and slavery">this AFD discussion</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 13:13, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

Well, I agree the inerrancy section had POV problems, but curiously nobody thought to edit it until I synchronized this article with that section. At that point, either <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> or <a href="../../../d/j/s/User%7EDjSamwise_6d61.html" title="User:DjSamwise">DjSamwise</a> began deleting that section every time I synchronized it.

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> From my personal experience with this article and the editor who <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNs</a> it, it was created as a POV fork of biblical inerrancy. I tried to explain that, under guidelines, we should only create a spinout article if we have more content than can fit reasonably in the parent article, not (as it turned out) to combat the poor treatement of literalism in the inerrancy article. I suggested we focus our energies in improving the inerrancy article before creating a spinout. Next, the format of the article is clearly not encyclopedic with the use of bulleted lists and sentence fragments. Third, the main editor doesn't understand the difference between citing the bible and the original reseach of interpreting the bible. If someone believes the bible literally, don't cite specific verses, cite the individuals who hold these views. If someone believes there are contradictions in the bible, don't posit these controadictions ourselves, but instead cite this interpretation. Finally, I asked on the talk page for the main editor to name a single person who is a bible literalist. And I asked, if this person existed, why they weren't cited as a source. The response was "Luther", who isn't mentioned as a literalist or inerrant in his article. I am truly skeptical on whether this position even exists. After working on this article, I do not believe it is salvageable. If <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">relaiable sources</a> are ever found, we could add some content over at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a>, but I strongly suggest returning this article back to a redirect to that article due to original reseach, formatting, sourcing, verifiability and possible hoax issues.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 13:29, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I never said I owned it, but I did take pride in its clarity. You inserted unreferenced assertions, unnecessary qualifiers, and confounding POV jargon. We discussed this at great length. I would have welcomed referenced assertions, or clarifying NPOV qualifiers. Recently, it seems that anything goes; so now is your big chance! POV fork again? We voted on this already -- see my above comments. <a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> already covered the bulleted list subject in the article's discussion page. I dislike sentence fragments; when you find them, you have my "official" premission to correct them. Are you again attempting to claim that Biblical references are off limits to me alone?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Arbeiter seems skilled at defending his edits, but we should still recognize this article as worthless. Wikipedia articles should never make mainstream Christians uncomfortable. Wikipedia is supposed to remain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a>. DjSamwise's revisions are even worse. There are plenty of Biblical literalists. Repeatedly claiming they don't exist doesn't make it true. And because the Bible explicitly states Jesus spoke in parables, literalists recognize the parables of Jesus as such. DjSamwise's version offers misrepresentations of references and misrepresentations of terms (AKA "straw man" terms). DjSamwise even includes references conflicting his own thesis. It would be better if both versions simply disappeared. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillstone_da96.html" title="User:Millstone">Millstone</a> 10:30, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not presenting a thesis. Yes my edits for this article are bad, the article is bad. The term Literalist is a slanderous term used by certain people to proove a point. In other versions and discussions Arbeiter (NOT ME) came up with the parable point that you are refuting, that they (literalists) disagree with the Bible's parables. (trees of the fields clapping thier hands?) His original argument was that it's stupid to believe treeswould grow hands, and literalists believed the literal version of that therefore literalists are stupid. How is that not a strawman argument that he presented? NO ONE believes that, though that's what the article said. So I changed the article to call it what it was.--<a href="../../../d/j/s/User%7EDjSamwise_6d61.html" title="User:DjSamwise">DjSamwise</a> 18:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not presenting a thesis?!? Then I guess you would not be offended if I said your edits were utterly pointless, inane, and haphazard. And what? We can agree on some things after all. Who is trying to "proove" a point? I represented both sides to of the argument to the best of my abilities, and it seemed the arguments drew to a stalemate. This is what initially captivated my interest in the subject. The article (as I left it) had never mentioned parables at all. This omission would have been an easy fix.

<dd>Thank you for saying that I am "skilled at defending" my edits. "Worthless" is a bit harsh, and a little too vague to counter or consider constructive criticism. Sometimes ideas just make people uncomfortable; it's a strain on the brain. This is unavoidable; you can't make everybody happy. Oh. You were not talking about making <i>everybody</i> comfortable -- just mainstream Christians. In that case, I disagree completely; this attitude lacks the neutrality you just proposed. As for being neutral myself, I covered this above. I have maintained high levels of civility in the articles, but in these discussion pages, it is difficult to swallow my sarcasm when I feel the arguments are disingenuous or recycled endlessly. Amen. Amen. Amen. HALLELUJAH. I had mistakenly thought people would naturally understand this point. This omission could have been easily fixed and did not warrant wholesale deletions. Misrepresented references?!? I did not bother cross-checking them until now, but I see it now. That's the cardinal sin in my book.

I'm curious if anyone can name prominent members of the biblical literalism movement. It appears, after working no this article and trying to research this topic myself, that biblical literalism is a strawman argument that is a hyperbole of biblical inerrancy.

<dd>wow, thanks for the link to that classic work. That may be the one. The others, particularly the Creation Research one, it's "Biblical Literalism" doesn't fit the same definition. They apply the Literalism only to Genesis. They don't claim not to believe in parables or hyperboles. They only claim that Genesis is not a parable. That's different than not believing the Bilbe contains them. In the scholarly definition, they fit the inerrency camp.

<dd>Although GRBerry might be one, you don't have to be an advanced Google Scholar to find references to Biblical literalists. Using Google, I found (and skimmed through) 4 such references in 30 minutes.

<li><b>Comment</b> by the previous article's main contributer. I don't know if this group is voting on the article as it exists or on the one to which I had contributed.

This type of dubious behavior seems to be quite prevalent on Wikipedia. After my short break, I documented a disturbing trend. To various main articles within Wikipedia, I have contributed nearly 7000 words; 8.6% of them remain today. To various main articles within Wikipedia, I have contributed 157 Biblical references supporting my statements; 0.0% of them remain today. To various main articles within Wikipedia, I have contributed 35 non-Biblical references supporting my statements; 2 remain today. (I have listed these separately, because <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> believes the Bible is not an acceptable reference if used by me.) My supported concepts vanished along with their references -- sometimes replaced by completely opposite concepts without references. I had hoped my edits would benefit from either support or intelligent opposition. (I am always especially pleased when someone changes my perspective.) Instead, I have defended my edits from vandalism and attempts to usurp, obscure, or delete my concepts. This is nothing but a waste of time -- a waste of life. I will soon abandon Wikipedia to its devoted censors and vandals. Let them make what they will of it.

<dd>Sorry for the confusion, this discussion took place during a name change (check and see). Regarding your over 150 refferences, I checked and double chekced your refferences, as I wrote on your talk page, your personal Biblical research doesn't count as citation. your ideas are interesing but Wiki isn't the palce to document your ideas. I'm sorry. Now I agere, the newly edited version is crap. But at least its well cited crap.

<dd>Question for ya, whats your opinion on lack of citeable definition? What if the only concensus on definition was for the same as inerrency. Would you support a merge? --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 00:34, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From my understanding "Biblical literalism" referred to taking the Bible literally, a position supported by some Christian groups (i.e. <i><a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-literal.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-literal.html" rel="nofollow">gotquestions.org</a></i>). However, as you point out, the article does not have a lucid definition to cite. The article (as well as its references) also seems to be vituperative of those who would support the position as well. If the only concensus on the definition was the same as inerrency, I would support the merge with <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">Biblical inerrancy</a>, a much better written article.
