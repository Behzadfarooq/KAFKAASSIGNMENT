<p>Actually, this is part of a larger AfD i would like to create, but its beyond any practical abilities to do so: I would like to nominate all the articles in the following template: {{<a href="../../../u/n/i/Template%7EUniversal_Century_Mobile_weapons_94a0.html" title="Template:Universal Century Mobile weapons">Template:Universal Century Mobile weapons</a>}}. I see no reason why all these random suits of armor from a fictional series should have their own articles. Merge at the very least. I know this is 'poor reasoning', but if lists of weapons in halo 2 and every other game shouldn't and no longer exist, this shouldn't either. Non-notable even with association. <font color="#FF9900"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid ƒuchs</b></a></font> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>) 00:46, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your opinion does matter, though you must use reasoning to support your arguments. How exactly, is it notable to have every Gundam ever seen, each with its own article?

<dd>They're notable to the series because they're the foundation the series is built on. Without Gundams, the series would just be people yelling at each other. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShady_Tree_Man_fe5b.html" title="User:Shady Tree Man">Shady Tree Man</a> 01:07, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Without starships, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> would just be people emoting at each other. But after forty years of TV and cartoon TV and movies and hundreds of books and fan magazines and conventions, there's only one starship from that series that is notable enough to be recognized by the general public: the <i>USS Enterprise</i>. I know the Gundam stuff is relatively big-name compared to most anime, but it's no Star Trek or Pokemon, is it? Why should non-fans be convinced that any Gundam fighting suit, let alone every one, is notable enough to pass general WP standards, just because the series is? <b>Merge</b> into one list per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>.

<dd>Actually, I think the general public would recognize the Borg Cube, Klingon and Romulan Birds of Prey, and maybe a few others. I do agree one list would be a better idea in this case. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 08:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To use the Star Trek example, are you suggesting every one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Star_Trek_ships" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Star_Trek_ships" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> should be deleted or merged into one article?

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>We seem to "have different standards for different fandoms" because of the general standard that more widely noted topics, those with more cultural influence, should be covered in more detail. I don't think every one of the ships in that category merits its own article in WP, but some do, simply because they've been featured in multiple third-party independent verifiable sources, not just fan-fiction, fan-obsessive-detail-suit-specs, and corporate promotional tie-ins with other products. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 05:19, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So you’re saying the reason for the difference is popularity? How do we measure that? Should <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilkie_Collins_9173.html" title="Wilkie Collins">Wilkie Collins</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bret_Harte_3d58.html" title="Bret Harte">Bret Harte</a> be deleted because the majority of Wikipedians have never heard of either author, let alone read their works?</dd>

<dd>Do we take into account people whose first language is not English when assessing popularity? A Japanese science fiction fan would react to this suggested deletion much like an American science fiction fan would react to the suggested deletion of the Starship Enterprise articles.

<dd>I expect you are correct that the majority of information and commentary on Gundam comes from either fans, the creators, or promoters. How is this different from Star Trek, Star Wars, or Dr. Who? Given five days, how many cited references to the Enterprise, the X-Wing, or the Tardis could you find, especially if you were not allowed to cite either the creators, promoters, or the fans? <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdward321_0e26.html" title="User:Edward321">Edward321</a> 00:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> I think that it would be useful as a list of all the minor Gundams, people often come to Wikipedia to find such things that they couldn't otherwise find all together in one place, and "cruft" or not, since there's at least the source of the TV show, I don't see why it would hurt to have one list of these. <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 12:58, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Normally, I'd say merge into a list (and I do support the idea of a list of these mechas), but in this case, I see nothing we can really merge. The article isn't sourced, and when I say "list of mechas", that doesn't include information like "Propulsion: rocket thrusters: 16200 kg, 5 x 11200 kg; vernier thrusters/apogee motors: 18". (Disclaimer: this comment is just for this article. If other articles on minor mechas have some well-sourced content, they should be merged into a list.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I came here from the relevant AfD for the figurehead RX-78 page - this particular AfD is made under even worse accusations than the former was. This is almost as mind-numbing as the deletion of hundreds of Soviet-era images used under the fair use rationale because a Russian court made a retroactive decision. Infact, I would go so far as to say that this is worse, because in that instance there was at least a tiny chance of Wikipedia being in violation of fair use laws and observances - this here is downright article barbarism. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 11:28, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Just because it's fictional and you're not a fan doesn't make it non-notable. As for your Halo 2 comparison...a genre-defining franchise that's still active and approaching its 30th anniversary is a lot bigger than a single recent video game. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 22:04, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> to the last few strong keepers. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> makes it clear that minor characters, places, and concepts should be merged into a list. I'm happy to apply the same policy to these mobile suits. <a href="../../../r/x/-/RX-78_Gundam_08d0.html" title="RX-78 Gundam">RX-78 Gundam</a> seems to be the equivalent of the Enterprise or X-Wing, and is definitely worth keeping independent. If you can show me that some other mobile suits are significant within the series, I'd consider keeping them. But you can't have 100 articles about 100 mobile suits and tell me that every single one is critical to the series. Someone who actually knows about Gundam needs to explain which ones are major, and which ones are minor. The best place to explain that is in the articles themselves.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Second, all this article is right now is four lines of text and a list of specs, all unsourced. (Those detailed specs aren't necessary for every single mobile suit, btw.). How often does this mobile suit appear in Gundam? Where is it established that it was "built by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon war."? How do you know it has "a set of shields that could be flipped"? If you can answer some of these questions, feel free to edit the article and improve it. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 10:21, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: To be honest, I agree with some of your points above. However, just as your argument becomes more valid, you shoot it down in the second paragraph. How do we know these things you mention? That's not specifically difficult. (1) Watch the animation and/or read the comics in which they feature. If we need to source everything, I suppose I could start collecting screen captures or image scans, in line with Wikipedia's fair use policy, on your "how do we know this" points. (2) Purchase or otherwise be in posession of any of the myraid plastic model kits of these various mecha issued by Bandai, the copyright holder. In addition to being a physical representation, in scale, of that particular mecha, the manuals are usually full of the "unsourced" technical lists that were so heavily decried earlier. If you travel to this website: <a href="http://www.1999.co.jp/" class="external free" title="http://www.1999.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.1999.co.jp/</a> (it has an English option) and visit the appropriate Gundam section, they retail the vast majority of Bandai-issued model kits, and include, for your reference, fully scanned manuals that include the technical section.</li>

<dd>Whether or not these entries belong here as encyclopedic content (and isn't that a popular buzzword these days...) is a point-of-view issue, but I would like to lay to rest this "unsourced" hogwash ad infinitum. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 23:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh, I think you just finished off my own argument for me - cheers&#160;:-p. Seriously, by definition, if an article doesn't list any sources, it's unsourced. I don't think we need a screenshot to prove every single claim, but the article does need to say where it's getting its content from (episode name, comic book issue, tech manual, whatever) - no-one should have to ask. Of course, once some sources are listed, the other debates about reliable sources and encyclopedic content will probably start again, but some sources would still be better than none. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 16:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Copy Pasta</b> Why is fictional technology non-notable? It's from Gundam. I'm not a big Gundam fan, but I know how huge of an influence Gundam has on mecha, anime, and Japan in general. To say that major parts of the series (THE MOBILE SUITS) aren't notable is ignorant. It's like these people just don't like Gundam and are doing it out of spite. Some people are suggesting merging... do you know how huge that page would be if ALL of that was merged? Should pages for all fictional things be taken down? Take down every page of Marvel characters? Or merge it, ya know, they're all in the same universe, just give them one page? James Bond villains? Fictional characters, take it down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Definitely some suits are not AS notable as others, and perhaps should be merged into a page that covers which series of Gundam the suits come from. But it is ridiculous to suggest that none of them deserve their own page.</p>
