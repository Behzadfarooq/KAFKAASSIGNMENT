<li><b>Comment</b>: The <i>article</i> doesn't have to prove notability within hours; its <i>subject</i> does. I could create an article about my pet hamster, but it wouldn't qualify as notable whether it was one line long or contained 10,000 words. As for UFOs and black triangles, that's a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> argument. The fact that dubious article X exists doesn't mean that dubious article Y automatically gets a free pass. By the way, the <i>quality</i> of an article does count for something. For example, I would probably change my vote on 9-11: The Road to Tyranny if the article was written in an encyclopedic fashion. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 17:42, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>See my comments below -- the quote on the newspapers that Barrie Zwicker was a writer for is taken from the Vision TV web site, and is not correct in my opinion. It is a big stretch to say that Barrie Zwicker is a mainstream journalist; I'm pretty sure that he's a freelance journalist with an alternative view whose articles were picked up by many major newspapers -- Samir ∙ <sup>T</sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samir_grover_e7b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samir grover">C</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 23:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> does not demand a 5000 audience. It says: "The following types of people may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them." and among them is the 5000 criteria. The flaw with the 5000 figure is that major publications have minor authors. Does everyone that publishes an article in the New York times get a pass? Including the local section editors, or the style columnist? If anything, I think it's a particularly flawed analysis. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Daily_News_8d56.html" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a> has several million readers. I can't think of more than 10 current writers on their staff worthy of an article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I've seen Barrie Zwicker on Vision TV and read (although disagreed with) his articles. He's legitimately notable in my view. If you apply the college professor test (he was a prof at Ryerson in Toronto), he's more notable given his media contributions. This being said, the article is very POV: <strike>(1) I don't think "he was a writer for the Globe and Mail....", despite what other web sites say. I'm pretty sure that he was a freelancer whose articles were picked up by other newspapers.</strike> (see below) (2) Also, calling Barrie Zwicker a member of the "mainstream press" is a bit out there, he's clearly an alternative voice in Canadian media. -- Samir ∙ <sup>T</sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samir_grover_e7b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samir grover">C</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 23:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
