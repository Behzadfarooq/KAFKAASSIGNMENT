<li><b>Difficult keep</b> while Wikipedia <i>is not</i> an encyclopaedia or dictionary of slang, this is one of the more widespread terms. The citations aren't so bad (it actually has some compared to many slang articles). The word is not used in English, however it is very widely used (from my experience) in Greek. I'm open to being convinced otherwise, but I think it just about notable enough. However, is there a List of Greek slang that it could possibly be merged with? - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 16:50, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course it's used in Greek: it's a Greek word. That's hardly the point, though, given that this is an English-language encyclopædia. I can't think why we'd have a list of Greek slang words either; do you think that we should have a list of slang for every language?

<dd>No, no, it's widely used <i>in Greece</i>; that's not our criterion for inclusion. They also widely use Kolos tou theou, Poustis, Poutana, k.t.l. — must we have articles on all those too? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 17:54, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>Kolos tou theou</i> is not used not even in Greece... (where have u heard this term?). <i>Poustis</i> and <i>Poutana</i> are the Greek equivalents of English terms (no need to say which are they), and are used solely in Greece. But the word <i>Malakas</i> has a different meaning than any English word (and may be used in cases were different English words would be used). The fact remains that this is a word the foreigners know, especially those who have been in Greece, or those who live in the centers of the Greek diaspora (principally in USA, Australia, Canada, UK i.e. English-speaking world). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 18:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is one of the most known modern Greek terms in the English-speaking world. For whatever reasons, it has become a very popular word in modern Greek culture, and is used in everyday speech, and not only. as a cultural phenomenon, its origins, usage and derivatives are presented and analyzed. Furthermore, we must have in mind that articles about slang words do exist (e.g. <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_a_bitch.html" title="Son of a bitch">son of a bitch</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a>, etc), and I suppose none has called for their deletion... <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 17:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As has been pointed out, there is no source to show that it's widely known, much less used, outside Greece &amp; Cyprus. And of course we have articles about some slang terms — but they're English slang terms, because this is an English-language encyclopædia. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 17:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To my knowledge, this is the Greek word that most non Greeks know... At least, this is by far the most popular answer I get when I ask them if they know any Greek word (u know, the words 'acropolis', 'democracy', 'philosophy', 'mythology' are considered Greek loanwords in English). I would agree with a move Francis proposed, so as to avoid confusion with the straits and the peninsula in SE Asia (with the creation of a disambinguition page, though). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 18:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>; unlike <a href="../../../r/e/_/Re.html" title="Re">Re</a>, where I voted Keep, there's nothing in the article to suggest that this term is used widely outside the Greek-speaking world.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would definitely be a "delete" if we had an article concentrated on the etymology and the meanings of a word - Wikipedia is not a dictionary; we have Wiktionary. But "malakas" in Greece is something beyond that. Like <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zamanfou.html" title="Zamanfou">zamanfou</a>, this term has become a symbol of a neo-hellenic cultural phainomenon; it constitutes the symbolism of an every-day social attitude, and it illustrates a particular stance towards life. I understand that for a foreigner this is difficult to be understood, but in Greece the terms "malakas", "malakia" etc. are in the center of sociological, political, and even philosophical analysis. The current article may not successsfully illustrate the various aspects of this term, but there is room for improvement.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 19:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>WP is an <i>encyclopedia</i>, which means it deals with things and ideas, and with words primarly as a way of referring to things and ideas. The idea of a 'jerk' (for which, by the way, there is not a WP article...) is cross-cultural: compare French 'con', Yiddish 'shmuck', <i>etc.</i> Of course, the nuances of the various words and their usage vary from language to language, but I don't see that they need separate articles; perhaps the current <a href="../../../s/h/m/Shmuck.html" title="Shmuck">shmuck</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malakas.html" title="Malakas">malakas</a> articles should be merged under the <i>English</i> name, 'jerk'.</dd>
<dd>As for the notion that it is the Greek word that most non-Greeks know, that sounds like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</dd>
<dd>Re <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zamanfou.html" title="Zamanfou">Zamanfou</a>, that should probably be merged with <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cynicism.html" title="Cynicism">cynicism</a> or something -- at least that's a word of Greek origin&#160;:-) .</dd>

<dd>First of all, the search doesn't really tell you much. It includes lots of Greek-written-in-Latin (Greeklish) as well as Libyan, Ethiopian, etc. names. Secondly, frequency of use isn't the issue: there are lots of <i>English</i> words which are much more common, but don't belong in WP, e.g. "within", "putrid", "lukewarm", because they don't express an encyclopedic concept. Finally, even if the Greek word is somehow expressing concept that has a special place in Greek culture, say φιλότιμο or νονός, this is an <i>English</i>-language encyclopedia, so we put the discussion under the English equivalent, even if it isn't exact, <i>e.g.</i> honor, godfather, or in an article like "Anthropology of Greece" or "Pride in Greek culture" or "Greek social structure" or whatever. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The only one of those that is encyclopedic is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_dozens.html" title="The dozens">the dozens</a>, because it is the English name of a very specific phenomenon. As for "bastard", it does <i>not</i> have an article; it is in the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html" title="Illegitimacy">illegitimacy</a> article, as you must have noticed when you made the link. I don't think the others belong in WP under those names. I'd think that at best they belong in an article on Insults (with subsections on U.S., U.K., Japan, Greece, etc.) or English Profanity or something. Use by the Greek diaspora is irrelevant. You can see that it doesn't behave like a normal encyclopedia article in that there are almost no links to it from other articles, except Talk pages. I think the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_profanity.html" title="Spanish profanity">Spanish profanity</a> article is a much better model for organizing this sort of information. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 00:12, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Article provides one reliable and non-trivial source (the Karamitsiou paper), so topic may be notable. "Not English slang" is not a reason for deletion. If a topic has non-trivial coverage in multiple reliable sources, then it's notable. Articles about individual items of foreign slang certainly need to be linked from other articles (e.g. List of Greek slang) so that people can find them, but I see no reason that the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> ones need to be merged into such lists.<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 23:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll do my best, in order not to revert you (!), and I will not object this solution, although I'm not sure I agree (well, most probably I disagree!); I still believe that <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malakas.html" title="Malakas">malakas</a> can still stand as an article, maybe as a sub-article of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_profanity.html" title="Greek profanity">Greek profanity</a>, if you treat the socio-cultural(-philosophical) aspects of the term, and you include them in the current article. "Malakas" is not just "Greek profanity". It is something more, and something else; I understand it is difficult for a non-Greek to realize that, but when we see satirical TV shows or even modern Greek movies or even modern theatrical plays, we understand that we have to do with something more than mere "profanity". I think that encyclopedically we choke <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malakas.html" title="Malakas">malakas</a> putting it under the label of "profanity".--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 11:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't question that "malakas" has a special place in people's, um, hearts. The question is simply how to discuss that in an encyclopedia. Interesting that there is no "jerk" article; on the other hand, it is understandable that there is a "nerd" article, because it is talking about an identifiable social phenomenon (which is cross-cultural, by the way). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 16:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment-Arguments for notability</b>. Μελετητής said: "It's a Greek word, not in use in English-speaking countries." Well, I definitely disagree! It depends on how we use the term "use". We, the jurists, we know in our terminology a term "<i>lato sensu</i>". Well, <i>lato sensu</i> of course the word "malakas" is used in English-speaking countries. It is the most notable neo-hellenic word around the world, and, even for the non-Greeks who have visited Greece, "malakas" is something more than a simple word; they understand that they have to do with a socio-cultural term; a word-symbol. I don't say that everybody in the world knows the world, but, yes, many many people around the world, beyond Greeks themselves, know the term, and its broader aspects. Not many people in th world know the city of <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larissa.html" title="Larissa">Larissa</a>, but I haven't seen anybody here questioning its notability. And why, <a href="../../../c/o/%C3%B1/Co%C3%B1o.html" title="Coño">Coño</a> has its own article? <a href="../../../c/o/%C3%B1/Co%C3%B1o.html" title="Coño">Coño</a> deserves a place in Wikipedia, while <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malakas.html" title="Malakas">malakas</a> doesn't?

<li>Yanni, I agree with your reasoning 100%. However, the fact remains that presently the article does not reflect the anthropological extent of the word adequately (save Areti's paper). I'm sure it <i>can</i> be reflected better, and when it does, I'll be the first to {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} it out per <a href="../../../c/o/%C3%B1/Co%C3%B1o.html" title="Coño">Coño</a> et al.

<li><b>weak keep for greek profanity</b> - Even if the word Malakas isn't used in English speaking countries wikipedia should try to counteract systematic bias anyway by providing info from different cultures- a non-Anglo centric way of looking at the world. Remember it is english wikipedia not England's wikipedia. I agree with the redirect to the page. While the page is not exactly of the highest integrity if some of those highly offensive words in English have an article then why should a page on greek words not exist? It does have a cultural aspect to it but I would suggest more professional sources are used even more to discuss it further, making in more encylopedic rather than verging on a dictionary which wikipedia is NOT. Moreover I would feel an article on List of Greek slang covering the greek profanities such as Malakas would be better suited. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 11:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
