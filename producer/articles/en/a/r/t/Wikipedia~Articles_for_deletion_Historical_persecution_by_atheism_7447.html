<p>This article is unsourced and simply a list. On top of that, it assumes that 'atheism' is some form of systematic organized religion. Perhaps the author had intended the page to be about persecution by totalitarian governments? or by communist governments? or something along those lines? But in addition to the title problems, just look at the article for yourself and judge whether it is encyclopedic or not. The poor name choice, lack of citations, and lack of content/list format is enough for me to propose this deleition. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 17:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Sorry I did not mean to offend anyone I just thought that persecution was persecution. Atheism is a group like any other, that can be criticized. Stalin and Lenin and Mao all engaged in persecution, their governments and they as individuals all professed atheism. As did estiblished atheistic governments engage in persecution like AKA Tiananmen Square. As for arbitrary, unannotated and POV etc. All I did was link to other Wikipedia articles ones I did not create, so I guess that wikipedia is really all of these things you are accusing me of.<a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 05:30, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's just that atheism itself is just a part of Communism. Atheism is also less specific than what we do in these cases. We don't do Historical persecution by agnosticism, Historical persecution by deism, etc. (I'm Catholic myself) Lastly the way you did it sounds grammatically wrong somehow. We have <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Christians_a939.html" title="Historical persecution by Christians">Historical persecution by Christians</a>, although it's in dispute, but we do not have Historical persecution by Christianity. If you were to do this it should be Historical persecution by atheists.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:55, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree one, some of the persecution done to the spectrum of religions under atheistic regimes was explicitly done because the state stated it was athiestic. Read some of the links like Russia for example. As for wording-Ok then lets reword the article to Historical persecution by athiests instead of deleting it. Why delete the article rather then collaborate to "fix" it. Also if you have examples of Historical persecution by agnosticism, Historical persecution by deism, etc please make articles with the sources and examples I support you if you have data.<a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 07:52, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I never said I was opposed to say Historical persecution by atheistic regimes, which seems to be what you mean.

<li>(1) "Atheism" is not a "group"; it is a philosophy, belief, etc. Beliefs do not engage in activities of any sort. <i>Atheists</i> or <i>atheist organizations</i> or <i>atheist states</i> can persecute. (2) However, I'm not sure that the intersection of atheism &amp; persecution is anything other than a trivial intersection; in other words, is it causal? or even correlated? If no evidence for either of those, then is the relation between establishment of religion (or non-religion) of interest enough that persecution by organizations / individuals is notably organized by religious belief? If not, then it sounds like an attack on atheism. An article singling out atheism in this way should justify the singling-out.--<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 17:15, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lquilter, you should be aware that most atheists would claim that atheism is not a philosophy or belief either. It's simply the absence of theism. It's no more a philosophy than being "non-Christian" is a philosophy, or than "not believing in the soul" is a philosophy. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 18:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right Silence -- although I won't get into it here, I agree with you in terms of a formal definition of philosophy or belief. But from a practical day-to-day perspective, atheism operates as a belief <i>about</i> religion ... But again, not the place to get into it. The point is that, as others have pointed out, "Atheism" cannot persecute anybody. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 20:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>T. Anthony, if you aren't opposed to "Historical persecution by atheistic regimes", then are you equally unopposed to my making a Historical persecution by theistic regimes article? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 18:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I am equally unopposed. If you or anyone wants to do an article on oppressive theistic regimes in general, rather than specifying to one theistic religion, than that'd be fine. The only difficulty with both is that they'll be debate on what constitutes an "atheistic" or "theistic" regime, but if you can do it I'd have no objection.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 18:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with you, Silence, and Scjessey. This idea behind this article is to say that a lack of belief in deities resulted in religious persecution. It is saying that the primary reason of say Communist China's persecution of Tibetain Buddhist is because China doesn't believe in deities. We would need specific citations making this association instead of a vague list. I think it is very important to have article about religious persecution. Very important. But I do not believe 'persecution by atheism' is the best way to approach this. Even Allegations of presecution by atheism seems a bit much. It would make much more sense to identify the primary organizational affiliation doing the presecution (fascism, communism, etc).-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 18:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I was asked to look at this, but have not had time to examine the article in detail. But I would certainly say that the title needs to be fixed, and probably more. It might be possible to say something like "Religious persecution in the name of atheism", but atheism itself does not persecute, any more than Christianity or Islam or Hinduism do, though there have been persecutions in the name of those too. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayesstw_643c.html" title="User:Hayesstw">SteveH</a> 11:29, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>comment: "... in the name of ..." is not the best phrase, though, and is not what this article/list is getting at. "In the name of" denotes something done for and because of the thing. The connection in most (maybe all) of the specific list items is indirect at best. I do think it's okay to identify organizations (including governments) by their official doctrines, if balance or causality/correlation are demonstrated. So the Soviet Union can be called an "atheist government" the same way the UK can be called a "Christian government". --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 17:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree, but would it then be OK to list every atrocity ever committed by the U.K. as "Historical persecution by Christians"? Isn't that a bit misleading? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 18:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think the examples are parallel ... I was commenting on the current list ("... by atheism") and noting that "... in the name of ..." is just as problematic. ... As for "historical persecution by persons of X belief/characteristic/whatever", I think these are obviously wastes of time and may need a general look in the writing-about-people category. It should look at how to handle lists / articles that are about some specific characteristic and address issues of causality/correlation in the context of attacks on people by characteristic. ...The larger point is that it's obvious that this list is an attempt to capture the frequent criticism / attack on atheism that Stalin &amp; Hitler were atheists, and expand it as much as possible. To me, since that's an argument that a lot of people keep making, it's worth having it in wikipedia, and ultimately, I hope, annotating the list/article with explanations about why each entry is proferred and/or is inappropriate. I wouldn't therefore say necessarily to "delete" the article but it will need substantial reworking and retitling, and there needs to be comparable content on atrocities committed by institutions/orgs/states with various religious beliefs, in order to avoid POV problems; if that's not done, then it should be deleted. (Note, I'm certainly not saying I agree with the proposition that "atheists" or "atheist states" commit atrocities in a way that is somehow tied to atheism -- it's for the most part utter bunk, both historically and as a matter of semantics &amp; logic, but hopefully in a well-written article/list, these points would get made. In other words -- the article has been clearly started by someone with a POV but that doesn't mean there's not a germ of an important issue to be discussed. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 20:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "germ of an important issue" is <i>already</i> discussed on Wikipedia; all attacks on atheism based on Stalin or, hilariously, Hitler (a devout Christian), are to be discussed under <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_atheism.html#Atheism_and_morality" title="Criticism of atheism">Criticism_of_atheism#Atheism_and_morality</a>.

<li><b>Rewrite</b>. I was asked to look at this article. The topic deserves inclusion, but the current article is unacceptable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unacceptably vague topic. As <i>atheism</i>, unlike Communism, is not a specific religion, organization, movement, or philosophy, compiling a list of persecution by atheists (or, in this case, by "atheism") amounts to a propagandic attack article. It would be like compiling a "Historical persecution by people with mustaches" on the grounds that Hitler and Stalin had mustaches; a more NPOV article would deal with persecution by <i>fascists</i> or by <i>communists</i>, not by atheists or people with mustaches, as there is no verifiable causal connection between them and the atrocities. Moreover, having a mustache or not believing in God is not centrally important to any of the people on such lists, suggesting there is an unstated agenda of attacking mustachioed, or atheistic, individuals in general by making such an article. Besides, it's an unacceptably vague and uninformative title; would you consider Historical persecution by theists to be remotely useful or neutral? Or, since <i>atheism</i> is a term defined by its negation with <i>theism</i>, would you consider Historical persecution by non-Christians to be acceptable? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 17:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - ludicrous and nonsensical list of articles that appears to be nothing more than an attempt to brand atheists as a group of devilish persecutors. Presumably this is meant to offset articles like <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Christians_a939.html" title="Historical persecution by Christians">Historical persecution by Christians</a>, but this article is misnamed and lacking any substance at best. -- <a href="../../../s/c/j/User%7EScjessey_ab91.html" title="User:Scjessey">Scjessey</a> 17:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I get the idea, but the wrong approach was taken. (a) The title is wrong - perhaps something related to the persectution of religion by socialist regimes (not sure exactly how I would word it, but most of this list is under communist gov'ts). (b) This shouldn't be a list, but an expanded article, with references, etc. And no, I wouldn't consider "Persecution by non-christians" as a title, it is also too broad. I would narrow it. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 23:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just seems to me that if there are articles about persecutions done under religion that if it can be shown that persecutions where done under non-religion that would be balance. Of course reworking any article is a farcry from deleting it. As to all of the victims of the Orthodox church and the Buddhists of China and Tibet who where persecuted because the athiestic government made athiestic policies to against them, well you can deny and say that such things don't deserve recognition. It is plainly another to claim such statements are bias or slander or not true when they are a matter of public record and history.</li>

It might be politically incorrect to say, but there were Buddhist, Hindu, Taoist (<a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Wuzong_of_Tang_01e1.html" title="Emperor Wuzong of Tang">Emperor Wuzong of Tang</a>), and Pagan regimes that engaged in persecutions.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Well you have to understand that in many societies Buddhism didn't remain in a purified non-theistic form. I'm not sure many schools of Buddhism were every atheist per se, non-theist is more accurate.. Now in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravada.html" title="Theravada">Theravada</a> the nontheism outlook mostly survived, but in <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana.html" title="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> God-like ideals did emerge to some extent. See <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_in_Buddhism_ecd1.html" title="God in Buddhism">God in Buddhism</a>. In addition many to most societies mixed their Buddhism with pre-Buddhist beliefs. Hence many Chinese maintained their earlier belief in Gods and mixed in Buddhism to it. To see Chinese and Tibetan Buddhist as "atheistic" is, almost certainly, wrong. To see them as even "nontheist" is perhaps misleading.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 20:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>Nontheist</i> is a nonsense word and mere synonym for <i>atheist</i>. I've never liked it. Regardless, large numbers of Buddhists remained atheist, and at the very least Buddhism never had a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_God_8ab2.html" title="Personal God">personal God</a>. Buddhism exists in theistic forms, but it's not exactly highly dogmatic in any case, and even theistic forms never focused on an explicit deity. The article's allusions to it are just silly. ~<span style="font: small-caps 14px times;"><b><a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_b02e.html" title="User:SwitChar"><font color="#FF0000">Swi</font><font color="#000000">tch</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/i/User_talk%7ESwitChar_3e09.html" title="User talk:SwitChar"><font color="#005500">t</font></a></sup></b></span> 10:29, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Strong <b>delete</b> for many reasons, the first being that this is just an excuse for bigoted frothing. The title is also just wrong: an abstraction cannot persecute. Even if we change the title to "Historical persecution by atheists", that makes no more sense than an article on "Historical persecution by non-Irish", since atheists have nothing else in common than what they are not. <a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a>'s suggestion of "Religious persecution by secular ideologies" is much better, but even then I think the net is being cast too broad for a useful article, and what is called for is a series of articles dealing with religious persecution by various secular regimes, e.g., "Religious persecution in the Soviet Union", "Religious persecution in Revolutionary France", etc. --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 03:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not opposed to the reverse of "Persecution by secular ideologies" or atheist regimes. Meaning if anyone wants a Historical persecution by theistic ideologies or Historical persecution by theocracies I would have no objection. I don't know how Love Monkey feels on that.
<dl>
<dd>I honestly don't see the value of such a page. There is no legitimate scholarship that indicates a causation or important correlation between belief in God and historical persecution. (There are many studies that show an inverse correlation between religiosity and religious tolerance, but these are purely in a modern context, not a historical one, and deal with individuals, not regimes.) Endorsing such a correlation is neither neutral nor verifiable, and even gathering the data in such a format is tantamount to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research#Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position</a>. It would be like having a "Historical persecution by black people" article, and then rather than simply deleting it because of its uselessness and inherent POV advocacy, arguing for making a "Historical persecution by white people" article to "balance the scales". Creating a second pointlessly vague and POV-advocating article doesn't resolve the problems inherent in creating a first pointlessly vague and POV-advocating article; two wrongs don't make a right. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 05:27, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Personally I don't believe in any of the "Historical persecution by" articles. However if we're going to have them than I don't see why "by theocracies" or "by state atheism" is any more odd or objectionable than the ones we have. I mean <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Christians_a939.html" title="Historical persecution by Christians">Historical persecution by Christians</a> could be seen as making a correlation according to what you indicate. If so it's making a correlation that is misleading or confusing. After all the title is not specifying and Christians aren't monolithic. So what Christians are doing the persection? If all of them, how? I mean were the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakers.html" title="Shakers">Shakers</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christadelphians.html" title="Christadelphians">Christadelphians</a> persecuting anyone? Or in the earlier eras how about the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Thomas_Christians_80b3.html" title="Saint Thomas Christians">Saint Thomas Christians</a>, who exactly were they persecuting? If not all of them, why the blanket statement about Christians in general?--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 05:55, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't find that all that convincing. Yeah the exact "persecution by atheists" isn't used that much, neither is "persecution by state atheism." However to say the second doesn't exist as a concept, as I was clearly meaning the second, is odd. <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_atheism.html" title="State atheism">State atheism</a> is different and I specified that's what I meant.

<li><b>Delete</b> - for reasons given by Silence, and also that this is basically just a list. I think that information about persecution is generally far better categorised by who is persecuted, rather than who does the persecution, unless those doing the persecution are a specific group of people working together (e.g., persecution by Nazis), or there is some other compelling reason to categorise it that way. So put the information in articles like <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html" title="Persecution of Christians">persecution of Christians</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_atheists.html" title="Persecution of atheists">persecution of atheists</a>, rather than instead telling us about persecution of non-Christians or persecution of non-theists. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 00:57, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
