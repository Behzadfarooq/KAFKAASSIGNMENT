<li>That's because in Ireland he uses his name in Irish: 'Ruaidhri' Conroy.

<li><b>Amend</b> I don't know who wrote this, but his 'associations' with Keira Knightly amounted to them both attending a charity function in Co Down a few months ago. Rory Conroy is a real person who WAS a physicist, but it seems like a fan may have gotten a bit over enthusiastic.

<li><b>Delete</b> Nonsense. Even if the Rory Conroy is Ruaidhri Conroy (which is suspect; see picture of Ruaidhri Conroy <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v050/50.2pr_mcdonagh_fig02.html" class="external text" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v050/50.2pr_mcdonagh_fig02.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), the additional accolades aren’t true. The "International Astro and Theoretical Physics Consortium" doesn't exist, nor does the album <i>The Transformed Man 2</i>. Whoever's putting up all this stuff is infecting other articles with the nonsense, too: e.g., having [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johnny_Cash_discography&amp;oldid=23100868|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johnny_Cash_discography&amp;oldid=23100868|" rel="nofollow">Johnny Cash</a>] collaborate on an album after Cash's death. (Also notable is that the pages of Cash, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trent_Reznor&amp;oldid=23096968|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trent_Reznor&amp;oldid=23096968|" rel="nofollow">Trent Reznor</a>], and [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Woody_Allen&amp;oldid=23104744|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Woody_Allen&amp;oldid=23104744|" rel="nofollow">Woody Allen</a>] reference Conroy's supposed band, "Centipede on the Roof" even though that name is not mentioned in the main article— it's obviously being made up as it goes). <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 18:20, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Amend</b> His life seems really incredible if it's true. I would be cautious however in deleting this. The article does say he's not well known outside of Ireland, so his album may not be on general release. Consortiums can also be small groups rather than large international ones. I am also concerned that where as the Johnny Cash article may be confused with the dates, this article does not give mention of these so cannot be held at fault. way2busy

<li>A Google search on "centipede on the roof" returned no documents, and there is no entry in allmusic.com for Rory Conroy, Ruaidhri Conroy, or Centipede on the Roof.

And there's <i>certainly</i> no evidence of any kind that he was a great young physicist or a rare martial arts master (and I've looked) as the article claims. It's been <i>three days</i>, and you sockpuppets have made a billion edits trying to keep this thing, and your evidence <i>does not exist</i>.

<li>"Rory Conroy", as an actor by that name, is not known to exist. As a physicist or Irish historian, he has no articles or textbooks in university libraries that a number of Wikipedians, including myself, have been able to find. As a martial arts master, his achievements cannot be verified.</li>
<li>The claims that Rory Conroy are Ruaidhri Conroy cannot be handily verified.</li>
<li>If Rory Conroy is Ruaidhri Conroy, it is unusual that this fact was not mentioned on the page until <i>after</i> the Articles for Deletion notice went up. Surely the name he was credited under would at least be worth a <i>mention</i> in a fairly comprehensive article written by what must be a very knowledgeable fan!</li>
<li>He is mentioned as playing key roles in the Irish dramas "Fair City" and "Batchelor's [sic] Walk". IMDB lists "Fair City" as an Irish television series beginning in 1988. No Conroy, Rory or Ruaidhri, is credited. IMDB does not list a "Batchelor's Walk", however, "Bachelor's Walk" is listed as an Irish television series that ran from 2001 to 2003. No Conroy, Rory or Ruaidhri, is credited.</li>
<li>Mr. Conroy is listed as a recipient of the "Best Young European Physicist of the Year" award. No such award is mentioned on Google. The awarding body is the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Science_Foundation_5e48.html" title="European Science Foundation">European Science Foundation</a>, which has no reference to a "Conroy" on its website.</li>
<li>Mr. Conroy is <i>not</i> listed as a recipient of the 1998 Theatre World Award for his role in Martin McDonagh's "The Cripple of Inishmaan", despite the fact that Ruaidhri Conroy <i>did</i> win this award. Another glaring omission in what is otherwise a fairly comprehensive article.</li>
<li>Pictures of Ruaidhri Conroy available online (such as <a href="http://www.fmstar.com/movie/r/r0401.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fmstar.com/movie/r/r0401.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v050/50.2pr_mcdonagh_fig02.html" class="external text" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v050/50.2pr_mcdonagh_fig02.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>) show a non-glasses-wearer with dark hair who doesn't look a <i>thing</i> like the picture in the article. The picture in the article does not appear online in a Google image search for "Ruaidhri Conroy", nor for "Rory Conroy".</li>
<li>This page is supported by an unusually large number of sockpuppet votes, which, while not an indication of the article by itself, is worth considering on top of the other evidence, listed in part above.</li>

<li>You were doing so well Lord Bob until your last point, insulting people by calling them socket puppets demeans all your other points, the source of the pictures has hard to verify, people can wear glasses and dye hair for roles etc. I think that you are confused by the use of irish names, my name "Seamus" which is Irish for James, we in ireland live in a multi lingual society I can (and do) use both names, perhaps this should be editted and the name chaned from Rory to "Ruaidhri". To the other users I'm sorry that I havent eddited other posts, I'm new to the community, but were we not all new once??

<li>If Ruaidhri is Irish for Rory (which, to my <i>very</i> considerable surprise, it actually seems to be!), then why why why wasn't his actual freakin' name mentioned in the article?!? He's credited under Ruaidhri <i>everywhere</i>. He appears as "Rory Conroy" <i>nowhere</i>. Two of the credits in the article, if IMDB is to be believed, are <i>absolute lies</i>. His academic background seems to be <i>total fiction</i>. The stuff on martial arts seems to be <i>dubious at best</i>. There are important omissions and facts that are false in the pre-AfD'd article (and in the present version). Heck, for all I know the author of the article also happens to be named "Rory Conroy" and is doing his damndest to pass himself off as the more famous Ruaidhri. You say that my referring to sockpuppets when a bunch of first-time users and anonymous IPs unanimously vote to keep an article demeans my other points. I could have called you anything I want but it wouldn't change the reality that my points are <i>real, unassailled facts</i> that could be disproved very easily if the article were actually true. A reference on the ESF's website to Conroy's award. Known and documented pseudonyms that he also performs and writes under, so as to explain the discrepancies in the claimed and his actual credits. Something on his martial arts work, or his album. Proof of his involvement with <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigur_Ros_f826.html" title="Sigur Ros">Sigur Ros</a> during their December 2004 Irish concert stop, despite the fact that <a href="http://sigur-ros.co.uk/tour/arctour.php" class="external text" title="http://sigur-ros.co.uk/tour/arctour.php" rel="nofollow">their official page</a> claims they neither toured in December 2004 nor appeared in Ireland all of that year. If you could actually verify all of those things, my argument would collapse utterly. But you can't. That's why you haven't, despite repeated calls from different editors to do so. That's why the only way you can try and win this AfD is by flooding the ballot box, rather than by actually convincing us of your point of view. I don't care if you think it cheapens my argument: this vote is supported by sockpuppets, barring you actually revealing solid evidence this vote will be to delete, and this hoax of an article will die. And I will be a little happier because it did. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 21:23, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok Lord bob, we will have to leave it at that, i have never said anything other than I know he is an actor, i'm not that well informed on his musical career etc, I do know he is an actor, thats all. I cant answer for the person who worte the article in its past or present form because I dont know who did it. I came across this by accident (email actually) however i havent been spamming this site, as my ip address will show.

<li>That's alright, then. I didn't mean to imply that <i>you</i> were one of the sockpuppets or one of the article's major editors, the evidence doesn't seem to bear that out. And I'm certainly not going to argue that Ruaidhri is Irish for Rory, and that Ruaidhri Conroy is an actor, which seems to be your main bone of contention despite my addressing other arguments in a thread with you. I took out my anger at the sockpuppets on you, and though I stand by my points above, I didn't mean to cause any offense to you (although I wouldn't mind offending the sockpuppets a bit. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 22:12, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ruaidhri Conroy is a real actor; you can find him on IMDB and google. However, no one has given any proof that Ruaidhri Conroy is in fact the same person as Rory Conroy—I haven’t seen information that would indicate that Ruaidhri has gone by the name "Rory." <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 16:05, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Rory is really famous in Ireland. He has appeared on a lot of t.v. shows on Irish television. His face is known to all. His band are less well known in Ireland, but that's not his profession. He was on a late-night talk show recently and told the incredible story of his life. As a fluent Irish speaker, Rory and Ruaidhri are interchangeable, and although while it's true that he prefers to go by Ruaidhri, he is also know as Rory, especially by non native speakers.---Hector5 (talk) 17:06, 14 September 2005 (UTC):

<li>More assertions without facts. And yet another user with no contribution history. Until someone demonstrates that 1) Rory Conroy is Ruaidhri Conroy and 2) that even half of the stuff in this article is valid, I still say <b>Delete</b>. | Keithlaw 16:49, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That’s not true that he has no contribution history, Keithlaw. If you check the contributions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=13.8.125.11" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=13.8.125.11" rel="nofollow">13.8.125.11</a> (aka Hector5 and some other posters on this page), it seems that he’s contributed a good deal of Wikipedia’s current information on Rory Conroy and Centipede on the Roof. It certainly looks like he's playing a joke to me and creating sockpuppets to back himself up. So I'll reiterate my <b>delete</b> vote, too. <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 17:40, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have been trying to find any information on him. He does appear to be credited as Rory Conroy for 'Into the West' at this site: <a href="http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film144297.html" class="external free" title="http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film144297.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film144297.html</a> It also seems that a Liu Zhen Juan has been known to come to Ireland: <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/shaolin/newsletters/2003/Septb2003.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ucd.ie/shaolin/newsletters/2003/Septb2003.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucd.ie/shaolin/newsletters/2003/Septb2003.html</a> Still, nothing conclusive though. I can say however that A Rory Conroy did write an article on sexuality in eary Ireland. I have given the book details above. Hope this helps.Jestermax 20:31, September 14, 2005

<li>I did some searching, and I can’t find any reference to <i>New Agendas in Irish Prehistory</i> containing any papers by an Ruaidhri/Rory Conroy (e.g., <a href="http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/27939" class="external text" title="http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/27939" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.wordwellbooks.com/book.php?id=26" class="external text" title="http://www.wordwellbooks.com/book.php?id=26" rel="nofollow">here</a>), nor does a google search of the paper's title, "Man, Father, Priest and Martyr" bring up any hits.
