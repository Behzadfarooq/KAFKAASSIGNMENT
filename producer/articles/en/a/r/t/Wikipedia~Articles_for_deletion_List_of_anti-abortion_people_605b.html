<dd><b>Comment</b> - only one person has said they were waiting for something like this, and it could easily be meant in a different context. I'm a pro-lifer myself, quite militantly so, but such a 'list' doesn't foster "discussion of a topic" at all, it just sits there making Wikipedia look bad because it's a hopeless attempt. I would AfD a "List of anti-life people" just as quickly. (Notice also that the article didn't use the prolife/prochoice positive-sounding terms, but referred to "anti-abortion" which is similar to "anti-choice" <i>shrugs</i> <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> 14:09, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Isn't anti-abortion the opposite of pro-abortion? Aren't you anti-abortion, or just "pro-life"? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 15:04, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that that matters, here, mate. The debate over abortion and even whether we call it pro-life/choice or anti/pro-abortion often turns discussions into a <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ForestFire" class="extiw" title="meatball:ForestFire">shitfight</a>. Since we're here first and foremost to build an encyclopedia, it's probably best to avoid that kind of stuff unless necessary, and it isn't, here. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">(talk)</a> 18:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Excuse me, but as the only Keep on an article that is obviously heading for the dustbin, I have the right to ask a question. Lots of diverse reasons are being cited for delete, and someone mentioned the name. Names can be changed. I don't care about the name. But I just can't see the difference between this list and numerous others on the site. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:52, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm assuming that you mean to be talking to me. Yes, of course you have the right to ask questions. Nonetheless, whether or not Sherurcij considers himself to be "pro-life" or "anti-abortion" is totally irrelevant to this article, and is the kind of question that starts flames. Why not stay on topic, and argue the keeping of this article on its merits, rather than starting a discussion that's likely to start a fight and isn't relevant? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">(talk)</a> 21:10, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There isn't a similar list for pro-choice or pro-abortion people. Because of that it makes the lists on this issue unbalanced. Also I don't think it's common for there to be lists concerning a position on a single issue. For example List of euthanasia opponents, List of gay-rights activists, List of birth control opponents, etc. I'm pretty sure will all come out red. Somewhat embarrassingly for my case though there is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_disability_rights_activists.html" title="List of disability rights activists">List of disability rights activists</a>. I am disabled, however I don't entirely agree with the activists, so I'm not sure where I feel there. Still that issue is in least able to be annotated without ticking people off and there is no category for the activists themselves. (There is Category:Rights of the disabled, but it's not specific to people) Still I have not yet voted though and I'm not sure I will. I am Pro-Life/Anti-Abortion/Anti-Choice(terminology is irrelevant to me) but still in this case I'm not sure the list can do more then the categories on this.(There is also Category:Pro-life politicians) Normally I like list, but as mentioned this maybe can't be annotated or sourced without causing a fight so may become worthless. If this gets deleted though I will actively vote to delete any List of pro-abortion people, List of pro-choice people or whatever term is used when it arrives.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Well said.

<dd>Thanks for making me aware of that. I added a "mergeto" on List of computer games featuring ants. On pacifists I don't know. That's also single issue I guess, and there isn't a List of militarists, but somehow it feels like pacifism is more of an entire life. My life is really not much like <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wangari_Maathai_b75a.html" title="Wangari Maathai">Wangari Maathai</a>, she isn't on this list but she did come out against abortion<a href="http://www.equityfeminism.com/archives/years/2005/000002.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.equityfeminism.com/archives/years/2005/000002.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2004/dec/04120702.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2004/dec/04120702.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and there is a great chance anti-abortion people have less in common then pacifists do. Which would risk having a list that's a random group of people with little in common which seems to be something they're moving away from. Although a list of anti-abortion activists would be relevant I think. I'd have to think on the whole thing.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<ul>
<li>Both those articles have the potential to be POV, and I would certainly support renaming if a better name could be found. But they do document a real and significant movement, in a way that a (hit)list of people does not. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 10:32, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. How consistent. The preferred response to the CFD attempts on Category:Pro-life celebrities et al was "there's already a list; listify." Now we finish up by deleting the list. Also, anyone who claims this is unverifiable isn't paying attention. Read <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Ireland_08f9.html" title="Kathy Ireland">Kathy Ireland</a> or <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Mulgrew_52c2.html" title="Kate Mulgrew">Kate Mulgrew</a>, for example. If it's verifiable enough to get into each article, it's verifiable enough for a list or a category. As for my "vote" in this alleged consensus process: <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 23:03, 10 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For the record I'd have voted keep on that category. I strongly believe that categories are the way to handle this kind of thing, not least because individual article authors will see and review the addition of the category. It also ensures that only those who have a strong and widely-publicised interest will be added. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 10:32, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Zaphod.&#160;;) I was somewhat out of line with that consistency remark, as it's not the same people participating in both discussions. But it is true that when the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, we can get those kinds of effects. I think we'd also see very interesting results in both discussions if we correlated each person's personal view on the political subject with their view on whether or not the category or list is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 20:14, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In my case you'd probably find I'm less likely to nominate somthing if I support its agenda, but on AfD I will vote to keep stuff I hate and dleet stuff I like based on my best guess at whether it meets the criteria. I think a large proportion of lists are arbitrary, often dangerously misleading (as I believe this one is), and dulfil the same function as categories but less well. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 23:17, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a useless list. It isn't a list of people who belong to a recognizable group (college alumni, say), have a common intrinsic quality (Italian American, say), or recognized achievement (Nobel Prize winners, say) -- it's an unverified list of people who (may) share a specific OPINION. And it's an opinion singled for noting WHY, exactly? Next up, List of free-trade supporters, List of believers in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy, List of people who crack open their boiled eggs on the narrow end, etc. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:26, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
