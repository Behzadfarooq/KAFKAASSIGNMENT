The only thing it says about him personally is that he is a "prominent television and print journalist".

<li><b>Burninate Delete</b> as an RS rogue. RuneScape's quests do not lend themselves well to the wikipedia. There are over a hundred of them, virtually all involve <i>take item X to NPC Y</i> then <i>fetch item Z for NPC Y</i> etc. Once the dialogue/history present in the quest is explained (like in this case), there's nothing else to add except game guide - the RuneScape Gods article is as close as RS gets to an expanding storyline. 81.157.18.156 10:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I want to point out that that I included the AppleTalker info and link on the MacNN article in order to introduce valid links to the AppleTalker article. Also, though there have only been a few editors, many members of AppleTalker contributed to the article before it was created on Wikipedia, so if you see a few new heads here, understand that its not a disingenuous attempt at "tipping the balance" of opinion, but rather the genuine opinion of other people who have contributed to the article before-hand.
<p>As for noteworthy-ness and "non-trivial published works", AppleTalker has a few thousand posts, some of which are rather substantial, from technical issues to philosophy. I just wonder what kind of standard can judge MacNN to be "noteworthy" and yet have no place for AppleTalker. Also, AppleTalker differentiates itself from most forums on its policies, lack of moderators and system of governance. I think that is substantial, because it makes it rather unique.--<a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxley_460a.html" title="User:Tuxley">Tuxley</a> 08:33, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>As for noteworthy-ness and "non-trivial published works", AppleTalker has a few thousand posts</i> — The posts on the discussion forum itself are not non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the discussion forum.
<p><i>I just wonder what kind of standard can judge MacNN to be "noteworthy" and yet have no place for AppleTalker.</i> — What makes you think that <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macintosh_News_Network_80b3.html" title="Macintosh News Network">Macintosh News Network</a> satisfies the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria either?

<li>Fine, if you want to be really stubborn about this, go ahead. The moment this page gets deleted, MacNN's page will be put up for deletion as well. How about we stick to one set of rules rather than just bully the small guys? 129.129.128.84 09:20, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Uncle G, exactly what sources pertaining to what do you want cited? AppleTalker is a board. Everything leading to its creation and all that has gone on within it have been recorded and stored. Also, AppleTalker is <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/blogs_forums/appletalkerwidget.html" class="external text" title="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/blogs_forums/appletalkerwidget.html" rel="nofollow">on Apple's site as a widget</a>.

<li>Some examples: Histories of this discussion forum, created and published independently of the discussion forum itself; non-trivial news coverage in a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable source</a>; independent guides to the discussion forum. If you can find and cite such things, you can change the minds of the editors whose rationales are that the WP:WEB criteria are not satisfied. That web page that you hyperlinked is <i>not</i> a source. It says <i>nothing at all</i> about the discussion forum. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:08, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I believe AppleTalker is notable in itself. Just some browsing around the board will verify that this is indeed a different kind of board. Also, I cannot provide many links because AppleTalker is a young board. However it has been mentioned on numerous other sites and blogs.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article might be taken as a simple advertisement for the site it references, and that is damning enough in and of itself. However, the entire article is basically written as a series of statements that reduce to "we are not like our rivals" and "our rivals are evil."

<li>Perhaps I should rephrase. Verifying the <i>history</i> of pages is generally difficult to verify (perhaps crawling through archive.org, etc, but admittedly that tast would be vast and horrible for a forum) because the history is generally also not something that is widely published. OTOH, that leads to the agreeable point that the history of a website is simple not useful or suitable for WP; if there <i>is</i> something newsworthy, then it will have been recorded elsewhere. However just because the history of the site fails V I don't believe the article is up for deletion; V simply states that the <i>information</i> there that isn't verifiable needs to be removed. Sure, for many pages V covers the whole thing; but here if you strip the unverifiable bits you're still left over with information such as the existence of the site, what it's for. <i>Those</i> then fail WP:WEB; I think the distinction between a blanket V delete and combination of V/WEB is an important one; V should strip down the information, and what's left over is what should be judged for deletion. Compare the existence of some unV information in some random otherwise great article; the article should not fall because one part of it is outside our rules. Here a far greater section is unV - but it's still a section. Does that make more sense? --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">Firi</a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_Esperanza_4dd7.html" title="User:Firien/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">n</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirien_191d.html" title="User talk:Firien">§</a> 09:09, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article originally consisted of just the company name, and was tagged for speedy delete for being empty by Anthony.bradbury. Tag removed by author Mikehaley without comment, though discography was added. I've been trying to open dialog with the author in the talk page Talk:Electric Human Project for a couple of days now without success, trying to get article to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. At this point I'm looking at an article about a company that gets only 373 distinct Ghits with no multiple non-trivial third-party stories, or major awards, or charted hits. Some of the <a href="http://www.electrichumanproject.com/index2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.electrichumanproject.com/index2.html" rel="nofollow">albums</a> appear to have gotten outside reviews, but I'm finding nothing about the company itself. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 12:17, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - As <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> does not have specific guidelines for record labels, I would suggest that a label can only be as notable as the acts it has signed/worked with. The "multiple non-trivial published works" Wikipedia seeks would have to relate to their releases for those acts rather than just for the acts where the artist works or has worked with multiple labels. I have no opinion as to whether this label passes or otherwise. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 20:23, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't expect it's a stretch that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> applies to a company that is a record label, as opposed to a company that produces software, runs a hotel, or any of the other companies it's been applied to. As far as the individual acts the label has produced, I did a preliminary check of individual notability there for each band and found nothing of remark. I submit it would unreasonable for an editor to apply <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> to each and every band in order to possibly find notability to justify the article on the <i>record label</i>, and suggest the onus is on the contributor to show why the label should have an article. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 12:54, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would say that if a label has worked successfully with a sufficient number of notable acts, they would become notable of themselves; it would demonstrate a degree of success within their field that would be of remark. An exact dividing line would be virtually impossible to draw however. The majority of major label acts flop.... <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 13:35, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh, I'd agree with you, but it requires the writer to show the notable acts the label has produced. In this case, Mikehaley has continued to edit the article, refuses to communicate any questions to me, and yet continues to fail to show notability of either the label or the associated bands per this, or any, discussion. The article is also vanity per the disclosure at this <a href="http://mikehaley.proboards26.com/index.cgi?action=viewprofile&amp;user=admin" class="external text" title="http://mikehaley.proboards26.com/index.cgi?action=viewprofile&amp;user=admin" rel="nofollow">site</a>. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 11:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> "Underground" labels can't be discounted simply because they don't have mainstream/radio success (such a precedent would wipe out many very influential aspects of an important subculture through the past few decades). This label seems to have notability in the underground music world, due to the number of releases and cross references with bands that are listed in wikipedia. Suggest having the article conform with all Wikipedia standards but keep it in terms of content. robotcaptain 14:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We can't even confirm this band <i>exists</i> - <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> may be negiotiable, but <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is not. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:49, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not a band, it is a record label. As far as confirming that the bands on the label exist, do a little bit of research and you will find that they all do. for example: la quiete (<a href="http://www.laquiete.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.laquiete.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laquiete.org/</a>), hot cross (<a href="http://www.level-plane.com/hotcross" class="external free" title="http://www.level-plane.com/hotcross" rel="nofollow">http://www.level-plane.com/hotcross</a>), isis (<a href="http://www.sgnl05.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.sgnl05.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgnl05.com/</a>), daughters (<a href="http://www.wearedaughters.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.wearedaughters.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wearedaughters.com/</a>). and, all bands i have just mentioned (along with many others on the label) have multiple US, Japanese, and European tours under their belt, multiple full length albums, and widespread popularity in the independent and underground music community. Again, this information is all quite relevant to a large and important topic: underground music. robotcaptain 18:44, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>None of those are <b>reliable third party sources</b>. From this, I really can't conclude that these bands even exist - after all, my bands' website you might have concluded we knew how to play instraments, we actually had albums, our fiddler was in the baseball hall of fame, et cetera. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>1. Nora Roberts 2. Terry Goodkind 3. Daniel Silva * 4. Janet Evanovich 5. Scott Smith 6. Danielle Steel 7. Fannie Flagg 8. J. A. Jance 9. Sara Gruen 10. James Lee Burke</p>
</blockquote>
Only number 3 marked with the * has an Author page or stub in Wikipedia. He wrote 9 books since 1996 and that suggests some sort of baseline. Ms. Sharon Weinberger has written one book which sold fewer than 500 copies and raised very serious charges about the provenance of the events she described, as can be seen at the second external link to the critique of that one book.
<p>The history section of this entry shows considerable contention that could indicate troubled matters.</p>
<p>Let's discuss and see if there are some extenuating circumstances for what otherwise will be a sharp lowering of standards caused by retaining this Author. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrac2000_e5f8.html" title="User:Drac2000">Drac2000</a> 01:08, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Wrong use of Data</b> Please realize that basically ALL of the names you listed in your so-called NYT bestsellers list are authors of novels, i.e., FICTION. Weinberger's book doesn't belong in the same category; it's not "literature" in the fiction sense. It's non-fiction. I'm sure you know what the difference is. (Moreover, most authors know that the New York Times Bestsellers list is really just a jacked-up publicity stunt; it's definitely not a reliable meter for gauging the popularity of a book.) When attempting to cite data in the future, please get to know the list of names you blindly fling around. <i>But, getting back to my point: other than groundless speculation, what is your judgment based on?</i> <a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYosofun_9b47.html" title="User:Yosofun">Yosofun</a> 04:00, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

If we held all the cryptid articles up to the same standard of proof we'd not have articles on Bigfoot or the Waheela or other articles I've been working on. Perhaps instead of having it as a separate article it could be merged with a more general article on SHC.<a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisapollison_fe0d.html" title="User:Lisapollison">Lisapollison</a> 14:06, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Quite true, but there's probably relevant comics without awards or sources attributed to them.

<p>Well it's subjective to what you consider notable. Flat Life is read 13,000 times a month. If by Wikipedia's standards that is not good enough then I can not defend it against deletion. But I always thought the best thing about Wikipedia was the fact I could find information on even the most obscure things (and websites). And why the hell does the "e" in "Hahnchen direct to the listing for "evil"? - Parabolee 11:11, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - HE had already been told and because, again if you read the talk page, you will notice that the editor he was in dispute with clearly <i>did have</i> notability issues and had discussed listing here. Since their dispute became personal (at least in the opinion of the subject), the other editor no longer felt comfortable listing, lest it seen to be in bad faith and further escalate the situation. The subject of the article then offered to list it himself, to settle the dispute. It was this abortive attempt that i rescued. My role was simply one of assisting a new editor complete what i believe to be, at its root, a good faith nom. The fact there is not (yet) a consensus suggests to me it was not an extraordinarily bad listing. Thats my role, no more, not less. I hope thats clear. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 06:11, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Michael you say above you are "a marginally important journalist", yet in your first post to my talk page you describe yourself as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Threeafterthree&amp;diff=70815885&amp;oldid=70038347" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Threeafterthree&amp;diff=70815885&amp;oldid=70038347" rel="nofollow">"a national journalist"</a>. I then question that and you call me rude? I reverted your page per policy and you call me a vandal. I have tried to link many useful WP: since you are new. I am sorry you are soured but calling me rude, a vandal, and agenda driven doesn't help it would seem.

<dd><b>Comment</b>(takes deep breath) One can be both "national" and "marginal," Tom. I have been published in numerous national; periodicals, and my work has been featured on MSNBC, Slate, and CBS.com (among others), but I am hardly in the class of, say, an Anderson Cooper; hence, "marginal" is a relative term. Anyone can read your snide comments on various talk pages questioning my work as a journalist and decide for themselves what you really meant. Besides, when one self-describes as "marginal," it should be seen as humility or self-deprecation; when one describes another that way, it could be interpreted as an attack. I am trying, by initiating the AfD process, to appease you, but you seem to want to keep the argument going. BTW - my comments about vadalizing refer to pages where, in your zeal to delete my edits, you deleted the work of other people. Stop trying to twist my words, sir.<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistorymike_ae6a.html" title="User:Historymike">Historymike</a> 18:48, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to comment</b> Tom, Tom, Tom...1) Yes, you are right about Exum. If, as you claim, you have no link to Exum, then please accept my apologies. 2) Re: vandalism: My comments about vandalism are, in the main, directed against your reckless edits that erased other peoples' work in your effort to erase mine. I did get peeved when you demanded a citation on the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Brooks_419d.html" title="Michael Brooks">Michael Brooks</a> bio, and then kept deleting the citation because it came from a blog (never mind that it is from an award-winning author, David Neiwert, whose area of expertise is watching the racist right. You just <i>assumed</i> the citation link was to my blog). You are obviously a person who is not willing to consider that some blogs are now go-to media sites unto themselves, and I do not wish to waste time on the blogs-vs-traditional media debate here. 3)For someone who professes to just want to get along, you sure do spend an awful lot of time coming back here to keep stirring things up.

<li><b>Reply</b> Hi Michael, 1) Apology accepted, no biggie. 2) I don't think my edits were "reckless" or erased others work. The only ONE I think was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pyramid_mausoleums_in_North_America&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70978967" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pyramid_mausoleums_in_North_America&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70978967" rel="nofollow">this</a> and I did add that material back in. All the other edits were removing blogs as referrences. I never "demanded" anything, I just placed a fact tag on some material on your bio. 3) Not really stirring things up, just trying to respond to defend myself.--<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 14:09, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>strong keep</b>: Just more evidence of ongoing efforts to whitewash the Wiki's version of history.

<li><b>Keep —</b> His most recent book, the <i>ANZAC Illusion</i> advances new theories about the popular view of Australian's experiences in war. It is a controversial position for an academic to take and it adds significantly to the reinterpretation of Australian war and social history. It was published by a major publisher <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_University_Press_6c23.html" title="Cambridge University Press">Cambridge University Press</a>. I can't comment on his other books because I don't know them. Certainly the article is weak, but it is simply a stub and over time it will be improved. I think it would be a shame to consider that Eric Andrew's material is not notable when we accept every footballer and sportsperson as notable just because they have played in a few first grade matches. In one hundred year's Andrews contribution to Australian history will remain more important than <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Markovski_00ff.html" title="John Markovski">John Markovski</a>'s contribution to Australia.

<li>Criterion 2 of WP:CORP is for <i>stock market</i> indexes, not for web sites that give quality ratings to breweries. Criterion 1 is what you are looking for.

<li><b><s>No vote yet</s></b>. It is unclear from the linked sites I visited whether this is a local (micro)brewery (i.e. its beers are available off premises) or just a brewpub/restaurant that offers brew-on-premises. Would be inclined to keep it if it is a local brewery. Not sure that an individual brewpub/restaurant meets the grade, though. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It'd be better if we had a source for that rather than my own tasty but original research, but yes, this beer is distributed as well. Not sure how MUCH they distribute, if that matters, but it can be found at other bars and restaurants. The brewery itself is a brewpub (i.e. their products are available packaged but are also <i>served</i> on the premises.) They do not have a kitchen. I'll admit I was a bit questionable about making this- I wouldn't be in favor of articles on every corner bar in the world. But since they're a licensed commercial brewery, I figured this put them in a different category. There'd been discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Beer_8c19.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Beer_Notability_Criteria_6309.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer/Notability Criteria">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer/Notability Criteria</a> on notability of individual breweries, but nothing I'd call a clear consensus. If you're inclined to say (as some did in the discussion) that any licensed commercial brewery is significant, this one clearly counts. If you want some level of third-party sources, well, they are some, but I don't know if there's enough to clearly show the significance of this. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:19, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Good to know that notability is being discussed in the beer project, and tend to agree: the garden variety brewpub-restaurant is common enough to require further indicia of notability, but local breweries that distribute ought to make the cut. (For a fact like this, the menu or beer list of <i>another</i> restaurant serving this brewery's beer would be an independent, non-self-published source reliable enough to establish this fact, I think.) - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:32, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b>, and so I don't muddy AfD's up with more brewery articles. <i>Are all commercial breweries notable? And if not, what would disqualify a commercial brewery from notability?</i> <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:34, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That very question has been kicked around a bit at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Beer_Notability_Criteria_6309.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer/Notability Criteria">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer/Notability Criteria</a>. Guidelines that try to say "all things of type X are automatically notable" are rather silly, even tho we do that in cases of towns as a convenience. We could make up rules based on how many barrels per year they produce, but I don't think we need to- isn't what we're looking for really just proper sources? I've remember reading a newpaper article about this place, but I believe it was from several years ago and I'm unable to turn it up online, but I suppose I don't expect people to just take my word for it that there are better sources available. The main reason I don't see a need for a specific standard for breweries is that I don't see vanity brewery articles usually clogging up Afd. I'll admit the closest thing we have to a relevant guideline is <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> which this almost certainly fails, but I'm admittedly biased on favor of things that are delicious. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 01:28, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm a beer fan myself. Given the lack of clarity, then it seems like <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is our best guideline. If not, then there's nothing to stop Wikipedia from becoming a brew pub directory - and from lots of other similar sized restaurants, etc. claiming "equal" notability. As far as brew-pubs go, any city with a pub is going to get a local newspaper write-up, so that's hardly notable. To prevent that, I'd like to suggest that the brew or the pub should first win at least one major award before meeting Wikipedia's notability requirements. "X-city's best" by some newspaper award, probably wouldn't count (at least not for a Peoria sized city). Other ideas? <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 01:42, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I could try to assert that breweries are of particular cultural significance but that's just my own opinion which shouldn't count for much. My general standard for all articles involve the subject being covered in an appropriate number of independant sources. I don't personally see a need for specific standards for breweries, altho expecting some significant award doesn't seem unreasonable to me either.

So far this Afd seems to confirm what I'd suspected- that articles on commercial breweries and unlikely to be deleted via Afd, but this is the first practical test of brwery notability that I'm aware of. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:01, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: for those who like having our own standards for significance rather than relying on expert opinion, there's one factor that might make this brewery somewhat unique, at least in its locale: they serve <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cask_ale.html" title="Cask ale">cask ale</a>, which, as far as I have seen, isn't available at places like <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goose_Island_Brewery_1fce.html" title="Goose Island Brewery">Goose Island Brewery</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's a small business of no notability. That it makes beer seems to be the only reason why people are voting to keep it. I am a beer advocate. But I see no sense in listing every corner shop, bus stop, milk farm and brewery on the planet. The rules of Wiki are that an entry must be verifiable - that is the item must have been written about in an approved source. A listing in a phone book or collectors directory does not count. If RateBeer had an article on the brewery that would be of interest. But they merely list the brewery - along with every brewery on the planet! <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalfourCentre_5115.html" title="User:BalfourCentre">BalfourCentre</a> 23:07, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> although I think the deletion on El Mudo was premature, if it got deleted then this article can't be here, either. Hopefully though, it's on the Spanish Wikipedia, because it's definitely notable in the Spanish-speaking world (for better or for worse). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 06:20, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Anyway, if it's notable in Spain it's notable here. We're an international encyclopedia that just happens to be in the English language.

<li><b>Delete</b> - it isn't notable enough in Spanish to have an article on the es wikipedia (ditto El Mudo and El Chombo), and it doesn't pass the notability criteria here either. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 10:26, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm pretty sure that "el mudo" doesn't actually exist, since I've found the song credited to "andy val gourmet" and <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk/products/192755-01.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.juno.co.uk/products/192755-01.htm" rel="nofollow">listed</a> in the Juno Records catalog. Since it's a single that's achieved a notable level of popularity and has a video made for it, I'm going to say keep and cleanup. If you want to verify for yourself, see the cover <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk/covers/192755-01-front.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.juno.co.uk/covers/192755-01-front.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 00:27, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> First off, the song wasn't created by "El Mudo," but rather <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Chombo_2ffa.html" title="El Chombo">El Chombo</a> feat. Andy's Val Gourmet, and thus the artist wasn't deleted. Second, this song is becoming much more popular on the internet every day, in my opinion much more than <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_poop_girl.html" title="Dog poop girl">dog poop girl</a>! If we can get more info on this song, and the artists, it may become a good article. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDT_9076.html" title="User:SuperDT">SuperDT</a> 04:07, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for the additions. However they still don't address the basic issue of whether the book is notable or not. If the book had been reviewed by some independent and reliable <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source</a> for example, then it would show notability. As it stands the references you added show notability for Freemasonry, but not for the book "99 Degrees of Freemasonry".

<li>I have absolutely no wish to write about Peter Nygård, nor am I under any obligation to do so just because I happen to stumble over a hatchet job on the person. As far as I understand <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, it is better to have no article at all on a living person rather than one which is defamatory. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 08:04, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are under no obligation to write an article about Peter Nygård, true. But you should consider that initiating an AfD rather than attempting to fix an existing article is asking other editors to spend time evaluating the article, time which could better be spent creating and revising other articles. In any event, there is a substantially revised article in place now, and there is no justification for deleting it. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 08:19, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is the position I would usually take where the article is in need of a minor cleanup but basically harmless, but with attack articles, I think it is reasonable to delete unless someone actually rewrites the thing (and in some cases deletion and rewrite from scratch may even be needed). Thus, in a case where I'm not interested in making the rewrite, my alternatives are a) to ignore the article and pretend I never saw it, or b) to turn to the larger Wikipedia community. Since I have no idea where else to report an article that seems to be on a notable subject but should be deleted unless rewritten, I took it here. There seems to be no other way, or should we have a special place for reporting pages like this? (BTW, the rewrite is fine, and I suppose the discussion can be closed.) <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 20:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>, as the material except the lyrics had already been merged into the main article.

<li>That's fine if you want to merge this content with <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_V_School_3091.html" title="King George V School">King George V School</a>. But you should include the lyrics. Along alumni this is often debated, and I pulled these words directly from the hymn book. Talking to other previous students, we felt it was important to add these lyrics. I felt that it may be inappropriate to include this in the main <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_V_School_3091.html" title="King George V School">King George V School</a> section, as it would dilute the value of that page. So I created this page. I am new to wikipedia, so I apologize if this was inappropriate. But like I stated previously, I think it is very important to either include the lyrics in the main page, or keep this one. Dpatri 13:28, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No problem. Thanks for the correction. In terms of value -- it is only important to previous students -- However, it is oldest and most respected (debatable) English secondary school in Hong Kong and is often identified by its school song... not to repeat myself, but I just want the lyrics included somewhere.

<li><b>strong keep</b> The merge target, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_V_School_3091.html" title="King George V School">King George V School</a> is already a <b>huge</b> article and the school is <b>notable</b>, contrary to the nominator.

<ul>
<li>I didn't know the <i>nominator</i> had to be notable...&#160;;-) Seriously, I am not asserting that the parent <i>school</i> is non-notable, just its song. And I realize the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_V_School_3091.html" title="King George V School">King George V School</a> article is long, but the only additional info in this article is the lyrics. How are you going to find <i>"credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy"</i> to confirm the lyrics to a high school song? Even the original author above admits there is debate as to the exact lyrics. It can't possibly pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is why we have notability requirements in the first place. --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatori_Son_533a.html" title="User:Satori Son">Satori Son</a> 19:02, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may completely remove it from main article and put into "see also" section. This is a completely independent piece that may be safely removed from the main narration about the school. By the way, if the issue is verifiablity, the text xas no right to be in the main article either. As for "theird-party sources", in this case the school itself is a valid source, you don't need "third party": Lyrics is not an opinion or description, it is bare fact. Just like basic items about person's bio may be taken from his website. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 19:14, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right, the specific lyrics should probably not be included in the parent article. I appreciate what Dpatri, the original author, is trying to do, but <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> is one of the few Wikipedia policies that is completely and totally non-negotiable. --<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatori_Son_533a.html" title="User:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 18:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok, if verifiability is the only issue preventing this from being approved (from Satori Son's pov) then I found the song on the kgv.edu.hk page. I have cited this page in the wiki (If I have cited it incorrectly, please correct). I hope we can now say that this song is verifiable. BTW, I disagree with the words that are on the kgv.edu site, and can prove I am correct. For one, it is using the american english spelling of "Honour". This is a british school and is still using british english. Secondly there is a typo, saying "Honetas" when it should be "Honestas". I don't think anyone would dispute that, so my version is the corrected version. The whole reason I created this as separate is because the KGV main page is too long, and I feel the lyrics are important - and now verfiable from a trusted source (the school website) Dpatri 22:05, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>BTW, I am going to try to get the version on the kgv.edu.hk site corrected as well --Dpatri 22:07, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A7 is not about non-notability, it is about the <i>lack of assertion</i> of notability. These are not the same. Whether the assertion(s) of notability is valid grounds for keeping an article is for an AfD to decide. <a href="../../../a/w/y/User%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3b01.html" title="User:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh</a> 06:11, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My weak "Keep" is because I'd be much more in favor of deleting this version and starting over with a version on which a little more time and research has been spent; I've certainly done part of that research.<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 07:19, 23 August 2006 (UTC) (Additional references, comments)<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 01:44, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep!</b> Not only is he notable, but this is not the first time I have seen a rugby bio up for deletion. Going through the <i>categories</i>, it seems that rugby has a better quality of people bios that other sports. Looking at some soccer players, and rugby league players, it seems people have created them purely so there is not a red link on the team page. So if you want to nominate things, look there first, where people create player articles just so the squad is complete! Rugby has far less player pages, because MOST of them are at least a paragraph or two, soccer and rugby league have articles which are no more than a sentance or a pasted player profile!

<p><b>Delete.</b> This article contains vanity. It is a mere showcase of bias editors boosting the image of the three universities. The "Big Three" maybe heard by speech, but is rarely recognised on paper and therefore unencyclopedic. The article is not notable and does not fit the critera like the "G-10" article. The information can also be misleading, especially on "Rankings". This year, 10 universities withdrew from the "credible" Macleans ranking of universities. These universities questioned the validity of the surveys conducted. (University of Toronto included) Hence, it is safe to reason the surveys by Macleans are unreliable. Also, the statement <b>In international university rankings such as the Academic Ranking of World Universities (conducted by Shanghai Jiao Tong University), the University of Toronto and McGill University generally alternate for the first and second highest ranked Canadian university. Queen's is generally third or fourth</b> is untrue. Queens University does not fall in the third or fourth rank. It is not even in the top 100 universities according to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I would like to add "Harvard of the North" statement is a personal opinion. The sources used to justify that statement is not credible at all. Dvb 15:25, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as vanity and under <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. From what I can find, the term has never been used by the media (or anyone in particular).

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I created this article, and the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price_comparison_service.html" title="Price comparison service">Price comparison service</a> article. I was advised to create the list as a pragmatic means both of protecting the main article from spam, and to stop it becoming a long list of links. I need to work on the formatting, and turn it into something more than just a repository of links, but please give me some time to do this. In the short term, I have been keeping a very close eye on who has been adding links to both pages, and removed any that could be considered unnotable. I do need some international help on knowing notable price comparison sites outside the UK, and have requested that on the main article page.

<dd>A little more explanation, to try to explain the encyclopaedic relevance. Price comparison is definitely of relevance (see main article for justification on that point). There are around 30 notable price comparison companies - some operate internationally (Kelkoo, Froogle), some are focussed on Europe, others on the US. In addition, some focus on a specific product area, some on a much wider range. My idea was to build two articles similar to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_content_management_systems.html" title="Comparison of content management systems">Comparison of content management systems</a>, one focusing on countries of operation, the other on services offered. That then keeps a long complicated grid out of the main article on price comparison. Please suggest any alternatives that will offer a visual comparison/explanation of the companies in this market. There must be other examples of this kind of list on Wikipedia?<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlowski_1b02.html" title="User:Blowski">Blowski</a> 16:37, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Each of these articles about characters from a television movie is written almost completely from an in-universe perspective with no citations. Each has one or more sections devoted to trivia, "facts", speculation, and extraordinarily banal quotes. Attempts to remove such sections are reverted by the articles' author. One of the articles is a duplicate. These articles should all be deleted and merged into the main article, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_10th_Kingdom_bd83.html" title="The 10th Kingdom">The 10th Kingdom</a>, which could use some work itself. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 22:42, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Neutral</s></b>. These aren't high-quality articles, but I know for a fact that 10th Kingdom has a fanbase. I'm not sure how big it is, though. In any sense, "merge and delete" is not a valid vote because it doesn't comply with the <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GNU Free Documentation License</a>. Though AFD is unnecessary if the goal is just to merge the articles, I support keeping the AFD live to develop consensus on 10th Kingdom's notability and the suitability of keeping the individual articles, because a consensus to delete could very well emerge. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green">szyslak</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a>)</small> 00:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

But Wikipedia has no articles on Natasha Rostova, Andrey Bolkonsky and Pierre Bezukhov. No way should there be individual articles on the characters from "The 10th Kingdom".

<li>I'm not familiar with War and Peace, but if those are main characters then they certainly could have articles here. Plenty of main characters from classic works have their own aricles (e.g. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Smith_0986.html" title="Winston Smith">Winston Smith</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Savage_5f40.html" title="John the Savage">John the Savage</a>), so why not them? More applicable to the 10th Kingdom, many contemporary characters have articles too. I don't see why certain characters not having articles (yet, at least) means that other characters shouldn't, either. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 19:40, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Calling it a "TV movie" is a bit of a stretch, as it's like 12 hours long or something (I have the DVD and it takes up 3 discs). It's at least a miniseries or a "limited series". I'd say the character articles are reasonable, as they're too big to be merged. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:12, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> - Only basic character info, no "trivia".

<li><b>Stubify and merge, and redirect</b> per Vary. For characters that have only been in one work of fiction there does not need to be an entire article dedicated to them unless there are substantial claims to their importance. These articles do not have that. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 01:58, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>CONCERNING THE CRYSTAL BALL, NOTABILITY AND CORP STANDARDS:</p>
<p>(a) The SWANsat pre-launch subscription exists today. The page has nothing to do with advertising. (Just to let you know, the phrase "become a pre-launch subscriber today" would be considered poor advertising.)</p>
<p>(b) The published work, Shareware Telecommunications, has been discussed/presented within the UN system, through the UN ICT Task Force.</p>
<p>(c) At least one military school website has published briefings concerning the technology.</p>
<p>(d) It is appropriate to discuss the prospects for success of future projects, provided that discussion is properly referenced and (I might add) using fairness of tone - eg. "SWANSAT IS IMPOSSIBLE" or "DOES NOT AND WILL NOT EXIST" is not fair.</p>
<p>(e) Patent holder's credible research is being used. Experts at the forefront of space communications are being used (check the corporate capabilities of the spacecraft vendor's directors and management, for example)</p>
<p>(f) <b>Exceptional</b> products that include certain "future-tech" items are acceptable. SWANsat's power payload, delivered by IOSTAR, is a commercial space nuclear system, built &amp; technically owned by Sandia Labs/USG, overseen by the US Inter-agency Nuclear Safety Review Panel (INSRP), utlizing the "Commercial Reusable In-Space Transportation Act of 2002. A Redacted Portion of The Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2003." From any reasonable, unbiased, point of view, there are <b>exceptional technology</b> advancements directly impacting on SWANsat, RIGHT NOW, as we debate the existence/deletion of this WP site.</p>
<p>(g) IOSTAR has received notable, independent press coverage for its "SPACE TUG BOAT" in which its power payload (after its space tug boat missions are complete) are to be sold/transfered to SWANsat's communication payload.</p>
<p>(h) SWANsat is a holder of a satellite licence from a UN-member state. Notability criterion should include Government licencees, shouldn't it?</p>
<p>(comment was added by Wmt)</p>
<p>Sundry space scientists familiar with other satellite systems are not convinced that SWANsat can create a system in the order of magnitude that it claims. Without divulging proprietary technological secrets, more technical information on the WP page would assist the space skeptics among us to at least consider the implications of such a project. Giving SWANsat Marketing that opportunity is fair. Err on the side of caution, yet also offer due respect to the engineers of IOSTAR &amp; ORBITAL &amp; SANDIA LABS. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wmt, believed to be William P.

<li><b>Delete</b> Note that Wmt is William P. Welty himself. Note that the two 'Keep' votes above were inserted by Welty. Welty claims involvement of engineers at IOSTAR and Sandia; this claim has not been substantiated by IOSTAR, as the only material I can find on this is from SWANsat, ergo Welty. Experts are claimed to be involved by Welty; let's see non-Welty-sourced, non-SWANsat-sourced, citations supporting this claim. There may well be patents involved, but these have not been cited. (William - if you claim something that can be disputed, you must either provide direct proof or cite supporting material as a reference to show that your claim is factual and supported by others. Supporting material that has been published and gone through peer review is considered good. I realise that this is unfamiliar territory for you - your claimed 'PhD' dissertation on SWANsat contains no citations or references to prior or related work, and is largely unsubstantiated.) Presenting slides to an audience cannot be considered publication or peer review. Neither can appearing on a miltary website. Obviously, since I created this deletion page and raised the deletion question, I'm for deletion, since that's less work than constantly keeping Welty's claims in check.</li>

<p><br />
<b>Wmt is not William P Welty. I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT WILLIAM WELTY</b>. BUT, in one of his public presentations, he provided an online hidden document folder. It includes a PDF document of an IOSTAR/SWANsat agreement, early IOSTAR engineering studies concerning the powerplant &amp; communications payload. As a layman, I personally found them difficult to read and I am not sure they directly addressed Dr Wood's key issue: high-frequency/low distance ultilization. Ask William P Welty for access, if you wish. Or call IOSTAR to settle this matter once and for all. Dr Wood, just because you have not (yet) read the documents in the presentation binder (the terms of viewing the page does not permit me to re-publish the documents) it does not mean they do not exist or are untrue.</p>
<p>Here's a challenge for you Dr Wood: <i>will you commit to removing the deletion petition IF it is proved that IOSTAR is involved with SWANsat?</i></p>
<p>In the meantime, I have changed my "KEEP" vote back to one. I apologize for any inadvertant confusion. (perhaps you should do the same). It was an easy visible mistake that the volunteer administrator would quickly work out. I actually agree with you, Dr Wood, in that more IOSTAR technical information in the public domain would be nice. However, I am unsure if the physics/mathematic proof you are probably seeking is critical to the existence of the whole WP page. Remember that your bias towards new information regarding new satellite technology advancements will always be highly demanding &amp; rigorous (not a critism) and therefore your level of satisfation and demand for proof is much higher than the rest. The SWANsat WP article is not a scholarly debate forum, that is why I hope you will accept my challenge above.</p>
<p><br />

<li>William P. Welty would obviously have a vested interest in SwanSat. William is often written Wm. Wel<b>T</b>? The inference that can be drawn is obvious. If you're not William P.

Encyclopaedic veracity should not have to reply on hidden documents. My request for deletion stands; SWANsat is largely one man's dream, will not be built for a large number of reasons not limited to available power/frequencies/distances, and, despite the many claims made by Welty for it, it doesn't exist. Will Welty use the existence of a Wikipedia page on SWANsat as evidence of support for SWANsat? Likely - he'll probably list it as another <a href="http://www.swansat.com/Milestones/" class="external text" title="http://www.swansat.com/Milestones/" rel="nofollow">milestone</a>.</li>

<p><i><b>Dr Wood, I will not ask Huon to identify her/himself! Again, for clarification: I'm not William Welty or Charles Welty. Your barking up the wrong identity tree and you are looking desperate each time you bark, which is frightfully often. Here is a response to Huon's concerns:</b></i></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Reliable Source: Issue#1: "What are the credentials and expertise of the people taking responsibility for a website?"</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>Response:</b> SWANsat is a holder of a satellite licence. William Welty has expertise in this area. He held an FCC satellite licence previously (after a number of transfers, it is now known as Direct TV). SWANsat corporate partners are of impecable note. Please note that (a) Dr Wood does not discredit IOSTAR, Orbital, Sandia Labs - just the licence holder - and (b) that he is not willing to contact Government of Nauru, SWANsat or IOSTAR for confirmation - he just wants to Google the net.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Reliable Source: Issue#2. Surprising or apparently important claims that are not widely known.</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>Response:</b> I think SWANsat might fail this test to some degree - especially in terms of it being widely known. I guess that is what SWANsat Marketing is trying to achieve through the United Nations System &amp; their website. Having said that, here is Dr. Jim Stewart, President of IOSTAR Corp: <a href="http://csmarts.colorado.edu/presentationpages/34_future_of_space/page_01.htm" class="external text" title="http://csmarts.colorado.edu/presentationpages/34_future_of_space/page_01.htm" rel="nofollow">'Revolutionary Space Systems of the Horizon: Disruptive Technologies can Change Industries'</a> and <a href="http://www.sp.nps.navy.mil/trau/thursday.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sp.nps.navy.mil/trau/thursday.html" rel="nofollow">Technology Review and Update</a> (A short course designed for military, government and civilian technical personnel and decision makers interested in refreshing and updating their knowledge in important technical areas). IF SWANsat's partners are connected to the US military establishment, then I guess it makes common sense that its research and development would not be as widely known as Dr Wood would like. For example, we know that the Chairman of IOSTAR has been involved with DARPA projects in the past. This would enhance the source reliability, not diminish it.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Reliable Source: Issue#3. Reports of a statement by someone that seems out of character, embarrassing, controversial, or against an interest they had previously defended.</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>Response:</b> A system that can provide 600 million broadband connections is always going to be controversial. Yet if the power &amp; spectrum problems are dealt with, with (a) an ion-propelled power-plant (ie. not solar panels - with 250,000 - 500,000 watts of power) and (b) 10 GHz of spectrum (3G auctions were in the tens of megahertz), the handset might seem the biggest hurdle - impossible? no, difficult? yes. Dr Wood supports 'elegant' systems like Iridium &amp; Teledesic, yet is now against the architects who designed Iridium &amp; Teledesic. Despite this 'flip-flop', I consider Dr Wood a reliable source, albeit, a little in the dark at this present time.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Reliable Source: Issue #4. Claims not supported or claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community.</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>Response:</b> The licence that SWANsat has involves the W-Band. Dr Wood believes it cannot be used. The Italian Space Agency would beg to differ with him on that - 6 years ago they published this academic report that discusses Project DAVID (Data And Video Interaction Distribution) and the feasibility of using the W-band for broadband telecommunications via satellite.: <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7828/21518/00997394.pdf?arnumber=997394" class="external text" title="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7828/21518/00997394.pdf?arnumber=997394" rel="nofollow">Exploiting the W-Band for High Capacity Satellite Communication</a>.

<li>The public is free to purchase access to the IEEExplore archive. <a href="http://david.eln.uniroma2.it/" class="external text" title="http://david.eln.uniroma2.it/" rel="nofollow">The Project DAVID proposal</a> (then WAVE) hasn't been constructed or launched. As of 2006, the principal authors (who do not speak for the Italian Space Agency, by the way) are still proposing that the properties of the W-band channel first be characterised from low Earth orbit:</li>
</ul>
<center><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1655776" class="external text" title="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1655776" rel="nofollow">Early Experiments with W-Band Satellite Links</a>, Perrotta <i>et al.</i>, IEEE Aerospace conference, 2006.</center>
<ul>
<li>That is, the W-band channel has not yet been used from orbit; its channel characteristics have not yet been measured or understood, and the authors have built up expertise in that area and would still like to pursue that work further with practical tests in orbit. Meanwhile and entirely separately, SWANsat is proposing building a commercial service based around using the not-yet-characterised not-yet-understood W-band with untested technology, and claims that this technology (along with untested unproven unused-in-orbit power technology) will be operational from geostationary orbit only five years from now. That's not what I'd call likely, and not what I'd call a solid workable business case based on items entirely under SWANsat's direct control - especially since SWANsat is said to require ten billion US dollars for construction, itself an unlikely sum, and unlikely to be recouped by <i>any</i> business case. Unlike the DAVID proposal (or even <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teledesic.html" title="Teledesic">Teledesic</a>, which had patents and peer-reviewed papers to build early credibility and state its proposals clearly - Iridium and Teledesic remain elegant in conception from a networking viewpoint), SWANsat does not have its proposals described in academic literature.</li>
<li>Is SWANsat credible and real? Well, there's no available material around on SWANsat to convince anyone of this - saying you've been in the same room as people at a UN ICT summit and that SWANsat is associated with people who may be credible in entirely different spheres of expertise doesn't count; their credibility is not SWANsat's credibility, and it's clearly only SWANsat's credibility I'm questioning. (William Welty's credibility is not in question here: Welty's "PhD" is bogus, from a bogus non-accredited university, and was signed off by the entirely bogus and up-for-deletion <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Missler_bbeb.html" title="Chuck Missler">Chuck Missler</a>.) "Patent holder's credible research is being used?" Where is this "credible research"? Where are these patents?</li>
<li>The real question this discussion is for is: "Is SWANsat real enough to be worthy of mention in Wikipedia?" Claiming SWANsat is in some way associated with other people or organisations and that that makes SWANsat credible by association is not convincing, and not sufficient to answer that question satisfactorily. I can't even find press coverage of SWANsat. The Wikipedia article should not be the first definitive description of SWANsat; encyclopaedias are not meant to be primary sources.</li>
<li>Are you associated with SWANsat? Are you also sending me anonymous feedback via my website? You can say everything here instead.</li>
<li>Most of the links on Welty's <a href="http://www.swansat.com/Milestones/" class="external text" title="http://www.swansat.com/Milestones/" rel="nofollow">milestone</a> page are file: links likely accessible only to Welty when he uses his computer.</li>

<p><b>Thank you Dr Wood for your comments - the ones that stay on track. I will tell you about my interest in SWANsat when you remove your snide comments that YOU wrongly attached to my user id. I'm afraid, however, it's not as conspiratorial as you would hope or imagine.</b></p>
<p><br />
Dr Wood, I am especially glad to to see that your statements have moved from "impossible" and "will never exist" to "unlikely" &amp; W-Band characteristics are "unknown" by one group specializing in W-Band. That is a much better professional/academic position to take, especially as I gather you do not want to know or request the design specifications of the SWANsat:IOSTAR power/communications payloads. (Have you emailed or called them yet?)</p>
<p><br />
<b>re: <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a></b></p>
<p>If the WP Corporate Notabilty test for companies requires (point 1) the publishing of non-trivial independent works, then SWANsat fails this test - just as it fails Point 2 &amp; 3 (stock indices &amp; the like). In a project of this magnitude/notability, multiple groups are assigned responsibilities. SWANsat claims to be responsible for licensing, marketing &amp; financing. If SWANsat is the satellite licence holder with a sovereign state and has orbital slot assignment filings at the UN's ITU and has contractual ties to the space establishment, then <b>its notability is surely confirmed</b>. The likelihood/unlikelihood of financing is in the "Crystal Ball" realm, a realm that Dr Wood objects to. He is happy, however, to refer us to the Wikipedia article of failed venture Teledesic. The example is a lucid/relevant reminder that "success probability" does not fall into the WP:CORP criteria. (It is interesting to see how some academics are very quick to pass judgment on the academic-practitioners - rather than take a more moderate, side-line, 'wait &amp; see' attitude). My point is this: please refer back to point "f" above, regarding WP:CORP <b>admissibility of "exceptional products and services"</b>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SWANsat&amp;oldid=71098037" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SWANsat&amp;oldid=71098037" rel="nofollow">BTW, early editions of the article provided a feasible way to finance the project, but I think Dr Wood deleted it.</a></p>
<p><br />
<b>re:<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a></b></p>
<p>As a pertinent aside, the development of <a href="../../../x/m/a/XMax_5000.html" title="XMax">XMax</a> technology could prove <i>an illustrative precedent in terms of Reliable Sourcing</i>. Many were (and still are) suspect of Xg and its technolgy claims. It was always under wraps, with commercial non-disclosure agreements slapped on everyone involved in the project. The academics were furious they were not allowed to verify it. They didn't believe it could be, so they threw it in the "must be a scam" category. Why? Because they personally couldn't be involved in the buzz. Only one University Professor was chosen to confirm, verify &amp; then publically endorse it. It now is being deployed throughout the US as real VOIP-alternative. One man's "brain-child" ... BINGO ... a new breakthrough. So as we turn to the topic of W-band space communications, we might be looking down the barrel of a similar breakthrough, perhaps with similar commercial sensitivities and Dr Wood voicing the concerns of the 'outsiders'. The brain child of the W-Band technology is obviously <b>not</b> William Welty, but perhaps one or both of the gentlemen introduced below.</p>
<p><br />
Ok, back to the issue. Dr Wood argues that the IEEE article is proof that W-Band LEO communication is in the experiential &amp; premature stage. It mentions that the design parameters of the experient were Commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, with 15-20 watts of power, on a lightweight satellite, in LEO. I just read the article and I really hope that the volunteer Wikipedia administrator does so too. Dr Wood just confirmed that W-Band space communication is likely in the future! Now that Dr Wood has reviewed some of the research that is been conducted, he has changed his expert opinion from NEVER EVER to NOT LIKELY. Facinating! Imagine what Moore's Law and five years could do if academics can change their minds in just a matter of days.</p>
<p><br />
3 claimed aspects of the SWANsat/IOSTAR design parameters that are publically known are (a) 250,000-500,000 watts of power from (b) GEO using (c) the W-Band. To my &amp; Dr Wood's knowledge the SWANsat Satellite has not been tested - no sats have blasted into GEO for testing. I ask, so what? A large piece of vacant land in the CBD/Downtown does not mean that it will remain so in the future. You have the unused land (w-band), you have the building permit (licence), you have world class architects (iostar) &amp; world-class building contractors (Orbital &amp; Sandia). <b>This a serious project.</b></p>
<p><br />
<i>It is also a NON-PROFIT service that if/when switched on, will revolutionarily change the world. It will help world leaders conform their written promises (to their citizens and to the whole world) into a substantial reality. (eg. Millenium Development Goal #2: Universal Primary Education for every child on the planet, by 2015.)</i></p>
<p><br />
Back to the IEEE article. In essence, Dr Wood just gave the whole SWANsat/IOSTAR project additional credibility and provided source reliability by showing that the <i>overall W-band discussion</i> is that: <b>W-Band communication from space will be POSSIBLE</b>. Now, we know that in Dr Wood's view, is that it is UNLIKELY, yet he now acknowledges that it <b>could</b> be possible in the future. I am of the view, based on the public documents that: given more time, with the right design and the right people, it could. Again, I will refer you back to point "f" above, regarding WP:CORP admissibility of "exceptional products and services". It will be carried out by exceptional specialists and leaders in the nuclear and space communication industries. The US Government is a significant stake-holder, providing both capital and labour. They are providing financing of up to $1.5 billion through new legislation (<a href="http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/iostar_rescue.htm" class="external text" title="http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/iostar_rescue.htm" rel="nofollow">see news report</a>) and also providing nuclear scientists at Sandia Labs <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/LN05-28-04/key05-28-04_stories.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/LN05-28-04/key05-28-04_stories.html" rel="nofollow">(see news report)</a>. Someone has to be the first to do it, just like the man on the moon. <i>Despite the NAY-SAYERS, why not let the people in the best position to do it, who believe they can do it, with the licence to do it, AT LEAST attempt to do it</i>. The SWANsat/IOSTAR project is noteworthy and credible. Wikipedia should not delete the article.</p>
<p><br />
Dr Wood admits to the (source?, at least industry) credibility of IOSTAR. <i><b>This is an extremely important fact</b></i> because the most disturbing claim is by <a href="http://csmarts.colorado.edu/presentationpages/34_future_of_space/Slide45.JPG" class="external text" title="http://csmarts.colorado.edu/presentationpages/34_future_of_space/Slide45.JPG" rel="nofollow">IOSTAR President, Dr Jim Stewart</a> himself, when he notes that <b>100Ghz [W-Band] communications from GEO is within IOSTAR's capabilities</b> (see heading). Maybe the details are in HIS text books? Maybe they are military secrets? Maybe they are commercial secrets? Maybe IOSTAR would need to weigh into this discussion with some sort of proof, verification, clarification (a note of recommendation for the volunteer wiki administrator, reviewing this page)</p>

Then finally we come to the discrediting of <b>Chuck Missler:</b> Dr Wood's attempt to discredit <a href="http://www.swansat.com/AboutUs/" class="external text" title="http://www.swansat.com/AboutUs/" rel="nofollow">Chuck Missler</a> flies in the face of his notable background.</p>
<p>During the past 30 years, Chuck has served on the Board of Directors of over a dozen public companies, and was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of five of them. Chuck Missler received a Congressional appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Upon graduating with honors, he received his commission in the U.S. Air Force. By the time he completed his military obligations, he had become Branch Chief of the Department of Guided Missiles at Lowry Air Force Base. Chuck completed a Masters Degree in engineering at UCLA with additional post-graduate studies in applied mathematics, advanced statistics and information sciences, and completed his PhD at Louisiana Baptist University. His civilian career began as a systems engineer at TRW, followed by a Senior Analyst position in a "think tank" serving both the intelligence community and the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Recruited by the Ford Motor Company into a Senior Management position, Chuck established the first international industrial computer network in 1966. Leaving Ford to start his own company, he founded a computer networking organization later acquired by Automatic Data Processing (NYSE) to became its Network Services Division. He subsequently served as a consultant to the Board of Directors of Rockwell International for corporate acquisitions (which included Collins Radio, American Data Systems, and others); and has also participated in over 100 business ventures as a principal, strategic advisor, or turnaround specialist.</p>

Each of these was a troubled turnaround situation. These directorships are only intended to imply participation; not personal credit for the results. Each was a learning experience. In 1989, The Phoenix Group, Inc., Chuck Missler's publicly traded development company, entered into an $8 billion joint venture to supply personal computers to the 143,000 public schools of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Technical Projects Dr. Missler has served as a consultant, principal, or a director, participating in over 100 high technology investments, acquisitions, or divestitures over his 30 year career. Some specific projects have included:</p>
<p>System Engineer, Subsystem I of the SAMOS Program (highly classified reconnaissance satellite program); principal contributor to major developments in the gathering of ELINT (electronic intelligence) information via satellite.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This 30KB discussion is ridiculous. The relevant question is not whether SWANsat will ever work, not even wether it <i>can</i> work at all (see, for example, <a href="../../../h/u/e/Huemul_Project_7be2.html" title="Huemul Project">Huemul Project</a> for a failed project, probably impossible). The question is whether SWANsat is notable by <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">Wikipedia's standards</a> (and to me, a license from <a href="../../../n/a/u/Nauru.html" title="Nauru">Nauru</a> or <a href="../../../t/u/v/Tuvalu.html" title="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a> does not imply notability), and whether we have enough <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article, and that also looks bleak - for example, even searching for "SWANsat" on the Sandia National Laboratories website produced no results.

<li>Wmt, I said: <i>That's not what I'd call likely</i>. In fact, it's what I'd call impossible from SWANsat. No contradiction or change of position there. I did not state that, to quote you, <i>W-Band communication from space will be POSSIBLE</i>. I stated that it hasn't been done. Again, you are attempting to build up SWANsat's credibility by drawing on the credibility of others - SWANsat does not hold the patents others hold. You're also selective with the facts, e.g. <i>In 1989, The Phoenix Group, Inc., Chuck Missler's publicly traded development company, entered into an $8 billion joint venture to supply personal computers to the 143,000 public schools of the Soviet Union.</i> - neglecting to mention that that venture failed, despite the price tag that you're presumably intended to impress people with. Shouldn't your defence of Missler, such as <i>completed his "PhD" at the <b>unaccredited</b> LBU</i>, which you have copied and pasted from <a href="http://www.swansat.com/AboutUs/" class="external free" title="http://www.swansat.com/AboutUs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.swansat.com/AboutUs/</a>, go on the Missler deletion page? <a href="../../../l/l/o/User%7ELloyd_Wood_fca6.html" title="User:Lloyd Wood">Lloyd Wood</a> 08:59, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The power payload via the "IOSTAR:SANDIA" link is established. The communications payload load via the "ORBITAL:IOSTAR" link is obvious (see Dr Stewart's bio). I personally possess SWANsat Satellite blueprints by IOSTAR (the IOSTAR:SWANSAT link). I am unable to redistribute them due to the terms of use from the page from which I obtained them.</p>
<p><br />
Outside of Dr Woods scientific objections, the number of <b>delete</b> votes on this page are consistent &amp; persistent in saying that the IOSTAR:SWANsat link is NOT (a) publicly explicit/verified by IOSTAR and (B) not publicly verified by third party investigations (journalists).</p>
<p><br />
<b>If (a) IOSTAR issues a press release concerning its involvement in the SWANsat Project, as the spacecraft vendor and (b) a number journalists write up the story, the WP article would then meet the stardards of WP:CORP, WP:ORG; WP:V, WP:NOT, WP:RS -- is that correct?</b></p>
<p><br />
The objection pertaining to 'advertising' would still need to be addressed. The "<b>exceptional future product or service</b>" would/could/should eliminate that concern. <i>Reality Check:</i> No-one would ever fund a $10B project because of a Wikipedia page. The global implications of a notable, verified company/project claiming 600 million broadband connections inherently deserves public awareness, observation &amp; scepticism. -- (comment was added by Wmt)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> As noted on the appletalker AFD, you have to make a distinction between an entire article failing V and a part of an article failing V. This article can be heavily cut down by V, that I agree with - but there remains some verifiable information, such as the existence of the site, what it's there for. It's apparently the second biggest mac forum; when it's been heavily strimmed by removal of unverifiable (and arguably useless) information, then it should be considered on its remaining merits. Again I give the example that if some small section of a random major article is unverifiable, the major article should not be outright deleted - but edited to remove the unverifiable information. In this case and the Appletalker case, a lot is cut out, sure. The articles were both written POV and littered gently with groupvanity, and they'll be heavily cut down by V criteria. But the distinction needs to be made between an entire article failing V and parts of an article failing V. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">Firi</a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_Esperanza_4dd7.html" title="User:Firien/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">n</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirien_191d.html" title="User talk:Firien">§</a> 09:18, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>He's right Brian: OR and NPOV aren't designed as grounds for deletion. Note that they're content policies. They <i>can</i> be grounds for deletion but only because of practical considerations, such as when an article would be empty after applying those policies. In fact, the Verifiable policy isn't grounds for deletion either except in the same special case: when the sum total of verifiable information is nothing ("unverifiable"), the article gets deleted. They're non-negotiable, yes, but what they address non-negotiably is <i>what</i> we write about things, not what things we write <i>about</i>. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 20:56, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Already suggested on the discussion page. No response.
<p>BTW, how is Wikipedia to determine whether the information on a trickster figure is accurate and not deliberate misinformation repeated by uncritical hagiographers? Idries Shah's statements about his origins, early years and activities were notoriously inaccurate. He grew up in England from 1927, but allowed his follower Elizabeth Hall to repeat his myth that he first went there in 1960.

<li>The Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK = <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishq.html" title="Ishq">ishq</a>) was set up by Bob Ornstein, Shah's deputy in the USA. Is it surprising that IS was 'accepted as an advisor', or that they invited him to speak there, or that they gave him an 'award' for so doing? This article should be deleted.

<li>For the last time, the place for presenting I. Shah's ideas is on his own page - not in a manufactured POV-fork. On a point of English, 'mentioning' Mueller and Frankl does not amount to 'integrating' them.

<p>When I first saw this article I thought it was for the term "reverse SEO". This didn't hold up as there isn't any article linking to this one, so it isn't enough of a wide spread term to warrant an article. Further, noting the "(C)" behind some references to the name make me think this is actually for the company "<a href="http://www.reverseseo.com" class="external text" title="http://www.reverseseo.com" rel="nofollow">Reverse SEO</a>". Under that banner, I don't believe it meets notability requirements. The <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reverseseo.com%2F&amp;url=reverseseo.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reverseseo.com%2F&amp;url=reverseseo.com" rel="nofollow">alexa rank</a> is so low as to be unrecordable at this time. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuffOfInterest_823e.html" title="User:StuffOfInterest">StuffOfInterest</a> 16:10, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's not that hard. It appears that someone has had the idea of promoting ethical behaviour on World Wide Web sites by coining the term "reverse search engine optimization" to denote doing the reverse of what the search engine optimizers do, with a web site. Given the aforementioned link with a single company, this is probably original research, a new concept being promoted by a single entity that has yet to be acknowledged by others and become a part of the corpus of human knowledge. So notability isn't the issue. Whether and what sources exist for the purported concept is. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:35, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"It is well known that young beavers often fall asleeep while sucking on the mother's teat. This hand reared beaver, Fritz, also liked to fall asleep holding a teat, in this case that of his nursing bottle" Konrad Lorenz et al, The Year of the Greylag Goose, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, NY 1979. Fritz is shown in the photo as sucking itself to sleep on a teat detached from its bottle. Konrad Lorenz was searching for visual mammalian (and human) imprinting but he overlooked the more important function of mammals, many of whom are born blind, to survive by finding and maintaining a physical oral and tactile sense connection to the teat. Human Imprinting should not be deleted from Wikipedia.

<p>The evidence for human imprinting has been circulated for the last two decades and also accepted by one of the world's major universities. An intellectual criticism of it would be appreciated but not just a mindless delete request. Human Imprinting should not be deleted from Wikipedia. Elsie Mobbs</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not a peer review journal. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 11:29, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Human Imprinting", "Mammalian Imprinting" and "teat preference" can be found on Google, Yahoo and MSN searches (other authors use these terms too) and "Human Imprinting" has already been presented in a peer review journal. It was first presented to a Nursing Mothers Assoc of Australia (La Leche League, USA equivalent) meeting in the 1970's with a request that it not be referenced until the peer review journal publication and thesis submission, which eventually took place. "Human Imprinting" is referenced in the leading medical textbook on lactation. It has been presented at a number of medical conferences over the last couple of decades. It is hardly a case of WP:OR or WP:VAIN! Human Imprinting should not be deleted from Wikipedia. I'll be off the internet for a couple of days so I'm looking forward to other discussion contributions when I return. Elsie Mobbs</p>

<p>I think that the article should't be deleted, it is by far one of the best pages in this site. It is well organized and it helps other users that might be interested to see all of the contestants album sales, and might not have time to go article by article looking for contestants album sales. Estraordinary Machine, I never really saw you around before, I've been visiting and contributing to make Wikipedia better, but you keep making it worse, in every other article, you find something and make a dispute over it.

<li><b>Comment on comment</b> Actually, I got it wrong... I think it's actually my father's brother's daughter's husband's brother's wife's <i>brother</i> who is Kid Rock. Hmm... that doesn't sound right either. I know my folks attended the wedding, and the Kid sang a song or two there. I can check with dear ol' Dad to find out the exact relationship again.

<li><b>Keep</b> The funny thing about KushCash and the reason I believe that they should stay in Wikipedia, is that they managed to develop this system in what would be considered light speed (8 months) furthermore as per some information I am getting through the CMO council they have already reached massive numbers for a new tehcnology with rather high learning curve. They are currenlty teaming up with both Boost Mobile, Amp'd mobile and Virgin Mobile in the US. They also just hired Frank Angrissani as CEO (former Sr. VP of Western Union, and Peter Hewitt former GM of Leapfrog, and funny enough former interim CEO and VP of Communications of DialPad (first VOIP company to reach 10 mil users. They are also teaming up with Qualcomm for R&amp;D. I honestly think that they have a real chance of becoming great.

<li><b>Userify</b> (or conditional <b>delete</b> if userify does not happen).

<p>There are a few problems with this article. It is very long, and pretty much unmaintainable (since it's potentially a list of every single person who ever lived or worked in Belgium); it includes contentious criteria (Flemish / Walloon / Belgian); it is a bare list of links; it is doing a job which would be better served (with less miantenance) by the extant category hierarchy; it contains a mix of real and fictional. Other than allowing for people to be claimed as Balgian when their article editors would reject the category, I do not see the purpose here (and I speak as a fan and player of the game <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1038692" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1038692" rel="nofollow">Famous Belgians</a>). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:21, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: while I agree that there are problems with the current form of the list (like the inclusion of fictional characters made by a Belgian), I don't think the list as such is superfluous, as it is a handy tool to see which Belgians have an article (your argument that it is "potentially a list of every single person who ever lived or worked in Belgium" is incorrect, as those people would be deleted immediately as not encyclopedic: it is a list of bluelinks), just like many other lists. Almost every country seems to have one (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_people_by_nationality_ee31.html" title="Category:Lists of people by nationality">Category:Lists of people by nationality</a>), and even though the existence of other articles is usually not an argument to keep one up for AfD, it is an indication that this list is not some anomaly, but a quite regular list. I don't see the contentious criteria Flemish/Walloon you mention, it only speaks about Belgium. Work on better rules, exclude errors and redlinks, but don't delete this list, it perfectly fits <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>, namely the second reason: navigation. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:06, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The argument that "every person from X-group will end up being listed" is usually a red-herring or fallacious. As I recall lists are accepted when they list things important to the topic or where the topic is important to them. A list of people important to Belgium or where being Belgian is important to them will not be a list of every Belgian. It won't even be a list of every Belgian who considers their Belgian identity important as most of those people aren't notable enough to have an article. If the list can be pared down to notable people important to Belgium than it'll be maintainable. IOW fix it, don't kill it.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Comment</b>: No, to the contrary. This list has redlinks (wanted/needed articles), which a category can't have.

<li>The intent in creating this short article is to memorialize a great classical scholar whose work is perhaps less well known among wider audiences but nevertheless highly regarded among experts in Platonic studies. Benardete's seminars were legendary, not only for their "standing-room-only" attendance, but for their protraction (6PM to 8PM sessions would routinely last to 10 or 12 midnight); his courses were attended not merely by undergraduate and graduate students but by professors from local colleges and universities. The author hopes that philosophers will actively edit and amplify this article so that it will accurately reflect in detail the enormous influence Benardete's thought has had on recent philosophy(the author). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Agini191 (<a href="../../../a/g/i/User_talk%7EAgini191_f6cc.html" title="User talk:Agini191">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Agini191_3c80.html" title="Special:Contributions/Agini191">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>This looks like a very, very <b>obvious keep</b>. Clearly a very notable classical scholar. Add an {{unreferenced}} tag and give it some time.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is a very widespread game and yes, it is called <i><b>Penny Hockey</b></i> in Canada, so that should be added.

<li><b>Comment</b> - At my school we always called it "Quarter Hockey" (not from Canada btw).

<li>I'm the one who started those pages. The big problem with this whole thing is the main article was being cluttered with descriptions which weren't even completely accurate (and in some cases, downright false). Some of the characters, such as Ciara here, are certainly less significant - but it would be inconsistant to make pages for some characters and not others. Maybe a better solution would be to make the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bratz_characters_634c.html" title="List of Bratz characters">List of Bratz characters</a>? I've seen similar character list pages in regards to other topics. It would allow more information space (and subsequently more accuracy) per character, while keeping the clutter out of the main article. What do you guys think? <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcy_d279.html" title="User:Alcy">Alcy</a> 00:14, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to admit, I'm unfamiliar with this area, but I'm not sure why a simple list of the characters' major features couldn't be squeezed back into the main <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratz.html" title="Bratz">Bratz</a> article; a lot of the material in the subpages (eg which characters could swap shoes) seems to me to be essentially unimportant for an encyclopedia, and the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratz.html" title="Bratz">Bratz</a> article itself might benefit from a bit of a prune to focus on the cultural/societal significance of the dolls rather than just facts about their characteristics. Someone familiar with the area could patrol the resulting section to make sure it remained accurate. However, one big list containing all the characters would certainly seem preferable to the current plethora of mini-articles. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 00:35, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are so many names that it might be beneficial to move them all to a separate page anyway. The main article is just getting so long. Yeah, it probably isn't necessary to have every edition listed, and I'm surprised someone added in the official character biographies. I don't know though, I think the shoe information is pretty useful. Since the dolls don't have feet (besides snap-on pairs), if a shoe is lost, the doll is missing a foot. These listings could be helpful to kids or casual collectors who might only have one doll and be unsure what shoes will match. At any rate, I think descriptions of each character (not too extensive, but long enough to include some detail and allow for a mention of variations) is a good idea - people might look to Wikipedia when they want help identifying what they have. It might even work in the main article with a simple format change (make it more like the character list on the Nana page, for example). Right now, it's really disorganized.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcy_d279.html" title="User:Alcy">Alcy</a> 01:18, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Such information seems more interesting to a general audience, but would still seem to me to fit better within the main article to allow casual readers, who probably wouldn't think to look up the individual dolls' names, easy access to the controversial information. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 00:59, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>I think there is a real divergence of viewpoints here about the purpose of lists.</i> Agreed, I see this happen all the time with list AfDs. In the case of the <i>two</i> lists involved here (as this is the same as the aforementioned other AfD), most of the groups featured actually warrant their own articles. Yes, the list is fairly raw, but I see nothing which intrinsically prevents it from being enhanced. A notariety requirement, as foul as notariety is as a concept, is a much-needed addition. These are not "List of cool websites", these are "List of established organisations", many of which are national bodies deserving of their own articles (and indeed have them, but are often not linked). <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 11:45, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd normally have just speedied this, but it was already a disputed prod.

<dd>Admittedly I'm not up on what wiktionary likes, but it doesn't seem like a good dictionary entry to me. You can put "quasi" in front of many many words, and surely the resultant words do not usually need their own dictionary entry.

<p>Vanity page about an academic, full of stuff like "Cohen describes herself as "math prof / mathematician / poet / writer / classical pianist /thrift-shopper / mother / grandmother / scrabbler extraordinaire".
