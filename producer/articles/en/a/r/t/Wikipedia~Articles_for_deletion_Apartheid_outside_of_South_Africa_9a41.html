It was orphaned (ie nothing linked to it). I deleted it because of that a few weeks ago. It has just been recreated today and a merge tag put on it calling for it to be merged with <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> in an attempt to bury that article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa&amp;diff=57017395&amp;oldid=55678416" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa&amp;diff=57017395&amp;oldid=55678416" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <b>Delete</b> or, failing that,<b>merge/redirect</b> with <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a> which should be easy enough to do since the article's a duplicate.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Racial segregation and Apartheid are not identical concepts; Homey has no problem with creating (and defending) articles on <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>, Sexual Apartheid, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_Apartheid_8516.html" title="Gender Apartheid">Gender Apartheid</a>, and even <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">Apartheid (disambiguation)</a>, and strongly objects to any of them being merged anywhere, but when it comes to this article he suddenly (and rather inconsistently) needs to have it deleted. He has actually deleted this article once already, using the rather bizarre claim that "orphaned re-directs should be deleted", when, in fact, the opposite is true - ideally all re-directs <i>should</i> be "orphaned", to avoid straining the servers. Now he is simply trying to avoid having <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> merged into this article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:16, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>so Jay, why did you support the dismemberment of this article way back in November 2005<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa&amp;diff=29151999&amp;oldid=28980586" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa&amp;diff=29151999&amp;oldid=28980586" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, a dismembersment that came to fruition last February? Why did you only recreate this article the day after the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> AFD failed?Homey 22:24, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, if articles on pejorative POV political terms are going to exist on Wikipedia, then they really should be presented in an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> way and <b>context</b>, don't you think? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:30, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You didn't answer the question Jay. Why did you support and help facilitate the dismemberment of the article last November to February?Homey 22:38, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I didn't dismember the article, I NPOVd it, removing a bunch of nonsense unrelated to Apartheid. And your question has been answered; if you have any more comments, please put them on the Talk: page. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:40, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You called for the article to be merged to other articles and left as a redirect. You didn't remove a bunch of nonsense unrelated to apartheid, you helped remove the <i>entire</i> article, particularly any reference in it to Israel. Why do you suddenly want to put Israel back into the article now when you supported removing it just a few months ago?Homey 22:44, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I really wish you would read the previous comments; as I said above if Wikipedia *must* have articles on pejorative POV political epithets (which, of course, it really shouldn't), then they at least should be presented in an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> way and <b>context</b>. Tendentious asking of questions which have been answered doesn't help Homey; please, at least, restrict it to the Talk: page - I won't be answering here again. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:50, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's because you are answering a question I didn't ask and not answering the question I did ask. <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> can be an NPOV article. There's no reason to recreate an article that's already been merged with <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a> for the sole purpose of subsuming Israeli apartheid into it. What you haven't answered is why you suddenly want to recreate Apartheid outside of South Africa the day after the Israeli apartheid AFD failed? Homey 22:55, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Homey's reasons for this afd are extremely suspect, especially considering his crusade to keep the Israeli apartheid article. In fact Homey created half a dozen ridiculous articles ending in "apartheid" all of which were about terms that didn't actually exist, just so that he could make a pov disambigiation page. Now he wants to delete the only article that really makes sense to keep. This demonstrates a level of hypocrisy that I thought was actually fatal.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 22:31, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think the point of the nomination is that this article was previously merged into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">Racial segregation</a> and replaced with a redirect. The article <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (phrase)">Israeli apartheid (phrase)</a> (now <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28epithet%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (epithet)">Israeli apartheid (epithet)</a> has just survived AFD and this article was recreated in the mean time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa&amp;diff=57017395&amp;oldid=55678078" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa&amp;diff=57017395&amp;oldid=55678078" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and a suggestion made to merge it with <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28epithet%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (epithet)">Israeli apartheid (epithet)</a>). So the motivation behind the AFD would seem to be as stated, that the article is a duplication of another one, and that merging with <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28epithet%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (epithet)">Israeli apartheid (epithet)</a> isn't appropriate. On the other hand, retitling it to be about the use of apartheid as an epithet, and sourcing it properly so it is about that, and not about racial segregation in general, could make sense.

<p><b>RENAME OR DELETE</b> It seems more sensible to name this article <b>Apartheid(political epithet)</b> and place a disambiguation page in apartheid. Then every bombastic statement used to malign different cultures, countries, religions Serengetti tribes etc. can be placed in this article. The entire idea of apartheid outside South Africa sounds ridiculous. What other country inscribes the legal seperation of one ethnicity from another based on genetics and ties those people not fit, (based on some arbitrary norm of purity) to legally work as manorial servants? Unless South Africa Jr. suddenly rises up, labelling other countries as having apartheid systems is a form of slander or political epithet, and this article or its name has no reason to exist for that reason. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Montag_3a27.html" title="User:Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a> 20:01, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So there's no problem with "epithet", because outside of the South African context, the word "apartheid" is being used in a defamatory and abusive manner. Do you think the people who talk about "Israeli apartheid" are trying to <i>praise</i> Israel? Are the people who talk about "sexual apartheid" trying to praise those who believe gay people should be kept apart and discriminated against? "Apartheid" as used in this way <i>is</i> a term of abuse, so "epithet" is correct and non-POV. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 00:18, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's your POV. There are some who refer to Israel as an "apartheid state" or as being in danger of becoming an "apartheid state" as part of an analytical comparision between Israel and apartheid South Africa. They may be incorrect in their analysis but its not for us to impugn their motives. I doubt most people would think Desmond Tutu applied the term apartheid to Israel because he intended to be abusive.Homey 00:25, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually Homey, I agree with your last sentence. In <a href="http://www.merip.org/newspaper_opeds/Tutu_IU_Israeli_Apartheid.html" class="external text" title="http://www.merip.org/newspaper_opeds/Tutu_IU_Israeli_Apartheid.html" rel="nofollow">one of the "Israeli Apartheid" articles attributed to Archbishop Tutu</a>, his tone is compassionate and constructive. If one reads the article carefully, the first parallel he draws is between the *struggle against* South African apartheid and the *struggle against* the Israeli occupation. In the fourth paragraph he starts to compare the suffering of Palestinians to that experienced by South African Blacks. My reading of it is that his analogy between apartheid and the occupation has as much to do with his faith in the techniques for ending it as it does with criticizing Israel's practices (which, no doubt, he does criticize!).</dd>

<dd>And BTW, I'm not entirely convinced that Desmond Tutu would approve of "Israeli Aparatheid" used as the title of an article on Wikipedia. First, the people who write articles are not usually the ones who write the headlines, so he might not even have used the term. He does compare Israeli practices to apartheid, using the term "apartheid," but (please correct me if I'm wrong) he does not call Israel an "apartheid state." Second, newspaper article titles tend to be written to grab attention so they can compete with the "Jen &amp; Vince keep 'em guessing!" headlines. Wikipedia articles have almost comically utilitarian names like "Trade and Usage of Saffron." What's par for the course in a newspaper headline could be inappropriate in a different context. Like Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/u/-/User%7ESu-laine.yeo_5d6d.html" title="User:Su-laine.yeo">Su-laine.yeo</a> 05:58, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well obviously I can't speak for Tutu's views on wikipedia&#160;;-) but he did write another article in the nation <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020715/tutu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020715/tutu" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> entitled 'Against Israeli Apartheid'. I'm not convinced that the Nation or the Guardian tend to have Jen and Vince headlines (you know I actually had to look up to see who they were, how sad am I?), and certainly not on opinion pieces. --Coroebus 09:48, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Coroebus, I think your comments about sensationalism in headlines are fair, although I still don't think "Israeli apartheid" is an appropriate encyclopedia title.

<p>Neither motive nor their characterization, or analysis have anything to do with the fact that it is an epithet. The term apartheid is political and abusive because the term has powerful negative connotations associated with a past system of injustice that everyone is familiar with. When you label someone a "Nazi" it is to demonize that individual by drawing upon the negative connotations of Nazism.</p>
<p>Catagorizing a state or system as an "apartheid state", without it actually being lawfully entrenched apartheid as recognized by international law, gains an audience because of the inflammatory nature of the word. But then offering colloquial or anecdotal evidence is not objective research and wholly manipulative.</p>
<p>It is abusive, it manipulates and maligns by drawing upon an imagined system in one place and stealing the momentum of a successful organized movement that was once against apartheid and hijacking it to the political agendas of those who oppose another state or society. Using vague associations between their target states, these individuals attempt to gain the same legitimacy as the anti apartheid movement, by coopting their agenda through sophistry into what was an existing successful one. It is easier to organize a movement when the groundwork has already been laid down and the inferstructure is there, but the goal has been achieved or is obsolete. Hence, its a propaganda tool to malign and forward a political agenda through negative past association.</p>

<dd>I agree with what Guy said, and written very well I might add. Or, in my own words (written before I saw Guy's) the term "apartheid" in the modern day is used as a pejorative, in a derogatory, defamatory, abusive way (even if, in a particular case, I might think the users of the term are correct), in virtually all cases. The only people I know of who ever used "Apartheid" in a positive sense were the Apartheid-era governments of South Africa (and maybe Rhodesia, or maybe it was called something else there), who decided to call their racial policy "apartheid," and the supporters of that policy of South Africa. Today it is understood to be a bad thing, hence "epithet" is a correct description and non-POV. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 02:39, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep Until</b> either a mediator or the arbitration committee can get this mess straightened out. As others have pointed out, this AfD is part of a much larger disagreement involving several articles.</p>
<ol>
<li>I think that allegations of "apartheid" applied to any country other than South Africa should be discussed only in the context of broader, neutrally-titled articles about that country.</li>
<li>However, I feel even more strongly that if the community accepts having an article specifically about allegations of apartheid in country X (other than South Africa), then it should allow the same for all other countries.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are trying to deal with issues #1 and #2 in no particular order, and one AfD at a time. It's not working. It feels like playing chess with the board broken up and the pieces in different rooms.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen long pages of Talk and AfD discussions for the various related articles, some of which are alleged to have been tampered with. There is a long trail of page renames and redirects, and allegations of all kinds of seriously bad wiki-behaviour. We have multi-day page protections with no end in sight, bans, blocks, and AfD discussions that end in no consensus. Desmond Tutu's name has being brought into the fray; thank God nobody's brought up Mother Teresa yet. Understanding all of this would require stretching out a very long piece of paper on the floor and drawing a detailed timeline. Mere mortals like myself don't have the combination of time and wikiwisdom to do that. <a href="../../../s/u/-/User%7ESu-laine.yeo_5d6d.html" title="User:Su-laine.yeo">Su-laine.yeo</a> 01:50, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Su-laine's comment is a perfect description of how I feel about this as well. It is so confusing. I love this line, it is so true: "It feels like playing chess with the board broken up and the pieces in different rooms." That is perfect. Using (or abusing) the same analogy, I feel like I keep making moves but they don't get me anywhere because after each move, suddenly it's a different game at a different table and nobody can see what happened before.
