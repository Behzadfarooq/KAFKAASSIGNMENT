<p>History: Born July 22, 1991 in Stintson Lake, New Hampshire; Dylan had a troubling childhood. His father (Dana Kendrick) was an alcoholic and his mother (Teresa Lorenco) left Dana with 1 year old Dylan to live with her mother. Teresa moved around alot and eventually ended up in Burlington, Vermont where she met Tim Elliott. Tim was her boss for a short period of time whem they both worked at a local produce store. Teresa and Tim were married a couple of years later and Tim addopted Dylan and his name was changed to Dylan Peter Lorenco Elliott, the name he still keeps today. Around this time, when Dylan was 5 he recieved his first guitar. A year later Teresa gave birth to Forest Peter Lorenco Elliott. Dylan witnessed his birth an to this day they still share an eternal bond. When Dylan was 9 Teresa and Tim divorced. This devastated Dylan and he quit guitar for a short period of time. Around this time Dylan discovered Heavy Metal and fell in love instantly. Currently, because of depression problems he is troubled with school work but has stuck with guitar as well as learning nine other instruments.</p>
<p>Style: Although his true passion lies in Heavy Metal, Dylan plays a mix of what he calls GarciaIommiPage. He says his style is much like Jerry Garcia's with the tone and sound Toni Iommi but the (what he calls) sweet sloppiness of Jimmy Page.</p>
<p>Gear: He mainly uses his Jorma Kaukonen epiphone signature guitar but also plays with a PRS Santana and a Gibson SG. His main amplifier is a Peavey Classic 50 tube amp, and he uses a wide range of effects from a Boss Distortion pedal to a Digitech effects board. His favorit pedal is the Boss distortion but he mostly uses his VOX wah-wah.</p>
<p>Influences: Dylan's influences are always changing but his favorite band of all time is Led Zeppelin. He mostly listens to metal bands such as DragonForce or Dream Theater but he loves most music; his range of musical tastes is from Joni Mitchell to Metallica but he despises Rap and other modern music. When writing songs he tries to emulate the sounds of Jeff Buckley.</p>

<p>KDE - <b>Kase Documentation Engine</b> Developed by Daniel Joseph (Accenture India Pvt Ltd) Release Date : June 2004</p>
<p>The KDE was developed as a part of a Six Sigma Project aimed at handle time improvement in Accenture.</p>
<p>During the “Analyze” phase of the project it was established that 25% of the handle time of a call was being spent on case documentation.</p>
<p>A need was experienced for a tool that would help us in cutting down on the time spent in documentation at the same time adding on to the accuracy of diagnosing and troubleshooting</p>
<p><b>Salient Features</b> The major aim was to decrease the AHT of calls by decreasing case note documentation time and time taken to diagnose and troubleshoot a customer’s issue. This was achieved by integrating the most frequently used features on one single platform.</p>
<p>The Kase Documentation Engine (KDE) was designed to Reduce call handling time Standardize documentation Improve resolution and Provides for a backend database to help in analysis (e.g. steps completed vs. Handle time / FCR etc.) The KDE was created with in-built diagnostic, troubleshooting steps and case documentation of frequently occurring call types, so that it can be standardized and copy-pasted into the client page.</p>

<p>The HiPaCC, or High Protein and Cycled Carbohydrate diet, uses extensive evolutionary arguments and scientific literature to justify a high dietary carbohydrate intake, and shows how such high dietary carbohydrate intakes may be used effectively in weight loss.</p>
<p>The HiPaCC diet program was specially formulated in 2005/6 to overcome the failings of nutritionally imbalanced high protein, low carbohydrate diets, and is founded upon the essential principles of good nutrition.</p>
<p>The recent failure of the low carb diet as a healthy and sustainable means of weight loss has been highlighted by the media and the medical press. In contrast, HiPaCC provides a safe, affordable, balanced, natural and effective means of losing excess fat stores quickly. Rather than simply limiting calories the HiPaCC diet uses natural means such as green tea and mild exercise to increase caloric expenditure by promoting the metabolism.</p>
<p>Key to the success of the HiPaCC diet is the revolutionary concept of glycogen cycling. Although much maligned, carbohydrates are an essential component of a balanced and healthy diet, and the association between carbohydrates, diabetes and obesity has more to do with the imbalance of the Western diet than it does with its high dietary carbohydrate intake. The HiPaCC diet is based upon recent advances in appetite and nutrition and further information may be found at <a href="http://www.hipacc.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hipacc.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Ryan Siu was born on the 9th of October, 1983 in Corby, England.</p>
<p>He started his ice hockey career in Division 3 of the South China Ice Hockey League (SCIHL) (run by Asiasports) with Bud Gold the 1999-2000 Season. Siu recorded 6 goals and 3 assists in 4 games for his rookie season, and the team lost in overtime in the finals. The following season he joined Wellcome (sponsored by the Hong Kong supermarket of the same name) of Division 3, and was named captain of the squad. The team had a rough time in the regular season finishing in last place. Siu finished his sophomore season 9th in overall regular season scoring (10 goals, 4 assists, 14 points in 15 games played) and was named League MVP. However the playoffs were a different story, as Wellcome defeated the Season champions (Quamnet) and defeated Watsons Water 9-3 en route to the finals to face Dragon Centre. Dragon Centre started the game strong scoring three quick goals in the opening minutes, and eventually went on to lose the game 4-3.</p>
<p>In the summer season Ryan formed the Ice Flyers, which was mainly made up of players from the old Wellcome team as well as a few new additions. This team joined the Hong Kong Amateur Hockey Association (HKAHA). The Ice Flyers dominated this league, winning the season convincingly. The Finals were a best of three sieres played against the runners up of the league, the Black Knights. With the first game of the series tied 1-1, Ryan scored the gamewinning goal with 1 minute 11 seconds to go in the game to give the Ice Flyers a 1-0 lead in the series. In Game 2, Ryan again scored the winning goal, this time with 10 mintues left in the game, and the Ice Flyers managed to hold on to a 3-2 lead and win their first Championship. That season Ryan was named League MVP, Playoff MVP and name to the First Team All Stars.</p>
<p>The Ice Flyers continued to play in the HKAHA Winter 2001-02 Season while Ryan left for University in Cardiff. He played one season with the Junior Cardiff Devils under 19's B team. Ryan occasionally came back to Hong Kong to play some games for the Ice Flyers who failed to win the league, however defeated IceWolves in the playoff final without the help of Siu.</p>
<p>Siu returned to Hong Kong for the Summer 2002 season, where the Ice Flyers joined the Asiasports Division 2 Summer League. The Ice Flyers again dominated the regular season and playoffs, defeating Outback in the playoff final to earn their third straight championship title.</p>
<p>After leaving Cardiff University, Siu went to the University of Birmingham to do a Masters, where he joined the Birmingham Eagles A team who compete in Division 1 of the British Universities Ice Hockey Association. He scored two goals in his debut against Cambridge University who they defeated 10-0.</p>
<p>Siu also played for the Hong Kong Typhoons in the Hockey Fives an Annual International Tournament, from 1997 - 2001.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-09_55a1.html" title="Edit section: Paul Chai">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Paul Chai</span></h2>
<p>Paul Chai #9, was born on the 11th of July, 1984 in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>He started his ice hockey career with team Wellcome (sponsored by the Hong Kong supermarket of the same name) of the South China Ice Hockey League (SCIHL) in the 2000-2001 season. He finished his rookie season 12th in overall regular season scoring (10 goals, 1 assist, 11 points in 15 games played) while finishing in second place for playoff scoring (7g-1a-8pts 4GP). Wellcome finished last in the regular season, but made the SCIHL finals in a Cinderella run, but fell just short losing in the final to Watsons.</p>
<p>At the end of the 2001 season, Chai and fellow teammates Jonathan Kwan and Ryan Siu formed a team named IceFlyers in a breakaway league, the Hong Kong Amateur Hockey Association (HKAHA). Chai was named as an one of the two assistant captains of the team. IceFlyers dominated the summer season of 2001 winning both the regular season championship and the playoffs. In his sophomore year, Chai led the league in scoring in both the regular season (12g-5a-17pts 8GP) and the playoffs (2g-1a-3pts 2GP) and was named regular season MVP, as well as earning first line all-star honours and the scoring title.</p>
<p>The next season Chai played in was the HKAHA winter season 2001-2002. He was named as captain of this team, as previous team captain Ryan Siu left the team. Chai led the team to 2nd place during the regular season and the overall championship after defeating IceWoves in the playoff finals. He scored the overtime game winning goal in the championship game. He ended up finishing the season 1st in league scoring (33g-9a-42pts 16GP) as well as first in playoff scoring (7g-2a-9pts 3GP). He finished the season as the regular season MVP, playoff MVP as well as winning the scoring title. During this season he was also asked to play for SCIHL Division 2 team Tat Lee as a free agent where he picked up an assist in his only game.</p>
<p>In 2002, Chai also participated in the International Hockey Fives (an under 20 tournament), and played for the Hong Kong All Stars. He played 2 games scoring 2 goals, including the game winning goal against rival Hong Kong team HK Typhoons.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2002, IceFlyers rejoined the SCIHL and won the league and playoff championsips, making it 3 major championship titles in a row. He played, captained (Team Green) and scored in the mid season All-Star game. Chai finished the season 3rd in regular season scoring (13g-3a-16pts 9GP), as well as 1st in playoff scoring (5g-2a-7pts 2GP). He was named the playoff MVP, again scoring the championship winning goal.</p>
<p>After a 2 year hiatus from hockey, Chai returned to play 2 games in 2005 for the Pandas of the HKAHA, scoring 2 goals.</p>
<p>Chai is currently sitting 5th in overall scoring in the history of the HKAHA (now named the HKAHC), despite playing 30 games less than most of the other players. He has the best point per game average in the history of the league, and is tied for 2nd in all time goal scoring.</p>
<p>Paul Chai has worn #9 throughout his hockey career. He currently has a 25 game scoring streak that has yet to be broken.</p>

<p>[[Joe Carran was born in 1936. His dominance in the accounting profession could have been predicted because of his boyhood friendship with Sammy Sells, Larry Lybrand, and Ernie Ernst. “It was an exciting time in the history of Accounting” recalls Ernie. While the entire world was debating the merits of “double entry vs. single entry” accounting, Joe was all alone in his fervent advocacy of the “triple entry” system.</p>
<p>Undaunted by the world’s distain for his accounting system, Joe remained unapologetic. When Joe’s first accounting professor (Author Anderson) noted that with the triple entry system, the books are always out of balance, his answer was “That’s the beauty of it – those pinheads at the IRS and the SEC are so confused that it makes an audit impossible.”</p>
<p>After receiving his PHD in Accountancy, Dr. Carran formed the accounting firm of Carran, Sells, Lybrand, and Ernst with his boyhood friends who had been spending most of their time in various detention homes. After years of internal bickering over Joe’s triple entry system, the Firm broke up. Sammy Sells teamed up the Danny Deloitte and Harry Haskins to form a small firm. Larry Lybrand formed a firm with Carl Coopers. Ernie Ernst and his brother Earl then started their own family accounting firm.</p>
<p>Joe recalled the firm’s breakup as the best day of his life declaring at the time “Those guys have no chance without me!” Disgraced by his profession, Joe started the accounting department at Northerly University. After Northerly lost its accreditation, Joe was “allowed” to retire. His parting words were “The world just doesn’t appreciate the obvious merits of my system – they keep whining about that out of balance thing”. Rumor has it that he is living a peaceful life somewhere in the Leeward Islands. Authorities have been searching for his whereabouts for years.]]</p>

<p>Kamen Rider Lance appears in the movie Kamen Rider Blade: Missing Ace. His secret identity is Magaki Shin, who was fired from a restaurant job and subsequently taken under Shimura Junichi(<a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamen_Rider_Glaive_abc9.html" title="Kamen Rider Glaive">Kamen Rider Glaive</a>)'s wing after a fateful encounter with the Peacock Undead. He transforms using the Category Ace card Change Kerberos (green). His weapon is the Lance Rouzer, a polearm similar to Leangle's. With the Mighty Impact card, he can charge the tip of the weapon to deal a finishing blow.</p>
<p>Originally working with fellow riders Glaive and L'Arc, he shared an arrogance toward the previous riders, which they considered relics of the past. Tachibana Sakuya employed the new riders on a number of missions against the resurgence of Undeads which were unsealed by the Albino Joker Undead. Soon, riders old and new began a shortlived competition for the Category King cards, which the Albino Joker sought in order to use the ancient relic that was to give great power to the winner of the Battle Royale. After defeating the Tarantula Undead he was killed by Albino Joker, but not before leaving the Jack of Clubs as a clue to his assailant's true identity.</p>
