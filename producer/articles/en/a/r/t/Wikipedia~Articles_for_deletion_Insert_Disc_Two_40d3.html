<li><b>Keep</b>. The show was actually started in mid 2004 and has a moderately small but growing following. The article was written by a fan, and not by the creators, and therefore was not created with the intent to promote the site. Google returns more hits when you don't type in the actor's name, (although they are harder to find due to the phrase being used in a lot of Easter egg and video game sites) since most mentions of the site are quotes from the show and not about the actual performers.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I respectfully disagree with the idea that this page deserves deletion under either charge of vanity or advertising. No attempt is made to sway the reader to visiting the creators' website (ie. advertising) and it takes a neutral stance on the content. If the article had proclaimed: "Insert Disc Two is a hilarious, brilliant take on comedy", yes, that would be biased and grounds for deletion. But this article is not simply a commercial. In all fairness, the article briefly explains what the show is and simply tells of its history and influences. In short, it provides those curious about the show information to better understand it, which is what a good encyclopedia entry is supposed to do. <tt>arthur42</tt><tt>(talk)</tt> 15:04, 23 July 2005 (CDT)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Saying that the votes of people with a so called "vendetta" against your site is not too terribly different than how the owners are more likely than not furiously messaging all their friends on AIM to support the entry. Like it or not, insert disc two is nothing more than a website visited by the owners and their immediate friends - the guestbook only has six entries to it since april. If the site was even remotely popular it would certainly have more than this. Additionally, I might add that my own site (the one referenced in the Amendemnt above) is FAR MORE POPULAR than Insert Disc Two (avg 500-1k visitors a day when i sit around and do nothing), but an article made totally without my knowledge was deleted in accordance with Wikipedia policy, and, well, I agree that it should have been deleted.

<li>I didn't realize that was your special code. I just copied the sig of the first person I saw and changed the relavent information. My apologies again. I promise I have not been up to any foul play, I was just trying to organize the page. My OCD I guess. I have not forged any votes, and whatever vandalism happened here, I was not involved in it. If the page is deleted, so be it, I respect the whatever decision Wikipedia makes. However please know that the site has been dealing with vandals for months and they have posted an entire thread on their forums dedicated to vandalizing our Wikipedia page. This has gotten much messier than it should have. I promise not to make any other alterations in formatting. Hopefully the voting can continue in a mature, civilized, and TRUTHFUL manner. Thank you.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "just that the page exists is advertising." Then by that logic, with all due respect, so is every other article on this website. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be funny, I'm just having trouble seeing the argument there. Merely documenting something, ie. this show, isn't advertising. The only argument that seems to be sproating here is that because the show isn't well known, any sort of referencing of it here would be a means to increase attention, and thus its advertising. In that case, their only crime is not being well-known enough, which is no grounds for deletion in my opinion. <tt>arthur42</tt><tt>(talk)</tt> 15:04, 23 July 2005 (CDT)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Your site recently deleted an entry for another online television series, one that had a rapidly growing following. When that series originally came out, Scott Kurtz of PVP put the link on his site causing a massive increase in popularity. That series had not only Kurtz as a fan, but also a prolific Hollywood producer. In the case of that series, the creators did not make the page, nor did they modify it ever. The fact is the Internet is the new big entertainment medium. An article written by someone who has never met the creators but merely talked to them online is the same as an article written by someone who has never met a celebrity; merely had their fan mail answered. If this is advertising, any page on very minor celebrities can probably also be considered advertising.

<dd>I did not say they were celebrities.

Maybe O'Brien is much more prolific than the folks at ID2, but it doesn't make the page his fan started any less of advertising than the page ID2's fan started.

<p>The idea that the site is visited only by people who "talk to the creators online" is completely made up. The creators of the show have, yes, talked to people online who have visited the forums on the site. However, only ONE PERSON knew them PRIOR TO viewing the show. Commenting is fine, but please at least assure that your comments are truthful.</p>
<p>Also, I have not forged any votes. I noticed that one person did not sign his vote. He didn't know the format to use, so I said I could just fix it for him, and I guess I got the username he gave me (JohnnyLawRoutine) wrong.

Ian was simply saying there's a lot of stuff on Wikipedia that very few people care about to look up, so that shouldn't be grounds for deletion. I believe Ian's point was that Wikipedia should contain information on anything that is in the public eye, just in case people want to look it up, and the statement that "nobody cares about this" is not a strong argument.

<li>But is is difficult, however, to consider this show "not-notable" when there is obviously a strong following supporting it. Granted, it may not be a large or widespread community, but this show obviously has a niche following which its creators received as a result of performing both live as well as online. The fact that many of the show's fans, including the one who authored the page, have come out so strongly to support this article seems to indicate that it is notable, at least in the eyes of its growing fanbase.<tt>arthur42</tt><tt>(talk)</tt> 18:34, 25 July 2005 (CDT)</li>

"Besides, if it's that popular. How come the website only has 1905 hits?" I think I should probably clarify an earlier comment of mine before it causes further confusion. I defended the show as having a "strong" following. By that, I meant "devoted," as opposed to "large" or "widely popular." My mistake. On a seperate note, perhaps a possible solution would be a compromise. That is, to have the article's author/authors edit the site so it feels more in line with Wikipedia policy and less as a vanity or advertising page, since so many people here seem to feel that it is. Just a thought. <tt>arthur42</tt><tt>(talk)</tt> 13:04, 26 July 2005 (CDT)</p>

<dd>I've watched some of the videos and I actually think it's quite funny. You may well have a strong cult following. BUT, I'm sorry, it (IMO) is not currently notable enough for an entry in an encyclopedia. Try again when ID2 has gained wider recognition.</dd>
<dd>Also, I took a look around and I can't see any votes that just say "Advertising". Some say "nn advertising" or "vanity, advertising". This doesn't mean the article is written in a POV way. It means that the voter doesn't consider the subject notable enough for an article. Thus the existence of the article itself may be considered advertising or ego-stroking.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable. Show is very new and does not appear to have had any influence outside of its extremely limited fanbase. At the moment, the number one result for a Google search on "Insert Disc Two" (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Insert+Disc+Two%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Insert+Disc+Two%22" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) is this vote for deletion page--beating out the official website. While that is probably only the result of fans and foes of the show link-spamming to attract votes, the fact that a VFD page was able to exceed the Google ranking of the show's official website in such a short time is, in my view, a fairly clear indicator of its lack of notability. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 04:50, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
