<li><b>Comment</b>. This is an interesting case of <i>literarism</i>. The process is as follow: in order to <i>clarify</i> a smoky pseudo-theory, establish a comparison with some scientific findings/theory/words. But... one can clarify something only if what is used in the comparison, is clear to all. In that case, the string and super-string astrophysical theory, is likely to be totally unknown by the author as well as audience.

<li>Dear Wiki contributors, admins &amp; sysops. <b>You have been mislead by Curps</b>. Please see that article in question and decide for yourselves if deletion is a correct Wiki thing to do. I have decided not to pursue the re-naming of Curps's article <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_c3f4.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> and through consultation with other helpful Wikis, I have decided to start a series of Asian Tsunami articles on my own ... there is freedom to initiate such a move right&#160;? The articles in questions is proposed to drill deep in the subject in question. In Asian tsunami : The earthquake I have attempted to focus just on the earthquake that caused the Asian Tsunamis. In <a href="../../../t/i/m/Asian_tsunami_%7E_Time-line_cce4.html" title="Asian tsunami : Time-line">Asian tsunami : Time-line</a> (currently vandalised by Curps), I have drilled down to the exact minutes to minutes account of the waves of deadly tsunamis. I will be added other article in the Asian tsunami series like the humanitarian aspects, current news &amp; occurrences etc. because I think it is the right thing to do. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 06:55, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Curps, you definition of spamming is grossly questionable. To 'spam' (by Wiki definition) is to broadcast unsolicited messages. My messages, on the contrary, to every contributors of this vote, is a communique rather than a spam. Your other accusation of me spamming your articles are also not acceptable. When I posted "asiantsuani.org" (a forum site for relief work) to the specific relevant sections (perfectly OK because you have other forums &amp; blogs there too) you deliberately deleted my entries and launched unwarranted accusations at me for spamming ... is that the right thing to do, Curps&#160;?? I have left the deletes as it is because if the originator of the article does not appreciate the particular contributions (though very relevant by me), I will never force it on him. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 07:39, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comments on Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</b> Hi all, I have listened to BanyanTree's advised &amp; visited <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> ... found out some interesting pointers to share with you.</p>
<p><b>Key policies</b> 1) Avoid bias. Articles should be written from a neutral point of view, representing differing views on a subject fairly and sympathetically.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was Curps Neutral when he deleted other points of view, even if they were differing. The term "Asian Tsunami" is an accept term or name for the event that happened on the 26th Dec 2004, covered by news media and the net. Blatantly calling <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_c3f4.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> is silly because there have been hundreds of earthquakes very week since 26th Dec 2004 but there is only one deadly tsunami that has been named by the media as the "Asian Tsunami".<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 08:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Point is, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was the name of the article that already existed. Renaming an article that lots of people are following is a big change. That article is in a state of flux at the moment, because the tsunami is a current event. After a few months, things will settle down. You'd be better off making whatever contributions you have to the existing article, and if, later, consensus develops that it is badly named it might be moved then. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 12:53, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Moreover, the earthquake was in the COAST OF NORTHERN SUMATRA (if we want to be precise) not exactly in the Indian Ocean per say ... 2004 Indian Ocean is wrong big time&#160;!!

<li>The earthquake epicentre was about 150km west of far-northern Sumatra. In the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean does not begin at the west coast of Sumatra there, it begins at the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

As for how specific the title should be, I don't know. But it's already been to a vote once, and you were the only person in favour of your proposed title. Finally, it is not entirely relevant whether our title matches what the mainstream media has been calling it.

<li>Kenkam, if something is off the coast then it is in the ocean. And 150 kilometers off the coast of Sumatra is well into the Indian Ocean.

<li>Finally, with regards to the three-revert rule which you have listed this under, you have already twice reverted the addition of the VfD notice to the top of Asian tsunami : The earthquake.

Kenkam, you keep saying "Curps has moved articles without consensus". Can you clarify what you mean by this? Do you mean that sections of articles have been moved around within one article, or that articles have been renamed without discussion? If the latter, were these substantial articles, or duplicates of larger articles that needed merging and redirecting? Did anyone else complain about these edits? You need to be exact (and preferable point to the appropriate page histories) when making claims like this. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 13:03, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I mentioned the IP thing for 2 reasons, 1) it could support Adam's view, and 2) it presents the view that he is only known locally. Regarding the ISBN thing, sure a lot of people self publish, but I mention it to bring into question notability. I think a lot of people would see an ISBN and automatically assume notability, so that's just some preemptiveness on my part. To me, anyway, the vanity view can only be supported circumstantially, so I'm much more comfortable arguing the notability issue. That being said, the article does reek of a lot of information that just isn't at all relevant with respect to what he is supposedly notable for, such as his parents getting divorced, his political views, and his travels abroad. Also I just noticed: regarding the newspaper article about him, it's from a paper that he used to work for, hmm... OH SNAP! I sent an email to Steven Durel and he emailed me back:<br />

<li>A Question of Credibility - There is so much useless stuff on this web site. You have to acknowledge that. Who does this hurt? Who does it offend? If Wikipedia is really a global information center, then this post should be kept as-is. But we all know it's going to be deleted just by the tone of everyone here, so just get it over with.

Thus, I do not acknowledge it. If I see something that is non-encyclopedic, vanity, nonsense, etc. then I take appropriate action. Other users do the same. If you've noticed something that has slipped through the crack then feel free to bring it to someones attention, or rectify it yourself. Additionally, I think you are misinformed about what Wikipedia is and is not, I suggest you read <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>.

It is helpful to have such votes tagged as suspicious. Your IP investigation is good data. It's also helpful to standardize the bulleting and indentation.

<li><b>Comment</b>: First, since the CTMU is based on logic and analytic philosophy rather than physics, it may not be evaluated in a physics journal at all. Nor should it be. There's no reason to suppose that knowledge qualifies as significant only after being kicked around in particular journals. Some people don't choose to publish in such venues, and there's no justification for making any particular kind of journal the final arbiter of intellectual worth. When it comes to intellectual progress, there are no trade unions. <i>.... at 07:01, 2005 Jan 17 216.139.113.98 again forgot to add "~~~~" to the contribution above.</i></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Some justification, but not much. Peer review is most effective with regard to long-established and familiar theories; it is more likely to be counterproductive when applied to radical theoretic departures. I don't know whether the CTMU has appeared in a "peer reviewed" journal, but I do know that it has been in plain view for years, and that any qualified persons who have found fault with it have had ample opportunity to register their critiques. Some have, and have been duly answered in plain view.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Whether or not you choose to take a given idea seriously is of no general interest. But to pass formal or contentive judgment on it, you need more than what you have. You need an assumption-free reason why the idea obviously doesn't work, as opposed to personal prejudice or a passing impression that it superficially resembles other ideas you and your friends dislike. This idea is conspicuously in the public domain, and despite the fact that several good references have been provided, you can't name a single verifiable item of content that definitively marks it as invalid.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I for one am not passing judgement on the inherent merits of the idea (its explanatory force, theoretical refutability, etc.). I'm passing judgement on its notability. One criterion I have for this is that it's little discussed. (A number of ideas that, unlike this one, are obvious tosh, <i>are</i> discussed and thereby are noteworthy, however much I or others might wish they would shrivel up and disappear: racial suprematism, etc. etc.) Another is that the main proponent of this idea here -- User:216.139.113.98, who may or may not be its author -- won't come up with the titles of respected academic journals in which it is discussed. Physics? No, it's less physics than philosophy. Philosophy? No journals again. Yes, ideas which I consider to be valueless (e.g. psychoanalytical stuff) <i>are</i> debated in respected journals; moreover, it's entirely plausible that philosophy journals are to some extent blinkered about new ideas, especially those that come from outside academe. But there exist iconoclastic journals (from off the top of my head, <i>Radical Philosophy</i>, though offhand I don't know if it still exists) and channels by which unorthodox ideas can be examined within and maybe enter the mainstream. (Sorry about mixed metaphors there.) My inability to show that it's worthless isn't enough -- it may indeed be impregnable to attack, or my brain may simply not be up to the task, or I might just not have enough time and effort. A quick writeup in the web supplement of <i>Popular Science</i> isn't really enough. Can you propose any other criteria of noteworthiness? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 01:18, 2005 Jan 20 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The CTMU has been around for over fifteen years, for the last five in high profile, and anyone who has bothered to familiarize himself with it knows that it is not only notable, but profound. Given the amount of air time it has received in connection with its national media exposure and in subsequent discussion groups and Internet fora, questions like "Yes, but who among the people I personally consider (credible, interesting, a bigshot) is currently discussing it?" don't merit much of a response, particularly when Wikipedia hosts many ideas that see but little traffic despite their enshrinement in hypertext. By the way, the Popular Science article I posted is a scan of the hard copy - it was on tens of thousands of newstands across the US and abroad. (There have been other articles like it, but what I've given you is quite enough.) Langan is one of the uncloistered few who tried to take his insight directly to the streets; yet here you are, trying to ensure that when it comes to his work, a purportedly open encyclopedia confuses itself with a constipated digest for elite academic periodicals. It's exquisitely absurd to maintain that any philosophical idea, let alone one as unique and inevitable as the CTMU, should be held for ransom by pap-filled scholastic journals of philosophy; until very recently, the mere suggestion would have been quite unthinkable, and for very good reason. If you're interested in philosophy, but too lazy or preoccupied to fairly and responsibly evaluate the source material, then by all means, go to a university library and scan the philosophy journals for survey articles. But as you do, try not to lose sight of the fact that this is far less likely to put you in contact with the entirety of significant modern philosophy than with the latest ivory tower buzz. It's simply not fair, and it would only be cheating the public, to limit the circulation of an important idea like this one out of personal prejudice gussied up in a flimsy catch-22 party dress. 216.139.113.98</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I notice that the CTMU entry has been removed, but I can't find any mention of the criteria actually applied, or by whom. (It does seem that the user who posted the page had all of his several pages removed for some reason or another, but this too is shrouded in mystery.) Having reviewed Wikipedia's deletion policy, I also see that while deletion is subject to a vote, such a vote must be based on a set of explicit criteria, none of which would authorize the removal of an informative, well-written page on the CTMU. Therefore, I or some other CTMU buff may write such a page and resubmit...unless somebody here has information to the effect that this is destined to be a waste of time. Do any of you people have such knowledge? (I suppose you'd have to be some sort of administrator to speak definitively on the matter...) If so, on what is it based? Please identify the specific criteria that would be used to delete such a page. (Although I'd naturally appreciate a response, I would ask that you observe the civility guidelines which apply to this context - a couple of comments posted above clearly run afoul of them - and also that I be spared any reference to anybody's personal opinion, or for that matter any irrelevant set of superficial criteria purporting to identify a given theory as a "crank theory" without attention to its actual content.)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: But Uncle, the last time I looked at it, "<a href="../../../s/c/a/Scatolinguistics.html" title="Scatolinguistics">Scatolinguistics</a>" claimed to be the study of "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a>". Now, while sociology is the study of society and sociology should most certainly claim its own article (articles, actually), I don't see why there's either a general need to have an article on X and another purportedly on the study of X -- particularly when the "study" barely exists. (Let's see -- is there a peer-reviewed <i>British Journal of Scatolinguistics</i>, or a West Coast Conference on Scato-Linguistics?) Instead, it very much looks to me as if this is a new (and inferior) attempt at what has already been done in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a>. But OK, if the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scatolinguistics.html" title="Scatolinguistics">Scatolinguistics</a> article is worth preservation, how would you like to see its future relationship with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a>? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:32, 2005 Jan 10 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed, fair enough. I withdraw my comment that it is a neologism. My vote remains, however, since neologism or not, it's a very, very, VERY rarely-used word, and this article seems unlikely to be the palest ghost of what's already located at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> and elsewhere.

<li>My own Google Groups search revealed only five posts with the word (and four of those hits are the same quote used in the now-modified article), which does not attest widespread use. There is only one hit for the corresponding adjective "scatolinguistic". It may technically not be a neologism since it was invented about 40 years ago, but if somebody invents a word and it is barely used at all for decades (even within the field in which it was invented), I fail to see why we should distinguish it from a neologism. They don't feel the need to explain it because it is an easily recognizable <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> word, like if I made up a word like, say, "dentolinguistics" for the study of different words for teeth. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 17:08, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Only one of the hits is the quote used in the article. The others don't actually contain quotes.) You are trying to claim that if something isn't notable, it is a neologism.

(And if you are going to argue non-notability on the grounds of limited interest, which is what you apparently will be, please explain why all of those H2G2 readers won't be interested in what scatolinguistics is.) Don't argue that something isn't a neologism, but since you don't deem it to be notable it "really is" a neologism regardless. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:46, 2005 Jan 10 (UTC)</li>

<li>We get so many non-notable words here on VfD though that the "neologism" argument is pretty much short for "some word that was made up by some individual(s) and hasn't gained widespread use", i.e. a non-notable word. I suppose our terminology isn't technically correct. In any case my argument was that this is a non-notable word, not that it is a recent coinage, because such words are perfectly welcome so long as they are actually used by a sizable group of people. The notability of the name of a field of study is easy to measure: does anybody in that field refer to it as such? So far, I see no evidence of scatolinguists or their scatolinguistic texts, although there is a significant amount of study done on profane words (I'm a linguistics student and I've seen it). I would not declare unencyclopedic an article about the study of profane words, but it would need a clearer and more recognizable title, and since this article explains little more than the meaning and source of the word itself (i.e. a dicdef), I think it should be deleted. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 21:51, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, by that I mean that an educated person (the type of people reading the few articles on the linguistics of profanity in which the word is used) could probably meaningfully guess what it means by decomposing it into its constituent words, but I imagine there are many laymen who don't know what "scatological" means or who would not be able to readily decompose it. I think a more conventional title ("Study of profanity" or somesuch) would be overall more readily understandable and appropriate for the subject, but I really don't see why an explanation of it should exist outside the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">profanity</a> article. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 07:56, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>One linguist. Great.

<p>George Costanza is not Jewish, and there is no indication that his mother is.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're right; the Costanzas are Italian Catholics. I removed the reference to Costanza from the article. -<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderj_1067.html" title="User:Alexanderj">Alexanderj</a> 09:09, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, while the Costanzas are Italian they are not Catholic.
<ul>
<li>I thought I had read that the Costanzas were Catholic, but I stand corrected on that. However, they are NEVER referred to as Jewish, and Larry David had purposely kept their religion ambiguous. As such, Mrs. Costanza can hardly be cited as an example of a "Jewish mother," if her religion is never ever referred to, and she is supposed to be religiously ambiguous. Therefore, I've reverted your edit. Also, please sign your comments in the future. -<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderj_1067.html" title="User:Alexanderj">Alexanderj</a> 07:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)*

<p>The original article whose content was basically "Jewish mothers are great, but Woody Allen created this horrible stereotype" was pretty flawed. I changed it to be about the stereotype itself and got rid of the "syndrome" (it is not a clinical syndrome) in favor of "stereotype". I don't know if this should be kept — personally I think this is a little too close to an ethnic stereotype that, whatever its prevalence in Jewish comedy, is a little too close to other unfavorable ethnic stereotypes for my personal comfort. But anyway, I thought I would just explain myself. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:24, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I fail to see how this is relevant to the Jewish Mother stereotype used by comedians, so I removed it. Feel free to revert, I just don't see how it is relevant. There are lots of stereotypes based on this set of characteristics, and it would be tiresome and perhaps impossible to list them all.</p>

<li>I didn't want to reply or give a reason, but apparently an anonymous comment has caused me to speak out. The only evidence of notability, apparently, is in article in Evansville Courier &amp; Press, IN on Dec 28, 2004. Is he notable locally? Yes. Does that warrant his inclusion into the Wikipedia? No. Has he been Slashdotted? No. My answer still remains the same. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:40, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>AllyUnion, you really didn't do your homework. How about full feature spreads in the Dall Morning News and the Indianapolis Star? What about regular articles in World magazine and National Review? The Evansville paper is one of the most insignificant of his pieces. And he's been Slahdotted too. --Anon 09:40, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Does my library get every major newspaper? No. Do I live in Midwest? No. Show me a link to a nationally read newspaper that is commonly sent across the United States for people to read.

If I wanted a Midwest paper, I'd pick up the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Tribune_3abd.html" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>. If you were on TV on your local television station, even if it was Southern <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, I would not claim notability for you. If you were on the front page of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, maybe. And I doubt that Joshua Claybourn's material was front page material on the Indianapolis Star. Now, if you made an ass of yourself on national television, like say... <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hung_60a2.html" title="William Hung">William Hung</a> then somehow got famous, I'd claim for notability.<br />

All these turn no results. The first one is searching for his name on slashdot. Nothing. The second one is finding if the word 'slashdot' occurs in any of the sites linking to www.joshclaybourn.com. Also nothing. The third one is finding if the word 'slashdot' occurs of any pages currently linking to his current blog. Again... nothing. A search on Slashdot itself under "Stories" does not show any definate hits, all of them are "0.1"; I still see no reason why to keep this. I did my homework, stop deluding yourself.

<li>Definite <b>keep</b> as it stands now. I recognize his name, and I spend as little time as possible on right-wing blogs.

<li>We all know (or should know) that bloggers and blogging manipulate the Google page ranking mechanism. Moreover, <i>my</i> (real) name has thousands of Google hits and is recognized by people, too. Yet I don't have, nor expect, an encyclopaedia entry solely on that basis. Wikipedia isn't Google by another name, nor is it a repository of currucula vitae.

<ul>
<li>similarly my real name gets lots of hits on google - a sizeable number because of me (although I do share a name with an Australian rugby league player and a Canadian academic), as I have had an internet presence since about 1998, and my site gets top spot on two or three different google searches, and on the first page in a couple more. I've also had a few poems published in different anthologies. That doesn't make me notable, and so there isn't a Wikipedia article about me (or my namesakes for that matter - both of whom (imho) are more deserving of one than me (at this moment in time certainly). What makes one of the top 200 bloggers notable? Do we have articles on any of the others?. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 16:54, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are 51 articles so far in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Category%7EBloggers_c891.html" title="Category:Bloggers">Category:Bloggers</a>. Claybourn fits comfortably into this category. I've wikified the article, by the way. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 19:17, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That there are 51 articles in that category doesn't say anything about whether Joshua Claybourn should be added to it. Indeed, picking six articles from that category at random, I discover in each case there is something significant about the person that can be pointed to <i>aside</i> from a mundane curriculum vitae of going to school, writing for newspapers, running a web-log, being in the "top 200", and having a home page. There's nothing, despite your edits, that makes Joshua Claybourne stand out in similar fashion. I'll ask again the question that you have failed to answer: What makes Joshua Claybourn <b>notable</b>? I'm in the top 200 of some things. May I have my curriculum vitae published on Wikipedia, too? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:29, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)

<li>His opinions on politics, religion and society are widely discussed across a wide swath of the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogosphere.html" title="Blogosphere">blogosphere</a>. He also meets the <i>print</i> published author test from <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. It is not formatted as or nearly as extensive as a CV would be.

<li><i>widely discussed across a wide swath of the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogosphere.html" title="Blogosphere">blogosphere</a></i> — But not anywhere else, such as on Google Groups. He gets a mere 10 hits, yielding only 4 distinct references. As I pointed out above, bloggers and blogging manipulate the Google page ranking mechanism. However, as has been recently pointed out elsewhere on VfD, they don't manipulate Google Groups, and the Google Groups Test seems to be, currently, an effective tool for blowing away the blogger-created fog. I get nearly 1000 times as many Google Groups hits as Joshua Claybourn does. May I have my curriculum vitae published on Wikipedia, too? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:20, 2005 Jan 14 (UTC)</li>

He's not "one of the top 200 bloggers" but "one of the 200 most influential authors on the web", which is significantly more different. "joshua claybourn" isn't a common name and the Google hits are his alone. The entry should stay.

<ul>
<li>"most influential authors on the web", when written in a blogging magazine with a target readership of bloggers, translates into English as "bloggers". Moreover, "top 10/20/100/200" lists in magazines are rarely backed up with hard data. (Oftentimes they are constructed by the editor and a group of mates in the pub.) And even when they are, those data should be treated with suspicion by encylopaedists. ("top 10/20/100/200" lists derived from reader polls are self-selected and usually more topical than true. A readers poll of "influential authors" in a blogging magazine is going to yield more than the appropriate share of other bloggers.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:02, 2005 Jan 12 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment from 24.163.124.186</li>
<li>btw - in the future, perhaps there should be a mechanism to contact copyright holders first, <i>e.g. email</i>? I would think false, or at least <i>not completely researched</i> accusations of copyright violation could be just as damaging to the WikiPedia as the act infringement.</li>
<li>btw - he can't be all that 'unotable' if he's on Glenn Reynolds' blogroll<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Reynolds" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Reynolds" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> (and has been so through several revisions and purges).</li>
<li>question - is this really an issue of politics I'm seeing here? Meaning people who disagree with Josh's right-leaning idiology seek to censor<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> him in the form of subjective opinions about his significance? As a solution, could someone propose some axiomatic semantics<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(semantics)" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(semantics)" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and/or quantifiable metrics<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Metric" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Metric" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> we can apply to either confirm or deny the claims of the detractors ... and apply to other similar situations?</li>

When I got a email from him, I was tempted to vote to delete because I don't really like the tactic. But upon further reflection, it seems like this guy is fairly well-known within the world of blogs and has written some articles for some widely-known publications. This seems to be a very borderline case. However, the page right now sounds like more of a publicity bio rather than a real NPOV article. Someone who is familiar with the blogosphere should rework the article, maybe with some criticisms of his opinions.

<li>it certainly fails the google test, and with a "best showing ever in an American presidential election in 2004, winning a total of twelve votes among the three states" it doesn't seem notable that way (unless no other party got fewer votes?). I'm assuming therefore that its either advertising or vanity, but the author has gone to a lot more effort than I'm used to seeing for either of these. They would probably be best pointed in the direction of some cheap/free webhosting.

<p><b>As of 2004 the term remote influencing is becoming widely used for certain kinds of <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a></b>. Thats the opening paragraph of the WIKI <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a> entry. I would go somewhat further, and argue RI has already more or less replaced the term <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a> , to describe the alleged use of the mind to influence matter. In this light, unless WIKI wishes to use old fashioned out of date language and terminology on purpose, I would argue this vote is quite clearly the wrong way round. The <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a> entry should be merged into <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_influencing.html" title="Remote influencing">remote influencing</a> , and not vice versa. Just do a google search to confirm the popularity of "RI" as present usage. Why would WIKI vote to use old fashioned out of date language? Furthermore, unless those requesting deletion can explain their viewpoint, which they seem unable to do in this instance, how do we know they are not just mere sock puppets? Finally, there are a dozen sub terms on the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a> page that have their own WIKI entry. RI has its own sub section, a tacit admission of the widespread usage of this term, yet a sub page request is being denied by this deletion request. The request for deletion of RI, is self evidently editorially totally inconsistent with the editing applied to the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a> page. I also think there is a good case for merging <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairvoyance.html" title="Clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a> into <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_viewing.html" title="Remote viewing">remote viewing</a>, since as with RI and <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a> , it is essentially the same phenomena. RV and RI have become the accepted language - surely it is not for WIKI to take dispute with the evolution of psychic terminology, and try and force old fashioned out of date language on internet users? If people search for RI, and call it RI, the phenomena should be listed under RI, logically. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 13:12, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, "remote influencing" not <b>the</b> new word for psychokinesis, as a check of any dictionary will show you. AHD4 includes neither "remote viewing" or "remote influencing." I was the one who added "remote influencing" to the psychokinesis page in an effort to acknowledge that the term <i>is</i> in restricted use and deserves a <i>brief mention.</i> It does not need its own article, and a redirect takes care of people finding it. When and if respected dictionaries include "remote influencing" as entries, and <i>define</i> psychokinesis as "remote influencing," then it will make sense to say that the word "psychokinesis" is out of date, and not before. My stances, a) that "remote influencing" deserves a brief mention, and b) does not deserve its own article are perfectly consistent. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:21, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, I agree with that, on reflection. Dictionary.com says thus:</p>
<p><i>psy·cho·ki·ne·sis Audio pronunciation of "psychokinesis" ( P ) Pronunciation Key (sk-k-nss, -k-) n. pl. psy·cho·ki·ne·ses (-sz) Abbr. PK The production or control of motion, especially in inanimate and remote objects, purportedly by the exercise of psychic powers.</i></p>
<p>So adding remote influencing to <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a> makes no sense at all, since as presently employed, RI applies to people and biological systems. Thoughts, emotions, hearts, blood clots, etc. It does not involve the movement of objects. Just do a google search, and see for yourself.</p>
<p>So then we have the puzzle that we have a phenomena, the American government and army is spending significant amounts of money on, we have on camera interviews to back that up, that biographical claims exist for such as Buchanan, that is the object of numerous claims and offers and services, that is distinct from the existing WIKI entry of <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a>, yet apparently, <b>MUST</b> be denied its own entry. This whole thread gets more bizarre by the post. We just made a case for inclusion of RI as a separate term to PK.</p>
<p>I did notice the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychokinesis.html" title="Psychokinesis">psychokinesis</a> RI entry had the incorrect information that the Ronson book was self published. Actually, it accompaned a major investigative TV series. I can understand a difference of opinion, but to add information that is false to WIKI, because you don't likr a certain subject, is getting a bit extreme. I mean, I don't edit other people's posts, and I don't add knowingly false information to WIKI. Why are people adding false information about the Ronson book to WIKI? Are these guys just CIA 'sock puppets?' You have to wonder. It seems to me this is a case of 'they doth protest too much' What desperation drives the posters, who in their own terms of logic, admit RI is is significant, and is distinct from PK? The sheer number of posts to this thread indicates an extreme high level of interest in the subject, and in itself, could be part of a case for inclusion. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 21:13, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of the terms I've heard for this sort of thing, "telekinesis" is the most common, followed by "psychokinesis". The only place I've heard "remote influencing" is this article. Both "telekinesis" and "psychokinesis" are used for any situation where the human mind is used to influence material objects, be they spoons, bricks, or the hearts of goats.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the book being self-published, the term applies to any publishing arrangement where the author of the book is the one paying the costs of publishing.</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> So why is this any more 'barking' than the existing Wiki entry on Remote Viewing? RI is something the American government spends a lot of money on - as a matter of pubic record, carefully documented by Ronson. If dowsing, and various other entries are okay, why is this one not? I wonder if the problem with this article is that its too good, and that the American government is concerned some of their secrets are being put in the public domain.

<dd>Simply put, because this article is a vanity take on the topic.

<p>What peer review exists for <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghosts.html" title="Ghosts">ghosts</a> or <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairaudience.html" title="Clairaudience">clairaudience</a>, exactly? Both allowed articles. Surely that is just 'original research, no evidence of peer review.' There are many examples in Wiki of articles about well funded government research projects. None of these get challenged. The history of RI has been carefully documented in a one hour tv special and book by Ronson. If <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_viewing.html" title="Remote viewing">remote viewing</a> is an allowed topic, the history of a government research project, why is <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_influencing.html" title="Remote influencing">remote influencing</a>, the history of a government research project, any different? I just took the liberty to chop the article somewhat, and it is now clearly focussed on documented historical facts of activity by the American military. Actually, point of fact, you're dead wrong about the absence of peer review. The article, is in fact based in part upon a peer reviewed article published in New Scientist magazine. So on the basis of your claim there is no scientific peer review for this article and that is unsupported 'original research,' I would deduce you voted for deletion, without actually bothering to read the article in the first place.

<p>Multiple independent peer review references to the scientific literature, yet the above poster calls it just 'original research.' Crazy. I see no vanity in the edited version of this article. You're just voicing a personal prejudice, you can't back up in any way. Fine, get RI deleted this time, it will just be back in 6 months time. You can't wish away experimental facts, no matter how hard you try. No-one requesting deletion has yet provided any real reason *WHY*, other than you just don't...er... like it. Personal emotional prejudice, is no real reason to ask for the deletion of an article. How can an article be both as you admit 'scientifically peer reviewed' and a 'barking, vanity crank,' at the same time? A highly illogical position, derived from raw emotion, I would argue. Emotion is not a rational thought process, nor is it scientific, or peer reviewed. May I respectfully submit, the folks asking for deletion here, most likely work for the government, and don't want their RI secrets publicised? They seem to be obsessed with this entry, in a way that is beyond reason. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 23:33, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Codswallop. This topic/research is definitely not peer-reviewed, it cobbles together a few marginal citations not directly related to it, quite a different thing. For example, so many cranks refer to Richard Fenyman these days that some professionals have grown wary of doing so in lay literature. Furthermore, New Scientist is a pop science publication, not a scholarly journal. As for military organiations, these have a tendancy to look into anything that might have a potential to disorient or kill people. Such interest shouldn't be interpreted as inherently scientific, or even serious. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:48, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The Ronson book is published by Picador, a vanity press, by the way. Does anyone have any bona fide, easily verifiable evidence that the U. S. government is actually conducting remote influencing programs? It appears as if a couple of researchers coined the term "remote viewing" as a euphemistic synonym for "clairvoyance," and that became the trendy term for clairvoyance because it sounded scientific, and "remote influencing" got coined by extension. As nearly as I can tell "remote influencing" is a synonym for "psychokinesis," plain and simple. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:34, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Remote influencing is gonna get re-created sometime soon, even if it gets deleted this time. Its a recognised term, that deserves explanation - as much as <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_viewing.html" title="Remote viewing">remote viewing</a>. I've added skeptical references to the article. Its referenced to historical studies, books, peer review articles. How many articles in Wiki can say the same? As it stands, it seems likely more articles will be produced on RI over time, and the article will get filled out in the years to come. Why so much grief?

<p>i've heard about this. the article doesnt say, is there a way to sheild against it, like with armor or something?</p>
<p>It has been re-written - by me. Its nothing like the original article, now. Its carefully referenced to historical studies, biographies, peer review papers, with skeptical challenges to the viewpoints presented, also linked. If only every article in Wiki could conform to this standard of presentation. I just did a google search, and I would say conservatively RI turned up over 100 relevant page links. Its clearly a known and recognised term, in use by real people, including the American military, and including Donald Rumsfeld. Its real enough to get funded. The article did originally have a comment from Lyn Buchannan on shielding methodologies, but because there was no peer review scientific paper on that, I decided to drop it. Maybe insisting on strict peer review evidence for all effect claims in the article, as was being demanded by several posters, is going *SLIGHTLY* too far. I think it is, personally, but I'd rather have something in Wiki, than nothing. So if it needs peer review evidence, then so be it, because it certainly exists. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 16:32, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see four peer-reviewed studies for a totally different subject (prayer as a technique for healing) and three articles criticizing those four. One of the <i>New Scientist</i> articles mentioned (<i>Matthews</i> and <i>McCrone</i> are two separate articles, and should not be cited as if they were one) is a criticism of paranormal research in general, and the other may cover RI briefly. The SciAm article is an overview of consciousness in general, and I don't recall it covering paranormal abilities.</dd>

<dd>Of the books, two cover prayer in healing, and the other two have the feel of being written for the purpose of making sales, not to reveal any truths. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 19:12, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think myself and many others, believe 'prayer' is just a group form of meditation. You sit down, focus you mind on a person not present, and wish a certain outcome for them. Yet that is 100% different to remote influencing as the military practise it you say, where you focus on a person, and wish a certain outcome (their hearts stops, their blood clots, etc). It seems to me the basics, focussing on a person, wishing a certain health outcome, are the same. Interestingly, the prayer studies seem to confirm the same performance envelope for the effect, as the military studies i.e. predominantly coronary and clotting based application. Its clear since I edited the article, support for your repeated and somewhat hysterical requests for deletion have dried up. If it gets deleted, I'm re-creating, because its obvious the silent majority think this is fair value. The article may get expanded in the future, but I think its reasonable for now, to stick to claims that can be backed up by peer review evidence. If people want more, I suggest they add a comment to the discussion page, and register their interest in a more full discussion of RI, as a matter of historical record. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 11:05, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not the way it works. If the article is deleted, re-creating it will make it eligible for speedy deletion by an admin. As for the level of participation in this vote, I wouldn't read too much into that.

<p>Maybe the article should be re-submitted from scratch. I think its 90% different to what was originally posted, before I hacked it to pieces. Most of the above comments apply to something that has little resemblance to whats presented posted. I think the vast majority of concerns originally raised, have now been addressed. To this extent, the request for deletion has been proved a useful editorial process. Besides which, more studies in RI are pending, and if 2/3 more credible peer review articles turn up, I would argue the case for inclusion get stronger. If we got to the point in 20 years time, when 20 + accepted RI studies existed, the thing was mainstream funded science, Wiki would look pretty silly, if it said 'it was deleted in 2005, and it can never come back because of that.' Long term, there is going to be an RI entry, of that I have no doubt, its just a question of at what point the vocal minority give up and accept it.<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 13:11, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The previous vote did not seem to adress the issue of deletion very thoroughly
<ul>
<li>I read through the original debate on deletion.</li>
<li>It does not seem the question got many votes either way.</li>
<li>A lot of the discussion was on related issues, such as the propriety of publishing a picture of a clown's makeup, the distinction between the clown and the performer, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am having trouble finding any evidence this person merits an encyclopedia article.
<ul>
<li>I tried using Google to determine how well known the person is, but it is difficult when there is just a single name.</li>
<li>Is there any external link that could be added to the article to help establish that this is a notable person? There are none in the article as it stands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is it that makes this person notable? Reading the article, the "invention of fiddlestix" seems to me to be the most likely candidate, however, I see no substantiation. Can this claim be substantiated by an outside link?
<ul>
<li>Googling on "Glenn fiddlestix juggling" turns up no hits other than Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Googling on "Glenn fiddlestix clown" turns up no relevant hits other than Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Googling on "Glenn fiddlestix inventor" turns up no relevant hits.</li>
<li>Further, Fiddlestix is claimed as a registered trademark by a [<a href="http://www.kidsurplus.com/tntfb-9068.html|" class="external text" title="http://www.kidsurplus.com/tntfb-9068.html|" rel="nofollow">toy company</a>] for a toy that is not even related to juggling.</li>
<li>Also, the link in the article to <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fiddlestix.html" title="Fiddlestix">fiddlestix</a> contains the claim "Fiddlestix, the most advanced, and 'modern' design [of <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil_Sticks_f4a8.html" title="Devil Sticks">Devil Sticks</a>. <b>No</b> evidence is given to substantiate this claim at all. In fact, a google search for "fiddlestix devil sticks" garners yeilds &lt;100 hits, none that seem to substantiate the claim.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding it all up, there seems to be a legitimate question of whether this person is truly notable enough for an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 03:15, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
