<dd>Well, actually, it is the place for notable unproven claims, just like it is the place for notable hoaxes, so long as both are (a) notable and (b) attributable to reliable sources. You may be referring to <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a>, but reporting claims that the US, Syria, Sri Lanka, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, India, North Korea, the UK, etc, etc were/are state sponsors of terrorism isn't soapboxing. The claims exist, with varying degrees of evidentiary support. But we're not here to determine the validity of claims (that's original research), only to report that they have been made, without giving undue weight to any part of the arguments. One thing that Wikipedia certainly is not, which may be of relevance here, is censored. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 21:15, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes and they should at least be renamed as it seems the term state terrorism is not consistent in all sources in all articles, meaning there is self defining going on by editors which is the very proccess of WP:OR. The very idea that you can define "State terrorism" when the term "terrorism" does not even have an international definition is quite absurd and as such the term should not appear in article titles either. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 01:06, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia does not have "Allegations against XYZ person" because of very real concerns with violating libel law, at least that's how I perceive why there are more strict codes regarding bios. That said, allegations with merit do have a place in Wikipedia, even in bios. In the case of various countries' foreign policies, allegation might be the only appropriate word, given the nature of the deliberate concealment that is performed by all governments in undertaking actions that might damage their reputation. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackhorkheimer_f07f.html" title="User:Jackhorkheimer">Jackhorkheimer</a> 02:11, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is exactly my point, if we know its wrong to accuse people we should avoid accusing entire nations. The problem with these articles that even goes beyond naming and basic idea is that the sections within them are usually sourced to limited articles and not presented with counter claims. Wikipedia is not a place to promote Chomsky's definition of what "terrorism" is, however it gets its own section in the US article ... Your personal opinion of some countries "foreign policy" is not appropriate terminology to define state terrorism. As noted above State terrorism does not have an definition so its the editors defining the term to match the article, which is also a violation of WP:OR. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 02:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just for the record I do not think you have the ability to state people have to choose all or nothing. I also do not find it to be "anti-american" I just find it to be in bad taste as Wikipedia is being used to prop up the very minority world view by fringe professors and disputed authors and researchers. To see an article like this and have the only semi respectable person in it be Chomsky, is quite sad as we all know how level headed and fair minded Chomsky is. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 01:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is a mass of badly sourced pottage, despite the long list of citations; again and again it makes unsourced allegations and then sources various statements about how awful the atrocities were. I don't see this article ever being more than a battleground of ideologies or a platform for anti-Americanism; the various subsections are probably better off having individual articles (and I suspect most of them <i>have</i> individual articles already).

<li><b>Keep</b> Either allegations from notable groups or individuals exist. Or they don't. In this case they exist. NuclearUmpf's statement above doesn't hold water. A government statement in a state newspaper, or a government's statement to the UN is a perfectly legitimate source to carry allegations on this page. The BBC is state media, controlled by a director general appointed by the British government. Would you suggest that the BBC is not a legitimate source? Allegations made by one government are as valid as allegations made by any other. As wikipedia carries many allegations made by the United States government about other nations and individuals, taken straight from US government websites, it seems perfectly reasonable on this page to also detail allegations made by other governments about the United States.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 13:31, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

If it weren't for the well-referenced material, I'd argue for deletion. This article pulls disparate information together in a way that promotes some (albeit weak) conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is "The United States has allegedly committed terrorism". The entire article serves to promote this insipid thesis. It skirts the boundary of original research by presenting unrelated incidents in the form of a discrete encyclopedia topic. Academics make their living from this sort of clerical work. Furthermore, this article has a misleadingly bland title. The word 'allegedly' is the only preventative against an extraordinary conclusion (consider Lies allegedly told by George W. Bush or Alleged war crimes of Henry Kissinger). Presenting an extraordinary assertion in the form of a seemingly innocuous and trivial assertion is pathologically sinister.

<p>Nearly all of these sources i mention involve <i>specific</i> mention of "state terrorism" as a phrase (some do involve commentary on the concept of "terrorism" in general). They amount to clear demonstration of an international legal and academic consensus on the use and meaning of the phrase "state terrorism"; moreover, on the page we have gone out of our way to give every opportunity for objections and contrary evidence to be provided.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it has become clear that several "editors" are intent only upon seeing the information provided there deleted from the Wikipedia record. Among others, these include "Morton Devonshire" and "NuclearZero" or "NuclearUmpf" or "Zerofaults".</p>
<p>In the Charges &amp; Evidence section, we have in each case mentioned clear citations from widely available media and journalistic sources which clearly describe defined, limited conditions (as proof) and/or use the words "state terrorism" (accusations).</p>
<p>These are not articles making unprovable, skewed observations about negligible issues! This is not a "Brittney's Black Babies", "American Racism", or "American Evil" article.</p>
<p>These constant AfD's about "State Terrorism" articles are really silly. I have no idea if the Sri Lankan and Syrian articles adhere to the same rigor as we have worked to bring the U.S.A. article in line with, but obviously i think that insofar as they can, they should. Similarly, though, insofar as they cannot, they should not. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStone_put_to_sky_6cb2.html" title="User:Stone put to sky">Stone put to sky</a> 06:10, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Geneva Conventions do not mention international terrorism, the only political scientist is Chomsky, the Human Rights orgs are not the major ones like Red Cross etc. they are actually ones I never heard of, though I am sure they are real. There is 1 citations from an international group, wouldnt call it a law org, they write about how you cannot define terrorism, they use state terrorism in the article but not in a real way, they are saying you cannot define it because terrorism lacks a definition. The leading military expert is Ganser, which I wouldnt call a military expert after that document was proven to be a forgery. SO while I am sure this will be a keep, it would be nice if you actually looked over the sources fully and researched them. There is a political scientist being used as a source because he runs a human rights group, oddly enough the web page for that group has nothing on it ... it looks like a home page. The actual "allegations" come from Cuba State News, Chomsky, obscure french human rights groups, World Workers Party etc. And next time you accus eme of something I will start going to admins, I am tired of your baseless accusations, you still never apologized for accusing me of "deleting" those other section even though I proved they were just moved down a section, woops, egg on your face. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 10:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Everyone please witness: this is the sort of nonsense i must put up with on this page (and more than likely the author of this RfD, as well). This person has already seen that the Geneva Conventions are -- as cited repeatedly on the page in question -- the basis for most (but not all) of the official (i.e. -- legal, political, and NGO) definitions of both "terrorism" as well as "state terrorism". Similarly, there are more than a mere few political scientists quoted on the page...and no 'egg on my face'.

<dd>This has grown very tired Zerofaults. Most of the allegations made by various people in the Cuban government (<i>reported</i> in "Cuba state news" rather than <i>made</i> by Cuba state news) - have actually been admitted to by the perpetrators.

<dd>Not sure what you are talking about, who said anything about deleting references? If you participated on the page you would see I never had a problem with it, while the source is bias, WP:RS doesnt say we cannot have bias sources. Also the people who have admitted to wrong doing have not admitted to commiting terrorism. So the actual allegations of terrorism come from only bias sources and not government admissions. This is part of the problem, the US gets accused of commiting "unlawful warfare" from a non bias source, however the source alleging terrorism is Chomsky, by stating all instances of "unlawful warfare" is terrorism, hence making a redefining a legal definition when he does not have a legal degree. My only gripe has been WP:RS sources and Seabhcan provided those. My bigger gripe will never be resolved because some people do not mind an article filled with state run papers as sources, and I do not either since educated people reading the article will see the blatant bias in it.</dd>

<dd>Either the sources pass WP:RS and this page should stay - or they don't, meaning this page should be deleted. You write "[the sources] pass WP:RS". So is that the end of the matter? Will we still find you discussing the issue of these sources in the future? Even though you admit here that the sources meet WP:RS? If you think that a Cuban ambassador to the UN's statement on terrorism against Cuba is a "fringe source" - then that is merely your view. To most people, it is no more fringe than Colin Powell's statement to the UN in 2003. But as you now admit that this meets reliable source guidelines, then why is there a need for you to keep bringing this issue up? Perhaps our confusion about why you repeatedly mention these reliable sources whilst calling for a deletion of a page, may explain why you are reading what you term "circular arguments". --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 15:58, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article could be stronger since there are many many credible sources of information regarding the extensive use of and support for terrorist activities perpetrated by the USA. 'The Trial of Henri Kissinger" by Christopher Hitchens comes to mind. But, this article is of much higher quality than many on Wikipedia and has over sixty sources, many of which are extremely credible, ie the Guardian Newspaper in Britian (Englands third largest paper). Furthermore, there has been very little counter evidence on this forum, nor any actual discredidation of the used sources. I am annoyed at the petiness of this debate. Calling people anit-american because they are critical of a countries human rights abuses is a terrible rhetorical tactic. Much like calling anyone who crticises Israeli policy and marginalization of Palestinians anti-semetic including academics like Prof. Finklestien, who had two parents survive Nazi concentration camps. Many of the most committed American citizens including numerous members of the National Public Radio have presented evidence of US terroism. I will stop here. Please do not delete this article, make it better, or atleast come up with some credible accusations either against the sources used or disproving the facts cited. If we only count as credible those institutions and academics who are lauded by mainstream discourses then they will be free to dupe us at every turn.--<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mahakaya (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mahakaya_be04.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mahakaya">contribs</a>) 01:47, 14 December 2006 UTC.</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>We are not judging the merit of the accusations against a country. The accusations exist, they are well known world-wide, they are the subject of legal and political action. This is part of history, and will remain so, regardless of the final verdict of the civilized world. We do not pretend to moral or legal judgment. We record what is notable and documented. What could be more notable? What could be better documented than the existence of these allegations? <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 06:24, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> nominator gave no good reasons. "anti-American bias" is a completely POV statements and makes it sound like the AFD was to push POV, like how many conspiracy articles get AFD'd by people who don't believe in the conspiracy theories. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 09:51, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> An article is suitable for inclusion in wikipedia if it supplies documented, non-obvious, non-source-text information about a notable phenomenon from a neutral perspective and in a summary format. Colorable accusations by other states of US complicity in state terrorism meet at least all but the NPOV and summary criteria to the extent that the accusations can be verified from reliable sources and are not mere reproductions of formal government remonstrances.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The concern that this article is an instance of content-forking is not misplaced; but because the article treats allegations, and as such, could include official US Government responses to the charges, the article is not necessarily POV.</dd>
<dd>I am worried that the article is beginning to "plead evidence" rather than confine itself to an overview treatment. Wikipedia should report controversies <i>but not resolve them,</i> no matter how dispassionately that resolution is attempted. External links and references can direct readers to sources that attempt to analyze and resolve the controversy. Accordingly, some of the lengthier block-quotes and more detailed statements of accusations should be <b>summarized</b> at a level more appropriate for reporting rather than analysis.</dd>

<dd>I think part of the problem is that Nuclear and others define "fringe" any person or group who makes these allegations. Thus even governments of large important countries, such as Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, become "fringe" as soon as they mention US terrorism. Whole universities become "fringe", however selectively. ETH Zurich is now a "Fringe" university for the purposes of discrediting this view, however, when one of their faculty published the Theory of Relativity, they are not "fringe". I don't see Nuclear putting <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a> on AfD because he worked at a "Fringe" university. There's no way to win against this kind of logic - they want it both ways.

<dd>I think the government of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro are not the most neutral of observers. I have no problem with ETH Zurich either, not sure where I said I did. If you watch the news you would see how the Iranian president hosted a "serious conference" on if the Holocaust happened, so serious he got the best researchers, like David Duke, and did not permit anyone with an Israeli citizenship present. So while you may find the president of Iran to be neutral on certain issues, I surely wouldnt consider them neutral on issues related to the US or Jews. I also did not put Ganser up for AfD, so not sure why you would assume I would put Einstein up either. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 19:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have to say I find this misleading as well because I never stated Ganser was not a reputable source either, simply that if you wanted to avoid the talk page drama with others, you may want to bolster your sources with non Ganser material. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 19:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Chavez and Castro may not be neutral, but Bush is no better - I'd put them all in the same salt jar - an the US is certainly not neutral in their denial of terrorism. (I'd didn't mean you alone, but you are certainly on the more reasonable end of the same spectrum). My point is that the label "fringe" is used to dismiss things witch conflict with a predefined notion of reality. I have a Chinese friend who doesn't believe the Tiananmen massacre really happened.

<ol>
<li>that a couple of users (those who have actively attempted to delete this article for month) say that government x is an unreliable source, and doesn't meet <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<li><b>I actually agree with many of these conservative editors position</b>, that most of these conspiracy theories are bullshit.

<dd>What do governments as sources have to do with WP:NOR? The more you attempt to summarize the more you seem like you really do not get the point. Allegations is not encyclopedic. There are NOR problems that arrise, however none currently in this allegations article, but come up because people want to assume that a source stating "US violated human rights" is equal to "US commited terrorism" because in their opinion all violations of human rights are terrorist acts ... The real problem is an article on accusations is not encyclopedic. I think I will start one if this is permitted to stay soon on "Allegations of terrorism by Taiwan" and cite China's claim that they attempted to create missles that would reach the Great Dam. Then soon after another one on "Allegations the Democractic Party of America is aiding terrorism" and source it with Republican far right commentators. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 23:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We can simply <i>report this fact</i> (the fact that such allegations have been widely discussed in notable sources), or we can write an article which <i>discusses this allegation</i>. This is where POV comes into the picture. Any in-depth article about an allegation or conspiracy theory <b>must cover both points of view</b>, without slipping into OR.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Interesting points. But I'm not quite sure how events on this page affect various conspiracy articles. In the area of the article I am concerned with, the allegations are made by the Cuban government that perpetrators of terrorists acts were employed by the CIA. The alternative explanation comes from the perpetrators, who say that yes they were employed by the CIA, and admit to the acts. Its fairly straightforward. There are no opposing points of view, and it is all recorded in declassified files anyway. Just as there is no opposing view that the CIA initiated the Bay of Pigs invasion, conducted assassination attempts on Cuban leaders, tracked down Che Guevara in Bolivia and oversaw his execution etc etc. These events aren't conspiracy theories or wild allegations.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 11:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Zleitzen, Re: US article - I haven't looked that closely at any of the articles yet, which is why I wanted to setup some ground rules above. Still, here's a couple random thoughts about the United States article:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) The title itself is a matter of opinion - what exactly is an act of terror? Does rigging an election count? What if someone says they're freedom fighters? I <i>really</i> don't want do get into that debate, so I'll simply suggest that <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covert_operations.html" title="Covert operations">covert operations</a> might be a more NPOV term to use. Any claims that act X was a (terrorist act / liberation) need to be made when discussing that specific act.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) I'm concerned about the "Other allegations of American terrorism" section. This section simply takes a historical event (e.g. war in Iraq), and lists a single source which puts forward the <i>opinion</i> that it was terrorism. First, a Saddam spokesman is hardly a neutral source. Instead of putting these quotes here, they might better be used on a "war in Iraq" page, as an example of the "pro-Saddam POV'. Secondly, if you want to find some independent evidence of the US sponsoring acts of terror in places like Iraq, be my guest. But note that "a group of soldiers comitting a criminal offence", and "an act of terrorism ordered and sponsored by the US government" are two <b>very</b> different things. If the only evidence that such terrorism occured is that a Saddam supporter said "what the US is doing is terrorism", this should be treated as propoganda and dismissed. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 15:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good points.</dd>
<dd>1) We have been arguing about a title for months, with several informal and formal straw polls, changing the title is like <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herding_cats.html" title="Herding cats">Herding cats</a>. In addition, I argued over and over that "alleged" in the title violates <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:AWW</a>. The unsuprising response was what "is" is. (this has been a common argument for months, what <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> <i>really</i> mean, does source x meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>? )...</dd>
<dd>1) Several editors have attempted to define what is terrorism, using US terms for terrorism. I think it is a good idea, similar to the short definition at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_a365.html" title="American Empire">American Empire</a> another controversial page. The definition section has been deleted repeatedly (in fact, every single one of these sections has been deleted by a small core group of wikipedians, opposed to this page)</dd>
<dd>2) The "Other allegations of American terrorism" section was supposed to be deleted, at least that was the result of the straw poll, along with the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Gladio_6040.html" title="Operation Gladio">Operation Gladio</a> section.</dd>
<dd>I noticed someone put these all back in. I will remove the sections now.</dd>
<dd>If you are intersted in the 5 archives, the entire soap opera is there. Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 17:13, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> sourced, encyclopaedic. Passes every relevent policy with flying colours. Biased accusations and false accusations are definitely appropriate, see <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> for instance. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:40, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete All</b>: Except Syria other two governments are democratically elected, well recognized countries and there is no any allegation that was confirmed by another recognized country that un-alleged for human rights violations or any human rights courts such as <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Court_of_Human_Rights_5e56.html" title="European Court of Human Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a>, etc; And I also like to support <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerr_avon_f75a.html" title="User:Kerr avon">Kerr avon</a>'s points too. <a href="../../../l/a/h/User%7ELahiru_k_90e0.html" title="User:Lahiru k"><font color="blue"><b>♪♫ ĽąĦĩŘǔ ♫♪</b></font></a> <a href="../../../l/a/h/User_talk%7ELahiru_k_232b.html" title="User talk:Lahiru k"><font color="blue"><sup>Walkie-talkie</sup></font></a> 20:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Such allegations have existed since at least the late 60s – early 70s. Calling this anti-American is nothing but misleading. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 21:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Deleting it would be pro-American bias. This is a free encyclopedia, not a puppet organisation.
