<li><s><b>Keep</b> My preference is to turn into an article on the reasonably famous American author Jessamyn West, 1907–84, author of the 1945 novel <i>The Friendly Persuasion.</i> However, this librarian has a blog 'n' stuff and is famous enough that she outranks the, uh, <i>real</i> Jessamyn West in Google. So it could become a combined page or a dab for the two Jessamyn Wests. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 03:40, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</s> See below for clarified vote</li>

<dd>This updates a previous comment.</dd>
<dd>I have split the article. Apparently the librarian-blogger's full name is Jessamyn Charity West and differs from the Quaker novelist's, so I'm decided to avoid the dab page and just have split out <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessamyn_Charity_West_a059.html" title="Jessamyn Charity West">Jessamyn Charity West</a> and cross-reference the articles to each other. This way, at least <i>some</i> users—the ones that want the novelist—will get what they want without having to follow a link.</dd>
<dd>The naming convention says "Use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things." Jessamyn Charity West is not the librarian-blogger's most common name, but her most common name does conflict with the author's name, and the author was there first.</dd>
<dd>I'm now inclined to think the librarian-blogger is notable enough for an article. (But working on a page will do that to you). Actually I just found out that she's one of three dozen bloggers who were issued press credentials for the 2004 DNC, which clinches it for me anyway.</dd>
<dd>Since the article nominated for VfD was about the blogger, I've put a duplicate VfD notice referring to <i>this</i> discussion on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessamyn_Charity_West_a059.html" title="Jessamyn Charity West">Jessamyn Charity West</a>.</dd>
<dd>In continuing discussion please be sure to indicate a clear opinion <b>on librarian/blogger/activist Jessamyn [Charity] West, 1968-,</b> because the question is really about her. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:14, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep both.</b> Blogger borderline, but her mention in the New York Times, in Library Journal as a "mover and shaker," the DNC's issuance of press credentials to her at the 2004 convention, her Google listing <i>above</i> the novelist (good example of Google systemic bias but still), and her status as an opponent of the USA Patriot Act (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22patriot+act%22+%22jessamyn+west%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22patriot+act%22+%22jessamyn+west%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">800 Google hits</a> on <i>"patriot act" "Jessamyn West"</i>) put her just on the "keep" side of the border, IMHO. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:25, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Though my vote is still to keep both, candor compels me to add a new data point. I called my local public library, and asked a librarian if she'd heard of "a librarian named Jessamyn West, not the author." She hadn't, and she referred me to the library director, who hadn't either. I explained that she was a librarian with a blog, and noted for opposing library-related provisions of the USA Patriot Act, and it still didn't ring any bells with her. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:01, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep both.</b> Both are influential enough to warrant mention. As noted above Jessamyn Charity West is more than just a blogger—or just a librarian, for that matter. It is also inaccurate to refer to only one of these two people as an author as <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=61-0786416084-2" class="external text" title="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=61-0786416084-2" rel="nofollow">Jessamyn Charity West</a> has also been published in print.

<li><b>Comment</b> Nothing to make of it. I apprear to have accidentally stumbled into something I shouldn't have, and if that is the case, please delete. My "history" is that I have only occasionally poked around here, and maybe should have played in the sandbox a little more (hence the multi-edits to this page) before commenting. But these recent comments seem to be more focused on me than the agenda item, so please forgive my intrusion. I came to this wikipedia page because I was looking for information on Jessamyn Charity West, and I was only somewhat familiar with Mary Jessamyn West (bad English major, I know), so I voted accordingingly (room for both, I still think). I am very familiar with the online presence of JC West and the work she does in online communities and with freedom of speech issues, and library work, etc. User:RickScully

<li>Ah. Thanks. IMHO "coeditor" isn't quite the same as "author," though, and I don't think "author" is currently her primary identification."Revolting Librarians Redux" has an Amazon sales rank of 392,835 which, by my personal criteria takes it out of the class of vanity press and obscure academic publications but doesn't make it notable in itself. She also edited a book called "Digital Versus Non-Digital Reference: Ask a Librarian Online and Offline."
