<li><b>Comment</b>: For the moment, I would suggest leaving it. It seems pretty notable, and several hundred thousand hits for a campaign that's been running for a just over a month is pretty impressive. If in a few months time all the hype dies down, and it proves itself to be nothing more than a fad, at that time I would advocate deletion, but for the time being, if I had to make a choice, I would say <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 05:10, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a serious attempt to address a serious political and economic problem, and probably one of greater long term significance than, say, <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Sheehan_da7a.html" title="Cindy Sheehan">Cindy Sheehan</a>. One of the strengths of Wikipedia <i>is</i> it's ability to address "flash topics." - Lawrence Person</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> "Massive blog-based astroturfing campaign?" Isn't that a contradiction in terms? The "porkbusters" effort isn't being pushed by a single organization or even party; it's an entirely voluntary and yes, grass-roots movement. I could just as easily say that the Cindy Sheehan hysteria in August was a "massive media-based astroturfing campaign on behalf of a marginal band of leftie radicals." That wouldn't give me the right to ban any mention of it from a public forum.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for reasons already listed. Additionally, it appears very likely that this campaign will mark a seismic shift in the country's approach to federal spending and earmarks for a particular district. As such, it will also be a seminal point in the growing influence of citizen journalism on public policy.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>This is a big time project, and certainly, as noted above, has more impact that Cindy Sheehan. As a result of this project, there has already been committments to return almost $100,000,000 in specific cuts, while many more representatives have pledged to do the same. If this doesn't deserve notice, I don't know what does.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep and Expand</b> Porkbusters is notable now and has great potential to morph into a permanent political movement. If they succeed in getting offsets for Katrina relief, they'll deserve a permanent entry. If they fail, then perhaps in two or three years this entry should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanlovejoy_4999.html" title="User:Danlovejoy">Danlovejoy</a> 18:51, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Seems obvious opposition to this is ideologically-based, contrary to Wikipedia's NPOV policy. Presently, there's no reason whatsoever to delete it. If it comes to naught, it can always be removed when that becomes clear. For now, though, it's news. A better rewrite would be a good thing, though. <a href="../../../j/d/b/User%7EJdb1972_6b31.html" title="User:Jdb1972">Jdb1972</a> 21:43, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It could use some editing to make the overall appearence cleaner and have more information on what is involved with the 'movement' but there is no good reason to have the entry deleted other then politically motivation.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Disagreeing with a group of people does not make their efforts "blog-based astroturfing". More fundamentally, even if the phrase were accurate, it would not follow that the article should be deleted. The criticism is silly and shallow.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is an example of a truly grassroots political phenomenon and will persist independent of what Wikipedia does.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Capitalistroadster. Greetings, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instapundit.html" title="Instapundit">Instapundit</a> readers. Your enthusiasm is admirable, but please keep in mind that input from very new user accounts is routinely discounted on AfD – this policy is in place to combat the swarm of "one-issue voters," if you will, that shows up when <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/026160.php" class="external text" title="http://instapundit.com/archives/026160.php" rel="nofollow">one of the most popular blogs links to a particular discussion</a>, for instance. As it stands now, this article is unlikely to be deleted. If you came here from Instapundit and just created a Wikipedia account, please consider <i>not</i> voting, as you will only complicate the closing out of this discussion by the administrator who does it. <i><b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">ndroid</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 02:57, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I am not a regular contributor to Wikipedia, but I have gotten into the habit of checking Wikipedia whenever I come across new terms such as this.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't have nearly as much of a problem with it now that it doesn't just read like a content-free spamming attempt to make it sound more established than it is.
