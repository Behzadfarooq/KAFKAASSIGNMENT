<p>The result was <b>delete</b>; recent community consensus against "in popular culture" articles applies much the same to this article, where "can be verified/cleaned up" protestations are outweighed by the extent to which this article is unverified and messy, and clearly isn't going to be made into a real article anytime soon. This article suffers more than others that have been deleted, if anything, due to the confusion between the Western political emblem and the Eastern religious symbol. The argument that this should be kept around because some of this mess needs to be merged into the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swastika.html" title="Swastika">featured article</a> is equally unconvincing. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 03:15, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not every entry is OR. It's easy to speak in general terms, but when you examine the entries one by one, each one is different. Why not just add fact tags for the problematic ones, and if they are not cited within a few weeks, delete them - then if the article is whittled down to nothing it can easily be merged or deleted. Seems like this AfD is jumping the gun to try and solve a problem that will just be re-created. The best solution is force people to make citations - deleting the article won't solve anything, it will just get re-created in a new format (sub-section somewhere else). -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 15:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, the best solution is to delete articles that consist of nothing but indiscriminate context-free items. As I've already said, even if every item were cited, that would still leave this as an indiscriminate list, devoid of any context either within the fictional item from which the sighting was made or in the real world. I am willing to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and accept right now on face value that every item on the list is a real factual thing. Which leaves the question of "so what"? What does it tell us about the XFL that their logo bore some passing resemblance to a swastika? What does knowing that a character in <i>The Sum of All Fears</i> has a swastika engraved on the back of his watch tell us about either The Sum of All Fears or the real world? Nothing. And I'm sorry, but your desire to keep these sorts of articles because it keeps the information from being in the main article is a poor excuse. If the information is crap in the main article and it's crap here then the information should be removed. And if that means that you or some other editor who's interested has to monitor the article, so be it. I have articles on my watchlist and when people add crap information to them I take it out. That's part of what being an editor here is about. If you're not willing to do it, that's fine, you certainly aren't required to. But please, don't shift the responsibility onto someone else by dumping garbage into a trivia article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with what your saying, I really do. But I know from experience these items will be re-added to Wikipedia by well meaning but mis-guided newbies (who represent the majority of editors). I've done experiments, deleted the pop culture section of an article - watched it re-populate within 6 months. Deleted it again, watched it re-populate again - always different people, anons and one-time editors.

<li>Well we keep going in circles. You on the idealistic side, how people should behave, and me on the practical side, on how things really are.

<li>Keeping the article to keep the information from becoming someone else's problem is not a valid argument for retention. If the information is crap, it's crap no matter what article it's located in. The proper response to crap is to remove it, not to shift it onto someone else to deal with. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:23, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>MediaWiki support to keep and improve quality of articles (like stable versions) has been promised for years and yet, nothing had materialized. This ugly and bad "in popular culture" hack is, IMHO, the only (somewhat) working way to deal with the crap here and now. Frex: I have watched the cruft being removed from <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorilla.html" title="Gorilla">Gorilla</a> article and getting accumulated again and again until the <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorillas_in_popular_culture.html" title="Gorillas in popular culture">Gorillas in popular culture</a> did help with it. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 22:03, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I find exercising a small measure of vigilance as an editor and demanding that additions to articles meet Wikipedia standards works quite well. Endorsing my <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#What_would_it_to_take_to_forbid_long.2C_pointless_lists_of_pop_culture_references.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">proposal</a> to spell out explicitly that this sort of crap squarely outside the bounds of Wikipedia policy would also be a good thing. Personally I don't think it should be necessary to spell out in policy that crap information doesn't belong in an encyclopedia, and the existing admonitions against indiscriminate information and directories ought to be sufficient. But endorsing a policy change would help put a stake through their hearts, more than complaining about how things can't ever possibly change does. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:45, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
