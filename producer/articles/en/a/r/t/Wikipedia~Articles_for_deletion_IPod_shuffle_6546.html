<p>This is an advertisement. The <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a> is notable enough to have its own article. This particular version of the iPod is not. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 19:09, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I created this article because I happen to think the iPod shuffle <i>is</i> notable, and because the iPod photo also has its own article. I can see your point, but if we delete <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_shuffle_8511.html" title="IPod shuffle">iPod shuffle</a>, perhaps <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_photo_be46.html" title="IPod photo">iPod photo</a> should also be deleted, as it contains no information that's not already on Apple's web site? - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 19:12, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the explanation. I was not aware of <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_photo_be46.html" title="IPod photo">iPod photo</a>. Now that I look at that article, I would say it should also be deleted. I think the same should apply to <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_mini_1d38.html" title="IPod mini">iPod mini</a>. All 3 of these, including the <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_shuffle_8511.html" title="IPod shuffle">iPod shuffle</a> are not sufficiently notable on their own to merit an article that is seperate from <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>. Although some might even claim that the iPod itself is simply "another MP3 player", I think most would agree that the iPod broke through a certain barrier to become a sort of cultural phenomenon. I don't see any particular iPod variant or improvement coming close to that. Therefore, I think they should all be covered under one article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 19:29, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> - I lean towards wanting to keep the more specific articles, because they can have a lot more specific info than the more general-purpose <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a> article should have; I think putting all the model-specific info into the main article will make the main article even more huge than it already is. (Keep in mind that there's a separate article for just about every line of Mac computers ever made, though admittedly Macs are more different than iPods are.) But let's weigh popular opinion on this. Should <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_mini_1d38.html" title="IPod mini">iPod mini</a>, <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_photo_be46.html" title="IPod photo">iPod photo</a>, and <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_shuffle_8511.html" title="IPod shuffle">iPod shuffle</a> all be deleted and their contents merged into <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>? Or should the more specific articles stay? Or should some of them stay and others be deleted? (Johntex, would you like to put deletion headers on the mini and photo articles?) - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 19:46, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, largely for the reasons given by Brian Kendig above. I'm not going to comment on iPod mini and photo (I must admit I haven't looked at those articles yet), but I think shuffle - because it uses a flash drive rather than the hard drive used on most iPods is sufficiently different (from iPods - it'll generate a lot of different views) to merit an article of its own. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 20:27, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think all three should be <b>deleted</b>. However, I am going to refrain from putting deletion headings on the other two articles at this time. Let's see how this vote goes. If there is clear consensus for deletion on this one, then I will nominate the other two for deletion as well. If not, then I will leave the other two in peace. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 20:36, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> I'm not convinced that the iPod shuffle really deserves it's own page, I think Wikipedia would be better served by merging this with <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">IPod</a>. However, <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">IPod</a> itself should probably be editted down a bit as well. -- <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKaszeta_0108.html" title="User:Kaszeta">Kaszeta</a> 20:38, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If we can have <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> being a history and general overview and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_95.html" title="Windows 95">Windows 95</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_98.html" title="Windows 98">Windows 98</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Me_94dd.html" title="Windows Me">Windows Me</a> describing individual versions, then we can have the same with <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>, <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_mini_1d38.html" title="IPod mini">iPod mini</a>, <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_photo_be46.html" title="IPod photo">iPod photo</a>, and <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_shuffle_8511.html" title="IPod shuffle">iPod shuffle</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:57, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. For the same reasons as Uncle G. This article is more specific than iPod, plain and simple. This is no more an advertisement than any of the other three million articles that are on commercial products.--<a href="../../../c/t/a/User%7ECtachme_cf74.html" title="User:Ctachme">Ctachme</a> 21:17, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with Uncle G. There are many articles on different versions of the same product on Wikipedia already. I don't see anything wrong with that. <a href="../../../m/p/i/User%7EMpiff_fa5a.html" title="User:Mpiff">mpiff</a> 21:20, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The ipod is a cultural phenomenon, if every Star Trek episode can have an entry so should this new iPod. I think it shows devotion to wikipedia that there is an entry on somthing announced today, already. Well done! <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexp73_ff12.html" title="User:Alexp73">Alexp73</a> 21:24, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. For the reasons others have listed above. Also because this iPod uses a different architecture than the others, which are basically all based on the same architecture that was first introduced with the original iPod. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 21:56, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is not short of space, and the article is (I think) interesting. True that the info is duplicated on <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/" class="external text" title="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/" rel="nofollow">Apple's site</a>, but this may not be the case in a year's time. The <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a> article has become an interesting and useful reference to the evolution of the iPod as a product, which is <i>not</i> available on Apple's site. Possibly this will also happen with iPod shuffle? If anything I'd say that the <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_photo_be46.html" title="IPod photo">iPod photo</a> article could possibly be merged with the iPod one, but not this, which is a more distinct product. — <a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPmcm_a5d3.html" title="User:Pmcm">PMcM</a> 22:21, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, for reasons of interest, logical arguments above, and the plain and simple fact that Wikipedia is not paper. GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 22:29, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Definitely <b>Keep</b>. Is notable and does need its own article, is not the same as the original iPod. That's like saying Windows XP shouldn't have its own article. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandy_Johnston_1e7a.html" title="User:Randy Johnston">Randy</a> 22:31, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.
