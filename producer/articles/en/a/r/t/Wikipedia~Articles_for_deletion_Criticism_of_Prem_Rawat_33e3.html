<dd>I vote NOT to delete. In my opinion, and the opinion of all former followers of Prem Rawat who have expressed an opinion, the main Prem Rawat article is 90% pro-Rawat POV. That is a natural consequence of the Wikipedia system, where articles will always reflect the opinions of those who are willing to dedicate the most time to editing. I and others were able to spend some time ensuring that the criticisms of Rawat were at least included on Wikipedia, and although I don't have the time and the inclination to police these articles full-time, after the work I put in to this article, I strongly object to it being deleted. If it was to be deleted, then all the criticisms would have to be included in the main article, which would, I understand, make it too large. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 20:07, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>From what Andries says, the problem seems to be an ongoing revert war in the main Prem Rawat article. The proper way of dealing with that is asking for Moderation or Arbitration, not creating a new article on the same topic (because, if the new article is not locatable, it is rather pointless; if it is locatable, it merely provides a new ground for the revert war). As such, <b>merge</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 20:58, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Radiant, the situation we have is that if a conscientious, independent, journalist were to write an article on Prem Rawat it would include all the negative aspects of his life so far. The article on Rawat is a whitewashed version of his life so far. What has happened on Wikipedia, is that we former followers of Rawat, who are most qualified to talk about those negative aspects, have been attacked, ridiculed, and marginalised. We don't have the time, inclination, nor respect in the Wikipedia process, to continously fight Rawat's supporters, so when the criticism article was created, a few of us did put the work in to ensure that readers would have the opportunity to read the information that Rawat's supporters are trying to hide. I would support merging the articles, but am loath to go through the arguments again. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 23:04, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jossi, I thought I explained the level of my interest very clearly in my post. I check out the articles once a week or so, and intervene where significant changes happen or are proposed. Deletion of the article is clearly a significant change. I contributed significantly to the Criticism article. I haven't the time, the interest, nor the belief in the system to put any more time into Wikipedia. That should be clear enough for you. There is certainly nothing sinister requiring highlighting of the word 'suddenly'. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 07:44, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, not for the Rawat articles. In the end I was reasonably happy that any readers would be able to do the necessary research to avoid being ensnared by Rawat's cult. I did try to get the mention of former followers ("ex-premies") as a "hate group" removed from the Hate Group article, but to be honest, the process is so laborious, and Rawat's supporters so dedicated, I gave up. All I do now is keep an eye (maybe once a week) on the Rawat and Criticism articles to ensure that nothing too inaccurate gets included. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 23:28, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

(If you try to edit <i>either</i> article right now, the editing screen will actually <i>suggest</i> to you that you do this -- that you find a way to spin some of the detail off to a new article.) Pjacobi seems to be arguing that that <i>particular</i> aspect is inherently POV, but he seems to mistake "people will clearly have strong POVs on the subject" for "the subject is clearly inherently POV". IMHO, it is <i>difficult</i> for a subject to be inherently POV; to do so it usually either has to incorporate an opinion directly into the article title or it has to commit the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_fallacy.html" title="Existential fallacy">existential fallacy</a>. Direct opinion-incorporation into the article title (like <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a>'s "[[Reasons why XYZZY is bad]]" is usually so clumsy that NPOVing the title is easy and produces a better title, like "[[Criticisms of XYZZY]]". Of course, in theory the new title could be committing the existential fallacy -- but to do so, it must be making an assumption that something exists, and there must be serious dispute over that statement of existence. Is anyone actually seriously claiming that Prem Rawat has never been criticized??</dd>
<dd>A final note on the timing: this article was created eight months ago, by a self-described proud student of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Maharaji</a>. It was specifically created as a place for critical views of Prem Rawat to be aired (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&amp;oldid=4335113" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&amp;oldid=4335113" rel="nofollow">as can be easily verified</a>). For eight months, it has served that purpose. Now it's being claimed that the subject itself is inherently POV and that this merits deletion of the article? I trust that Pjacobi nominated this VfD in good faith and that he does not want a bad precedent to be set, but I can think of a worse precedent that could be set, that of separating the sub-topic "Criticism of ..." out to a separate article when the main article gets too large and then saying "No, this article shouldn't exist, we'll have to merge those parts <i>which fit</i> back into the main article." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:10, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is about one of ten VfDs on POV forks, I participated in. Just today, by random chance, I put up four of them (thanks to Andries for pointing to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>). Generally speaking, most senior editors tend to agree that all POV forks must be killed. This discussion is to clarify, whether the situation with this article is special.</dd>
<dd>But the most important things I've heard so far, is that the <i>main Prem Rawat article is 90% pro-Rawat POV</i>, that <i>The article on Rawat is a whitewashed version of his life so far</i> and that <i>Rawat's supporters [are] so dedicated, I gave up</i>. This strongly suggest to me, that the entire topic needs serious re-assessment, and merging the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat_e41b.html" title="Criticism of Prem Rawat">Criticism of Prem Rawat</a> article into the main article would be a very important first step.</dd>

<dd>Mr. Smith, a more accurate summary of the article would be "Wiki contributors give corroborated information about Rawat that Rawat supporters don't want in the main article, Rawat supporters give lame rebuttal..." Actually, I'm coming around to the view that we should merge the articles. I am willing to put the time in to ensure that only reliable sources are included. Any sources that are proven to be unreliable will have to be rejected, or quoted as such in each reference. For instance, I can prove that Elan Vital and TPRF are unreliable sources for information about Prem Rawat. The only other sources are independent media articles, and personal testimonies. Yes, let's merge the articles - should be an interesting exercise. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 23:48, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear 140, this isn't an issue of what I think, but what are the facts. As a follower of Rawat for 25 years, I think that other followers, and prospective followers, have the right to know the truth about Rawat. Would you follow a diet from someone who was obese? Rawat clearly does not have peace in his life otherwise he wouldn't drink heavily, smoke, cheat on his wife, and demand the best material gadgets his followers' money can buy. All these allegations have been repeatedly corroborated, as well as the fact he lies about his past. The truth might look unpleasant expressed in the stark terms I did, but for someone who makes the claims he did and still does, it is clearly in the public interest that the truth about Rawat be known. And where have I been obtuse? Anyway, looks like the consensus is now to keep the articles as they are, so you will be spared months of arguing about the validity of every source for the Prem Rawat article. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 07:38, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I rejected Rawat largely because he, and Elan Vital, kept information about Rawat hidden from me. When I became aware of this information, I considered it, considered the good aspects of my involvement, and made my choice. I became active as I think other people should also be able to make the same informed choice. I partially agree with these statements about the bias of former followers, but I am sure everyone agrees that testimony from current followers is at least, but probably more, unreliable. I know my testimony as a follower was, although sincere, unreliable, as I wasn't aware of the facts. Being aware of my own potential for bias, I try to ensure that the facts on ex-premie.org are verified. Facts are facts - we might put different weight or spin on the facts because of our bias, but unless the facts are disputed (and Elan Vital have yet to dispute a single fact on ex-premie.org), they should stand so that interested readers can make up their own minds. The only argument I can think of for not publishing facts about a prominent person is that it could be an invasion of privacy. In the case of Rawat, as he claims to be able to teach a method of achieving personal peace, how he exemplifies this peace in his personal life is of utmost importance, and is definitely in the public interest.</dd>

The flaw in this is that very few such people have any interest in the subject of Prem Rawat. The few independent newspaper articles that have appeared in recent years have no problem in including criticism of Rawat. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 10:07, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>DpbSmith, articles do not have to be neutral but they have to follow NPOV guidelines. The critical points in the article all follow the NPOV guidelines. If you think otherwise then please tell where. They are well documented and in some case voiced by objective, unbiased academic sources such as Haan, Schnabel and van der Lans. Some of the rebuttals to the points of criticism are flimsy and undocumented and sometimes even ridiculous and do not always follow NPOV guidelines. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:43, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

See the history and the contributors. The article contains information that is not all supportive of Prem Rawat. This is not about being allwoed to do this or the other.

<p><b>Keep.</b> The main descriptive information about Prem Rawat is at 32KB, and could be larger. The criticism/controversy information about Prem Rawat is at 32KB, and could be larger. Attempting to include both these aspects in a single 32KB article space would lead to condensation and omission to the point of unintelligibility. Larger articles are indeed to be broken out according to topic, and that is what happened here: the criticism/controversy article is actually a large break-out Prem Rawat subtopic article. It cannot be scattered into other articles because it fills an entire 32KB article space all by itself.</p>
<p>Prem Rawat is not one article, but actually a complex of several articles: a main introductory description/history article, one on his teachings, one on his support organization, one on his father, one on criticism/controversy, one on his yoga techniques, a few other minor ones. This complex of articles, and especially the main and criticism articles, are the product of hundreds of user-hours (no exagguration) and many real-time weeks of patience, research, delicate political negotiation, wading through invective, and carefully executed and justified editing. When the process was complete, the results were an example of a balanced and informative text crafted in a polarized atmosphere where everybody had the ability at any moment to press the delete button, but managed to compromise anyway. When it was finished, we specially marked those versions in the edit history as the final reference versions, so that they could serve as baseline versions if there was too much "info creep" or "POV creep" in subsequent editing.</p>
<p>Those final reference versions represent the best and most encyclopedic, readable, and informative work complying with the 32KB rule that could be produced on this highly polarized topic in the "mutually assured deletion" Wikipedia environment. I am weak at the thought of all the work they took. I am weak at the thought of it all going away. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_D_302c.html" title="User:Gary D">Gary D</a> 03:39, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_D_302c.html" title="User:Gary D">Gary D</a>, I appreciate all this effort, and I agree that splitting the article using factual subtopics (like teachings, organinzation) is the method of choice. But the having a separate "Criticism of Prem Rawat" (in its current state and with it objectives) is surrendering the NPOV. The Criticism article and all other P.R. articles give totally different views about P.R. - this is the core issue, why this is an undesirable POV dork. Of course, of the P.R. critcs themselves are notable enough, the "Criticism" article can be used to depict them. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 11:44, 2005 Feb 27 (UTC)

<dd>Critics notable? How can an tiny group of vociferous critics (approximately 20 of them) can be notable? I'll tell you how: by obsessively posting hundreds of thousands of posts about P R and spamming the search engines with it, that's how. Yes, a small group of obsessively dedicated people, can become notable ... but to allow them to use Wikipedia as a soap-box to become even more notable? That would be a travesty.

<dd>Jossi, you <i>do</i> realize that in the real world, the testimonies of the people you label "apostates" are considered <i>more</i> reliable than testimonies from current members? Former members <i>may</i> have some sort of vested interest in portraying the group in a certain light. But current members <i>definitely</i> have such a vested interest. The small number of supposed "experts" on new religious movements who claim that apostate testimonies must be discounted is dwarfed by the rest of the social science world who view such disaffected former insiders as their most valuable informants. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:10, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting your use of <i>real world</i>. What is the <i>real world</i>, Antaeus? Apostate testimonies are not all equal. I am talking about the group of apostates that have been labeled <b>professional enemies</b>. Note that most people, just move on, taking with them whatever experience they had. I have several close friends that no longer practice Maharaji's teachings. They learned what they learned, they did not see the need for a teacher anymore, and they stopped being students. No big deal. Then there is the few of those that make it their purpose in life to become <i>professional enemies</i>. Some of them make a career and a living out of it. They write books, become special "witnesses", etc. Others just become consumed with their hatred of their former love. Some of them become obsessed, bordering on the pathological. Do you know that these people come together online <b>daily</b> to check the <i>latest news</i> on Maharaji, day after day, after day, after day <b>for years</b>? Regarding your assertion about the "rest of the social world", note that Sociologists have studied the subject and most agree that testimonies of professional apostates is not reliable. There is abundant research in the subject. Apostates such as the ex-premies are not an exception. They are a minuscule group, and yes, in a free society they have the right to express their point of view, as long as their actions do not impinge on other people's freedoms. Their actions speak for themselves. Since we started working on these articles, I have received hate mail of the most disgusting nature, targeting me and my family, for the only reason that I post here under my real name. Tell me that this is also part of being the <i>most valuable informants</i>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi ≈</a> 04:09, Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, Jossi, but you're committing the <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i> fallacy from the moment you classify some critics as "professional enemies". You're right that most sociologists do not regard the testimonies of "professional apostates" as reliable. That's because real scholars don't commit such a fallacious pre-classification to begin with! Tell me, if you were the Better Business Bureau, and you were trying to find out who were the good companies to do business with, and who were the ones ripping off their customers -- would you automatically classify any former customer who says that a company behaved with complete disregard for their customers and for the law, and who is angry about that, and who lets people know about it, as a "professional unsatisfied customer" who is not to be believed?! Why on earth <i>wouldn't</i> someone who was cheated and tricked by an unethical company be rightfully angry, and why on earth would it be considered evidence of bad faith for them to blow the whistle on the goings-on? And yet you're claiming that the majority of the academic world (instead of a tiny minority disproportionately relied upon by cult-structure groups) takes any public announcement of "I was cheated and tricked by an unethical group" as not just evidence, but <i>proof</i> of bad faith, of being a "professional apostate". Any so-called scholar who decides that <i>only</i> those former members who are <i>not</i> angry enough to speak up are a truthful source of infomation on whether the group did anything to be angry about is a scholar not worth his salt. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:25, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you a sociologist your self that you speak with such confidence about this subject? Really... Are you saying that Eileen Baker, Reender Kranebourg, Jeffery Haden, Gordon Melton, David Bromley, Irving Hexman, Anson Shuppe, and Douglas Cowan to name just a few are not trustworthy? Are you sure you know better? Have you read their books, papers and encyclopedias? Or maybe have you bought the buls*t spread by Anton Hein? The smear campain against them by the countercult movement is expected, but does not make it right, neither appropriate. Talk about ad hominem attacks! --<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.81.88.140.html" title="User:64.81.88.140">64.81.88.140</a> 18:53, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>All right, let's do that, let's talk about <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i> attacks. As you know, though it is quite often conflated (accidentally or deliberately) with the general notion of <i>any</i> sort of identification of a person or any sort of critical commentary about that person, <i>ad hominem</i> actually refers specifically to trying to disparage an argument, not by finding flaw with the argument, but by imputing flaws to the person who holds the argument, or by suggesting some particular rewards that a person would stand to gain from the triumph of their argument, and arguing that such flaws or rewards, in themselves, somehow affects the validity of the argument. So, looking at this, we can clearly see that "the testimonies of apostates are invalid because they are serving some pathological inner hatred" and "the testimonies of apostates are invalid because they are making careers out of criticism" are exactly examples of this latter type of fallacy, <i>ad hominem circumstantial</i> attacks.</dd>
<dd>Now, sound academic scholarship is built on a foundation that includes a grounding in elementary logic. A college sophomore with a single course in logic under their belt should be able to see the flaws in discounting the testimonies of <i>a whole class of persons</i> based on <i>ad hominem circumstantial</i> argumentation. Thus, it is shoddy scholarship to adopt such a principle, and a "scholar" who adopts such a principle is a shoddy scholar. You have now introduced the names of specific "scholars" who do in fact advocate this fallacious filtering, and you are accusing me of <i>ad hominem</i> against them. But simply put, even if <b>I</b> was the one who had named all those people, even if <b>I</b> had said "they're shoddy scholars, and their position on apostate testimony is shoddy scholarship", it still wouldn't be <i>ad hominem</i>. If I had said "their position on apostate testimony must be shoddy <i>because</i> they are shoddy scholars", it would be <i>ad hominem</i> -- but the fact is, I didn't. The position is shoddy scholarship because it's founded on an elementary logical flaw. Asking "how dare you call these authorities I have now appealed to a bunch of shoddy scholars!" is the wrong question; the right one is "if these 'scholars' are promoting a position which has an elementary logical flaw as its bedrock, what right do they really have to authority?" -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:37, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. In short, what you are saying hat these scholars don't use "elementary logic" and that you know better than these scholars. It could have been said in just these last 8 words. I would kindly suggest that you break open one of their books and read them rather than dismiss their findings as <i>shoddy scholarship</i>.

<dd>I didn't just say it. I showed it. If there is some argument buried in one of their books which could actually make a case for dismissing the testimonies of an entire class of persons based on <i>ad hominem circumstantial</i> reasoning, I would suggest you show it; it's not really very convincing or impressive when you just sneer that I should read their books and then strut around as if you'd actually presented a rebuttal. By the way, I must tell you, it's <i>very</i> amusing that when I say "This is <i>not</i> a general truth of the sociological community, it's shoddy scholarship only promoted by a small coterie," Jossi's response is "It is so! This is something that <i>most</i> sociologists believe, not just a small coterie!" and your response is "How dare you accuse Eileen Baker, Reender Kranebourg, Jeffery Haden, Gordon Melton, David Bromley, Irving Hexman, Anson Shuppe, and Douglas Cowan of shoddy scholarship!" -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:43, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I will also invent something new called a 'recursive fallacy', but it's really just the old double standard, where instead of actually presenting evidence that you are in error, I'll just blather that you are compounding your error by failing to fall in with my assertion that you are in error.

<dd>Jossi, I'm very concerned. If you have been the recipient of harrassing emails I strongly condemn it. I have been the harrassment target by premies who post online and who have created a website using my real name to harrass and libel me, so I know how awful and frightening it feels to be such a target, so I sympathize with you. It's never acceptable behavior. If you want to provide evidence of this, I would be happy to expose that unacceptable behavior and publicly condemn it on the ex forum with a strong demand to anyone who reads the ex-premie forum to stop it. Please let me know, because I can safely say that all the ex-premies that I know (especially the ones who post on the forum using their real names) would also protest anyone harrassing you, Jossi. It's simply wrong and very bad behavior, whichever side of this argument one is on.</dd>

<dd>I also want to point out to you that the particular sociologists of NRMs that are quoteed and referenced in the Rawat articles have been discredited as cult apologists by their peers -- other sociologists of NRMs. In particular, Gordon Melton has been strongly criticized by his peers because of how he dealt with The Family, which, as you know, is the child sex abuse cult that has been in the U.S. news so much in recent weeks. Introvigne is another controversial "scholar" of NRMs who has also been scrutinized by his peers because of his extremist views about "apostates." Melton was paid by The Family (Children of God) cult, and he also appeared in one of their promotional films/videos. Not all of these scholars paint former members as "apostates being automatic liars" -- Benjamin Zablocki and Steven Kent come to mind. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnother_Ex-Premie_b78d.html" title="User:Another Ex-Premie">Another Ex-Premie</a> 13:55, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "Prem Rawat" article, as well as "Criticism of Prem Rawat" that is the subject of this current discussion, both cite Gordon Melton in the Resources and Bibliography sections. One assumes that when an author and their material is cited, that they are a reliable authority, and Melton sets himself forth as an authority on the subject of NRMs, even though he has received strong criticism from his professional peers. Here is the link to a website called "Skeptic Tank" that published an article titled "When Scholars Know Sin," by Stephen Kent and Theresa Kreb. In this article, Melton's and his colleague's questionable activities when studying NRMs, is discussed. But, this is fairly old information that has been available for quite some time. I recommend you brush up on the subject of sociologists of NRMs and destructive cults, as well as psychologists and other professionals who also study NRMs and destructive cults, before you jump in and call it all "bs." IMO, one must become informed about all sides and pov's of a particular subject before one can make an informed conclusion or opinion.</dd>

<dd>You make me do all your homework; that's okay. It's not a "smear campaign," but you don't have to believe me. On the Apologetics Index website, you can read Melton's, Shupe's, and Lewis's responses to the above-mentioned article and then there's a link at the bottom of the page where you can also read the response from Stephen Kent called "Clarifying Issues --A Rejoinder to Melton, Shupe and Lewis." It's a published debate online that's quite interesting. Also, there's proof Melton took money from The Family. It's on an IRS income reporting form and also available for viewing online. Again, you don't have to believe me, the copy of the form is linked below on the movingon.org website (a website that supports those poor kids from The Family cult that were so horridly abused). Yes, I believe those kids. Also, Melton has given favorable reviews (for money) to other destructive cults like the Scientologists and the Aum Shinrikyo cult (the cult that put sarin gas into the Tokyo subways).

<p>None of these articles should be allowed (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> should be merged to Wikipedia). The best action when you find one of these is to merge it into the main article. If it's too complicated to do, just cut and paste and mark the article for cleanup.

<dd>I just want to point out here that having an unsubstantitated, repeated allegation on Wikipedia (See Hate-Group article) that ex-premies are a hate-group (I know, I know, the wording isn't "just exactly like that") makes it mighty, mighty, uncomfortable to come here and write/edit on Wikipedia. The only source to support that allegation is the Rawat cult on it's FAQ webpages. Jossi Fresco has spent more time trying to discredit ex-premies than ensuring that an accurate writing of facts about Prem Rawat takes place. He gets quite cantankerous towards any ex-premies who've tried to participate in the "wiki process." All of the Prem Rawat articles are pure POV advertisements and promotional pieces for Prem Rawat, written by current cult members (yes, I know the word "cult" is censored and considered obscene here). I just wanted to point that out and say that which ever way this vote goes, I'll never recommend any of these articles about Rawat as anything more than novellettes or fairy tales, wishful thinking on the part of current "students" of Prem Rawat. The "Past Teachings of Prem Rawat" article is a particularly hilarious example of what happens when facts get in the way of writing about the truth. If I cared much about Wikipedia, I'd fight for the truth here, but, on the whole, all the Rawat articles present such a distorted and revised view of Prem Rawat, that they all need to be sent to the scrap-heap and rewritten. That is, of course, if Wikipedians are actually interested in anything factual. Yeah, that hate-group allegation is quite stunning -- it's there because a cult says so and no other reason. Hey, I call's 'em like I sees 'em. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnother_Ex-Premie_b78d.html" title="User:Another Ex-Premie">Another Ex-Premie</a> 12:49, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jossi, I don't need your approval or permission to work on Wikipedia articles, but frankly, I don't have time for your ankle-biting. It's tedious. Nobody is abridging your freedom to practice a religion, either Jossi. Anyway, Prem Rawat states right on his Elan Vital and Prem Rawat Foundation website FAQs that the practice of Knowledge is <b>not</b> a spiritual practice, philosophy or a belief system, but, you seem to want to have things both ways, otherwise you pout and point fingers. Fact is, Rawat has <b>always</b> claimed that what he offers is <b>not</b> a religion, so I don't really know where your "freedom of religion" complaint is coming from now. I didn't get selected by Prem Rawat's inner circle people to work full-time for him because I <b>did not</b> understand Maharaji, Knowledge, his message, or my own devotion to him. But, I do understand very well that you don't <i>want</i> me talking about that secret project. You and your premie friends are so adamant <i>against</i> my talking about it that you even try to tell folks that I was <i>never even there</i> in Miami Beach, Florida, from 1979 through 1981, and if I <i>was</i> there that I'm crazy, and so mentally unbalanced, that no one should ever believe anything that I say. And <b>you</b> have the nerve to accuse ex-premies of being a hate-group that dehumanizes people. Fact is, Jossi, I don't need Wikipedia, or your or Prem Rawat's permission in order to tell the truth about my past as a foot-kissing devotee, and <i>my</i> telling the truth about <i>my</i> life as a devotee of Maharaji is really none of your business, and it certainly does not take away <i>your</i> ability or your freedom to be a practicing premie now.</dd>

<dd>You are entitled to think whatever you want and to help these people as you have done so dutifully over the past months. But note, that whatever you "personally think" is inconsequential to this conversation. FYI, I have no intention to "understand" a group of people that think, speak and behave as they do. I know Maharaji close to 25 years, both as a teacher and as a person, and I can assure you that I have not been in the company of a human being that is more noble, impeccable, kind and inspiring as Maharaji. Through thin and thick (and this is <i>not</i> an analogy, I have been in a war as a soldier, for example), his inspiration and guidance have been there from me throughout all these years, consistently. I must admit that given my experience of Maharaji and his teachings, it makes me sad to see the hearsay, gossip and appalling remarks and actions by that small group of people, and see their ill-will, arrogance and attempts to be seen as credible as even more saddening. If that is the company you chose to keep, Andries, it is your choice, and so be it.</dd>

<dd>Jossi, it sounds like you're simply too emotionally attached to the subject matter to be involved in this article. You seem to be almost seething at the mere possibility that someone would disparage your beloved Maharaji, irrespective of the facts and evidence and their implications, large and small. This doesn't seem good for your own mental health and I'm sure it's unsettling for others who are trying to edit the article(s) from a different perspective. For example, I, personally, would like to add a couple of things to one of these articles. New evidence has come to light that Rawat once bragged to the Boston Globe about having millions of criminals as followers. These people would be willing to steal cars, hijack planes, even kill others or jump out windows and kill themselves if they thought it would please him. This was said just days before Mahatma Fakiranand tried to kill the reporter who threw the cream pie at Rawat. Furthermore, in the late 70's, Rawat claimed that Knowledge could give one supernatural powers such as the ability to make things levitate although, he warned, he could take them away in a flash if the devotee wasn't dedicated enough to him. I think these are key points that must be added somewhere, especially given Rawat's and EV's current attempts to characterize his past as they do. But, Jossi, even if these facts are perfectly documented, as I believe them to be, will you allow their admission to stand? Or will you just go ballistic and sabotage the editting as you have in the past? I'm glad some new eyes have taken a look at these Rawat articles. Perhaps they'll finally receive some real balance. I'm just not sure that you'll want to stick around for the process. I think it will pain you too much. --24.68.221.224 03:23, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do you mean by "Try me", Jossi? Are you threatening to not allow those additions to the Criticism article to stand even if fairly stated and documented? See, for all I know, you might be paid to do this. I'm not. I can't get into an endless edit war with you. So tell me clearly, will you fight those edits providing they're fairly presented? Both are sourced to official DLM or Elan Vital publications. Yes, they're outrageous. Yes, they fly in the face of how Rawat presents himself these days. But they're legit and exceedingly relevant to the question of who this guy is. Can you handle the evidence or not?</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> -- This is just silly. The Criticism section was "forked" off because the acrimony was making editing impossible, and a concerted effort from what fit the Wiki definition as a "hate group" attempted to fill the original article, in fact, swallowing up the whole. The best compromise was doing it this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>The circus played out like defining something like "cherries." Instead of saying "<i>cherries are a small round fruit</i>," and having a parenthetical section that said "<i>some people don't like cherries</i>" these people tried to define cherries as "<i>the foul-tasting seed of hell, poisonous to the touch</i>" and then circular and anecdotal reasoning to say "<i>I heard a guy who once looked at a cherry and he was turned to stone, so don't even LOOK at cherries.</i>" And for citation, see an anonymously maintained web page and chat room that no-one admits to running. And just look at the nasty language above.</p>

<p>I vote to keep the Criticism page on Prem Rawat on Wikipedia and also to merge it with the main article on Prem Rawat. Jossi, who is one of the principal contributors to the Prem Rawat page argued for a separate page for any criticisms. Now he is requesting it's deletion because of its POV. The Criticism page is backed up by both verbatim transcript of Prem Rawat and by scholarly assessment. It seems rather transparent that the push for deletion is a calculated strategy to remove any viewpoint that does not adhere his and other followers' POV.Verification <b>note:</b> <i>This user's vote is the one and only edit in Wikipedia.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- I vote to keep, but in my opinion the article needs a thorough cleanup, such as removing 75 external links to the critic's website (Wikipedia is not a link farm, nor should it be a marketing tool for any website), and I belive the article needs a thorough NPOV of the article, removing gossip, etc. --<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck_J_3fcb.html" title="User:Chuck J">Chuck</a> 21:12, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>ahem chuck, i found your mistake, you just took the number as shown in the article until a certain paragraph and thought this all must be links to critcs-sites. So what does that mean. 1.

You have no idea how much and how intensive your pro-rawat mates have collaborated in this special critics article 3.

Would you also include in that ban the "hate group" article (that characterizes ex-premies as a hate group) and the "Purported List of Hate Group" article, and all of the other articles in which people have also been involved in writing/editing, such as apostates, cults, anti-cult movement, etc.?</dd>

<dd>hello pjacobi, i see you have the same rough temper when it gets you as i have. I can understand that you want to have it simple, but unfortunately the interest of independend people in that matter is limited. I appreciate the effort of MBq concerning the "Lehre" Paragraph in the german scratchpage for example, but it is simply wrong and the content is indeed unencyclopedic.
