What is wrong with my page i will fix anything that you want. You have already deleted it once. I don't want you to delete my work again. I dont work for this company, i used to volunteer for them. I just want an entry for the ranch on wikipedia. -isoar4jc</p>
<ul>
<li>isoar4jc, if you want a wikipedia article that's kept, I'd suggest you look up the relevant policies at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what wikipedia is not</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability requirements</a> <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability guidelines</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">Notability criteria for organizations</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">Notability requirements for corporations</a>. I can appreciate your desire to have someplace important to you on wikipedia, and I think you could write a great article, but sometimes it's tough to sort the wheat from the chaff in Articles for Deletion. If you have any news articles, published material from a third party, or other references, it would be great to see them, otherwise the organization might not meet our requiremts as per <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">wikipedia:notability of organizations</a>. Remember that notability is not the same as importance, there are many things important to many people that, sadly, are not verifiable enough for wikipedia standards. If you need any help, just drop me a line. As it stands, I'd say <b>weak keep</b> contingent on the providing of sources. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, if no sources exist, then delete. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 06:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> As of now, the article does not show that the topic is notable. Unless notability is established, this should go. And Isoar, I too understand the desire to have an article on something you've been involved in, but not all things are important enough for articles. The problem in this case is not the writing and such, but rather the topic of the article itself doesn't seem important enough. If you can provide links from third party sources that show that the topic of this article is notable then it is more likely to be kept than if it remains as is. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:56, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Isoar, you'll need to supply links to the relevant news articles and those news articles must do more than merely mention the topic of this article; they'll need to discuss the topic enough so as to establish notability. These sources will also need to be cited in the article. If you can do this then I'm sure many of us who are voting for deletion would reconsider. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>fine delete it</b> your minds are made up. It is covered extensively on 100 Huntley Street, but since that is owned by crossroads, then you wont accept that. and most other news articles arent online they'd just be on local cannels or newspapers. I know alot of campers and volunteer staff who are visiting this page and would be very unhappy if it got deleted. isoar4jc 22:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC) And stop call in me Isoar it's isoar4jc no capital and complete UID brainiacs.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> isoar4JC: please don't get frustrated, and abbreviations of usernames are common, though they can be annoying no harm was meant I assure you. This debate is far from over, please don't give up and just leave. There appear to be some sources, if you can supply links OR MLA-format citations (for things that do not exist online) to third-party materials I'd be more than happy to include them. Despite the implication, online sources are not the only valid ones. I'd love to help you keep this, but I need your help in doing so. the SPCA materials appear to provide notability in my mind as well. Also: wikipedia sources are not considered viable, but if you can track down the sources on those other articles they may provide notability for the ranches as well. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 02:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>isoar4jc</b> My UID is already an abbreveation, an i'm just sick of peaple calling me isoar, sorry that you all caught the reaction to the same thing somewhere else. As to articles and news stuff, I am working on that, but its not as easy as you make it sound. I need to find stories aout specific camps which leads you on many wild goose chases. I'm currently on the trail of a huge news story about the rance in British Columbia being evacuated beacuse a forrest fire a couple years ago. (i was there when it happened, and the news crews were there to film the horses being evacuated) And have you ever heard of Shane Doan? He is the captain of the Phoenix Cyotes he was also the Captain of Team Canada in the last winter oylmpics. He is the son of Bernie and Bernise Doan who just happen to be the regional directors for the western camps, he was a camp kid. The stories exist but getting the specific articles is alot of work. Isoar4jc 03:18, 22 December 2006 (UTC) PS: Why are none of the other camps listed here under deletion review? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_summer_camps" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_summer_camps" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_summer_camps</a></li>

<dd>Isoar4jc, please don't be mad at people for further abbreviating your name for the sake of brevity; editors often will refer to people by only the first few letters of their name and mean no disrespect. That aside, regarding your above comment: often times if its really hard to track down sources on a topic like this, that is a good indication that the topic itself isn't notable enough to meet Wikipedia guidelines. Stories about a camp having to be evacuated because of a forest fire, for example, tell us nothing about the importance of the camp itself. If there aren't sources that can explicitly tell us why this particular camp is notable (ie., why it is especially important, as 'average' camps, whether religious or secular, are typically not notable enough to warrant articles) then we will probably remove the article on the camp because we have to have third party sources. Also, having the son of someone important being involved in something in no way makes that thing particularly notable. Finally, in regards to other articles on camps, any of them which don't establish notability should be nominated for AfDs. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:29, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
