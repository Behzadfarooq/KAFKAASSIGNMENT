<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br /></p>
<p>I should point out at the start the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxim.html" title="Maxim">maxim</a> that AfD is not a vote, but a debate. Whilst the weight of numbers will often be an essential part of a determination of consensus, particularly where questions of personal judgment are involved, mere weight of numbers will not overbear weight of arguments grounded in policy.</p>
<p>In determining the final consensus, the arguments of all unregistered users were disregarded.</p>
<p>The main arguments in favour of keeping the article were:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the article was adequately sourced,</li>
<li>that the subject was notable, and previous AfD debates had recognised this (some explicitly noted improvement in the article since the previous debates),</li>
<li>that the subject's lawsuit against the Wikimedia Foundation either made her notable, or was the cause of an invalid nomination for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main arguments in favour of deleting the article were:</p>
<ul>
<li>that Wikipedia demands a stricter standard of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourcing</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality of writing</a> with respect to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living persons</a> than it does generally,</li>
<li>that the subject was of marginal notability, having attracted no major media attention, and the article was of no importance within the encyclopaedia, being essentially an orphaned page,</li>
<li>that the sources used were either broadly unreliable sources such as blogs, message boards or rumour-based websites, or primary sources,</li>
<li>that the article did not present a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, in that it wasn't a "balanced biography" and was essentially "a recollection of a negative event".</li>
</ul>
<p>There was significant debate over whether Writer Beware constituted a reliable source or not. This was regarded by participants on both sides of the debate as a crucial source. Arguments included that the SFWA organisation behind the Writer Beware project had an existence as a reliable source beyond the Writer Beware blog, and that the blog was a "pet project" of a small group within the SFWA used to advance an agenda, and that Wikipedia risked becoming a soapbox for that agenda.</p>
<p>In determining the final consensus, arguments in relation to the lawsuit were given no weight. Arguments in relation to notability were given some weight, but given the strength of the positions on each side with respect to this point, these arguments had little substantive effect on the outcome. The most weight was given to arguments about the quality of sourcing of the article, and arguments based on other key content policies (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>).</p>
<p>Distributing weight accordingly, the outcome was in favour of deleting the article. The concerns about the quality of sourcing, and issues of NPOV and BLP, were not answered in the debate, and outweighed any weight of numbers in favour of keeping the article.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 06:17, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Page was delete as an attack page in June 2006, overturned for AFD at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=57117026&amp;oldid=57116376" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=57117026&amp;oldid=57116376" rel="nofollow">the first deletion review</a>. That <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barbara_Bauer_bf62.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Bauer">AFD</a> discussion came to a clear keep discussion. Shortly after she filed a lawsuit against several parties including the Wikimedia foundation (and the article was updated to reflect this), it was deleted again as "per WP:BLP article is a bloody disgrace. Full of 'allegations" of who said what on message boards . No mainstream media interest." Another <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_March_25_7998.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 March 25">deletion review</a> was started and aborted to wait to see if the foundation/<a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> would take official action. When it was stated that they would not, at least for now, a third <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_March_26_d477.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 March 26">deletion review</a> was started, and came to a clear overturn decision. There was enough concern about notability raised that the article is coming here for its second deletion review. There is quite a bit of discussion about reliability of sources in both of the two most deletion reviews. This is a technical nomination on my part, I have no opinion. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 23:54, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very strong Delete</b> utterly not notable - no mainstream media interest. She got a bad write-up from a writer's guild? So bloody what? And look at the text "There have been a <i>number of complaints on internet message boards</i> ... Bauer is also <i>alleged</i> to have made legal threats ... <i>especially on web sites</i>. <i>Reports</i> of this behaviour are <i>usually found on sites</i> maintained by people who <i>claim</i> to have received such threats. She is also <i>alleged</i> to have caused". 'Alleged', 'alleged', 'claimed' 'usually' 'reported' - it boils down to who said what on message boards. All on-line tittle-tattle, there is a great lack of real facts here, and nothing approaching verifiable notability.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> There is no RS for the matter at issue. The SFFWA site does not show anything except the inclusion of her on a list. Similarly for the NJ courts--the complaint would be a RS, but the site shows only the name on a list. This is not suitable under BLP. I think she is N, and I think the threat is N, and I think a well-thought of blog can be a RS for some things--but not for BLP. And there's no reason to think her N otherwise. There are still a few days for a source to appear. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:17, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The SFWA site makes general statements about all the names on the list, including Bauer. Those statements are quoted in the article, and are the basic source material. The Writer Beware blog is also a reliable source, being another publication of the same organisation, and supports the assertion that Bauer regularly makes legal threats and that her actions were involved in the (albeit temporary) closure of Absolute Write. These two sources are reliable and are adequate between them to support almost all of the information in the article. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 07:52, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Suing WP only makes her notable, if it indeed gets her noted. Where is the media interest? Where are the secondary sources? Being notable to the Wikipedia community internally doesn't count.

<dd>It's possible (though I don't think it's happened yet) that the suit will indeed make her notable through coverage in the media; not necessarily due to the Wikipedia/Wikimedia angle alone, but because of all the other defendants; if any of them put up a big fight it could throw off lots of sparks. The writer community will probably be interested in the outcome of the case against SFWA, for instance. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 02:42, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I can't really venture a definitive <s>vote</s> opinion one way or the other. A previous AfD found her (barely) notable enough, though it's fairly marginal. The lawsuit may increase her notability, but this hasn't yet actually occurred. There's a decent chance that the article will some day need to be resurrected if deleted, but we're not a crystal ball. However, she does have some degree of notability / notoriety, so keeping the article isn't a completely bizarre choice now either. Any deletion now should be without prejudice, given that circumstances may (even quite soon now) necessitate overturning such a decision. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 15:51, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Utterly unnotable. There is no indication of notability present in the article. Blog mentions are not basis for notability, and according to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> are not reliable sources and should be removed from the article altogether. A lawsuit that has no coverage by any secondary sources is not even remotely sufficient to make her notable, or we'd have to include every single person on the planet who has ever filed a lawsuit. The fact that it was made against the Wikimedia Foundation is meaningless. There are people who have sued far more important organizations and companies than the WMF who don't have articles. The top twenty listing does not in and of itself make her notable; in fact I haven't been able to find articles for any of the other 19 companies listed. If policy is followed and the information cited to the blogs is removed, than the only information remaining would be the mention in the top twenty listing and an nonnotable lawsuit. That doesn't even come close to warranting an article at all.

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b> The lawsuit is a direct result of Jules H. writing this article in the first place. It's defamatory on its face. He used Wikipedia for his personal crusade against non noteable literary agents who haven't legally defrauded anyone to date. That may be a small point to a partisan, not not in the law. This is all about blogland, Internet writing forums and cliques of users who want to score points with blogging editors at publishing houses under the guise of ridding the world of scammers who charge fees and perform badly in the business. This just isn't a crime or a notable person in the way Amanda Urban is a notable literary agent. My protests have been steadfast on this issue alone from the beginning.

The warning I left on your talk page is standard procedure when a user blanks the content of a page without consensus for that to be done. In this case it was aggravated by the fact that there was a notice at the top of the page specifically instructing editors not to blank the page while this discussion is taking place.

<dd>Nor does it make a reliable source on its face and since it's a volunteer job, it's not an actual business with telecommuters. It's a vanity effort, no matter how valuable and just. The fact in contention here is notability. Bauer is a small time agent with no clientele of note in publishing. Therefore, she is not notable. You saying she is doesn't make it so. Maybe Jimo Wales will thatnk you for getting him sued? By the way, these are all the very same players as before on the keep side.

<dd>Folks, can we please end the sniping here? If Doc says he did not notice the mention of the lawsuit when he speedied the article, then a protracted argument over what happened, when and why is irrelevant to the issue at hand (i.e. whether the article should be kept or deleted on the basis of notability, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> etc.), and needlessly pushes the boundaries of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. That also goes for arguments about why it was written in the first place. Clearly, there is room for reasonable, intelligent Wikipedians to strongly disagree about whether the article should exist, and what it needs to make it acceptable if indeed it is retained. That's plenty to deal with without dissecting each other's actions and presumed motives.

<li><b>Keep.</b> - as others have mentioned, Bauer was considered notable in the first AFD, and since then the article has improved considerably, with more balance and reliable sources. The most important source is SFWA's Writer Beware site, which although it has an official blog as an outgrowth is not a blog in and of itself. The fact that Bauer has sued WF, SFWA and others is part of her notability, since her reported past attempts to suppress unfavorable attention with threats of legal action were what originally set her apart from the other agents on the Twenty Worst list. I suspect it is early days to expect mainstream coverage of the lawsuit, and I understand that we cannot decide on the basis of a prediction of future press attention. However, the sources already given in the article should be more than sufficient to establish notability. As for much of the article being negative, it is nevertheless scrupulously sourced, stated as neutrally as possible, and offset by as much positive material as could be reasonably found. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is not, I think, intended to require that no negative material ever be mentioned under any circumstances. -- <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 00:32, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Exhibit A as provided in the above link bears repeating in this light: "keep deleted. The Barbara Bauer article was one of several articles created on Wikipedia in May 2006 by User:JulesH for the stated purpose of, "I just feel that the information about them provided by the SFWA should be disseminated more widely". The sole basis for these articles (the others have been deleted) was a list on a website that does not provide data to back-up their claims, thus making it impossible for Wikipedians to verify the website's claims. This one website source is not the basis for posting rumors about a living person on Wikipedia, even if the claims are true. I do not understand all the "inside" talk (by Wikipedia editors who know the parties involved in real-world disputes with Barbara Bauer) on the Talk:Barbara Bauer and related pages, but it is clear that there is a group of editors who have collaborated to keep negative information about Barbara Bauer on Wikipedia, using only blogs and other unreliable internet sources in their citations. These "owners" of the article have been repeatedly challenged by other Wikipedians who pointed out that use of unreliable sources is a violation of Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons. The original attempt to delete the Barbara Bauer article was held off under the condition that the article would be built using reliable sources (Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Bauer), however the unreliable website sources were retained. The only reason this page exists is to repeat the claims of an unreliable website source that does not provide evidence for its claims, only a set of conclusions. There is no reason for Wikipedia to repeat these conclusions other than the desire of a few Wikipedia editors to use Wikipedia as a mechanism for amplifying the conclusions of the other website. This is not a basis for building a Wikipedia article about a living person, even if the claims are true. This has nothing to do with responding to "spurious legal threats". There are thousands of webpages that make unverifiable claims about living people. Wikipedia is not here as a mechanism for amplifying those claims. In my view, the link to "Writer Beware" at Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America should be enough coverage of this issue for Wikipedia. --JWSchmidt 18:33, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The stated purposes of wikipedia is to collect information from reliable sources into a single work to make them more readily accessible. The fact that the reason for creating this article was to include some particular information from a particular reliable source is reason to delete it how? Again, I repeat my comments from the deletion review: Wikipedia does not require its sources to provide hard data. It only requires them to have checked the data themselves and be reputable and trustworthy. The condition you mention was not actually imposed as a condition of the previous AfD discussion: the result was "keep" not "keep pending improvement of sourcing". <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 15:01, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Furthermore, she has used Wikipedia as a soapbox to disparage some people in violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (See <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Elwood_0945.html" title="Roger Elwood">Roger Elwood</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Elwood&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10692310" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Elwood&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10692310" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) and to promote others, including herself and her husband, in violation of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. For those reasons we should be very careful about using Nielsen Hayden as a source or a judge of notability. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 18:53, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm afraid I don't see the relevance of somebody's past infringements of Wikipedia rules (presumably due to ignorance of them and a simple desire to improve Wikipedia: the content I see introduced seems not to be disputed by anybody, only the lack of sourcing is inappropriate) to whether or not something they have published externally to Wikipedia is an acceptable source. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 20:57, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Blogs are not normally considered reliable sources. Some folks, here and elsewhere, have asserted that Nielsen Hayden is an exception and I disagree with that assessment. Her agenda-driven behavior on Wikipedia mirrors her blog writing. While her blog is certainly a good reflection of her opinions, it should not be used as a source for objective truth. And the fact that she has written about this subject does not, by itself, make this subject notable. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 21:32, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
