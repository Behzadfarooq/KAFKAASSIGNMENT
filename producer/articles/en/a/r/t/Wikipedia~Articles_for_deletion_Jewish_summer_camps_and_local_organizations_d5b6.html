<p>Two or three days ago <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">User:PZFUN</a> was nominating some Judaism-related articles for deletion during stub-cleaning. Together with mostly summer camps he inexplicably managed to list a number of rather notable Hasidic rebbes. Predictably this led to some nasty finger pointing and name-calling on the administators' noteboard and on AfD itself.</p>
<p>The full helping of bile is <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Nomination_by_PZFUN.2C_and_Speedy_keep_of_several_articles_by_Slimvirgin" title="WP:AN/I">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Featured_Article_Editor_being_attacked_for_cleaning_out_a_stub_category" title="WP:AN/I">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am re-listing the articles (minus the rebbes of couse) here in the hope to restore civility. Intentionally no rationale is given why any article might be delete-worthy. Please read the articles and make your statement on the worth of the article itself. Rude remarks and blanket statements are discouraged, those are never helpful. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 02:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I consider it highly impolite at best to remove with a keystroke all the efforts of many, who commented and voted on many of these AfD's. I think the vast majority of the comments were very civil and objective. To start from scratch, tossing away many hours of work by many caring people because there was <i>suspicion</i> of POV or GF on the part of the nominator (which I believe proved to be a false alarm) is simply wrong. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:46, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree. I think all the previous noms should be closed as either no consensus, or reopened where they were. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The votes at the various VfD for the articles were going along fine until the Dr. came along. There was absolutely NO acrimony on the voting pages themselves, everything was very civil. The results would have been either "no consensus" or "keep" because enough "keep" votes had already come in. Almost ALL those who voted "keep" gave far more detailed and researched reasons than those who voted "delete". It is puzzling, to say the least, why this new very unusual listing is now needed. Those who have voted on those VfD pages should be informed that this move was taking place. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 03:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree about the civility, though not necessarily about the potential outcome. Personally I think there should be consistent WP policies about all clubs and organizations and their grouping, if any. But leaving that aside, I totally agree that this re-listing is most improper. The work product invested by people by researching each case and voting, and the ensuing <i>civil</i> discussions, cannot just be tossed aside on someone's whim. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:16, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is all silly, wikipedia is big enough for all of these jewish summer camps. Camps for Jews are an important part of both european and american jewish history. 24.60.163.16 05:21, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is all <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and never should have happened. PZFUN deserves to be blocked. But now we're here it may be useful to review these cases, as summer camps have intrinsic notability and WP:V problems. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 07:21, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is time to stop the crusade against perfectly non-obtrusive and non-offensive articles about legitimate topics. What is the problem with keeping them? That Wikipedia will be more complete?? Keep them all and let people improve the articles. -- <a href="../../../o/l/v/User%7EOlve_f6a5.html" title="User:Olve">Olve</a> 08:00, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Is there any reason why these shouldn't be merged into ... oooh, lets say Jewish summer camps and local organizations. A paragraph mentioning what they generally have in common (constituency, activities, staffing), and then a list with locations and any <i>truly</i> important distinctions noted there. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>GWO: It's simple, because there are too many of them, they are very diverse, and they have different histories and facts surrounding them. Basically all the information about them would not fit into a normal page. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some of them are unique, but a lot are basically the same. <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Galil_1437.html" title="Camp Galil">Camp Galil</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Gesher_8ba0.html" title="Camp Gesher">Camp Gesher</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Miriam_5003.html" title="Camp Miriam">Camp Miriam</a> -- are these <i>really</i> more different than they are similar? Their differences could easily be summarised in a list / table at Habonim Dror summer camps. Much of the additional information is completely superfluous. I mean, do we really need to know where <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Gesher_8ba0.html" title="Camp Gesher">Camp Geshers</a> flagpole is, or how many baseball diamonds each camp has? -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>GWO: Obviously we are not focusing on the "flagpoles", the point is not just what you and I may think of these camps, it's obvious that there are plenty of other readers who are delighted to get this information and anything else that can be added to it in the years to come. In the USA going to summer camp is almost a way of life for many Jewish kids, it's part of their fun connection to Judaism in many ways, and it cannot be minimized and should not be trivialized and certainly should not be deleted. Wikipedia's servers can handle it. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:45, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry. I was under the impression this was an encyclopedia, not a holiday brochure. Playing softball is a way of life for lots of Americans: are we to allow every softball team a page. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>Oh come on GWO: Have you honsetly read <i>all</i> 1,200,000+ articles on Wikipedia? When all the articles about <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porn_star.html" title="Porn star">Porn stars</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudity.html" title="Nudity">Nudity</a> will go then I can start comparing things here to the Britanicca, but for now, <i>all</i> decent information is more than welcome as far as most people are concerned. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:27, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm all for including notable pornstars, notable summer camps and notable nudity. But the criteria for inclusion is notability, not usefulness to kids planning their vacations. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
<li>So what it boils down to then is what values to go by, those that value porn stars and nudists (what's notable about filth? -- it's like measuring garbage) or those that value Jewish children (who are inherently precious) and the notable institutions that serve them. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 15:01, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Our apologies; we missed the part on the Wikipedia Main Page where Wikipedia's adherence to some interpretation of Judeo-Christian "moral values" was cited. Until it does appear, however, I'm afraid the standards for inclusion for this (or, likely, for any other) encyclopedia will revolve around verifiability and notability before it does any utterly POV-ridden concept such as "values." <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:40, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmmm. I'm tempted to register wholesomepedia.org and filthopedia.org, and see which gets more contributors. Pornography is massive influence on world culture -- whether IZAK likes it or not. Jewish summer camps, not so much. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is an excellent example of what is wrong with AfD right now. It appears most if not all of these were nominated with no attempt to discuss the problems with these articles on the individual talk pages. Granted, what we have here are a number of summer camps and clubs, which in my opinion fall well short of current inclusion guidelines and the vast majority of them should likely be deleted if you look at them on their merits, independent of the issues surrounding the nominations. Still, if a reasonable effort had been made to discuss these articles individually this whole mess could have possibly been avoided; or at least some civility could have been retained during the AfD process.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:38, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wonder if there is any good way to announce mass nominations of articles. One can discuss the merits of an individual article on a talk page, sure, but what would one do when one goes spring-cleaning with, say, ten summer camps, or student societies or porno starlets? <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 17:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No there really isn't a good way... which is why mass noms are not the best idea. I understand the concept if it being easier to look at a bunch of similar articles together... but really, best practice is to individually nominate and discuss each article on its merits. Mass nominations just always end up being acrimonious.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:34, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are a lot of articles on American Jewish summer camps appearing on wikipedia, many of do not appear to be very notable: <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Modin_17b7.html" title="Camp Modin">Camp Modin</a>, for one. If these articles are to stay on wikipedia then I would suggest that new articles be made, perhaps one for each US state, in which information about the camps in those areas can be placed, rather than having this huge number pages on camps, most of them not exceeding about 250 words in size. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Martinp23</a> 18:48, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I disagree. Camp Modin is one of the oldest Jewish camps in the US and was the inspiration for a recent feature film. We need many more articles like this, not less. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:56, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The fact is that many of these articles are onyl a few hundred words long, and should either be expanded or amalgamated. With all the camps from a state in one article, it will be easier for the reader too compare the camps, and look and Judaism in these areas. The more notable camps shoudl have their articles extended. <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Agawam_94db.html" title="Camp Agawam">Camp Agawam</a> is really a tiny article which should be combined with others into a new article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Martinp23</a> 21:09, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please expand them then if you think they need more information. However, I would be happy to see stubs on every camp in the US, even the non-Jewish ones. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:12, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Grouping by state is a poor taxonomy, as I see no reason that geographic location (certainly on a scale smaller then "regional") would significantly differentiate them. If anything, group them by ideology/mission. Better yet, have a single article. --<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmagedman_ad26.html" title="User:Nmagedman">Nmagedman</a> 23:31, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> As per <a href="../../../b/r/e/WP%7EBREAK_aee2.html" title="WP:BREAK">WP:BREAK</a>, a Best Current Practice for page development is to start with a single page, to create sections as needed, and to fork those sections off into their own articles as the parent article matures. Here, however, we find a large number of stub articles with little indication of their <i>individual</i> importance. Repeatedly, the argument was made below that the camps are notable because they have been around for many years and have had an impact on many peoples' lives. I accept that argument for the camps as a whole, but see no justification for articles on each individual camp. I therefore propose that the camp articles be merged into e.g. Jewish-American camp movement discussing the <i>significance of these camps (as a whole) on the Jewish-American experience/culture</i>, with sub-sections for each camp indicating how it <i>substantively</i> contributed to or differentiated itself from the rest of the movement. --<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmagedman_ad26.html" title="User:Nmagedman">Nmagedman</a> 23:31, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I fully agree with this - just because they have affected lots of people doesn't make them notable. There are many people in the world, teachers and doctors for example, who have had a HUGE impact on many peoples' lives, but are not considered for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Martinp23</a> 16:28, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Jewish summer camps do not merely "impact peoples' lives" in the secular sense of "having fun" or whatever. These camps are an integral part of the Jewish cultural experience. They are not just about playing baseball or swimming in the lake. Those things might happen, but the main purpose is to provide a place where Jewish children and youth can affirm their Jewishness in an accepting, positive environment. As such, they are more akin to feminist retreats or GLBT retreats or some other cultural minority that does not always feel accepted or able to be "out" in the greater society. Those of you who did not grow up Jewish in America (or Canada, in the case of some camps) cannot truly understand the experience, anymore that a heterosexual can truly understand what it feels like to be gay in a homophobic society. If these were gay or feminist camps, would we even be having this conversation? Because the pattern of these delete nominations -- and not just camps, there have been others! -- has been to target Jews or Jewish institutions that might not be known in the general public, but are nevertheless as important in the Jewish experience as a lot of other things I've never even heard of that are still here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 01:44, 24 May 2006 (UTC)Rooster613</li>

<li>"Going Down The Pub" is an integral part of the "British cultural experience". Doesn't mean my local pub deserves an article. One can write about the importance of Jewish Summer Camps as a social construct without detailing each individual camp. I'd love to see such an article. Of course, writing such an article is <i>hard</i>, and requires research. Merely enumerating and describing each camp is easy, and pointless.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> [note: I voted Merge above. Since the thread has grown from there, I'm adding this rather than striking what I have above.] There are at least a couple hundred articles on various summer camps on Wikipedia, not to mention high schools and everybody's pet organization. Personally, I think they are <i>all</i> NN rubbish and have no place in an encyclopedia. However, it is a waste of energy to repeat the "Are summer camps encyclopedic?" debate on <i>each and every</i> camp article on WP. Hash out the debate in a guideline discussion. Once a standard is agreed upon, then sweep through all the camp articles, applying the standard equally. In the meantime, I would not be averse to flagging these (and all) camp articles with {{importance}}. --<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmagedman_ad26.html" title="User:Nmagedman">Nmagedman</a> 08:20, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Notability is Relative</b>: By any rule of logic, reason, and fairness, one should not short-circuit the system by nominating articles for deletion, when what certain articles may need is improvement and sources, and one needs to step back from one's own mind-set and think of entire groups of articles that may be important in other contexts. I did NOT write the articles on this page up for VfDs but nevertheless if enough people feel that these topics (about Jewish Summer Camps) are important enough to write them up, it must mean that many young parents or campers or people out there WANT to read about them, so that in itself makes these articles worthy of being defended. <b>A lot of the shouting about "notable" is bogus because notability is a relative concept</b>, and as I have stated, when the day comes that Wikipedia will do away with articles about porn stars and nudity I will know that it has become a "real" encyclopedia. <b>Why are Jewish Summer camps "not notable"?</b> They play a major and very significant role in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Jewish kids growing up in North America for two months out of every year. Jewish kids love their camp experiences more than they like school. Camp fees for two months are often the equivalent of an entire year's yeshiva or day school tuition, so summer camps are important features of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_education.html" title="Jewish education">Jewish education</a> and life! In fact it's surprising that there are so few of these articles, there will surely be more by new editors unaware of this fuss who will just write new articles in the future. Sure, the articles are wishy-washy and are obviously often written by people who want to get attention, but how is that different to other areas? Sure, in the Jews and Judaism sections we have articles that need work, is that not true everywhere on Wikipedia? There are editors who have spent hundreds of hours devoted to improving the articles, but they are few in number and it will take time, maybe even years. It is not wise to ignore the broader picture and to not take the long-term view, and "delete on sight". <b>There is now a new self-justifying rationale that one can just skip the "needs improvement" requests on article pages and just put "VfD" on them with the excuse that they just are doing it to "get the attention" of other editors -- "The New Deletionism"</b>. To expect action and solutions within days is not realistic. It will take months and years to improve things. <b>Writing and editing takes time, not to mention all the man-hours spent on debates and discussions on talk pages on Wikipedia.</b> Wikipedia has come a long way, and there is a long way to go yet, but we should not let deletionists to throw the baby out with the bathwater with articles in the name of making Wikipedia more "encyclopedic" when in fact, notability is relative, and more caution and care is called for. Wikipedia is not a "finished product", it is definitely a "work of art in progress" and no works of art are produced overnight. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 16:27, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Holy living shit. You really believe that wikipedia will be improved if it discards everything that does not fit your moral code. That's a scary, scary, scary idea. Thank God you're in a minority of one. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>GWO: Who the heck said anything about a "moral code"??? I was citing examples to make a point, that while some people think that porn stars are notable, others do not, and by the same token while some people think that summer camps are important and notable others do not. That's it in a nutshell. If I was truly worried about "moral codes" I would spend my time someplace else other than Wikipedia. I am not detached from reality, so please don't make it sound like that. Not everyone sees things the same way. There all kinds of "encyclopedias" out there, depending on one's <i>interests</i>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 17:23, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>while some people think that porn stars are notable, others do not</i> -- and you're telling me that your railing against porn and nudity (nudity&#160;?!?) isn't based on morals but ... what, exactly? Incidentally, if you think wikipedia's going to become cleanopedia, I suggest you investigate how <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomis.html" title="Bomis">Bomis</a> makes its money. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>GWO: So you think that Bomis's X-rated history should guide the fate of Wikipedia? Anyhow, it's a poor argument to believe that because Bomis is what it is that therefore Wikipedia is the same. People are free to be <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">moral</a>, <b>im</b>moral, or <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amorality.html" title="Amorality"><b>a</b>moral</a>, but that is also not the point of my argument which you insist on twisting. My point is that "notability" does not have the same meaning or definition in all situations and is not the same for all people, something which should be very obvious but which is often ignored. One could just as clearly say that while some people may think that different species of rare insects may be "notable", for those who couldn't care less about bugs, "bug xyz" crawling in the Mojave Desert is simply <i>not</i> notable -- whereas something that does interest them, like the things that revolve around the education and development of children, such as Summer camps, <i>is</i> extremely notable. My only argument here is that the notion of <b>notability is relative</b>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 18:04, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>My point is that "notability" does not have the same meaning or definition in all situations and is not the same for all people, something which should be very obvious but which is often ignored.</i> -- No. Your point is further than that. Your point is that notability is relative, but <i>your</i> concept of it is the one that should apply to wikipedia. i.e. remove the famous, notorious, filthy, obscene, unpleasant-but-widely-known pornstars whom you find so distasteful, but keep the non-famous-but-thoroughly-wholesome summer camps because they're so super-important (at least to the middle-class Jewish boys from the midwest to whom they cater). My point (if I still have one) is that that's hilarious. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
<li>GWO: What may be "hilarious" to you is pathetic to someone else. No need to make fun of "middle-class Jewish boys from the midwest" which I would say could be construed as a very offensive statement or worse, don't you think? Oh my, why do you put words into my mouth. I have never proposed <i>any</i> of the things that you attribute to me. I was pointing to examples of differences of perspective that prove that there can <i>never</i> be a universal standard to guide notability. Not everyone watches or has an interest in porn stars, nor should they, but the only thing that I have maintained is that no-one on Wikipedia or anywhere can decide upon universal rules for notability, nothing more and nothing less, and please do not attribute words to me that I have not stated specifically. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 19:23, 26 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>GWO: <i>No need to make fun of "middle-class Jewish boys from the midwest"</i> -- I didn't make fun of them, or even say anything derogatory about them, except to say that an individual camp that caters exclusively to them might not be particularly notable. So take your faux-outrage and implications of anti-semitism and go and write a good article about the cultural importance of Jewish Summer Camps, and fewer descriptions off their individual amenities. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - Setting aside dogmatic debates between deletionists and inclusionists, I think that a) the fact that an article is still a stub does not make the topic non-notable; and b) it takes some nerve to nominate for deletion articles that the nominator clearly has no knowledge, and in some cases didn't even read. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 00:14, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Saberwyn: Why don't you put those questions on the article's talk page and contact those who care about it and jog them along. There is no point in demanding "instant information" like pouring oneself a fresh cup of instant coffee for instant gratification. Gathering more information takes time and writing takes time. Articles need time to develop, and they need to have the basics in place, put there by previous editors that will take things to the next stage. This article is a respectable beginning. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:36, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Because I feel that these questions are directly related to your suggested reason for inclusion.

<ul>
<li>Goodness Saberwyn, there is no offence here whatsoever. Kindly note that I did <i>not</i> write these articles nor would I, as they are not in my real area of interest, but when I see that others have bothered to write up these kind of things and post them I therefore conclude that they are important and deserve further patience and scrutinity, and that they do not deserve to be "evicted" just because they are about children. You will find that articles dealing with children's topics will often sound and come across as somewhat "childish" or "simplistic" but that is no reason to get rid of them. They are important and it is NOT realistic to expect that these articles should conform to the standards of a sophisticated child psycholoogy magazine. Wikipedia is for everyone, it is not an encyclopedia for super-specialists who will doubtless look elsewhere for their information in any case. When ordinary people log on, they want to read ordinary articles about ordinary subjects, and the more sophisticated editors on Wikipedia should not lose sight of that reality. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 15:14, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Uniqueness is generally not particularly sufficient. I see that it has been around 50 years which is pretty good, but I'm sure that a lot of ethnic/religious youth groups have also been around that length of time and are not regarded as being notable. I agree that the sources are reliable, but I'm also sure that many regional religous/ethnic group magazines will make a noticeboard section about their youth programs so to speak. What is the size of this camp, for instance. Did it win awards for its social work? At the moment the articel is long but seems to have been inflated by large amounts of material which seems like a camp programme/manual/calendar/schedule.`<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Blnguyen_21c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Blnguyen">review me</a> 07:26, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

A run of the mill camp does not have the <i>only</i> synagogue in Winnipeg Beach. The same camp would not be the <i>only</i> Hebrew immersion camp in Western Canada. The same camp would not be the <i>only</i> sleep-away Jewish camp in Manitoba. If this article reads to much like an add, it needs to be cleaned up, not deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> The camp is known through most of North America, though it is a Canadian camp a lot of Americans have attended and are attending.

A camp like <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Massad_68d5.html" title="Camp Massad">Camp Massad</a> is unique in its programming and location, therefore the article should be kept so that other people that might hear about it can look at the article and know what the camp is all about.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Without repeating all the previous information, I agree that camp massad is an important aspect of the Jewish community of Manitoba and Canada. It is a great place for children to connect to their Judaism to help teach about their own religion. It is very important this article stays posted since it discusses the programs and everything that occurs and is very informative on it. This is the most positive information I have seen on one camp in a long time. It is very informative without being too personal. Please consider this for the camp's benefit before you take it down.

When you speak of something as wideranging as wikipedia, who's to say that one article is more significant than another. This page and this camp are obviously important enough in the lives and history of the many people who have passed through it's gates in the many years this camp has been around.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not about to vote delete yet, but I can't agree with some of the rationales being offered in support of keeping the article. <i>One of three camps supported by the Cohen foundation</i>: why is this notable? I don't think we have an article about the Cohen Foundation. <i>Site of famous 1998 fire</i>: the fire occurred off-season, was confined to only one building and, fortunately, caused no injuries. <a href="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980312/FP_001.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980312/FP_001.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> This is not the stuff of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Category%7EFires_845d.html" title="Category:Fires">Category:Fires</a>, and I doubt the camp would consider the fact that they had a fire 8 years ago as a justification for listing them in an encyclopedia. In fact, I can find no Internet references to this fire other than three articles in the local newspaper (the one I just mentioned and <a href="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980314/HA_004.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980314/HA_004.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, <a href="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980714/HA_005.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980714/HA_005.htm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>). Again, that's the local newspaper. I can't find any references to the camp at all in the New York Times or Washington Post archives. <i>Pulitzer Prize winning Eagle-Tribune</i>: Yes, the Eagle-Tribune has won two Pulitzer Prizes, but they had nothing to do with this camp or the fire. I don't think a Pulitzer Prize conveys encyclopedicity to everything a newspaper ever has or will report on. ... I don't know enough about this camp to say it's non-notable, but I don't think the keep voters should exaggerate the importance of the camp and significance of this article. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:31, 23 May 2006 (UTC)
