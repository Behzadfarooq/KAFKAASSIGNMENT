<li><b>Keep</b> (Please not that i am from Germany, so expect no perfect English.) it deserves its own entry here, as this story represents "Teen Titans Revolution".</li>
</ul>
<p>It features many Aspects which are untouched in the Comics and the Show of Teen Titans. And as a constantly Reader of this Masterpiece, i can say that it stands with Show and Comics on the same Quality level or more surpasses it, in Dimension that are not possible in Comics or Show. extra mentioned should be the incredible lenght and the Fan Support for it, own Forum, Reviews Count and so on.</p>

<li>Actually, if you go to the end of the results, you'll see that as far as unique results go, there are about 50. That said, how notable is "notable enough"? Last I checked, there was nothing in the Wikipedia deletion policy that said an article's subject matter has to have above <i>x</i> Alexa rank, or more than <i>y</i> Google hits. Some things are obvious cruft: an article about a character from a work of fan fiction for example. In cases like this, where the subject is <i>an internet community</i>, I think that the term is inappropriate. Look at <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a>. Is this article of minimal interest to non-fans? I submit that it is not. I also feel that the fact that an article <i>contains</i> a list of neologisms does not necessarily make it deletable. It is pretty clear on the deletion policy page that the policy against neologisms is against the <i>coining</i> of neologisms. The policy is in fact against original research. To say that the inclusion in an article of preexisting neologisms which are heavily associated with the subject is unambiguous grounds for deletion is extremely foolish. In that case, I can go to any article I dislike and add a list of "common" terms, and in minutes, someone will surely VfD it. Somehow, I think not. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistercow_17cc.html" title="User:Mistercow">Mistercow</a> 15:32, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, that was badly said.

Using "any" makes that sound like something entirely different, sorry. However, I still think that perhaps Tony could leave a little more room for <i>others</i> to make their input, and let freedom of speech have less of a volume factor.

<dd>Hi, Splash and all, please bear with me. First, I emphasize again that I did have high standards for the persons I included in my list (others have added some other people I am trying to have moved to more appropriate lists). "The exact solutions book" is the monograph by Stephani et al. cited in <a href="../../../e/x/a/Exact_solutions_in_general_relativity.html" title="Exact solutions in general relativity">Exact solutions in general relativity</a>; this monograph is widely regarded as a standard reference in this field.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you have an account on the <a href="../../../a/r/x/ArXiv_671d.html" title="ArXiv">arXiv</a> you can check that Alan Barnes of Acton University has quite a few papers there, so the Barnes I described certainly does publish research papers on gtr. I'd caution you against assuming that someone employed at a university which doesn't offer physics courses cannot have an active research career in physics, since this Alan Barnes is obviously a counterexample! Academic jobs are hard to come by (especially in Britain, or so I am told), so some talented persons may choose to accept a seemingly inappropriate teaching job in order to remain in the profession in which they have been highly trained. Also, on occasion, quite distinguished retired professors have been known appointments with small colleges, simply so that they can teach from time to time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, I now guess the A. Barnes I had in mind is an older person by the same name, and yes, I should have checked more carefully that I had the right A. Barnes. I have tried to contact by email Alan Barnes from Acton University to see if I can clarify this situation. I may may not have made a mistake, but if so, it was an honest mistake. (What does "cruft" mean?)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the best fix would be to let me correct the page once I have information about the A. Barnes cited in the monograph (some of these papers are widely regarded as important), rather than simply deleting it.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 22:33, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand: I would argue that many of wikipedia's articles are long, drawn-out definitions. The article does give more information than a simple dictionary definition.

<ul>
<li>I fall somewhere in between. An encyclopedia entry should be more than a long version of a dictionary entry. But this is certainly more than a dictionary definition. The first paragraph? Yes. A dictionary definition. The second? Not so much. Keep in mind also that the deletion policy states that we should delete articles that "Can never be more than a dictionary definition". Platitude certainly can. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistercow_17cc.html" title="User:Mistercow">Mistercow</a> 22:36, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I still feel that the article is more than a dicdef even in its current form. I think if anything it is borderline, but what it gives in terms of example and analysis of example gives more value than just a definition would. That said, I'd like to see it cleaned up a bit, and the analysis expanded. I'd also like to see it modified to more closely reflect the actual definition of platitude (a statement of deep content which has <i>become</i> meaningless through overuse). Examples of further expansion: history of cultural context, influences on philosophical thought, etc. I'm not saying the article is good, but it's a start, and the topic has potential. If it doesn't get deleted, I'll perhaps do some work on it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistercow_17cc.html" title="User:Mistercow">Mistercow</a> 01:20, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki to Wiktionary</b> per StradivariusTV. The way to fix a long, drawn-out dicdef is to get rid of the unnecessary cruft — then what you have is a <i>concise</i> dicdef. The article in question is equivalent to "platitude (n.) A statement of little or no worth, usually meant to encourage or inspire. From Greek <i>foo</i> 'flat'." — and if you go to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/platitude" class="extiw" title="wikt:platitude">Wiktionary</a>, you'll see that a similar definition (with the <i>correct</i> etymology) is already there! --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 20:12, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> They did not actually exhibit at MoMA. The show is at P.S.1, a much smaller affiliate. This year alone, the showing this group is involved in (The "Greater NY 2005") includes 160 artists, with the express purpose of displaying works by <i>new</i>, <i>little known</i> groups/individuals. Almost by definition, being featured in this exhibition categorizes a participant as not yet notable, although singled out (albeit in a rather large group) by the art world as having potential. To continue the metaphor of music groups, potential isn't enough. Call this their first major showing. If they can keep it up, then sure, an article would be appropriate.

Tesoro's drama program is slightly better than average for the surrounding community, but its nothing special enough to deserve a wiki. (And I'm saying this even though I go to Tesoro) I hate to say this, but the Tesoro drama kids who created this page just want their names to be on Wikipedia for minor recognition.

<li>Well for starters the grounds "Not notable" is not valid for VFD. Not to mention the fact that yes these people are indeed notable as most are referred to in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colditz_Castle_4245.html" title="Colditz Castle">Colditz Castle</a> article I turned into a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">FA</a> (using exactly this kind of "not notable" detail). I find it extremely amusing that the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> article which has <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html#See_also" title="Harry Potter">several spinoff lists</a>, in particular a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_the_Harry_Potter_books_62e8.html" title="List of characters in the Harry Potter books">list of characters</a> (all of which are fictional) is perfectly acceptable, yet a spinoff list of <i>REAL PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY LIVED</i> goes up for vfd.

<li>I am baffled. I have no idea why anyone thinks I am trying to punish anyone about anything. I will admit that I had not looked at the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colditz_Castle_4245.html" title="Colditz Castle">Colditz Castle</a> article and just happened to run across this, but if I <i>had</i> encountered that article, I would most certainly have begun a discussion on the Talk page as to why this information was necessary. Since the information is now all that exists in the article under discussion, then, yes, VfD is the appropriate place to discuss the matter. Why would I want to punish anyone with whom I have had no dealings, and wouldn't anyone who has worked on any article under VfD discussion also be annoyed? Why is annoyance at this article being listed here be of any more significance than the annoyance of any other person at their information being listed for deletion? Please, everyone, calm down, I am not trying to start a war or even an argument, just a discussion.

<ul>
<li>Sorry but VFD is not the place to start the discussion. First the talk page, then to RFC, and THEN to VFD is the appropriate order, If you are unsure its always best to ask other people first, get a few opinions, ask the writers of the article on the appropriate talk page FIRST. VFD should be the LAST place to go to discuss article content, unless its obviously junk like User:XYZ's Band's Fan page. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 05:22, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

"For the purpose of the list below, notable is strictly defined as being very likely to get a consensus to keep if listed on VFD. Similarly, not notable is defined as being very likely to get a consensus to delete if listed on VFD." I'm straddling the fence on this one. It seems to me that the article is right on the borderline between "notable" and "not notable". Does anybody have any precedents they'd like to use? I'm currently leaning towards "not notable", and suggesting that ALKIVAR and Osomec think about starting a website dedicated to Colditz Castle for such trivia (which could be linked to from the Colditz Castle article). But it could well be that ALKIVAR's and Osomec's rudeness is coloring my judgement.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A list of those who tried to prevent the escapes is as useful as the unchallenged lists of those who escaped and attempted to escape from Colditz castle during WWII.

Without access to the books listed as sources, none of it can be trusted; of no use to scholars or researchers. None of the sources look like official German personnel manifests.

<li>If the descendants were to do that directly, their additions would probably be dismissed as unverifiable, and rightly so. The additional information would have to come from books. There's probably much more to be written about Nazism and its appeal to many people, but perhaps not very much more in the way of Colditzcruft that's waiting to be published: as a sizable and apparently insatiable market for works about Nazi trivia (uniforms, etc etc) has existed for years, there has long been a big commercial incentive to publish. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:17, August 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree entirely with <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a>'s reasoning, but we come to the same conclusion. Munson seems happy to use Wikipedia for publicity, but objects to having an objective biography. The information that <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">User:Hall Monitor</a> and I have recently adde to the article is relevant, ordinary biographical info- year of birth, colleges, name of blog. This is all material that Munson himself posts on the web currently, so his claims of invasion of privacy are preposterous. Munson has posted, repeatedly, his address on the web. This article merely said what city he is in. However, since the subject demands control of his articles to his own personal tastes, and since he is marginally notable, I say we <b>delete</b> this article and then his other projects. He says the articles are keeping him from earning a living and they certainly aren't feeding anyone here. I'd propose that if this VfD is successful then we should nominate the bundle of articles as well. If Munson isn't notable for starting them, then they likely aren't notable either. <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infoshop.org.html" title="Infoshop.org">Infoshop.org</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Media_Project_ec48.html" title="Alternative Media Project">Alternative Media Project</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breaking_Glass_Press_1aa3.html" title="Breaking Glass Press">Breaking Glass Press</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/a/Practical_Anarchy_551f.html" title="Practical Anarchy">Practical Anarchy</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. chuck is very important in some circles- he does a lot, as can be seen from the above list of his projects. infoshop.org is probably the premeire site of anarchist information on the internet, and is certainly notable; chuck, as its founder, should remain as well. infoshop gets a lot of hits each day. no books about him, but due to his outspokenness, prolific publishing of newspapers and on the internet, and the fact that virtually every anarchist in the US knows who he is, i think he is notable enough to warrant a keep. as for his demands of control, i don't see this as any reason to eliminate the articles. if anything, he's a more interesting subject now that he has launched a <a href="../../../c/h/u/User_talk%7EChuck0_348d.html#Boycott_of_Wikipedia" title="User talk:Chuck0">boycott of wikipedia</a>. he says he is going away, so we won't have to worry about his demands for control of biographical information. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> <a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeah_0915.html" title="User talk:Heah">(talk)</a> 14:56, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Interesting mini-controversy here. My research shows that this guy is notable in the anarchist community. I think we need to be cautious determining notability for people/things within the anarchy category because, by definition, they place themselves outside the mainstream. As such, we should not expect mainstream websites and commercial outlets like Amazon to validate notability as effectively. What we do know is that this guy has published a book that's fairly notable within his community and he's done the same with some websites. I don't think his prior behavior on Wikipedia or his attempts to control his biography content should be relevant to this VfD. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 16:42, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this article as well as Infoshop.org and some other related ones. I don't understand his behavior with regards to this article. I actually e-mailed him once to ask him to verify the information there (that I didn't add) and he just started removing stuff without explaining. I understand and share his concerns for security culture (I'm assuming that's his objection?) but there was nothing there that was more than basic biographical information. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 17:23, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Chuck Munson should have his own Wikipedia page -- and should be able to make changes to it when somebody posts something as privacy invading as his home address on it.

<li>Now this is an odd controversy, and it brings up an interesting question: Does someone have a right to say "no, you <i>cannot</i> post a biography of me" or not? If he was a public figure (Politician, Hollywood Star, etc), the answer would be more obvious. But, he's not. Really not entirely certain how to assess this. I'm going to ercr on the side of caution, and say that since he's technically a private citizen (after all, notariety in 'Anarchist Circles' is not the same as being a notable public figure), he should have a right to have this removed if he doesn't want to be public. <b>Delete,</b> for now.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why is there even a discussion about keeping Chuck? As a librarian I am opposed to this censorship in the form of deletion by a mob, and I am also opposed to efforts to invade his privacy by blocking Chuck's attempts to remove sensitive personal information from his entry. While Chuck may be notable in small circles that are not to everyone's taste, he is indeed notable. I have learned and gained a great deal from my short, mostly online, association with Chuck. I am sure that many people have learned and gained from him. If you don't like Chuck's entry or don't think he's notable, don't read it.

<dd>This is not a vanity page. I didn't create it and if you've followed this controversy, I've been trying to temporarily keep some personal information off of the entry so I can find a job. People who know me can tell you that I'm not vain or interested in self-promotion. At the same time, it's laughable that a few people think that I'm non-notable. I happen to be a notable anarchist, activist, and librarian. I've been profiled by the New York Times, Washington Post, and the Kansas City Star.

I am trying to understand the expectations of Wiki, and have started to edit based on the learnings I have achieved. I am working to achieve the "massive cleanup" and would welcome pointers amd feedback. What I can say in defence of not deleting the word is that having come to the Wikipedia to better understand and define the concept I was surprised to find it missing. Thus my ham-fisted attempt at adding it. I had never done so and thus the short comings. I am reading the MANY and various pointer pages. help or coaching would be welcome <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrius42_423d.html" title="User:Adrius42">Adrius42</a> 22:31, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This phrase is used widely by politicians and, as evidenced by the newly added citations in the article, is also discussed by social scientists and other researchers. The recent modifications to the article make it less problematic than before.

<li><s><b>Keep and expand.</b> For better or worse, this is both a part of marketing history and animation history.

<li><b>Keep</b> Don't like how it sounds? Then we clean it up, we don't delete it. Wikipedia contains many articles on various methods of torture, getting rid of just this one (and leaving the rest) doesn't make sense. People have definitely had their nails ripped out as a form of torture, it's fact and not fiction. Clean it up, don't censor! <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommking_d6d1.html" title="User:Commking">Commking</a>, 11 August 2005
<ul>
<li>I don't think this is an issue of censorship. The problem is that we cannot verify that any torture has gone by that name. Have people had their nails ripped out as a form of torture? Most likely, yes. But do a google search for "denail" or "denailing". For "denail", you'll find a bunch of people who can't spell "denial". For "denailing" you'll find sites where people are trying to remove nails from lumber. Now let's narrow down our "denailing" search by adding the word "torture". Two results. Maybe there is a kind of torture called "denailing" and only two people have ever decided to mention them in a web page. But with no sources referenced in the article and no Google results, we aren't going to be able to clean this page up. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistercow_17cc.html" title="User:Mistercow">Mistercow</a> 08:20, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Would you please clarify the terminology you used: "nn". Regardless, I created this entry, and intended it as serious and worth expanding in the coming days (because of the curious relationship between the indivual's ordaining denomination and the church he serves in), and no, I'm not Evans. However, I've reviewed the policy on deletions and whatnot, and suppose this could be considered a vanity article, though I didn't mean to use resources for useless material, or waste your time if you view it as such. My apologies if indeed this is how you take it. I respectfully vote <b>keep</b>. --<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.185.140.252.html" title="User:64.185.140.252">64.185.140.252</a> 23:49, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

You shouldn't just jump to the conclusion that everything like this is vanity. I have stripped the page down and improved the spelling &amp; grammar, and it seems more acceptable now. Whether this is a relivant page at all is open to debate though.. Perhaps it should be moved to Wiktionary.

<hr />
<p>The "Silly Revolution", while still rather unknown, has real substance to it, and the events described - although not "serious" by nature - did actually occur. Unfortunately for international interest, all media coverage of the organization has remained local - meaning no english-language links are available for reference (besides our own site).</p>
<p>The use of Wikipedia was intended for precisely this reason - to bring our movement to a broader international audience. Whether or not this is a legitimate use of Wikipedia is for you to decide, as we have no intention to force our ideology on anyone, but we do believe that our entry is not completely without merit. "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/silly" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:silly">silly</a>" does not, in our opinion, necessarily equate with "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Dumb" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Dumb">Dumb</a>", "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pointless" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:pointless">pointless</a>", or "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/superfluous" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:superfluous">superfluous</a>". I think that Wikipedia readers/users should be allowed to decide for themselves how much thought (or lack of it) our militia deserves.</p>

<p>P.S. we are anything but a "private" militia</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Wikipedia to promote your movement is definitely a violation of "what wikipedia is not".

<ul>
<li>do you really think what we wrote constitutes propaganda? (in the classical sense). I would also be more than happy if someone else wanted to look through our site, read the articles, see the interviews, and write an "objective" entry on us. Volunteers? DardaDos 16:55, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<hr />
<p>Pharsh is not an unknown organization. Its activities have been covered by all the major news outlets in Israel, including press, television, radio and internet sources. Indeed, coverage of Pharsh has been so widespread that several satiric shows complained of the "oversaturation" of media by Pharsh. In addition to news articles, editorials have apeared in the press including the nations leading daily newspaper. While irritating, Pharsh is unfortunatly not a minor cultural phenomen in Israel.</p>
