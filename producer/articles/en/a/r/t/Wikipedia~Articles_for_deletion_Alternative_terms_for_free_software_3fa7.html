<p>This is just a thinly veiled attempt to merge a series of FOSS articles without consensus. It's a duplicate of content that already exists in the other articles. One reason cited to create the article was that the other articles were POV, but that's not a valid reason to create a new article. The title of the article itself is POV, as many would disagree that one is necessarily an alterntive term for the other. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I beg others to check what Njyoder is saying. The talk page for the article never says anything about other articles being POV. The Talk page says that this article is a consolidation of other articles, so yes it currently duplicates info on those articles. The reason for creating this page is that the other pages duplicate a lot of information (sometimes with inaccuracies, and those differ from article to article), and a secondary issue is that quality of the other pages seems to suggest that have few wikipedians caring for them (and this is a situation which has not been changing over the years) - merging to one article would combine their efforts. I plan to suggest a merge of the articles in question, when I've finished making this page. On the issue of POV, which has not been raised by me, but since it has been raised by the person requesting deletion of this page, combined efforts will bring more eyeballs to this page and more eyeballs should lead to less POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The articles which I've suggested merging into this article are <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libre_software.html" title="Libre software">libre software</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/FLOSS_260c.html" title="FLOSS">FLOSS</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/s/FOSS_b963.html" title="FOSS">FOSS</a>, and <a href="../../../o/s/s/OSS_FS_9f9e.html" title="OSS/FS">OSS/FS</a>. There may also exist others (of lesser size / of less known terms). Each is an alternative name for <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a>. Some can be thought of as an alternative name for "both free software and open source software", but, "open source software" is, by definition, an alternative name for "free software" <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. So I maintain that this page and it's name are accurate and would be an improvemet over the current situation. Finally, I would like to note that I only started this article a few minutes before it was suggested for delection, and I have commented that it's not yet ready, and I have continued to improve it since. It is therefore a work in progress (although a good one, IMO) and can of course me modified by anyone. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 17:03, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You said: " Current pages for such terms are fairly thin, and go through phases of being biased." Correct me if I'm wrong, but 'biased' means POV. You've conceded that you've done a unilateral merge without consensus. The names "open source" and "free software" are associated with philosophies and movements as well, they're not just definitions for licenses, so it's misleading to classify them as that. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dd>They go through phase of containing POV. POV isn't a persistant problem, but consistancy is a persistant problem. It appears that not many people are caring for these pages, and when edits are made it's by one person and it an go weeks or months without review. Also, I have not done any merge - not unilateral or multilateral. I have made a page which I hope will reach (or has already reached) a quality and usefulness where I can propose it for a merge. The philosophies put forward by FSF and OSI are indeed different, but this does not make FLOSS different from free software. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 17:44, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you admit you brought up POV then. You did merge the content, you took it from the articles and you stuck it in this one. That's called merging, it seems like the only means you have to counter my argument is some very weird semantic argument using a bizzare version of English that only you speak. And the philosophies are different, which means the associations between the terms are different, which means you can't just blindly substitute one for another as an "alternative." Meanings of words go beyond just what they are formally defined as. For example, the dictionary definition of "propaganda" is benign, but anyone who speaks the language knows it has an obvious negative connatation/meaning attached to it. And the idea that some of the terms are alternatives to others implies a certain inferiority as well. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dd>"Merge" is a wikipedia term, as well you know. It means, approximately, to stick on a tag that suggests replacing many articles with 1. My page is not a merge. On the word "Alternatives", I've already agreed to remove the word. And you know this too. To steer clear of philosophical implications, in the article I try to talk about software "<i>that is covered by the names discussed in this article</i>". I can't think of a fairer method than that, and now that you've advertised this on the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-source_software.html" title="Open-source software">open-source software</a> Talk page, that one side of the debate can contribute to the article if they feel there's misrepresentation.

<dd>Also, regarding the nomination, I just noticed another false criticism. This is not duplicate content. It contains some duplicate content, but if you read the article there is plent of new stuff in there. (Stuff that would be silly to put in each terms page since that would be more duplication, and stuff that can't fit in each term's page because it deals with how the terms relate to eachother.) <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 19:48, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They're new sections with duplicated content from other sections. The types of licenses covered, the history of the definitions/terms, the attempted registering of the trademark and so forth are all covered by the other articles. You're still using semantics to twist things. It's disingenuous to suggest that because other articles haven't used those specific headers that the content in those sections is new. I also noticed that you're already POVifying the article, trying to portray the term "free software" as if all they did was co-opt the term and renamed it (like they were just some copy cat movement), ignoring any kind of philosophical and pragmatic disagrements. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dd>The bit up to the first comma is probably mentioned in an article somewhere, as is the bit between the first and second commas. The bit between the 2nd comma and the first full stop is new. The last sentence is also new, as far as I know. But, more than the newness of individual words, phrases, or sentences (and even if I'm not correct about the above, at least under the scrutiny you've been tracking me with of late), the arrangement of this information is new - rather than it being spread across multiple articles, each one with a different wording - here it is consolidated. It is undeniable that a non-zero amount of newness exists there - and you asked only for newness - so I think this is the conclusion on this issue. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 21:46, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So the entirety of the newness is you saying "the other terms haven't been claimed by anyone"? The last sentence isn't new, the other articles discuss similarity between the formal definitions. It seems to me that you'rearguing that it's new content based on the fact that you've rephrased and reordered some sentences, even though the information remains the same. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<li><b>Keep</b>, a discussion of the various terms is useful, and it's nice to keep the discussion in one place.

<dd>I'm certainly open to a change of name. I don't see "altenative" as being POV - but that could be just me. I think "Free Software terminology" changes the scope greatly. "terms for free software" would be good though. (the difference being that the latter says what the terminology is for, while the former says what it's about - which a hard to define relationship.) Another title I thought of was "suggested replacements for free software" - but FLOSS, FOSS, and OSS/FS weren't suggested as <i>replacements</i>, they were just suggested. "other names for free software"? Just "names for free software"? or "terms for free software"? Other suggestions welcome. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 18:57, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the information belongs together in one article, but I will ask you to reconsider your vote because I think this article contains too much information to fit in a subsection of another page. Keep in mind that it was proposed for deletion only minutes after I started making it, so it's not yet as complete as it will be. For example, I hadn't written the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_terms_for_free_software.html#Licenses" title="Alternative terms for free software">Licenses</a> section when this was proposed for deletion, but I think that's a good section now and it doesn't completely fit under the topic of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 22:56, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I certainly see that this article, as is, can hardly be put verbatim into <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a> because it's just too long. However, I personally believe that, if it belongs anywhere, a very much more concise list in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a> would be best. We'd have to be pretty concise about it, but I think it would be best. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 23:04, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I see where you're coming from. The list of terms can certainly be made more concise, and this is something that I plan to do (I just didn't get time to do this before an Afd suddenly appeared). I did the list first because it's the easiest, but I think the more important things are the bits I'm working on now such as the "Definitions and meanings" and the "Licenses" sections. If this article was just/mostly a list of names and blurbs about each, I'd agree that it should be merged - but please check back in a day or two and see where the article has developed to. One other thing, although of secondary importance, is that if this is put in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a> page, it will be maintained by the maintainers of that page - which wouldn't be as good for neutrality as a seperate article would be. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 23:58, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The Talk page was not meant to indicate that. The page is not supposed to have anything about the "GNU/Linux" naming stuff, and it shouldn't have Anything Vs. Otherthing. It's not about controvercy or disputes. This is the history of the names that have appeared, the reasons for each name, the meaning and associations of each name, and other factual stuff. Emotional stuff is for another article. Pages such as List of disputed F/OSS terminology are terrible. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 22:31, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds like a great article. Perhaps <i>history of free software terminology</i> would be a perfect name.

<p><b>NOTE:</b> This AFD has now been advertised on the Talk page for <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-source_software.html" title="Open-source software">open-source software</a> (by Njyoder). I feel this may bias the sample of Wikipedians that enter this debate.

<dd>No, merges need to be voted on by people of all relevent articles. This isn't a merge, it's just a page. It will probably form the proposal for a merge when it's ready, but it itself is still just a page - and it would be nice if I could have gotten the proposal ready before it was thrown into AFD trials. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 10:14, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, you're right, AfDs shouldn't be voted on by the people who best understand the subject matter. You could have avoided this all by asking for permission first, don't complain about getting proposals ready when you move ahead with something without permission. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dd>You could claim that you notified "the people who best understand" <b>if</b> you had notified all related articles, or even two or three of the most related articles, but you notified <i>one</i>. Ask for <i>permission</i>? For what? From who? This is getting crazy. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 21:29, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I inserted it into <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a> after you complained too. You need to ask for permission from your fellow Wikipedians, because Wikipedia acts on this principle of consensus. When merging content, you start a discussion to ask if it's a good idea or not. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dd>I haven't merged anything. I had not added any merge tags to any articles, and I had not opened a dialogue on any Talk pages about merging. I wanted to try something out, and if it went well, I would probably propose it for a merge. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 03:57, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
