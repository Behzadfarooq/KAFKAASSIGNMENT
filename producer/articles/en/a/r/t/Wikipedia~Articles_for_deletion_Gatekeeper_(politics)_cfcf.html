<dd><s><b>Comment</b> Few people graduate from a communications program without learning this concept. Try not to focus on the anecdotal example currently at the core of the article, but on the long recognized concept. Maybe it doesn't make sense to some people that others would accuse the left of policing their ranks with gatekeepers, but the article should not be about an anectode -- it should be about the concept. Every communications system has some kind of gatekeeper. This AfD process is a gatekeeper for Wikipedia. Here's a reliable source on the social science of gatekeeping: <a href="http://www.tcw.utwente.nl/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Media,%20Culture%20and%20Society/gatekeeping.doc/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tcw.utwente.nl/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Media,%20Culture%20and%20Society/gatekeeping.doc/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhoSaid__8085.html" title="User:WhoSaid?">WhoSaid?</a> 21:19, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

<dd><s><i>Comment</i>: You might want to take a second look at the article. The premise of the term "gatekeeper" is that powerful foundations are spending serious money to buy off influential "left media" in order to suppress scandalous information about the Bush administration (among other things), which makes plenty of sense. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 16:21, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</s>
<dl>
<dd><s>Even though the article suffers from all the points I mentioned above, and probably more besides, HK is right about his statement above (i.e. it explains why some of the left media allegedly suppresses scandals:it's been bought off by the right). I don't know if this makes "plenty of sense," but it doesn't seem totally impossible, except that if it were true you'd expect the left media that hadn't been bought off to go over it, and seemingly it hasn't, only a handful of fringe websites. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 19:55, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</s>

<dd><s>I see. I think I came to the wrong conclusion because each is the article is verbose and the true idea (I don't like to call it a theory, as people confuse everyday "theories" with scientific theories) is nearly as improbable as the other. As Шизомби mentioned, some of the left media would not have gone along with it, especially those outlets that are controlled by an independent owner or a wealthy person who operates at a loss to spread his or her agenda. Also, we should be hearing from mainstream journalists that their stories have been suppressed by editors or owners, as journalists tend to be highly principled and often quit rather than violate those principles. The idea depends on the gatekeepers having an extreme amount of control over what is published and broadcast, and the silence of journalists, newscasters and editors, who the article characterizes as "left" (an assumption that the article gives no evidence for). Chip Berlet is given as an example of a gatekeeper, but he does not have the power to suppress media stories, even for the organizations he has worked for because he is simply a writer. Noam Chomsky does not either and he is actually known for his criticism of the U.S. government, according to his Wikipedia article. Norman Solomon is also a writer and his affiliation with a watchdog group and the institute he founded do not give him the power to suppress news. Writers can write stories that are supportive of the government or against its detractors, but that does not stop other writers from writing stories critical of the government. Also, gatekeeping writers' work is subject to change or suppression by the alleged "left" editors and owners. A gatekeeper would have to be in a position of great power within an organization and could not control multiple organizations without having someone powerful in on it at each one or using memorandums about which stories are inappropriate, which could be easily leaked. Even if a person is in a position to suppress articles, in a large organization almost any individual can be bypassed by going to someone in an equivalent position or at a higher one. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 00:56, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

<dd><s>Once again, a closer look at the article should answer your questions. "Gatekeeper" is not synonymous with "censor;" the version of the article that presently appears defines a gatekeeper as one who acts "to manage, constrain and co-opt the movement," or to "ostracize particular voices." I suppose that this could be done by "suppressing media stories," as you suggest, but it might also take the form of organizing campaigns of defamation against other, more uncooperative journalists. I also find your assertion that "journalists tend to be highly principled" to be a rather broad statement; consider, for example, the case of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judith_Miller_%28journalist%29_9edf.html" title="Judith Miller (journalist)">Judith Miller</a>, merely the first one that comes to mind (in fact, she might be an appropriate example of a <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatekeeper_%28politics%29.html" title="Gatekeeper (politics)">gatekeeper</a>.) --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 01:45, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you mean you or those sites will attack WP as a gatekeeper, or me? I hope that isn't what that means (WP has plenty of scandalous stuff about Bush, anyway). The Gatekeepers article is simply not neutral from the first part of the first sentence: "In political parlance, a gatekeeper or left gatekeeper" - right there: "political parlance"? Broad use by politicians or political scientists? 'Fraid not. One of the other problems I failed to mention was the lengthy list of alleged gatekeepers. I don't know if there's a specific policy on allegations on WP (there's no lists of alleged homosexuals or people alleged by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">David Icke</a> to be reptilian humanoids for example, though some pages do mention allegations), but List of people described as neoconservatives got <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_people_described_as_neoconservatives_30cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of people described as neoconservatives">deleted (see AfD)</a> for similar reasons. The Gatekeepers article simply uncritically reproduces a list of allegations from a nn site <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="WP:NOT">WP is not a mirror</a> (in its original conception it collated allegations from several nn sites). The article's primary author (<a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>) invited criticism to be added, but this theory seems to be so nn that apparently none of the major right, center, or left media has commented on it in the US or abroad. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 19:55, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b>. I hesitate to vote "delete" on this article as it seems to be a term that is used by some conspiracy theorists and possibly others. I want to note, however, that this article is in no way "unbiased" or neutral point of view as some editors insist. For instance, use of terms like "Establishment" and "left media" (repeatedly), characterizing media coverage of 9/11 war games, and and implying that there are no critics or skeptics employed by the "left media" place this article squarely in the realm of POV. Of course, POV alone is not a sufficient reason to vote delete. I do not see the article as a whole as an attack on Berlet, as only one paragraph mentions him by name.

<p>Keep-- I don't think foundation-subsidized folks should be able to censor material on the wikipedia website that reflects grassroots anti-war left awareness of the special influence that foundations play in U.S. left political and media life. Political Research Associates has published a journal, Public Eye, in recent years. In 1999, the Public Welfare Foundation gave a $50,000 grant to PRA, the San Francisco Foundation gave $120,000 to PRA, the Tides Foundation gave $57,550 to PRA, the Cummings Foundation gave $55,000 to PRA, the List Foundation gave $25,000 to PRA and the Ms. Foundation for Women (which was given over $1.2 million in grants from the Ford Foundation between 2000 and 2002) gave $150,000 to PRA. In 2002, the Ford Foundation gave $176,663 in grant money directly to the PRA. These are facts. And it is also a fact that a Political Research Associates writer acted as a leading conspiracy researcher-baiter within the alternative media subculture after 9/11/01 and attempted to stifle left subculture discussion of 9/11 conspiracy evidence, as well as discussion of the role that the Ford Foundation plays in U.S. political left life today. Wikipedia's credibility as an alternative independent information source for internet readers will suffer if it capitulates to the pressure of foundation-subsidized folks and deletes an article, like this gatekeeper one,--that apparently contains information that the foundations and their stable of journalists/gatekeepers do not wish to see shared with Wikipedia readers.(bf)</p>

<p>Comment--Your argument is sophistry. Are any foundation-sponsored editors/writers presently helping to determine what "violates WP policy"? Have the majority of WP readers ever been allowed to determine WP policy with regard to which articles to censor? Are the WP gatekeepers willing to also start deleting all the articles that are little more than repostings of corporate-sponsored, historically inaccurate and politically-biased corporate websites?</p>
<p>If foundation-sponsored gatekeepers have conflict-of-interest issues which lead them to censor wikipedia articles that are critical of their foundation-sponsors, then they are not really capable of editing the wikipedia website in an ethical way, from an alternative journalistic point of view. Perhaps it's more appropriate for such folks to act as gatekeepers for more middle-class academic-biased/establishment-oriented encyclopedias, like the World Book or the Encyclopedia Britannica?--bf</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It would help if you indented your response underneath the post you are responding to with either an asterisk or a colon (or more than one as necessary). It would be nice if you signed with four tildes ~~~~ too. Anyway, I'm not sure I entirely follow you. (1) <i>Are any foundation-sponsored editors/writers presently helping to determine what "violates WP policy"?</i> I don't know. Going through the history for each article and corresponding talk page for each policy page would take an awfully long time, and I don't know that there'd be any way to prove which editors were "foundation-sponsored" or not, since in most cases there wouldn't be any way to prove who any of the editors' identities are. (2) <i>Have the majority of WP readers ever been allowed to determine WP policy with regard to which articles to censor?</i> Do you mean have the majority of WP readers been allowed to edit the policy pages? As far as I know everyone can edit those pages, but AFAIK most don't chose to make edits to those pages. Or do you mean are the majority of WP readers involved in the AfD process? I would guess most aren't, that most WP users simply read articles, followed by creating new articles or editing articles. I think it's probably a smaller percentage that bother with AfD, which seems to be a necessary process unless you really want every article posted on WP to stay (e.g. Dogballs). (3) <i>Are the WP gatekeepers willing to also start deleting all the articles that are little more than repostings of corporate-sponsored, historically inaccurate and politically-biased corporate websites?</i> Who are WP gatekeepers, all the people involved in the AfD process? Also, it would help if you identified what sort of articles you had in mind. It seems to me editors do try to address issues of "corporate-sponsor[ship]" "historically inaccura[cy]" and "political[]-bias[]" in articles, but whether they can keep up with such problems, or address them as well as is necessary are open questions. (4) <i>If foundation-sponsored gatekeepers have conflict-of-interest issues which lead them to censor wikipedia articles that are critical of their foundation-sponsors, then they are not really capable of editing the wikipedia website in an ethical way, from an alternative journalistic point of view.</i> I'm not sure if you're referring to prior editing of this article (and the AfD), and/or editing of articles about foundations. Certainly, I would agree that if somebody is taking money from e.g. the Ford Foundation, and they make edits to that article, then they potentially have a conflict of interest and an ethical problem. There might be some ethical people who could work past those problems, but for the most part it would be unwise. My "sponsor" at present moment could be said to be my late grandmother (thanks Oma), and I'm afraid she would not satisfy <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html#Deceased_people" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)#Deceased people</a> so there's never been and probably never will be an article on her here. With regard to pages for foundations and media, I'd advise you to do what I indicated at the bottom of the Gatekeepers talk page, what HK agreed with; I'd support such edits and help revert edits removing such information if I came across it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not sure what your talking about. Any personal attacks are un-called for and should be removed by those who make them or by other editors. We are interested in whether this article meets the standards of wikipedia pure and simple. Surveillance of others with the intention to discredit those individuals is not only bad manners, it is in violation of wikipedia harassment standards. Conduct a civil discourse without name-calling or harassment is all I ask. Is this article, well cited? Is this article relevant? Does this term get use outside of wikipedia? Etc. are what is under discussion. Not whether any one editor tries to inform people that a vote is taking place and then calling it VOTE STACKING, that is harassment and a personal attack and I removed it as such. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 05:13, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The attacks I referred to that Northmeister above said were not understood were (bf)'s comments above (User:Bob jan AKA User:209.213.73.30). I apologize for my long response to bf, whom I let annoy me. And Northmeister, I wish you would explain why you feel the article is "well sourced" when the handful of sites used as sources don't meet WP criteria by a long shot - see my original post in the AfD and the comment below about the Alexa ratings. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 05:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The "attack" wasn't a personal one if it was merely pointing out likely or potential vote-stacking. If there is evidence that a certain group of people is vote-stacking in similar Afds, it's actually more relevant to this discussion, not less. Asking someone to vote in an Afd is, as far as I know, not against Wikipedia policy, even if you know how they will vote beforehand. It is, however, a relevant consideration for a sysop that is attempting to determine consensus in an Afd vote, consensus being a muddy concept (as it should be, imo). Please remember to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> and interact <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">civilly</a>- <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 05:08, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment'</b> The good faith/civility comment was meant to be a reminder for everyone here. Regarding whether the information about potential vote stacking violates <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, well, "This guideline does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary." I.e., if there is evidence of potential vote stacking, an editor can and should point out the evidence. Here, there is at least some evidence of vote stacking (though the nature and weight of the evidence will be for the sysop who goes through this Afd to determine), thus it was appropriate, in my judgment, for Jersey to point to the evidence despite AGF. I hope this makes sense, forgive me for being somewhat long-winded.

<p><b>Comment</b> Posting the vote stacking links concerns this article and getting into a revert war to try and hide it is a serious offense. You aren't suppose to delete other people's comments on an afd. I have also deleted the part of my comment which could be interpreted as a personal attack already. Needless to say, if you see the user's talk page and the bottom of his user page he has been accused of being a POV Larouchite editor in the past. He also just broke the three revert rule.

Third, I ask that you refrain from your continued personal attacks on myself and other users.

Fifth, I ask that you make an official apology to that said user for your harassment and surveillance of his postings. Sixth, I ask a personal apology to myself.

<dl>
<dd>a) Hopelessly POV. It assumes that the media in the United States is left-wing, which laughable statement seems to actually be <i>believed</i> in some quarters, but should still not be reported as "fact".</dd>
<dd>b) It's a LaRouchite fantasy. Actually, let's scratch out "fantasy": when we're dealing with LaRouche, one doesn't need to specify the disconnection with reality, since it's basically inherent.</dd>
<dd>c) Undue weight. The term is <i>not</i> used in political parlance; it's used by a handful of lunatics and conspiracy theorists when writing lunacy on conspiracy theories.</dd>
<dd>d) It's a LaRouchite hit list. I suspect, as a general policy issue, we should profit most mightily from refusing to host LaRouchite hit lists.</dd>
<dd><b>Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia</b>. It is not a forum for conspiracy nuts and Lyndon LaRouche fanboys to piss all over the sum of human knowledge.

<li><b>Keep</b> Cursing, as seen above in this discussion, is not argument. Attacks and counterattacks directed at political factions are not arguments relevant to the article under consideration. The term is widely used in political analysis by analysts at several stations along the political spectrum. Its history dates back at least 50 years, as documented by legitimate academic source. The article is badly slanted against perceived left gatekeepers, but that can be fixed. The pervasiveness of the term in political anaylysis is reflected by the choice of the National Communications Association to name their Mass Communication Division Newsletter "The Gatekeeper". Try looking at some legitemite etymology before typing a tirade against a poorly written article. The word has a long, documented history, available even from easily found reputable on-line sources such as <a href="http://www.tcw.utwente.nl/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Media,%20Culture%20and%20Society/gatekeeping.doc/" class="external text" title="http://www.tcw.utwente.nl/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Media,%20Culture%20and%20Society/gatekeeping.doc/" rel="nofollow">the University of Twente</a>.

However, it is quite limited and Gatekeeper refers to more than what you wrote about. There needs to be the entire idea of Gatekeeper included, as was originally presented in the article. I propose we start with your re-writing, and those interested work together to get a balanced, accurate, NPOV article done. I propose this to you and to the original creator as well. What do you say?

<li><b>Comment</b>, that is actually much better but couldn't it still be considered a neologism and thus not warrant a page?--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 23:27, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>The concept of a "gatekeeper" in journalism is much better defined, and was discussed even in my basic Mass Communications/Journalism 130 survey course. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:51, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as rewritten by <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a>, but might belong better at Gatekeeper (publishing), since the concept (which is a notable one, especially in the era of blogging, user-written sites like Wikinews, self-published book, etc.) is not limited to journalism, but is common to the publishing industry, including books as well as magazines and newspapers. I don't feel strongly about the name, though. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 23:58, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as rewritten and move to <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatekeeping_%28communication%29.html" title="Gatekeeping (communication)">Gatekeeping (communication)</a>, since the external link says that the term is applied in other aspects of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_communication.html" title="Human communication">human communication</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 00:24, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as rewritten and move to <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatekeeping_%28communication%29.html" title="Gatekeeping (communication)">Gatekeeping (communication)</a>(s). <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 01:58, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have <b>moved</b> the article per the nascent consensus here, and I suggest that we close the AfD and proceed with the stub as-is. Should it be communication, or communications? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:00, 14 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't be in a rush. 6 hours are left until normal closure. Besides, the "s" name is bad. "in Communications" usually refers to "means of communication". <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatekeeping_%28communication%29.html" title="Gatekeeping (communication)">Gatekeeping (communication)</a> would be correct in this case. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 02:33, 14 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why <b>not</b> be in a rush? Who cares about "normal closure"? The article is not about politics, so it shouldn't be at politics. I don't need to have a process tell me that it's OK to do that. Just write the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 03:06, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
