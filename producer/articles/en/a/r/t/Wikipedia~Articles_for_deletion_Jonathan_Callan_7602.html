This bit of inflated puffery talks big about his award-winning TV series (in other words, the pilot put on his college's in-house TV station), his award-winning screenplay (in other words, the award given out by the community theater that hosted the play), and his second award-winning screenplay (5th place in a competition that has <b>ten</b> Google hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=WriteSafe&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Writing+and+Art+Contest&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=WriteSafe&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Writing+and+Art+Contest&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Roboliberal seems to have a skewed notion of what constitutes "significant body of well-known work," "notable awards" or "regarded as important figure by peers." Wikipedia policy has in mind a slightly larger field than the theater community in Ithaca, NY. When Mr. Callan's acclaim comes from the New York Times theater reviewer instead of from his college newspaper, and his awards from the Tony nominators rather than the local theater, that will merit notice. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No Delete</b> Respectfully, I disagree on both counts for proposed deletion. Mr. Callan is a writer whom I work with on several IC-TV shows and is of extreme notability in the areas in which he writes. Certainly, the accusation that it is somehow self-advertisement is baseless and without proof. I have worked with the author but am not even a close friend, so in neither case does the article fit the criteria for auto-biography as laid out in the wiikipedia guidelines. After all, IC-TV itself (our campus TV station) has a wiki entry, so why not an entry on one of its more popular writers?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The case comes down to one of notability. I have fufilled at least three out of five of the notability criteria: recieved notable awards (cited), regarded as an important figure by peers (cited), has created a significant body of well-known work (cited). I would welcome suggestions on how to demonstrate the other two criteria, but there are honestly few authors that have statues or monuements of them built, anyway. And no one cites a problem with *their* wiki entries. The lack of a secondary source (such as a non-fiction book about the author's work) is one that I could find numerous wiki-entries on authors to support in contrary. Many articles on semi-popular modern authors fail to meet this requirement. I would like to remove the tag for speedy deletion, honestly. I welcome other opinions however.</dd>

It's my opinion that Roboliberal needs to also assert why Mr. Callan is notable beyond local theater stuff. In short, can we get more sources that assert better notability? If so, I will change my mind. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 18:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - A wee bit of digging. I've no beef with the notability of the <a href="../../../i/c/t/ICTV_9197.html" title="ICTV">ICTV</a> site, seeing as it has won numerous awards <a href="http://www.ictv.org/sections/awards/awards.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ictv.org/sections/awards/awards.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and serves 26,000 homes on Time Warner basic cable in the county in which Ithaca is located. By the bye, that awards list? Callan does not appear. The broadest possible search of ICTV's website <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Callan&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=ictv.org&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Callan&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=ictv.org&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> has only four hits for Callan, one as being on staff in the spring of last year, three pertaining to the one episode that he wrote. A search on the Cornell Daily Sun's website doesn't turn up any hits, despite the citation of an article purportedly about the subject <a href="http://cornellsun.com/search/node/Callan" class="external autonumber" title="http://cornellsun.com/search/node/Callan" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:18, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly Object to Deletion</b>I object to the notion that the subject in question is not notable because he hasn't had a write up in the New York Times. There are plenty of television and comics writers who have never once had a write-up by either the New York Times or any other national paper who warrant (and have) wikipedia pages. Likewise, I will point everyone to the "notability page" for Wikipedia requirements which clearly spells out that fame IS NOT equivalent to notability. Mr. Callan is a well-known author in the Ithaca and Priceton communities and I believe I have established notability in this regard through numerous citations and articles. An inability to find a few of these clearly cited articles doing cursory google searches is not the fault of the subject. The world exists beyond the internet. And I'm not at all sure The Cornell Daily Sun makes an archive of even a majority of its articles. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Roboliberal (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERoboliberal_4356.html" title="User talk:Roboliberal">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roboliberal_0f21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roboliberal">contribs</a>) 21:48, 19 March 2007 (UTC).</small><small>— <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsername_4f9c.html" title="User:Username">username</a> (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsername_2815.html" title="User talk:Username">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_username_c492.html" title="Special:Contributions/username">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I would like to mention that in addition to his notoriety in upstate New York, Jon Callan is also well known in central New Jersey.

<li><b>No Delete</b> This will be my last post here. I find this entire argument ridiculous. Accusations of "sock-puppeting" most of all. You asked for proof of the subject's notabality, I have, in my mind, more than supplied it. Others agree with my positions, and wikipedia is meant to be a community foremost based on strength of argument in terms of inclusion, not percieved social standing. Whether or not those featured here are first time users are irrelevant. They have continued in making the case that the subject of the article is *INDEED* quite notable. Certainly, I have enough respect for wikipedia to know its not a vote. But I have registered my opinion. The facts and the citations more than speak for themselves. To disclude a writer of medium popularity who speaks to a large audience from an internet encyclopedia that has a substantially huge entry on LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE is indeed insane. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Roboliberal (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERoboliberal_4356.html" title="User talk:Roboliberal">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roboliberal_0f21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roboliberal">contribs</a>) 00:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You've already voted TWICE before as Roboliberal. Once at 13:41, and once at 21:48. And now again at 00:11.

<li><b>Comment</b> What you don't seem to understand is that we need proof. Real proof - not comments from people who may or may not exist and who may or may not of heard of the subject. We simply cannot take your word for it. If he is really a household name, if he is held in high regard by those in the know, then that proof would exist. Bring it- real sources that anybody in the world can examine and say "yep - this guy is notable", and this argument will disappear. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 02:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Leaning towards <b>delete</b> because the article appeasr to describe someone notable within the SF-media field, yet it is a name I have never seen (TtBoMR) in the media material I "watch", here in the UK. I suspect that a writer "famous" in a small village in England (but not known in the US or Guam) would earn the same disdain, if I wrote him/her up for Wiki. -- 62.25.109.196 08:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
