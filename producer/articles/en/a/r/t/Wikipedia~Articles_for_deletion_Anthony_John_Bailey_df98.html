<p><b>Delete</b>:This article appears to be a piece of self promotion overwhelmingly edited by a single anonymous user who I suspect to be none other than Anthony John Bailey himself. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Boy_that_time_forgot_b905.html" title="User:The Boy that time forgot">The Boy that time forgot</a> 23:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>: <i>Vanity page</i>: I read most of the articles linked to. The articles were either trivial or biased. The other links were to web sites that this guy owns. That's about as biased as it comes. It's <i>possible</i> that he's notable, but this article definitely looks like a PR piece to me. Also, "Eligo International" turns up very few references elsewhere, and the first few pages worth of links on Google are NN sources: phone books and things like Craigslist. <i>There's virtually no verifiable information on the guy on the Internet</i>. Isn't this odd for "one of the most decorated living Britons"? -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomXP411_f5b6.html" title="User:TomXP411">TomXP411</a><sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomXP411_8736.html" title="User talk:TomXP411">[Talk]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Delete</b> Was going to say to keep until I saw that the biggest contributor to the page - Eligo - is also the name for the company founded by Athony John Bailey. I will concur that is mostly appears to be a vanity page. --<a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgod_66f8.html" title="User:Ozgod">Ozgod</a> 06:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> As one of the significant contributors to this article, I principally used the respected and newly published Debretts People of Today of 2007 to find most of this information including all the foreign honours and positions. I also used various online websites to back it up including as many non Bailey sites as possible ie medias. Bailey is an interesting person for me by the nature of his very wide activities, growing political influence and the fact that he has given money to a major UK political party during the ongoing political crisis here with the UK Government. I therefore oppose deletion but if you want me to re-edit it I can or you can. -- <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a><sup><a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeisal_8ceb.html" title="User talk:Seisal">[Talk]</a></sup><small>— <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeisal_8ceb.html" title="User talk:Seisal">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Seisal_5f07.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Seisal">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b>Im not one and the same person. I have though used text seen on the Eligo site although have put enough references to back it up I think.

It keeps triggering that "too good to be true" flag in my head. Also, his web sites (Elios, and the art foundation) don't have ANY links from other web sites. That seems odd for organizations that claim to be so important or influential. On the other hand, one article I found said that his fee for some arbitration was over £1 million. When you run in those circles, you don't exactly need Google for clients to find you. <i>If the article is kept</i>, there's got to be a way to make it sound less like a résumé and more like an encyclopedia entry. Perhaps, instead of listing all of his awards, charities, etc, we could shorten it and say "works with several organizations, the most notable are:" and "has received several awards, such as..." -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomXP411_f5b6.html" title="User:TomXP411">TomXP411</a><sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomXP411_8736.html" title="User talk:TomXP411">[Talk]</a></sup> 06:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Investigate &amp; reduce to a stub</b> People in high positions do have links on Google, at least with respect to the organizations they are associated with. I notice that every one of the affiliations listed is one that is not available online. Almost every one of the awards listed will have a list of holders of some sort, and I think in these circumstances they have to be checked. We may find ourselves having made a mistake here. The proposed course of action will be to stubbify the article, and add data only as it becomes available. Has anyone checked the Times article, which is not available to me--the link is just to the Times website. It would at least demonstrate the existence of a person. by that name. The Evening Standard may or may not be a RS in general, but the material here is from the society gossip column, and sounds very much as if he wrote the press release. He claims one single million pound fee, but it does not say for what. Read the article sentence by sentence. The Painting &amp; Patronage web site, designed by his company, mentions him only in passing as a member of the advisory board. The Foreign Policy Centre seems to have the nest documentation for him--a brief bio. at <a href="http://fpc.org.uk/search/anthony+bailey/" class="external free" title="http://fpc.org.uk/search/anthony+bailey/" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.org.uk/search/anthony+bailey/</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have looked again at the homepage of the Painting and Patronage site and in the first paragraph it lists him as the founding chairman together with the Saudi Arabian Prince and in the advisory boards of each initiative as the Chairman of the Advisory Board which consists of very many notables including foreign and other ministers. -- <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a><sup><a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeisal_8ceb.html" title="User talk:Seisal">[Talk]</a></sup></li>

<p>Eligo, his company, also makes charitable contributions and boasts about them on its website. Any company doing this makes very sure they get newspaper coverage. (And they don't just do diplomacy; they also do website design) The company site claims that he was Anthony Bailey appointed to the UK’s Ministerial Task Force on Gifted and Talented Education in Jan 07. Such appointments are announced. It isn't in google. The best positive evidence so far is photographs on the Eligo web site, which seem to show him with world leaders.

<dd>I'm wondering if part of the problem is that most of his contributions are in the Middle East. The media in these countries won't be accessible to english-language search engines. This is so frustrating, because this guy may indeed be notable, but <i>I can't prove it</i>. I also can't prove that he's not. What I do know is that he is listed as an owner or major contributer to nearly every site that talks about him. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomXP411_f5b6.html" title="User:TomXP411">TomXP411</a><sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomXP411_8736.html" title="User talk:TomXP411">[Talk]</a></sup> 05:42, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All of those sources bar one are about some aristocratic religious club - I don't see wikipedia's notability guidelines indicating that as a cast iron reason to have article space. The other references simply indicates he owns a PR firm - again not any sort of reason for notability. The phrase "self publicist" jumps out at me with this case - and when phrases like that are about I am very careful about fuelling ego's - especially when they own a PR firm and there is a very high probability that the editors involved in creating this article have a COI. <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 13:55, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I suggest you revise the Education section to reflect his own (previously included), i.e. UCL, Budapest, and Sofia degrees, and not his work in the Education sector. You could also add a section on his actual accomplishments, as I advised before, e.g. what funds has he helped raise, and to what social or community benefit (impact on Passage Homeless Center? Impact of his assistance to Nuncio in Serbia? etc). What has been the impact of his particular diplomatic/brokerage activities, and can this be demonstrated verifiably? He presumably did not get his various knighthoods or awards just for being good at PR, but rather for having distinguished himself - so how did he do that, and what was/were its verifiable result/s? Also, he has been the object of some media controversy, e.g. his dealings with mid-east states and his one-time funding offer to the Labour Party, which was rejected at that time. How have these controversies been resolved? Why did he accept to become an Ambassador (to Europe) for Gambia, given the peculiarities of the latter's Prez and his so-called herbal cure for AIDS? Is that an honorary post or remunerated? And how does he square that with his foreign policy advisory role to Labour's FPC - is that not a COI?

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thanks for your valuable comments. I have revised the article considerably again to reflect your opinions and added backed his education background and researched his various other roles and put why he got each honour in the relevant section where I could fine it from non Eligo sources. His education role seems quite considerable as it crosses into his fundraising and Middle Eastern roles as well as some of the honours he has received either for related work within the UK or abroad. I have sourced several national newspaper articles which refer to the £8m raised for city academies and added this into the article and linked it to some of his existing education roles. The United Learning Trust role is important since it directly links him to the two sheffield academies he fundraised and he sits of their board along side the like of Lord Carey of Clifton, Dame Angela Rumbold and Sir Anthony Greener. Interestingly the more I research him the more I can see that his PR role is very much secondry to his inter-religious, philtantropic and education roles. This is also backed up in the Sunday Times article which says he cleared just over £100k in one year through PR. I have had to be quite careful when refering to this article since it is subject to legal action and denied by the Prime Minister and others. Should I remove it all together or can I keep it as it is. I can only assume that the many other charitbale roles he has are also in the field of event organisation, protocol and fundraising although I cannot find verifiable proof as to which. Knowing of the problems of Serbia and Montenegro the work for the Holy See for which he was knighted is also related to inter-religious work and there is a picture of him with some muslims and jews on the official papal knights website. I cannot find anything on his Gambian role except one article which I have referred to from a Gambian paper shortly before his appointment as Ambassador. No idea of the AIDS herbal cure! What madness! Doubt he is getting paid to be an Ambassador at Large and the Gambian article I found seems to suggest he was in the ocuntry originally to assist business in the Gambia and therefore assume the Ambassadorial role relates to this somehow or the African Union summit which Gambia hosted last year. Very little in this regard at least in English. Believe I have answered now most of the points raised by the community and ignored some of the unnecessary personal attacks on Bailey himself in relation to politics and his future wife and suggest that it is a considered for <s><b>speedy keep</b></s> now unless there are other comments. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a></li>

<dd>I do not have any connection to Bailey but became interested in his inter-religious work as a British Catholic and have seen articles on him in the past in the Catholic press in this country. I too felt orginally that at his age it must be too good to be true but his story does stack up even when you remove all the eligo references. When I read in January his engagement to the Austrian Princess in the newspaper I was already aware through history books of the Hohenberg anti-Nazi role during the Second World War and saw that this was not properly reflected on the Wikipedia entry on the Family so added some. The connection between the two led me to start to investigate Bailey some more and I started adding to the existing page on him. I have never played a role on wikipedia before and so started to change articles without being properly qualified in terms of the community's requirements. Yes I made many mistakes but my persistence with this article is that I believe him to be notable in many circles but at the same time have learnt a great deal as to how wikipedia works and what is expected of it and I hope the community will understand - even those that seem to suggest that whatever I do on Bailey and spend so long to correct my mistakes and get it right in the end are unwilling to accept. It seems one or two in community have grudges against him for be a Labour Party supporter or for other reasons but that should not affect my work or indeed some of their comments in relation to the context of this article. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a></dd>
