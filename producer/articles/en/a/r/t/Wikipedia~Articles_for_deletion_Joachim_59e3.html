<p>In-universe, plot summary article about a non-notable character <a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 23:48, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, the article can use clean-up, but the character is not non-notable by any means. He has a major role in the movie - and certainly not an article for deletion. By using your criteria, half of the Star Trek entries would be deleted.</p>
<p>Besides, you should discuss it in the Talk pages before arbitrarily deciding by yourself something should be deleted.</p>

<li>The character pushed a few buttons and had a few lines of dialog. This is hardly notable. By *your* criteria, every miscellaneous extra should have their own page. <a href="http://www.memory-alpha.org" class="external text" title="http://www.memory-alpha.org" rel="nofollow">Memory Alpha</a> has its own site. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 01:30, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Take a look at my edit history and you can pretty well extrapolate that I've seen STII. Additionally, you have yet to make an argument in favor of keeping this article. Perhaps rather than assuming bad faith on my part, you explain why this character warrants an article when more-significant characters like Dimitri Valtane, Michael Eddington, William Ross, and most of the other characters <a href="../../../d/e/e/List_of_Star_Trek%7E_Deep_Space_Nine_characters_4cbd.html" title="List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine characters">here</a> don't. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 02:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I just happened to see the film the other day and now come across this Afd (however it was raised) and the character is not notable enough. If it was kept, it should still be moved to Joachim (Star trek) or the like, to make space for a DAB page. Such a DAB page should be created in any case since there are mentioned a few other Joachims already on the saints page. The dab page should not only link to the saint's page (whose current name is in line with that of many other saints inluding his own wife) but also to the Star Trek film in case the character Joachim remains with out own article (which is what I am voting for) <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 11:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>SAVE</b> - I vote to save, for the following reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The character has a significant role in the TOS episode "Space Seed," which was the foundation for TWOK.<br /></li>
<li>Many film scholars have stated that TWOK is an allegory for Moby Dick, with Khan being Ahab. This being the case, Joachim is very much Khan's Starbuck; loyal, but questioning Khan's actins and motives. He is more than a mere "button-pusher." He is Khan's right-hand man.<br /></li>
<li>In non-canon Star Trek books, Joachim is a major character, especially in the Eugenics Wars and books about life on Ceti Alpha V. Yes, it's non-canon but many readers of these Star Trek books would come to this Wikipedia page to read a biography of the character.<br /></li>
<li>The point was made that if Michael Eddington doesn't have his own page, Joachim shouldn't either. Well, I think Eddington should have his own page! He deserves it just as much as Joachim.<br /></li>
<li>Yes, I have heard the rumors as well that Joachim plays a major role in Star Trek XI. As time goes on, people will want to know who this guy is and this article will help refresh their memories.<br /></li>

<li><b>Restore</b>. I move strongly to undue TenaciousT's edits. The original page (dealing with the deuterocanonical father of Mary) was at Joachim, but this editor, without discussion and without the use of the move tab, made some sloppy copy and paste moves. The biblical figure was not referred to as "Saint" in the primary sources. That is only a POV of the Catholic/Orthodox. This article, if it isn't deleted, should be moved to <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joachim_%28Star_Trek%29_4b2b.html" title="Joachim (Star Trek)">Joachim (Star Trek)</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Joachim_2f92.html" title="Saint Joachim">Saint Joachim</a> should be moved back to <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joachim.html" title="Joachim">Joachim</a> and discussion should take place through the appropriate proposed move channels. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 21:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Restore</b> religious content/<b>Delete</b> Star Trek content -- I didn't realize there was a previous, totally un-related Joachim article. For the reasons Andrew c outlined, Joachim should be restored/reverted to its previous content as it relates to the religious figure, and the Star Trek-related content axed. The copy-and-pasted Saint Joachim should redirect to Joachim. (I know AfD isn't a vote, but for whomever's keeping track, I'm the original nominator; don't "count" me twice.) --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 21:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</s></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - We're not completely finished. As already said, the edits cannot be undone completely without admin. While we now have a satisfactory structere ( I did not want to imlpy that Joachim should be moved to Saint Joachim), the current Joachim article contains now inside its history also the Star Trek character, and <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joachim_%28Star_Trek%29_4b2b.html" title="Joachim (Star Trek)">Joachim (Star Trek)</a> is without ist early editing history. The latter may not be a problem, but <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joachim.html" title="Joachim">Joachim</a> needs to be effectively restored to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joachim&amp;oldid=100833660" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joachim&amp;oldid=100833660" rel="nofollow">this version</a>. <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 09:08, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
