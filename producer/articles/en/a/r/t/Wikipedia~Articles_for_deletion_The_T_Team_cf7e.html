<li>Yes, sorry, you're right - on closer inspection it's not primarily about a website. Nonetheless the important factor is the lack of independent online coverage - the links are to a freewebs site and a Myspace, which do not constitute evidence of notability. So my Delete vote stands. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 18:24, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't see why just because the troupe has no money their page should be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>: In practice, groups with official websites as free domains are pretty non-notable. However, that is neither here nor there.

<li>An open letter from The T Team to whom it may concern.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hello all, The T Team here to shed some light on this little discussion. Several days ago, a young man named Elijah (see earlier comment) told us about how he had set up this little page for us on wikipedia. We had no desire to join good ol' wiki, but this young chap seemed to think we were important enough. We thanked him. Unsurprisingly enough, the article immediately came under scrutiny, mainly due to our unfortunate.....lack of funds, as it were, to get an actual domain name.</p>
<p>Side note for a minute, a quick message to J Milburn, your comment about free domains being non-notable....stupid. I'll have you know that professional wrestler Rick Steiner (one half of the tag team voted the second greatest of all time in North America by Pro-wrestling Illustrated) uses freewebs, and I'd call him pretty goddamn notable. Stupid comment.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's pretty clear to us that the article is hated, so we're more than happy for you to take it down. We don't need a wikipedia article. It was just something a young man decided to do to give back to the group he so loved, thinking others too would enjoy learning about this team. After all, in an encyclopedia that dedicates an entire article to "Allip" (yes J Milburn, that's a note to you), surely they encourage everyone to contribute whatever they can. Surely a great encyclopedia would cover as many topics as it possibly could? There are some articles with no external links or websites referenced at all, yet this seems fine as long as no freewebs sites are mentioned. We'll pass on the message to Elijah that for all future articles he hopes to set up, to put no websites at all to stand a better chance at not being deleted.</p>
<p>Well, that's all from us. We appreciate you taking an interest in our group, and hope you get a laugh from it here or there. This whole discussion has sort of made us wonder what you guys could possibly get out of scrutinising others peoples works. It makes no difference to you if these articles stay up. You put a lot of time into your articles and they put a lot of time into theirs, yet you say theirs aren't important enough for a website that you dont even own. You're just another brick in the wall. I wonder how many people have left this site in anger after they put a lot of time and effort into their own articles, only to have a Dungeons and Dragons nerd delete it. Sad, in a way. Anyway, that's by-the-by. Take it easy, guys</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have recieved so much abuse on AfD of late. First of all, the IP from which the long message was posted was the same IP that recently vandalised my userpage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AJ_Milburn&amp;diff=103980502&amp;oldid=103690140" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AJ_Milburn&amp;diff=103980502&amp;oldid=103690140" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:J_Milburn&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=103980723" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:J_Milburn&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=103980723" rel="nofollow">here</a>, so I guess this person has some agenda against me. As for the matter of me commenting on the <i>official site</i> being on freewebs- it was just that, a comment that, as far as I could see, summed up the article. The actual reason for deletion, as I stated in my initial comment, was the fact that no notability was asserted. The official site, according to the article, IS on freewebs, and so if it is a stupid comment, it was your friend Elijah who made it. Bringing up <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allip.html" title="Allip">Allip</a> is just a classic case of the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPok%C3%A9mon_test_7449.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokémon test">Pokémon test</a>, and is irrelevent. Also, guess what? <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html#It_should_be_about_everything" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia isn't about everything</a>. Why is there no article on me? Why is there no article on any of my friends? Because, much like (as far as I can see) this comedy troupe, we are not notable. The fact that so many articles on Wikipedia suck- If I come across one that does suck, I will do something about it. If there is no question that it is non-notable, I will speedy delete it. If there is question, I will bring it here. Sometimes I will <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">'prod'</a> it. Other times I will help rewrite it, or at least leave a message on the talk page, contact other editors, or tag it as needing attention in some field. The fact that I choose to edit Wikipedia as a hobby is irrelevent, and yes, I am just another brick in the wall. In nominating articles that should not be here for deletion, I am helping the encyclopedia in many ways. I don't own the website, but the whole point is that almost all of the work is done by volunteers. That doesn't mean that it is free web space, or that anything that is written should stay. Also, I haven't deleted it. I have nominated it for deletion, so that there can be a community consensus on the matter. It is not me who has chosen to delete the article, if it is deleted, but the community. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 16:58, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
