<li><b>Delete</b>: Non-notable public library. I haven't found any notability guidelines for libraries but, from searching on Google, this appears to be no different than any other public library. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 02:05, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep —</b> It's not necessarily un-notable, but it would definitely need some expansion by the person who started the article. –- <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><b><font color="#0000FF">kungming·</font></b></a><font color="green"><b>2</b></font> | <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk</sup></font></a>·<sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Kungming2_0eb5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Kungming2"><font color="#999999">Contact)</font></a></sup> 05:38, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Any institution that merely fulfills its institutional goals and does so in an ordinary way is one that is not noted in its field, is not "notable." This came from 1901, and there are thousands with Carnegie grants. Although the article is written well enough, the institution isn't of a high enough profile. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:41, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A library is like a school - it can have a profound effect on thousands of people who pass through it. Disk space is cheap. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 16:27, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete'</b>. Not notable. We would have over 100,000 more articles if we made an article on every random library. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="color:red"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>kid</b></span><span style="color:green"><b>64</b></span></a> 21:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I agree that libraries are very important, and if this is the only library that serves that city, then I agree it should be included. However, if it is one branch of all the city's libraries, I do not think that if a library is just one branch out of several in a city that every branch should be included (see <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio_Public_Library_6596.html" title="San Antonio Public Library">San Antonio Public Library</a>). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 21:44, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: By this logic, should we also have an article for the post office of each town that has only one? —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 21:52, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Commment</b> That's a good point that you make. A post office is also very important to a community, and yet, not every one has an article. It seems to me as though its a bit of hypocrisy within the wikipedia community in that schools merely need to be verified as existing in order to get an article, while everything else has to be verified <b>and</b> notable. I do not think that being verifiable also confers notability, which is apparently what many people believe. I have a big problem with the inclusion of every school just as long as you can verify that it exists. I believe that schools should only be included if they are notable for some reason. See <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. But concensus among wikipedians and apparent precedent states that all schools are notable. While I strongly disagree with that, I alone cannot change wikipedian policy or guidelines. If all schools deserve an article, then at least the main library serving a city is important enough to deserve an article. And maybe even the post office serving the community... <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 22:32, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Article contains no assertion of notability. That the community is currently making the wrong decisions and keeping school articles not worthy of inclusion is no reason to expand that to town halls, mayors, libraries, post offices, and all the other ordinary local institutions of daily life. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:58, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Architecturally notable building, citizens apparently willing to pass bond issues for any needed improvements or expansions, extremely high 94% of residents have library cards, per capita circulation is very high 23. They are a far above average library. This is the only library in the Village of Wilmette, and with its cultural programs it appears to be a vital part of the community. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:38, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Edison, but strongly disagree with the all libraries are notable crowd, and particularly with Markb, by whose definition of notability every billboard advertisement would be notable so we could have Chivas Regal billboard on the corner of 3rd and Main and other similarly "notable" articles. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 18:46, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Well I'm glad this article was fleshed out but it's too bad it took an AFD to make it happen. It didn't sound any more notable than the corner bookstore when I first ran across it. Nice job fixing it up... —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 20:10, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It was created at 22:12 on Aug 19 and the AfD was 02:00 on Aug 20. Many articles start as a mere stub and get expanded by the original or other editors. The alternative is to create the article in a word processor, then import it "full grown," which sometimes makes readers suspect it is copied from some other (copyrighted) source if it reads too well and is too long when newborn. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:17, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
