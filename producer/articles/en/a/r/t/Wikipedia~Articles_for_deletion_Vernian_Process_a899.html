<p>Looks to me like a self-promotional piece more than an informative article. Even in articles on more widely known bands they do not typically post sizable graphics of all their album covers. I don't know if this violates wikipedia's policy but it seems more like an advert.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now what's this all about then? If you guys want to delete this article. Whatever I don't really care. I mainly added it because someone else had mentioned my project in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_steampunk_works.html" title="List of steampunk works">list of steampunk works</a> article. So I wanted to create a basic encyclopedic entry for this site. I will admit that perhaps the inclusion of cover art came off as <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertising</a> so I removed them. I don't know what requires my project to be considered notable? Especially since it's mostly free. Does one have to sell their work to be considered notable?--<a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFACT50_0c93.html" title="User:FACT50">FACT50</a> 20:48, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Though it does read like an advert and needs some work to meet up to Wikipedia's standards, I believe it should be kept because <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. It is important to note that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> is simply a guideline and not policy.</p>

<dd>I have edited the article into a more encyclopedic style. I agree that it did read a bit like an advertisement (which I really wasn't intending). Like I mentioned above, I was so surprised to find a reference to this project on the steampunk related articles, so I just threw a page up. I have some collaborations that I am currently working on with <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attrition.html" title="Attrition">Attrition</a>'s Martin Bowes and <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jill_Tracy_1a90.html" title="Jill Tracy">Jill Tracy</a>. Should I not include those in the article, as they have not been released yet? Also should I link the interviews and reviews that exist of my work?

<dd>In order to be considered a notable band/music project, you have to be signed? What happened to artistic freedom? I guess being the first musician to tackle an otherwise untapped musical genre (see: <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steampunk.html" title="Steampunk">steampunk</a>) isn't notable enough? So as long as I just keep giving my music away for free, and avoid working with record labels, my work will never be considered notable? If that is the case I'll delete the article myself. I don't want to have anything to do with such a <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">fascist</a> site. --<a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFACT50_0c93.html" title="User:FACT50">FACT50</a> 09:26, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>it's not about being fascist. If there are enough reliable, independent sources (like music magazines or prominent websites) writing about an unsigned artist, then they're taking note of them. If they're signed to a label, obviously at least the label has taken note of them. But, if we don't have these guidelines, we can end up with articles based on what every kid in a garage has had published in his friends' blog about himself. It's about having reliable, sourced information. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 04:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I understand that, and I understand why you don't want every garage band listed on the site. However, reliable sources have written about this project. I mean as far as music in this genre, it doesn't get much more official than if <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Mercer_7d76.html" title="Mick Mercer">Mick Mercer</a> has written about it multiple times. He is the author of pretty much every book on the Gothic/Darkwave/Ethereal subculture. This project has also been featured in print media, that is available nationally. Nothing like SPIN, or any major magazines. You kind of have to be signed or tour year round to be noticed on a large scale. But whatever, I know that I have created something genuinely unique. It just sucks that the worlds free encyclopedia doesn't include things unless they are recognized nationally. Even if there are other music projects (i.e. <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_%28band%29_569e.html" title="Abney Park (band)">Abney Park (band)</a>) that have been inspired by this project who have valid wikipedia articles. Yet are also independent artists. --<a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFACT50_0c93.html" title="User:FACT50">FACT50</a> 08:52, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
