<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I don't know enough about the two awards listed (no citations) to determine whether they convey notability, but I doubt it. High schools are pretty much an automatic "keep" even when they only have substubs, but that's because they have sports teams heavily covered by local mainstream newspapers, they have a sense of community among the student body and parents, and other reasons that don't apply to middle schools. If kept (i.e. if much greater significance is demonstrated), rewrite from scratch (and cite sources) per author's request, dropping all existing content. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:46, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> While some editors make that blanket assertion for all levels of schools, there are many who insist that any school article must demonstrate individual <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EImportance_ffbd.html" title="WP:Importance">importance</a>. There is no "Schools <i>are</i> encyclopedic" accepted policy, just a lot of opinions and some battling guideline proposals. There are also plenty who say (for reasons I explained above) that high schools will always have enough notability if verified, but lower levels typically will not. Note that unaccredited <i>colleges</i> get a lot of "delete" votes. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:52, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Not the person who created the effect; not the facts of its development and history; not the place it is sold or the people who use it; and certainly nothing about how it fits into the history of magic levitations.

<li>Note that this effect was not exposed years ago. The illusion Isotope23 referred to is called the Balducci levitation, which has in fact been exposed for much longer than 3 years. I learned the secret when I was a child from a children's television program over a decade ago (really). The King levitation however was developed just in the last few years, and has not be widely used or exposed. Whereas you can say the Balducci has been popularized by magicians like Blaine, you can say nothing of the sort about this levitation, which hasn't been around long enough to be widely publicized to the layperson.<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerpaw62289_4ca4.html" title="User:Tigerpaw62289">Verdad</a> 01:19, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have taken your advice. I deleted the "major edit" box. At the time, I wanted to make sure that the format of the list was not edited. I have no worries about that now. The reason I don't want to take the advice of <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a>, is because I don't want to clutter the <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fueled_By_Ramen_b8ed.html" title="Fueled By Ramen">Fueled By Ramen</a> page. However, I will take that advice if it is necessary for me to do so. If you want proof of my information, please visit the <a href="http://www.fueledbyramen.com/releases/" class="external text" title="http://www.fueledbyramen.com/releases/" rel="nofollow">release page</a> on the label's official website. For release dates, I have used <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. I have other sources of information that I will use to determine the identity of the missing releases. I will eventually add these links to the bottom of the page. I don't see why you say that this list does not serve a valid purpose. The purpose is to see the history of releases by the label. I will continue to work on this article, and I will put it in the proper place that you determine.

<p>doesn't meet "Notability (music)" standards of:</p>
<p>"A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, dj etc) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p>
<p>Has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country[1]. Has had a record certified gold or higher in at least one large or medium-sized country. Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country[1], reported in notable and verifiable sources. Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable). Has been prominently featured in any major music media. Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such. Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability. Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award. Has won or placed in a major music competition. Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.) Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network. Has been the subject of a half hour or hour broadcast on a national radio network. "</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - In case there is any further doubt, I believe the Hangovers meet the standards of notability. The ensemble has gone on numerous international tours, traveling to Germany in 1970, and making their first solo tour to Bermuda in 1971. On a 1995 tour to Japan, they received attention by donating half of their tour profits to the Kobe Earthquake Relief Fund. They most recently toured London in June 2005 and will be touring Italy in March 2006. In March 2004, they were shown performing on the Brazilian national evening news, Jornal Nacional. Alumni include such notables as <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Keyes_43a9.html" title="Alan Keyes">Alan Keyes</a>. They have competed in international competitions such as the Intercollegiate Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA), advancing to the semifinals in 2001. They can be heard on the PBS American Experience documentary "Rescue at Sea." They are the second oldest a cappella group at <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_University_7419.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>, certainly the most well-traveled, and arguably the most musical. In 1980, their original single titled "Facetime" received national recognition and earned mention in Yale's "Guide to Selective Colleges." The song was recently re-recorded on the album "Blackout" with another original song, "River to the Sea," both of which received high marks from the Recorded A Cappella Review Board (RARB).

<li>Comment: He may be a martial arts fighter, but numerous things in the article are clearly false beyond what is already mentioned. There is no Northeastern Martial Arts Association. Nor is there an East Stroudsboug State University. Also, Ritler Gracie is clearly a joke as all Gracie first names start with R, but are pronounced like an H. So the pronounciation of the name would be "Hitler Gracie". I'm also not aware of a Pennsylvannia Top Team, although there is a small chance it may actually exist. Finally, Mixed martial arts events are not legal in PA so the existence of a NMAA’s Philadelphia Fire 7 event is unlikely.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> POV is not a reason to delete; it may be a reason to rename. The solution to POV is to *edit*. I did a quick search on google "Missolonghi Turkish Massacre" and found several references (I don't know how credible) to an alleged series of massacres of Turkish people by the Greek independence forces. [<a href="http://atlas.cc.itu.edu.tr/~altilar/tobi/2023/2023_4/sam_paper_ataov.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://atlas.cc.itu.edu.tr/~altilar/tobi/2023/2023_4/sam_paper_ataov.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>] (A Turkish source, but we don't discount German or Jewish sources related to the Holocaust, or Armenian ones related to that genocide.) See also [<a href="http://www.globusz.com/ebooks/Europe/00000026.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globusz.com/ebooks/Europe/00000026.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>] an ebook of unknown authorship but which reads on a quick scan as some reprint of a public domain item of the late 19th or early 20th century. Another Turkish source comes up on an obviously biased website "greekmurderers.com" [<a href="http://www.greekmurderers.net/rebel02.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greekmurderers.net/rebel02.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>]. So at least the point of view has been put forward that these massacres did indeed take place; there are probably conflicting accounts. I am not as well versed on the subject as others: could there have been such massacres? If so, then edit the article to make the cases pro &amp; con &amp; NPOV. If we delete the article are we saying that the alleged massacres did not happen or that they cannot be verified or that we as editors cannot be bothered to try to untangle the truth. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:34, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> not my area of expertise, but I just have difficulty with POV being a reason to delete; we have many articles here that are POV and have been flagged thus for months but there is no reason to delete them. There may indeed be 2 sides to this article, I just have difficulty with deleting something because the otherside hasn't (yet) been written up.

<li>Professors at my Univerisity (NYU) have encouraged me to publish this article at Wikipedia as a testing ground for a potential Senior Thesis that I will be writing.

<p><b>Self-nomination</b>: I the creator of this page nominate it for deletion. The following are my reasons:</p>
<p>(1) This article was created to curb the size of the main <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> article - there is no specific chapter of Gandhi's life being tackled here (for example, there is a separate <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_career_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_7751.html" title="Military career of Hugo Chávez">Military career of Hugo Chávez</a>, but this article contains sections of generalizations and analysis of Gandhi's life).</p>
<p>(2) A lot of the data is mainly different perspectives and analyses of Gandhi - these should be dealt with in the main article. A lot of it is POV language, and there is a lot of fancruft present. All this contravenes Wikipedia norms.</p>
<p>(3) There should not be a major deviation from the main article, which is an FA. The existence of this article impedes the purpose of the main one.</p>

<li>Comment, it doesn't meet the speedy criteria because it appears the material was written by different people, just moved into this article, though correct me if I'm wrong. The topic is worthy, as a subtopic of an important person of being covered in it's own article. It is an important facet of the man. If it is POV, NPOV it.

However, I've found that it's been very successful in getting people to add extra information which would never otherwise be compiled, and I attribute that to it being posted on a Wiki. So I was wondering if people have a recommendation for another Wiki that could be a useful host for such a list, so I can continue to work on adding to it? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Ben Raue</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraue_14e3.html" title="User talk:Braue">Talk</a>) 11:54, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I won't take it elsewhere unless it gets deleted. I was just trying to find a way that I can still work on it in Wiki form if Wikipedia won't have it.

<dd>You should've called it "saints who committed war crimes" then. I'm not sure that'd work either, but "genocide" means trying to murder an entire group of people. Thomas More may have ideally wanted Protestantism to be gone from England, but I don't think murdering them all was his primary method. (His son-in-law was a reconvert from Lutheranism I think) I doubt Charles I would fit either, but if he would I'd assume it'd be against some American Indian people like Powhatan's or something.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>I guess I have to concede that the title doesn't really fit the examples, and I can't come up with any truly genocidal saints (I'm sure there are some). Those who want to use this as a band name are welcome to it. If I delete the title from Wikipedia, I guess I'm also withdrawing it from the public domain, so you are free to slap a copyright on it. I am having trouble coming up with a short name that would better describe these Tainted Saints. "Atrocities of religious figures" would bring in thousands of popes, cardinals and whatever that engaged in war crimes, but were never made saints. It would also bring in the Protestants like Cromwell who did stuff that was just as bad, but, so far as I know, have never been declared "saints" by any religion.M dorothy</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Saints who committed war crimes" is pretty long, and it suffers from the limitation that it seems to exclude crimes against humanity outside of war, which better describes the two examples I have listed. I have considered Nicholas II, who would be more of a war criminal. The Wikipedia article on him does not, however, mention anything about him that I would consider a war crime, so this has to wait until I do outside research.M dorothy</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - Seems to be part of an edit war over the Jung Sin Yuk-Do entry, and one side put this up to slap the other side, which really isn't appropriate for an encyclopedia. There are too many 'he did this' and 'he didn't do that but should have' lines; also, it links several times to the same martial arts entry, so I wonder about this entry's importance. <a href="../../../d/d/l/User%7EDdlamb_bd4d.html" title="User:Ddlamb">ddlamb</a> 09:50, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Response</b>. This is where I totally agree. What would be everyone's preference for documenting this type of information, namely: image, history, topic covered, relationship to society and culture, statistics, etc.?

<li>Older Boy Scout Handbooks are perfectly good resources for identifying old badge designs. There are also various lists out there as to when badges were added, revised, or had their names changed. While such things may be interesting, especially for the Eagle-required badges, I don't think that either bits of data are alone sufficient to make a given article notable. That the rest of the article is POV rambling, listing of badge requirements, and a list of weblinks doesn't help.

As I have continued work, I have incorporated the few positive suggestions listed above. The current page still needs some work (like many an article) but is dramatically different than the article at the time the AfD was posted. Here are some specific responses to the concerns listed above:
<ul>
<li>How-to guide to getting to the badge. This is inaccurate. There is nothing on the site that tells a Scout how to earn the badge, except for a link to the requirements, which are common knowledge. The site (in current form) is a description of the merit badge and what its goals and purposes are. It is clearly information about the merit badge itself.</li>
<li>List of links - Many articles start by cataloging what is already known. I was in the process of developing the site and had collected a list of related articles and links. Due to some positive comments, the direction of the article was changed to comply with Wikipedia policy, and the links are now used in a more appropriate fashion.</li>
<li>Go and buy the book - Seems counterintuitive that anybody would want to take information off Wikipedia because some of it is already available in a book somewhere.</li>
<li>Eventually, one would expect that other information about the merit badge itself - history, changes, impact, etc. would appear on this page. This will be of interest to many users, especially those that are involved in collecting patches, etc.</li>

<dd>Before I knew the proper protocol for resolving AfD requests, I removed the AfD tags on the article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think it does/did meet Speedy Keep because the inital AfD was based on an unfinished article (clearly a misunderstanding). Notice that some people have changed their positions now that they have seen the whole article.</dd>
<dd>Point well taken on the temper. Not everyone is a conspiratory deletionist, just a couple, at most. I have calmed down considerably since yesterday. I was referring to some of the insensitive and and inflammatory (to me) remarks (for example, "After all, how much is there to say about the merit badge? Information about pulp and paper already exists in various articles. Lists of requirements don't belong on Wikipedia. Merit badge pamphlets don't belong on Wikipedia.") that were meant to torpedo the page right off the bat without any regard given to an attempt to improve or fix it. I think those are squarely the types of things that are referred to in the "don't bite" article. I understand the need for people to patrol against random or wacky new stuff, but it seems necessary for the established users to welcome and guide newcomers rather than just jump on an unfinished page and suggest deleting it. Now we've got that cleared up, I am pleased at the level of debate on what this page should look like if it is to stay a part of Wikipedia. I am still thinking about wikibooks, but haven't even figured wikipedia out yet. I think we are now to the point where we can disagree about whether there is enough value in a particular topic to keep it on Wikipedia, but those are the types of disagreements where we can "agree to disagree." <a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 22:37, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think these mb articles should provide a history of the badge itself, give a general overview of the topic, and provide wiki and web resources the Scouts could use to earn the MB. It should not be a mere collecting point, nor should it replace the MB pamphlet. As it stands at this moment, this article just needs some formatting and fleshing out. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 02:23, 14 February 2006 (UTC), Scouting Project and Portal coordinator</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for now. I cleaned up the article quite a bit, and trimmed out a lot of the "how to" and the completely unnececssary list of links from the bottom. It still needs more work, in particular, the "See also" section can probably be removed. For the record, I thought it <i>was</i> a thinly-disguised how-to page. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 03:54, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>After much careful thought and looks at the pages that this links to, I think this page should be <b>deleted</b> for these reasons: <b>1.</b>It is a glorified list, the stuff it talks about is better explained on the pages it links to, which are themselves well-linked. <b>2.</b>There are no articles like this for any other country. <b>3.</b>The page is very incomplete and poorly done, and seems to have a little trouble deciding what an "ethnicity" is. It has been tagged for cleanup sine April 2005 and no-one's really done anything about it.

<p>Obvious vanity page, created by a Finnish retired electronic musician over a week ago, then abandoned. The author only ever edited this article and <a href="../../../e/l/w/Elwood.html" title="Elwood">Elwood</a>, to add a link to this article. While the article establishes some notability, I think he's not notable enough by far. I'm both Finnish and an ex-Amigan and have never heard of him. If the article is not deleted it should be severely cleaned up and wikified as it currently reads more like a fansite than an encyclopedia article. "Elwood79" gets 376 Google hits and "Jussi-Matti Salmela" gets 41.

<li>I tried to, but all Google hits for "Balvanyos" turned out to be some kind of hotel booking sites. One of those I tried didn't even find hotels in the same country - the nearest was in Italy. I could, of course, simply remove all the advertising, but that would only leave the first paragraph, which would only tell where Balvanyos is and not establish any notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Such a shame. Balvanyos seems like a <b>very</b> notable place in Romania, and if someone could write a good Wikipedia article, then it would definitely deserve a place in Wikipedia.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Although the notvote-counters should note that Gwernol has notvoted twice, the points made by the keepers are enough to mean that a numeric two-thirds isn't enough here.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> an article about a company isn't necessarily an advertisement, it all depends how notable the company is. From front google hits it seems to be notable in their field at least. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElfguy_25ac.html" title="User:Elfguy">Elfguy</a> 14:52, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Elfguy, this company is notable in their field: they are a significant supplier of kits to model railway builders. The page does need work and it was apparently added by the owner of the company, but I believe it is better for the Wiki community to improve this page than simply delete it. Worsley Works are a major kit manufacturer and deserve an entry. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 16:14, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> Seems to be known among model train enthusaists, but does not, at least to my limited searching, seem to stand out more than any of the other modelers. Needs to show more evidence of notability. Note: Just because the author of an article has much to do with that article (be it about the person or their company) does not automatically make it vanity; just 94.28% of the time. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 21:03, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A couple more points (sorry): Worsley Works have been written up in several of the modeling journals (for example, "Sixteen Millimetres Today" and "Railway Modeller", I can dig out specific issues if required) so clearly do meet the criteria of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Second if we want to be encyclopedic then I'd suggest we do want to include manufacturers like Worsley and others of note. In fact that's what I intend to do (given time...) from the list at the end of <a href="../../../1/6/_/16_mm_scale.html" title="16 mm scale">16_mm_scale</a>.</li>

<li><b>Expand</b> Which I did. As they say, <b>be bold</b>. The whole reason this article was started is because of the amount of info in the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio.html" title="Amateur radio">Amateur radio</a> article was making the article too heavy, and I (and others) don't believe that Amateur radio was covering this adequately. the whole problem was that we would keep getting more and more theories that were not true in the Amateur radio article. All the article says now is that the origins are obscure. People want to know more and this article as a stand alone article is the only way we can assure the integrity of the Amateur radio article. These theories were part of the problem with taking up too much space. There are many many other theories that can be added to expand this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is going to have a lower standard for inclusion of information since it is so speculative a topic. Having it inamateur radio would cause information that is highly speculative to be in an article that is very different. Having two articles would allow an editorial standard appropriate to each article. Also this article could carry a lot of information that would unbalance the size of each subsection of amateur radio if it were there. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 22:16, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hang on! I placed this information here, as it is the first online example I can find of a "market for services" - where the whole service is carried out online, end to end, in particulary taking account of the post-eBay/Skype/VOIP world. If the wording seems too much like an "ad" the it can be changed. Companies are already listed on Wikipedia, so that in itself is not a cause for concern. The question is whether the entry adds value to users - which I think it does. Lets start a debate around that. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cekbrooks (<a href="../../../c/e/k/User_talk%7ECekbrooks_347a.html" title="User talk:Cekbrooks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cekbrooks_073c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cekbrooks">contribs</a>) , at 11:44, 10 February 2006.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the question is whether the company can be considered <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> (some guidelines <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">here</a>). We might also ask whether Cekbrooks has an interest in the company concerned? All edits by that username have promoted "Tutoreasy". <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 14:10, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks. I've patched up the Rasputin article, though I fancy it could still use some checking by a specialist. A joke's a joke (though not in this case a funny one), but this kind of childish prank wastes people's time, misleads the innocent, and seriously damages the credibility of Wikipedia.

<p>My sense is that these folks' charge for deletion comes from a place of homophobia. Jim French's COLT Studio group wrote the book on gay male erotica for the past 40 years. Go to ANY bookstore - gay, adult or otherwise and will see COLT titles.</p>

<p>Wrongfully speedied, rightfully unspeedied, but despite protestations of editors I think not notable. Google for "The Better Mod" Blockland gets about 50 unique hits, including mirrors. I would simply merge and redirect, but (a) the mod is already mentioned in Blockland and (b) it's tagged as disputed anyway, and I would not know how much is valid. In the end this is a large article on a very very trivial subject with no apparent claim to wider importance. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 15:09, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I do not think any of them have enough independent interest to support an article, they should be either deleted or merged into a stronger article. Additionally the editors who raised the DRV were concerned that their mod was being treated in an unfair manner by proponents of rival game mods: in the interests of fairness I think it befits us to consider the related game mods side by side. --- <b>Charles Stewart</b><sup><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChalst_00d6.html" title="User talk:Chalst">(talk)</a></sup> 16:43, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just want to clarify that I think all mod articles should be deleted for the fact that they aren't nearly notable enough. I barely think Blockland deserves an article.

<li><b>Delete All</b> as discussed by Charles Stewart. The children that started this little fetish did so out of spite, so their trivial comments about small free game should be removed and more or less relegated to the discussion section of the Blockland entry. Probably with a few links to actual working pages in the mods section of the entry as all legitimate information about a mod would be listed on thier website. Furthermore, these elleged POV comments about TBM are not simple POV, they are unfounded, unresearched, and untrue. Put an end to these childish cock fights, delete the lot of them.

The article quoted above is more about the game than the company. Also, I must say I would prefer the guidelines at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> to be made clearer. Most new restaurants are likely to get an article in a local newspaper, yet that does not make them suitable for inclusion in a general-purpose encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 20:52, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A product or service is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p>

<li>I can assure you I am NOT an oak Tree, a fern, or any sort of other "plant". As far as I can determine, from reading the CURRENT Wiki guidelines, this request for deletion is not valid. I have disproven both intitial objections ("non-notable" and "advertising")and am well within the letter and spirit of the "law", on both entries. Instead of heaping the abuse on a first time poster, and trying to kill my articles, how about actually doing something CONSTRUCTIVE and help me "fix" it! Springheeledjack 20:39, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Okay, for starters, NO ALL CAPS IN SECTION HEADERS. That <b>screams</b> "we copied from a press release", whether you did so or not. Secondly, keep the language neutral. "The World of YBS" is market-speak. "Public reaction" or something like that is neutral. Lastly, again, look at some of the articles on games, then compare it to yours. Yours does sound like a press release. Tone down the language and keep it neutral. Sentences like <i>"The YBS website even solicits people to submit new variations and games using the contents of the YBS box."</i> aren't going to cut it, while something like <i>"On the website, the company allows for the posting of variations and modifications to game rules"</i> might work better. Granted, YMMV, but I'm hoping you're seeing what I'm getting at.</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> per nominator. Most Google hits are unrelated, and the rest seem either "local boy makes good" or from non-notable sites. Most BoardGameGeek game pages have much more indication of interest from people other than the designer. For contrast, see <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy_%28game%29.html" title="Diplomacy (game)">Diplomacy (game)</a> which has indications of notability and widespread influence, and many external sites that are real references and hobby-service sites (not just advertising and fan-speculation sites). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:52, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. No doubt at all that this is a real, released product. But the press link cited above says that it's sold just 600 units after nearly a year on the market, and it's had no attention on Boardgamegeek--not even any Personal Comments, which even the most obscure games usually have a few. It's a little hard to say where the line should be drawn with things like board games, but I'm sorry to say that I don't think this one makes it yet. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 01:14, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> only states that "multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself" need to exist for it to be "notable". Those sources clearly exist. There is no requirement for a product or subject to have a "wide spread influence" or to sell above a certain number of units, for it to be "notable". If that were the case, at least 30% of Wikipedia should be deleted immediately on the grounds of "wide spread influence" alone. So, until the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is altered regarding this, your objections are completely unfounded.

<p><s>*<b>Keep Listed</b> - I live in New York and have traveled to Jerusalem a number of times on business and pleasure. I have attended this Kiddush along with up to 50 other people on a given week. It is not in fact renowed throughout the Jewish world, however, it is well known among a wide circle of Jews from all walks of life (though mostly single) in major cities throughout the world, so I'd vote to keep it listed. Especially since this "Kiddush Club" is not a group vying for greater visibility, a Wikipedia reference for this topic is not an attempt at self-agrandizement. I think it could be useful reference for on off-handed remark by someone in this clique on a website, such as "My wife and I met at <i>Ted's Kiduush</i> about 4 years ago."

<li><b>Sigh</b>. Look, folks, I'm sure Ted is a very nice guy, and I'm sure the Kiddush is important to the small circle of people who frequent it, but that doesn't make it a topic for an encyclopedia article. Let me try an analogy. I work for a company which has a wikipedia article about it. It deserves the article because it's an international company with 25,000 employees worth $30 Billion. But, my particular office doesn't have an article about it. It's a nice office. It's very important to the 100 or so people working in it, and I can certainly count people from more than a half dozen countries. We even have three (that I know of) husband-wife pairs, although I don't know for sure that they met while working here. We've probably got Steelers fans, and I know some people here who are good cooks, some of whom probably have a good chulnt recipe or two on their hard drives. None of this makes the office worthy of having a wikipedia article written about it. The goal of Wikipedia is to document things which are important, not as a tool to make things important. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 15:53, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Lol. Roy I appreciate the humor of your response and get the point. I also accept the logic. I realize that you (and the others) are probably extremely annoyed by what you call "sockpuppets", but realize that the people who posted here were not trying to manipulate the process by making something seem more important than it is. They were simply trying to counterbalance <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a>'s claim that it must not be a notable group because he lives in Jerusalem and has never heard of it. If THAT was the basis of the decision to remove the article then the decision was flawed. But if, as you have all clarified, the criteria for proving notability is citation of sources (and not personal experience), then the group probably does not meet Wikipedia's definition of notability. One thing to consider, in general, when you all debate the idea of notability - perhaps "Google" should not be the test of notability for ALL things. With or without Wikipedia the kiddush will go on, and I invite <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> to come and enjoy (drop by Chovevai synagogue around 11ish and ask around).

At least half the list fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and most of the rest are considered "verified" based solely on the fact that they are members of a single <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_tank.html" title="Think tank">think tank</a>. In the past, various people have been randomly added and removed from the list depending on the POV of whatever editor was interested in the page at the time. A good argument can be made that the list's very existence violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, given that there are several competing nebulous definitions of "neoconservative". And given those competing definitions, there could be libel issues if someone on the list disagrees with his/her listing there. Lastly, such a list can never be truly encyclopedic; it's just a random collection of whatever names have come to mind over time (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>). <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 17:37, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but seriously clean up.

<li><b>Delete</b> as above. "List of self-described..." as suggested by ikh would be useful if complete, but often times you won't hear neoconservatives label themselves that; I think citing self-descriptions would be almost impossible or lead to noticeable (uncitable) absences from the list, rendering it unauthoritative for those aware of this movement and misleading to those seeking information. --<a href="../../../d/c/g/User%7EDcgomez_01ce.html" title="User:Dcgomez">Derek</a> 23:03, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No way in the world that this can be encyclopaedic. It's a list with arbitrary inclusion criterion, apparently created just for the sake of having such a list.

<li><b>Delete</b> Very weasel-worded list. I can tell someone I reckon Britney Spears is a neoconservative, and add her? -- Mithent 16:46, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> 1st, why does the "List of Neoconservatives" redirect to the weasel-worded title of the article whose deletion is under debate rather than vice-versa? 2nd is Neoconservative a defined enough term? we do have lots of lists of people, but mostly the lists are pointing to something defined enough that we can attempt to lump people either in the list or out of it (e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_left-handed_people.html" title="List of left-handed people">List of left-handed people</a> where some may debate the existence of handedness or whether a person should or shouldn't be included on the list, at least we know what we're debating). Until we as a community are convinced that "Neoconservatives" means the same something to most people, the list is of no value. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 18:27, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did not intend to offend you nor put words in your mouth. Touche for the other names. I'm still a BIT confused as to why you and the nom are comparing this first name with surnames though...if you could clear that up I'd be most appreciative. If Hollywood and Google aren't convincing enough for you that is fine. We will see what the admins think when they see this talk page. Yes? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadangry_e9cc.html" title="User:Madangry">Madangry</a> 22:33, 9 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No worries, and I apologize in turn if I seemed a little curt myself. Anyway... this article actually does look a lot better than when I origianlly saw it. In fact, I'll do a little cleanup myself, just to bring it up to standard and make it more in line with some of the similar name pages. As for the "surname" thing... I actually did think it was one, since I didn't realize from the context on the page that it was a given name. The cleanup helped a lot.&#160;:) Oh yeah, <b>keep</b> now that the article is less of a dicdef and is definitely more encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 05:48, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. The arguments made for deletion are thorough, compelling and cogent. The arguments made for keeping signally and uniformly fail to address a single point the deleters make. One of them even <i>agrees</i> on one of the substantive points! For the votecounters, even if I count every single vote, there's still well more than the two-thirds level and with any kind of commonplace treatment, it'd be higher still. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:40, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I’m renominating <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hogwarts_ed85.html" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> for <b>deletion</b>. I have stated most of these concerns on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Hogwarts_b4d1.html" title="Talk:Battle of Hogwarts">talk page</a> months ago but they have not been responded to. I’ll recap the highlights here.</p>
<p>First, I feel that a sufficient summary of the book exists on <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter">Muggles’ Guide to Harry Potter</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a> as well as the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikicities.com" class="external text" title="http://harrypotter.wikicities.com" rel="nofollow">Harry Potter Wiki</a> which are the appropriate places for a book summary which literally tries to include every substantive detail. I believe that not only is the article name non-canonical but the framing of this part of the book as a "battle" constitutes POV <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, essentially providing a blank check for fans to add non-canonical analysis and interpretations of the text.</p>
<p>I'll refrain from calling it "Potter-cruft" (but it is You-Know-What). In the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Battle_of_Hogwarts_95cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Battle of Hogwarts">first vote</a>, the result was no consensus; the key vote there was <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> who felt that the <i>material</i> belonged on wikipedia even if the <i>article</i> didn't. As I've stated above, the content is on wikipedia in other appropriate places.</p>
<p>There are three main arguments against deletion. The first is precenent: <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Pelennor_Fields_69e5.html" title="Battle of the Pelennor Fields">Battle of the Pelennor Fields</a>, as well as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Windmill_%28Animal_Farm%29_44b0.html" title="Battle of the Windmill (Animal Farm)">Battle of the Windmill</a> all have articles, and the last article is a non-canonical name. I am fine with all of these articles, but I would like to point out that the key distinction is that the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Windmill_%28Animal_Farm%29_44b0.html" title="Battle of the Windmill (Animal Farm)">Battle of the Windmill</a> is canonically agreed to as a <i>battle</i> even if there is no definite name for it. That is clearly not the case with the Battle of Hogwarts. There is just as much justificaiton for making the end of HBP a battle as for making Battle of Home Alone for the end of the film <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Alone_1df3.html" title="Home Alone">Home Alone</a>.</p>
<p>The second is that this is an important part of the plot. That may be true, but this is not the proper method of article forking. The proper process should be to put all the plot content in the main article for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a>. Then, if there an overflow of notable plot details there the daughter article of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince plot should be created. However, the apparent community consensus judging by the first six books is that the main article should contain a shorter plot summary with a more detailed one in the Muggles' Guide.</p>
<p>The third argument is that this content is too long to be merged into the main article. That concern collapses into the second one which I have addressed above. However, I would like to add that part of the reason for the extreme length of this article is that the arbitrary format of a "battle" imposed on it. If this article were reduced to a mere plot summary, it would be shorter. And of course, even then, this would be an innapropriate method of content forking.</p>
<p>Please do not simply vote <b>merge</b> on this article unless you have read both articles and personally intent to merge the contests. Merges have been proposed in the past on multiple occasions but they are never followed through on and the merger notice is removed hourly by vandals. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 20:51, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Note</b> Don't know wnough to vote on this but if, as the article itself says, "the series of events are never referred to as the 'Battle of Hogwarts' in the books", the title/concept would surely have to have achieved a <i>lot</i> of currency to be legitimate. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 21:00, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with Flapdragon. The <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit_of_Caerbannog_6559.html" title="Rabbit of Caerbannog">Rabbit of Caerbannog</a> from <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail_3131.html" title="Monty Python and the Holy Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></i> is better known as the "Vorpal Bunny" (a name never mentioned in the film), because the name gained currency that way. If everyone's calling it "The Battle of Hogwarts" even if the name isn't mentioned in the book, that's a sign that it's significant enough to become noteworthy on its own. As for myself, I don't have a vote on it one way or another.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 21:09, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Those who point out there isn't actually any encyclopedic commentary in this article are correct — whether it is Wikisourceable or not, I am unclear as I do not work on that project (although I suspect it probably has all the biblical source material it wants by now). Thus, I think this is an AfD that does deal quite specifically with this version of this material. There seems to be a formative, but currently insubstantial suggestion that something similar to this could be done very much more satisfactorily, and possibly under a different title. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:46, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Thank you for that helpful information, Kinu. Genesis 1:1-1:3 all have individual articles (see the links at the bottom of this article), and all have similar comparisons between different versions of the verses. However, <a href="../../../1/_/_/Genesis_1%7E1.html" title="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</a> especially has some information that could be worth keeping. Perhaps keep this article with added commentary, keep Genesis 1:1 for notability and good information, and delete <a href="../../../2/_/_/Genesis_1%7E2.html" title="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</a> and <a href="../../../3/_/_/Genesis_1%7E3.html" title="Genesis 1:3">Genesis 1:3</a> as unnecessary? -<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanaman5_142b.html" title="User:Danaman5">Danaman5</a> 21:18, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but rename.</b> I have two comments. (A) Yes, I agree that this page is redundant with 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, but I vehemently oppose the idea that every Bible verse gets a separate Wikipedia page. So I would rather delete 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, and keep the Genesis 1:1-3 page. (B) Before deleting the article Genesis 1:1-3, take a look at what links to it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Genesis_1:1-3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Genesis_1:1-3" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. It seems to me that this article is <i>not</i> really about Genesis 1:1-3. It is about a comparision of major Bible translations. Notice that the pages that link to it are linking for that reason, and indeed Genesis 1:1-3 has a much more comprehensive list of Bible translations than do the individual verse pages. So I vote to keep it but rename it something like "Old Testament Translation Samples" or something along those lines. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrence_King_e04f.html" title="User:Lawrence King">Lawrence King</a> 03:54, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is an extremely valuable page to see a different old testament translations compared. I think that the all the Wikipedia articles on Bible translations would be severely diminished without a single page where examples of each of the translations can be easily compared. The comparison of versions shown on <a href="../../../1/_/_/Genesis_1%7E1.html" title="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</a> is nearly worthless due to their similarity. I do <i>not</i> support having hundreds (or even thousands) of verses on Wikipedia, but I <i>do</i> think that these particular verses are the most obvious one's to allow a comparison of Old Testament translations, and thus serve an extremely valuable role in the whole Bible translation domain.</li>
<li>I understand <i>Lawrence King's</i> point that the page is really about a comparison rather than about a particular attempt per se to explain these verses, nonetheless, for the name to be consistent with other verses (such as <a href="../../../1/6/_/John_3%7E16.html" title="John 3:16">John 3:16</a>), I think they have the correct Wikipedia title - by all means have a redirect page called "Comparison of Old Testament verses" or do a link of the type [[Genesis 1:1-3|Comparison of Old Testament verses]], but leave the name as is.<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrusselsshrek_6689.html" title="User:Brusselsshrek">Brusselsshrek</a> 16:11, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Google is not the only source of valid notability in the world; there are lots of things which nobody bothers to put online. The phrase, as a meme, is extremely widely recognized (everyone I know socially seems to know it). Google can be used to show that something is notable, and lack of google hits is reason to suspect it isn't notable, but lack of google hits <i>is not</i> proof that subject is not notable. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 22:00, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: look, the whole "unique google hits" thing is a total fallacy. I'd really love it if folks stopped citing it on AfD. If we buy it, then Microsoft gets just 512 "unique" hits to my own 493 "unique" results. It's just Google's attempt to present you with relevant results, not any indicator that results beyond that point are totally non-unique, nor am I just 19 hits less notable than Microsoft. <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_9077.html" title="User:Adrian"><font color="#000000">A</font></a></b><font color="#646060">drian</font> <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdrian_59cc.html" title="User talk:Adrian"><font color="#000000">L</font></a></b><font color="#646060">amo</font> <b><font color="#F660AB">··</font></b> 21:58, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The expression, as I have always heard it, uses the plural, "clown<b>s</b> will eat me." You'll also find that that formation returns far more unique google hits (if we're still using google as an indicator). Accordingly, even if this article is kept, it should probably be moved to this more well know and used turn of phrase, even if the Simpsons' original derivation was singular. This should probably be coupled with a note in the article to the effect that the plural designation is how the phrase is generally used in the parlance. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 00:14, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or perhaps <b>Merge</b> I have a problem with phrases being in Wikipedia unless they're undeniably a cultural phenomena (like for example, Wuzzzup). When I think of whether articles should be on Wikipedia I think, would I ever find this article in a book encyclopedia? It's a slippery slope. By the keep votes here, one could make the argument that almost any joke from The Simpsons/Family Guy could be made into its own article (which seems to be a disappointing trend on Wikipedia). Merge seems to be a fair compromise. I've heard lots of people (and I profess to doing it myself) do the "Who else but Quagmire" joke from Family Guy. It's certainly become a phrase. But if you'll notice, they mentioned that detail in the article <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breaking_Out_Is_Hard_to_Do_4409.html" title="Breaking Out Is Hard to Do">Breaking Out Is Hard to Do</a>, instead of making it its own article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Personally, I couldn't care less about this page but it raises a point - what should be deleted and what shouldn't be? There is a synopsis of every episode of <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a> for goodness sake, and at least this football team is real. I would rather have every pub team in the UK in wiki than pages and pages devoted to cartoon catchphrases, as we seem to have. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGretnagod_0e96.html" title="User:Gretnagod">Gretnagod</a> 02:13, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're trying to compare apples and oranges here - pub football teams and cartoon series are quite different things. For what it's worth, a defender of Family Guy could justify its detailed inclusion by virtue of it getting several million viewers (and many more who buy the DVDs), while pub teams are generally watched by the proverbial three men and a dog. WP's systemic bias to things like Western cartoon shows is a problem, but it's not one solved by filling it with articles about the totally obscure. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 08:35, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I would take a wide interpretation of notability in wikipedia with respect to football teams/competitions: as long as it is a serious and known one in real life, it should be deemed notable without regards of whether it is within a league structure recognised by FIFA or its affiliates (eg The FA). --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 04:14, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Alexa rank 135,844. I suspect that the site is notable in its field, but first page of Google hits are pages of creator's websites, local school districts, and the WP article, rather than feature coverage by major media or major adademic publications. <s>No vote</s>, pending further evidence. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>After a couple of days, not much data, so I would suggest a <b>merge and redirect</b> to an article such as "online grade reporting system", per R6MaY89 below. Keeping a redirect would satisfy the user info-vector that Kappa identifies below, without needing to focus on the brand more than its importance requires. Are there other similar systems which are in hundreds of other high schools?

<ul>
<li>From the article: "K12Planet and other similar websites (such as Thinkwave and MyGradeBook) have revolutionized grading by allowing parents continual access to student performance rather than just at the end of the quarter or through a parent-teacher conference." Doesn't make it sound like this one is dominant nor sole pioneer. Can some educators comment? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:43, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is not the dominant one, all of the companies are essentially the same. My school has used all three (K12, MGB, ThinkWave) in the past four years and I have noticed that though each has some advanced features, they all do the same job.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. OK, this is an excellent illustration of the problems which come of merging the article before the AFD is finished. Moink pointed out that the text is a copyvio. Therefore, I will also remove the section in the Taylor County article. One other thing, Taylor County is not the only county to have had white only proms, the same practise has taken place in <a href="../../../t/o/o/Toombs_County%2C_Georgia_dda8.html" title="Toombs County, Georgia">Toombs County, Georgia</a> as well, and so redirecting this to Taylor County won't make all that much sense. If a new article is to be created here I recommend that it be about segregated proms in general, and not just about what happened in a particular county. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 16:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or better still, merge. I don't see anything POV here - just a description of events.

So, in my opinion, the information should be merged into "prom" as an interesting set of facts occuring in a specific place as evidence for some of the problems with the "prom" (which, to someone who went to high school outside the US seems like torture!)

<li><b>Keep</b> This company is a player in sheepskin boots and Australian footwear. They do have coverage and are featured in an Australian Broadcast Commission (ABC) documentary on sheepskin boots in Australia. Additionally, I have seen press releases and articles in print so the internet will soon follow. (Shyets04 20:11, 14 February 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I (the initial uploader) would not say it is "original research that creates primary sources". The information in the page is extracted from the references at the end of the page, SPIRES and other sources. It is "source-based research", as defined in the wikipedia policies and guidelines. The fact it is hard or time consuming to collect (it was) does not make it a primary source. I agree it does not seem very "enciclopedic" in style, but that is a matter of edition. ¿Perhaps to supress the initial parragraph? <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArivero_4780.html" title="User:Arivero">Arivero</a> 09:46, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep/Cleanup</b> The idea of tracking the development of a profession or field (who mentored whom) has the potential to be very interesting to other people who are interested in the history of the field. (Like charting all the different bands that member of "Yes" have been in.) It's not original research IMHO but a particular way of categorizing a field. (You could perform the same function by creating WP categories "Trained with Max Planck", "Trained with Pauli" and so on.) On the other hand, the format is not very user friendly. Can WP accomodate a graphical chart form with hotlinks? Alternatively the author may want to try some alternative text display schemes used by genealogists.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:40, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> OK it's interesting, but what is your source? Who decides the genealogy tree? If it's one or a group of Wikipedia editors, then it's original research. Show sources that say that so-and-so was mentored/influenced by so-and-so or that already has such a tree.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's in bad shape as it is, but it's a simple enough <i>matter of record</i> who was whose PhD advisor, which defines the genealogy. Once of the sources is spires <a href="http://slac.stanford.edu/spires/" class="external autonumber" title="http://slac.stanford.edu/spires/" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> but there are others. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 03:10, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps the introduction, the methodology and sources could be moved to an entry on scientific genealogy, I can do it next week. They are good enough sources for chemistry, mathematics and some branchs of physics. I am told by humanity colleagues that it is not possible to do the same thing in philosophy (no oficial advisors), so <i>scientific</i> seems the right term. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArivero_4780.html" title="User:Arivero">arivero</a></li>
