<li>That same article says: "When you wonder what should or should not be in an article named "whatever", ask youself what a reader would expect under "whatever" in an encyclopedia." For this title, I would expect something about a school, not nothing at all.

<ul>
<li>I should have been clearer - whether the school is suitable for Wikipedia is discussable (my view is elsewhere in this discussion). I was referring to the "all human knowledge" part - Wikipedia is not for "all human knowledge" as much human knowledge is useless to just about everyone else - e.g. you do not need to know what colour my coffee mug is. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 15:28, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If this is to be kept, then frankly it's as big as it should get (unless it has or produces famous alumni in the future), anything else would be pointless padding. Personally, I'd prefer it if this were the start of a larger Education in Stevenage article (this appears to be the only school name linked to in the main <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevenage.html" title="Stevenage">Stevenage</a> article), since an overview of the schools in the area is more useful than large numbers of small separate articles. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 19:32, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I appreciate that you don't consider notability a valid criterion, but it is necessary to acknowledge that a multitude of other Wikipedians do, to the extent that it can be considered a community practice. Leading on from that, notability is necessarily linked to the <i>readers of the encyclopedia</i>; otherwise, a five-year-old's favourite toy automatically becomes a high-priority topic, to Wikipedia's external embarrasment, and negligible advantage. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 08:36, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some feel that "notability", a slippery concept with no clear definition, should be the standard for inclusion, but I don't see why it is <i>necessary</i> to acknowledge them. They're pretty good at putting that across for themselves. The widespread use of it as a term does not, however, make it an item of policy -- nor is it likely to become one, <i>because</i> it would be very difficult to define. One person's "notable" is the next person's "not notable", as we discover here every day. I don't understand what you are talking about when you discuss the "readers of the encyclopaedia. Our policy page very wisely points out that an encyclopaedia ought to include under each title what a reader <i>would expect</i> to find there. It is also careful to exclude items of only personal note, so a five-year-old's actual toy is excluded (although the type of toy is, rightly, included). I don't see what "external embarrassment" has to do with it. I'd be embarrassed by a Wikipedia that did not believe schools were worthy of inclusion in "all human knowledge".<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 03:16, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"All human knowledge" isn't what we're arguing, as that is clearly not what Wikipedia is for. It is for the relevant, important and notable bits of human knowledge. The argument is whether a primary school is sufficiently worthy on it's own. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 15:28, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing." -- Jimbo Wales. Tell Jimbo that's not what we're doing. It's certainly what <i>I</i> am doing. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 07:51, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, it's certainly NOT what I am doing, as I don't want to bore everyone on the planet to tears with useless drivel. Come on, are you seriously saying that if someone put on a calendar of what colour underwear they were wearing each day you'd consider that a valid addition? <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 13:33, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Methinks you two are talking at cross purposes here. The article in question here is a far cry from narcissistic drivel. On the other hand, it would be easy to construe the "sum of all human knowledge" in a way that is inappropriate to the WP. I've considered that quote as part of my basic understanding of what WP is, too. But I think of the "sum of all knowledge" as different from "all knowledge." Essentially, it's what knowledge boils down to; it's the knowledge you can't get rid of without losing something important. And this article is an example of such knowledge; it's important to understanding the community of Stevenage, and the discourse community constituted by Stevenage people. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 15:25, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> All schools are notable. Britannica doesn't have the space or editorial resources to cover them all, but Wikipedia has one and will acquire the other.

<li><b>Delete</b>. For goodness sake, surely we can hold the line at <b>primary</b> schools. Why do people think a school (i.e. building where teachers work) is inherently notable? What's next, preschools?

<li>So are libraries, factories, refineries, warehouses, harbours, airports, subway and train stations, office buildings, laboratories, shops, military installations, town halls, museums, parks, parks and stadiums, hospitals, clinics, churches, theaters, prisons, and many other places where people gather every day often for hours at a time often in large numbers. Some of these merit Wikipedia articles, based on notability, and some do not. What makes schools "inherently" notable, according to you, while these other facilities have to pass a notability test? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:27, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Schools should be handled in context of their community, not necessarily as separate articles. And Mr Zen can always form his own kindergartenpedia - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 10:19, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Harbours, airports, subway and train stations often merit their own articles; many already have them. I should think that any notable public institution of which a substantial community has encyclopedic knowledge should eventually be covered on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Merge &amp; redirect (or delete)</b> as ShaneKing suggests; it shouldn't have its own article. I agree with BM's second comment. I think schools should have to meet some set of notability requirements, just as fire stations, businesses, or any other type of organization must establish notability. Their specific notability requirements don't have to be the same as those for businesses, but "because it's there" isn't enough. That's enough for cities, but that precident shouldn't necesarily extend to a more granular level. Some might argue that since every school will likely host many thousands of kids during its lifetime, it gains notability by sheer numbers (more than 100 people have heard of it). But any single supermarket will host many thousands of shoppers over time (most of which shop there many times a week for years on end), yet we're not rushing to give each individual supermarket location its own article. - <a href="../../../e/i/s/User%7EEisnel_29f7.html" title="User:Eisnel">Eisnel</a> 23:39, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The simple fact that a school is small is no reason to exclude it from an encyclopaedia whose length is not limited. I see absolutely no reason to entirely remove such an article, especially when there are a plethora of articles covering sci-fi tv show characters and their "races"' temperments. Ask yourself if you would delete this article if it were long, in depth and well-researched -- I think not. Many great articles begin as stubs.<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik">Zantastik</a> 09:10, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Some additional content and references have been added. I would say it's now a fairly decent stub. I don't suppose that will change the mind of anyone who remains attached to the nebulous notion of notability ... but I mention it nonetheless. ... For this topic, as for so many others where extensive information is not available online, a properly encyclopedic article requires someone with genuine local knowledge. I suspect that there are many folk in Shephall who could contribute just such an article, detailing the role of the institution in local life and politics, and I don't see any reason to assume <i>a priori</i> that none of them will ever join the Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 08:48, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete, not notable. Second choice merge/redir to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevenage.html" title="Stevenage">Stevenage</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 19:59, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> What is "relevant"? What is relevant to some is irrelevant to others. If all "irrelevant" but true information were removed from Wikipedia, there would be one tenth the number of articles. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_pmk_ab75.html" title="User:Andrew pmk">Andrew pmk</a> 23:34, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
