<p>Carl Harrison High School is a school in the Cobb County School System. Located in Northwest Cobb County in Kennesaw, the school has a fine reputation as being an outstanding high school in an outstanding system. It is named for deceased Georgia State Senator Carl Harrison.</p>
<p><b>Administration</b> Donnie Griggers, the current principal, is a well-liked man whose tenure at Harrison has been a largely positive experience. Griggers is supported by the technical wizard known as John Stafford whose work in "Admin 3" is legendary. Stafford is responsible for all technology and network-related issues in the school as well as event planning and parking assignment. He is able to handle these tasks with the assistance of several special student assistants affectionately called "Staffordites" of "Stafford Boys."</p>
<p><b>Student Activities</b> Harrison has several extra curricular activites including chapters of Beta Club, Key Club, and National Honors Society.</p>
<p>A well-rounded journalism department includes an introductory course in basic journalism, Newspaper, and Yearbook. The newspaper, known as <i>The Tradition</i>, is well-liked by students and recognized as being both topical and and accessible. Its most popular section is "What Rocks." Originally called "The Tradition Recommends," this section displays the off-beat and light-hearted attitude that has become a staple of the paper. <i>The Legacy</i> is the school's award-winning yearbook. Staffed mainly by dedicated young women, the yearbook continually impresses students with its excellent photographic as well as literary work. Interesting themes and a polished look and finish verify the dedication of its staff.</p>
<p>The Fine Arts Department includes choral, drama, orchestral, and band programs. The Chorus is a well-known ensemble at the state level and continually has participants in All-State Chorus. The Drama Department continually amazes students as well as the community with its spectacular plays, one-acts, and muscals. The Band program was once one of the premiere high school concert groups in the country while under the direction of Dr. Scott Weiss who is know a professor at Indiana University. Recognizing the loss of his directorial talent, the program now is more dedicated to the marching band which competes nationally and has one some low-level Bands of America competitions.</p>
<p><b>Sports</b> Harrison has always enjoyed a truly respectable position in the sports community. The football team, headed by Bruce Cobbleigh, is a tough competitor on the county level that has produced many Division I college players like Paul Oliver at The University of Georgia as well as Tyler Evans at Georgia Tech. Also notable is the baseball program which has produced four major league players. The mens and womens soccer and lacrosse teams are also oustanding as they often reach the state level. The tennis team, fueled by the country-clubbing lifestyle of the area, is highly competitive.</p>

<p>hyperthesis n. hyperthetical [On analogy with hypothesis. "Hypothesis" is derived from hypo- "under" + thesis "a placing, proposition". The hyper- ("over") prefix denotes certainty of knowledge. It denotes that the thesis has already been subject to scrutiny and is widely accepted. Note: This word is a reaction to creationists who use a misleading stipulative definition to win arguments about Darwin's theory of evolution. Rather than being "just a theory" instead of "a fact", hyperthesis denotes that Darwin's theory qualifies as a good argument by means of conductive reasoning.] A thesis or proposition which has been tested and, consequently, widely accepted.</p>

Herbert Marvin Ohlman (1927 - 2002) is listed on the Information Science Pioneers of North America website as the inventor of permutation indexing or Permuterm. This idea was presented in 1958 at the International Conference on Scientific Information (ICSI). Permutation indexing is more or less the same as KWIC indexing (H.P. Luhn), but Ohlman's work was equally as important, albeit with a less catchy name than KWIC.</p>

Jordan Schlanger Designer [edit] Jordan Schlanger was born in New York into a family of artists, designers, musicians, naturalists and inventors. Surrounded by a fertile environment of creativity, Jordan started making jewelry for family members by the age of four. Throughout his early years, Jordan was recognized as a prodigious creative talent. His devotion to the interrelated fields of music, sculpture and design was manifested at every level of education, forming a unique background for the fine jewelry collections he produces from his New York City studio. In the years before art school, Jordan pursued his passion for design and continued an intensive study of jewelry and art, ultimately enrolling in New York's Cooper Union School of Art to obtain a degree in sculpture.</p>
<p>While producing sculpture installations at Cooper Union, Jordan simultaneously developed a collection of furniture, a collection of porcelain dinnerware, and an ambitious collection of wearable works of art, which reflected his inspired, sculptural themes and an innovative approach to the materials and mechanics of jewelry design. It was this collection that was presented at the premier gallery for jewelry, Artwear, in 1990, inspiring a comprehensive response from the fashion press and relationships with the most prestigious retailers worldwide.</p>
<p>Jordan Schlanger is now a member of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and of the International Jewelry Design Guild. His work appears regularly in magazines such as Vogue and In Style. He has been personally photographed and interviewed for Vogue magazine and Women's Wear Daily, and has appeared live on CNN. His jewelry is collected by celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Tina Turner, Courtney Love, Joan Collins, Uma Thurman, Halle Berry, Susan Lucci, Jane Pauley, Katie Couric, Judy Bloom, Carol Burnett, Stephen Tyler, Mia Farrow, Mike Myers and others. His work is worn by prominent news anchors and appears in films and television productions, most recently 'Sex and the City'. Jordan has collaborated with fashion designers Donna Karan, Mark Eisen and Han Feng.</p>
<p>Jordan Schlanger's fine jewelry collections focus on the classic. Powerfully inspired by nature, Jordan draws from his years of sculpture and design to create exquisitely crafted fine jewelry that is meticulously engineered. Whether organic and gestural, bold and sleek, or subtle and reductive, Jordan's unique approach to metal, materials and form has expanded the possibilities of jewelry design, allowing for a new aesthetic freedom and an entirely enhanced consideration of the needs and desires of the wearer. His quest for the highest quality, technical innovation and truly inspired, classic design seeks to imbue natural forms with the touch and gesture that is sensitive to the wearer's body, eye and spirit. Each piece reflects his philosophy that design is a form of communication and that jewelry is the most permanent, personal and tactile form of design.</p>

<p>Famous naqshabandi shaikh of Sindh valley Hadhrat Allah Bakhsh Mujaddidi was much worried for character of muslims and their awarness with Islam. In the result of his great thinking, struggle and councling with learned scholars of Islam "Jama'at Islah-ul-Muslimeen" came in the form of orgnization.</p>
<p>Jama'at Islah-ul-Muslimeen is an international religious and reformative Muslim organization, connected to the Naqshbandi Sufi order. It preaches Muslim brotherhood and help its members to practise Islam in its true spirit through love and respect. Its main characteristics is to adopt Islamic way of life by establishing religious institutions, reformative centers and arranging gatherings for zikrullah (remembrance of Allah the almighty). Every individual member of Jama'at Islah-ul-Muslimeen begins with himself, his family members, his neighbors and this process to live and preach Islamic ways of life.</p>
<p>After the death of shaikh, on the advice of a responsible committee of scholars, his son Hazrat Muhammad Tahir Abbasi Naqshbandi accepted the responsibility to lead this great mission. Now after the struggle of two decades many islamic schools are affiliated with jama'at and producing true muslims.</p>
<p>Jama'at is actively involved in preaching and building the character of common muslims. Thousands of people have benefited and now passing their lives according to islamic virtues. Their lives are now samples of sunnah of The Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p>

So Matthew Dec and Gregory Mooneyhan took SJC by storm this school year starting the season 33-3 and gaining the title of Beer Pong Champions of the school. They currently hold the ONLY title belt in the school's history for the "noble" sport as it is called around this cornfield. They play in campus-wide staged matches in which they perform daring feats of amazement and post unbelievable shots of glory. They will be the very first elected into the Schools newly created Beer Pong Hall of Fame and will forever be known the the town of Rensselaer as without a doubt the GREATEST to ever play the fabled game of beer pong in these humble residence halls at SJC. .</p>

<p>Fortis Healthcare, India was established in 1996 by the promoters of Ranbaxy Laboratories, among the world's top 10 generic companies, also India's largest pharma company. Founded by the late Dr. Parvinder Singh, the architect of Ranbaxy's growth, Fortis Healthcare, India is driven by the founder's vision of "creating a world-class integrated healthcare delivery system in India, entailing the finest medical skills combined with compassionate patient care".</p>
<p>From the pursuit of this mission emanates a passion to excel. Fortis has assembled the finest talents in medicine, be they doctors, nurses or technicians, and even management professionals across a wide spectrum. Enabling them to deliver the highest quality of healthcare are state-of-the art facilities and support infrastructure at each of our hospitals.</p>
<p>Fortis Healthcare India hospitals are benchmarked to International standards - achieving quality through the relentless adherence to the protocols observed in some of the world's leading hospitals.</p>
<p>The hallmark of Fortis hospitals, distinguishing them from their contemporaries, is the 'patient-centricity' that you will discern all over: in hospital design, services, programmes and most significantly in the caring approach of our people.</p>
<p>The Fortis circle of caring is fast expanding, spreading the name of Fortis Healthcare, India... reaching out to distant communities, welcoming patients from beyond India's shores.</p>
<p>One of India's leading tertiary level healthcare groups, Fortis comprises a network of 12 hospitals with a bed capacity of 1803 beds and 12 Heart Command Centres. Following the acquisition of the renowned Escorts Healthcare System, Fortis operates one of the world's largest Cardiac programmes. The group's Fortis Hospital at Noida, next-door to Delhi, is India's foremost tertiary care facility in Orthopaedics and Neuro Sciences. The group also performs cutting edge surgeries in various specialities ranging from cosmetology, woman &amp; child health, ophthalmology, dental, ENT, urology, and minimal invasive surgery. It's facilities ensure that there is genuine Medical Value in health travel to India.</p>
<p>The Medical Value that Fortis brings to it's services is because the Fortis team of expert doctors, mostly western trained, is supported by highly skilled nursing professionals, technicians, and aided by state-of-the-art medical equipment at their command.</p>
<p>Fortis recognizes that international patients have special needs and requirements and desire real medical value when they travel to India. To provide a highly specialized and dedicated service, the Fortis International Patients Service Centre at New Delhi, India has been created. For a patient, this means a menu of seamless services that will make their treatment and trip hassle-free, i.e. from greeting you at the airport, to their registration &amp; discharge, and even organizing the ground handling of any post-treatment travel.</p>
<p>After all, taking care of guests is an ageless Indian tradition.</p>

<p>The portion of any gains realized by a (private equity) fund to which the fund managers (general partners) are entitled. Generally these managers receive a right to carried interest without having to contribute a significant amount of capital to the fund. The general partners share of the realized gains generated is typically 15 to 25%. Carried interest is designed to be the general partners main incentive for strong performance.</p>
<p>The term originated in the early days of Venture Capital, when general partners put up nothing in return for 20% of the profits; thus the limited partners "carried the interest" of the general partners.</p>

<p>Magic number 7 is a theory proposed by George Miller(1956),american psychologist which explains some limits of the capacity of immediate human memory. Miller makes diference between the meaninful unit called chunk and the amount of information called bit. To be more clear he suggests an example: meaningless line of letters such as RFGINE consist as many elements and there is letters, here six since they have to be remembered seperatly. On the other side we have meaningfull line with the same letters FINGER which is concidered as one element since we stock this word as one information. George Miller says we are able to stock 7 plus minus 2 elements at one time, as by one look, by immediate memory. That is also very easy to verify when we see up to , for example 9 books we are able to say how many are there without counting them,but if we look at the library we can't say the exact number without counting them.</p>

Ring Round the Moon, or "An Invitation to a Castle" is a satirical play by French playwright Jean Anouilh. It concerns two rich twins, a cold playboy Orace, and his sensitive brother Fredric. Fredric is madly in love with Diane Messirshman, a spoiled daughter of a jewish self-made millionaire. Diane herself plays around with Fredric, but stubbornly desires Orace, mostly because Orace, as he himself admits "cannot love anyone". Orace, seemingly to save his brother from Dians, invites to a ball a lower-class dancer Isabella, dresses her in high-society dress, and tells the local aristocrauts she is the niece of a local noble Romenville. There are several plot twists, the play deals with class difference and the meaning of money in our society.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-04_c123.html" title="Edit section: Sergio Galoyan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sergio Galoyan</span></h2>
<p>Sergio Galoyan, record producer, artist and recording engineer is best known for his work with Tatu but has recently been working with Keith Flint from the Prodigy and Marilyn Manson. Born in Moscow on Christmas day 1981, Sergio Galoyan grew up surrounded by music. His father was a lead guitarist in a band that specialized on Western Rock &amp; Pop classics. While being influenced by the music his father was playing, including songs by legendary bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Queen and the Beatles, Sergio was also exposed to classical music. However, it was when a friend gave him the Metallica album ââ¦And Justice For Allâ that his life started changing.14 year old Sergio was inspired: he started taking guitar lessons from a Jazz guitarist Dmitry Maloletov, a legend of its kind in Russia, known for creating â2-hand tappingâ (a revolutionary way of playing electric and acoustic guitars). Dmitry still regards Sergey to be one of his most talented students. After 2 years of studying the guitar Sergio discovered DJ-ing, and was offered an opportunity to spin records at a local club. The experience introduced him to the House &amp; Dance music from the mid nineties including hits by the likes of Daft Punk, Underworld, Prodigy, Faithless, Mouse T, Basement Jaxx, Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim. Soon Sergio set up his own band called The Noise, where he became the lead guitarist. While The Noise was enjoying exposure on Moscowâs club scene, Sergio realized he was missing House and Dance rhythms and began working at home, producing his own Dance tracks using simple equipment and limited resources. Some of these early tracks were picked up by a cult Moscow dance station Station 2000. By the end of 1999 Sergio wrote and produced about 3 albums worth of material that frequently got airplay on Station 2000. His tracks became a bit of a phenomena in Moscow and soon caught the attention of the people at the studios of the renowned Russian producer Vladimir Osinsky, who immediately put him in contact with manager Ivan Shapovalov, a manager working with an unknown at the time girl duo Tatu. Convinced about the songs Sergio demonstrated, Ivan Shapovalov asked him to write and produce for the girlsâ first single âYa Soshla S Umaâ which became a massive #1 hit in Russia September 2000. Sergio is also responsible for writing and producing the 2nd single, âNas Ne Dogonyatâ, the 3rd âPol Chasaâ and two more tracks, âPokaji Mne Lubovâ and âMalchik Gayâ. Al of the songs written and produced by Sergio were featured on the highly successful album â200 Po Vstrechnoyâ released by Universal Music Russia, selling several million copies in the Russian Federation alone. Following huge success in Russia, the album was licensed by Universal Music to Interscope Records in the US. The prolific producer Trevor Horn was commissioned to do the English translations resulting in the songs written and produced by Sergio, such as âAll The Things She Saidâ, âNot Gonna Get Usâ, âShow Me Loveâ, â30 Minutesâ and âMalchik Gayâ being included on the international release "200 KM/H In The Wrong Lane". The album subsequently became the biggest selling debut release by a Russian Pop act in the history of music selling more then 4.000.000 copies worldwide (not including Russia). Come 2004, Sergio is truly part of global music history. Besides being responsible for unique, immediately recognizable musical style of t.A.T.u., he has already been working with other internationally renowned and highly respected artists like Keith Flint (Prodigy), Marilyn Manson, Jennifer Lopez, new UK girl group CLEA and Russian superstar Alsou. His remixing skills haven't gone unnoticed either and in 2005 Sergio has written and Produced 6 tracks on the new t.A.T.u. album â âDangerous and Movingâ.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-04_c123.html" title="Edit section: JOY">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">JOY</span></h2>
<p>Joy! There were (are) at least FOUR bands in this world named "Joy". This pages references the Austrian disco band which made big hits in mid-80ies like "Valerie", "Hello", "Japanese Girls", "Touch By Touch"...</p>
<p>The band Joy was formed in a small Austrian town of Bad Aussee with the population of 7500 citizens. Freddy Jaklitsch (born on 22.01.60), Manfred Temmel (25.02.59) and Andy Schweitzer were schoolfriends, but after the graduation all three chose different careers. Freddy became German teacher in school, Manfred - a DJ, and Andy was serving in police. Somehow they met again in 1984 and founded a band "Joy". Their first single "Lost In Hong Kong" came to the light in February 1985. It wasn't a big hit, but the new band deserved mentioning in press. And that wasn't in vain - their next single "Touch By Touch" (September 1985) immediately reached European Top 20 Dance Charts. This song already had all the features which became visitcard of the band. The first album of the band entitled "Hello" spent five weeks on the first position in several charts. That brought world-wide popularity to the band with their albums sold in more than 30 countries. In the summer of 1986 Joy returned to their studio to record the second album "Joy And Tears". The most successfull song on this album is "Japanese Girls". Probably because of this song Joy obtained big popularity in Asia. Their concert tour of 1987 collected 60 thousand spectators in total. In Seoul they were performing before 20000 stadium Jam Silna. After that concert Joy has become the all-times favourite band in South Korea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile concert activity was accompanied by releasing the compilation of best songs from first two albums. It has also appeared under the label OK-Musica. During the next year Joy gave a series of concerts in America and upon return to Europe performed in Germany, Portugal and Italy.</p>
<p>Shortly after that (in 1989) keyboardist and co-producer of majority Joy songs Andy Schweitzer left the band to start the solo career. However he was given a permission to use the original name "Joy" for recording the whole album on his own. This album was released by different companies under the different titles - either "She's Dancing Alone" or "Joy - 3rd". Its style differs sufficiently from original albums - the music is definitely more peaceful, less grooving and driving-on.</p>
<p>During the following years of rap and techno boom in Europe Joy didn't found its place on the stage. However, with the return to life of melodic songs "Best of Joy " was re-released in 1992. In 1994 two members of the original Joy (Freddy and Manfred) published on BMG a new single called "Hello, Mrs. Johnson". After that, having invited a new keyboardist, they release one more single in 1995 - Felicidad. This time the song is devoted not to Chinese or Japanese girls, but a mysterious Spaniard. The name of new member of the band is Johannes Groebl (born 30.01.60). Though being not as tall as the rest of the band, Johannes is no less outstanding personality. His hobbies include buddism, and according to unofficial sources of information he has extraordinary healing abilities.</p>
<p>In 1996 the whole album "Full of Joy" was recorded at BMG. It includes 12 songs. Unfortunately for unknown reasons the CDs were never printed, and the contract with BMG has recently expired. Looks like nobody currently owns the copyright to these songs.</p>

<p>The Mosquitos were one of the most talented bands of the mid '80s, hailing from the north shore of Long Island, New York. They were heavily influenced by '60s pop, especially Merseybeat / British Invasion, and they combined fantastic harmonies with fine songwriting and musicianship. The band featured Vance Brescia (lead vocals, guitar), Tony Millions (keyboard, vocals), Steve Prisco (lead guitar, vocals), and Iain Morrison (bass, vocals). After original drummer Pat Bishow left the band, Mitch Towse joined The Mosquitos.</p>
<p>Their only vinyl release was "That Was Then, This Is Now," a 5-song, 12 inch EP (Valhalla, 1985). The title track was covered in the summer of 1986 by The <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monkees.html" title="Monkees">Monkees</a> as their 20th anniversary single, reaching # 20 on the Billboard singles chart. The Mosquitos' "Darn Well" was selected by Jeff Tamarkin as the leadoff track to "Garage Sale" (ROIR, 1985), a fine cassette-only compilation of '80s garage sounds. One of the EP tracks, "Do You Want To Hurt Me," appears on the Spanish power pop compilation CD "The Bam Balam Explosion, Vol. III" (Bam Balam Records, 1996).</p>
<p>The only official live release is a cover of "Let's Stomp!" on the "Cavestomp! Vol. 1" CD (Cavestomp! Records, 2000). This was recorded in 1997 at the first of the annual Cave Stomp shows in New York City, and featured only lead singer Vance Brescia from The Mosquitos, who performed under the band's name with pals Tony Formosa (bass) and Pete Bross (drums).</p>
<p>While their official releases don't come close to showing how great they were, many of us have wonderful memories of the band... And there are, of course, live tapes and demos out there to testify to their brilliance.</p>
