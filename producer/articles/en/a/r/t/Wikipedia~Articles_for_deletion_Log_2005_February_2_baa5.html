The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 9 votes to delete and 5 to keep. This is a clear majority but not the overwhelming majority generally required to establish evidence of concensus. In reviewing the article, I found that the link to the professor's home page) is not working, undermining the ability of readers to verify elements of the article. In reviewing the arguments presented below, I note that the "keep" votes for the most part simply stated "published author". From available evidence, policy statements and an extensive study of our precedents, I do not believe that the general community concensus supports such a low standard for inclusion in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>After a great deal of consideration, I am going to exercise my discretion and delete the article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:46, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

Cal State at San Luis Obispo isn't bad, but it isn't prestigious either. His one book, published by the Univ of Virginia Press, has an Amazon sales rank of about 550,000, meaning very low sales. Howard Zinn's quote was probably just a courtesy blurb, as they were together at Boston University for a while. As another Wikipedian said elsewhere, there is something unseemly about a bunch of nobodies ruling on the notability of anyone.

<li>I don't personally find it interesting. However, we have articles turned into redirects for (reasonable) spelling mistakes and for miscapitalizations, and the usual argument is "Well, someone obviously <i>actually made</i> this mistake.". It seems likely that someone might think that there would be an article under <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope%27s_hat.html" title="Pope's hat">Pope's hat</a>. However, I'm less convinced that someone would expect an article to be entitled <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_hat.html" title="Pope hat">Pope hat</a>. History doesn't show this as being a duplicate article that someone turned into a disambiguation page. This started off as a disambiguation page, and so the "somebody actually made this mistake" argument isn't supported. <b>Move</b> to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope%27s_hat.html" title="Pope's hat">Pope's hat</a> then <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The only reason that categories are inadequate is if the aim is to have high schools listed that are insufficiently notable to have articles in the Wikipedia. There are numerous problems with such lists:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>There are aproximately 17,000 high schools in the United States. How are all these high schools going to be entered on the lists?</li>
<li>Some large states have between 500 and 1000 high schools; the state-level lists for these states will be extremely unwieldy.</li>
<li>Who is going to verify that additions to the lists are correct and accurate? Are you volunteering? There will be numerous omissions and inaccuracies, misspellings, and format differences from one state-level list to another. There are only a handful of states now, and the state-level lists are already inconsistent with one another. A major problem will be non-existent "fantasy" high schools added by people, named after themselves, high schools from novels, etc. It will be a very tall order for editors to keep these lists clean.</li>
<li>Don't forget that someone is also going to need to <b>delete</b> high schools that have closed. High schools close all the time. (Mine did, not long after I graduated from it.) Who are the editors who are going to remove high schools as they close?</li>
<li>What is the point? So that every American high school can have its name in lights in the Wikipedia? Being on a list of 17000 high schools isn't exactly "name in lights", anyway. What reasonable reader goal do these lists serve? Who is interested in a list of the names of high schools and the towns where they are located, and why?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>In short, the lists will inevitably be more low-quality crap in the Wikipedia. This is not the sort of thing that can be done well by a wiki. It is for all these reasons that Wikipedia is not a general information base, and in particular is not the Directory of American High Schools. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:58, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'd rather have all the info collected on group pages like this, in a table like I've created (since it's 80k and overwidth, I obviously need to do some cleanup, but I don't want to work any more on it if it might get deleted) using <i>annually updated</i> public domain US govt data, that's easily downloaded in an easily convertible CSV file, and which is as likely to be accurate as anything else on Wikipedia. Or the better one I created at <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhode_Island_schools_face.html" title="Rhode Island schools">Rhode Island schools</a>. <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Gatos-Saratoga_Joint_Union_High_School_District_b6c7.html" title="Los Gatos-Saratoga Joint Union High School District">Los Gatos-Saratoga Joint Union High School District</a> is a good example about how alumni info, etc. can be incorporated into the tables. I've created around a dozen of these tables (you can see most of them at <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose%2C_California_e18c.html#Primary_and_secondary_education" title="San Jose, California">San_Jose,_California#Primary_and_secondary_education</a>), and I'm still experimenting a bit with the exact presentation, but for the most part they're a fairly standard fmt. I was going to say my alternative vote would be to <b>redir to the Cat</b>, so people can get to the info (casual visitors are NOT going to know to look for <a href="../../../h/i/g/Category%7EHigh_schools_in_Connecticut_2df6.html" title="Category:High schools in Connecticut">Category:High schools in Connecticut</a>), but, hey, look. It doesn't exist, even tho' we have at least five articles on high schools in Connecticut. Also, no one seems to be complaining about things like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Friends_Schools_0c3b.html" title="List of Friends Schools">List of Friends Schools</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ottawa%2C_Ontario_schools_5a31.html" title="List of Ottawa, Ontario schools">List of Ottawa, Ontario schools</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 05:10, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>hey, look. It doesn't exist</i> Then click on that little red link, and hey, your problems are over.

<li>Well, it's easy after you've done a few, and if you know exactly what info you're looking for. The tables I've created have taken a bit less than a dozen clicks for the simple ones, way more than a dozen clicks for the more detailed ones.</li>
<li>'Far too long if complete' seems like a spurious argument--like <i>any</i> article that gets too long, it can be subdivided, in this case either by county or school district (in the case of California, probably both). <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 20:13, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unwieldly and far better acheived with categories. Also, there seems to be a contradiction here.

<li>Because the high school inclusionists are dissatisfied with the fact that occasionally they "lose" a VfD vote, even though they "win" in the majority of cases.

<li>Individual schools are not inherently notable, and once the <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">academic boosterism</a> and outright padding is winnowed away, most articles about them say little more than "{{placename}} School is a school in {{subst:placename}} managed by {{subst:headteacher}} with {{subst:number}} pupils". Alas! It is, unfortunately, exactly that sort of article that lists of redlinks encourage. Overwikified lists are perennial sources of articles on non-notable subjects, as people "helpfully" recolour the redlinks with non-articles padded with chaff. This despite the admonition that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a repository of links</a> (neither external <i>nor internal</i>).<br />
However, <i>these</i> articles do not redlink the individual schools, avoiding that trap. (And, of course, there is nothing to stop a <i>blue</i>link being made <i>after</i> a rare <i>notable</i> school has had an article of its own created.) Moreover, articles in this form can collect all of the individual "{{placename}} School is a school in {{subst:placename}} managed by {{subst:headteacher}} with {{subst:number}} pupils" non-articles into tabular form, adding enough information <i>by dint of being an organized collection</i>, where summary and overview information can be added as footnotes, to raise the article level with the notability bar. They are also far more maintainable than 17000 such individual articles would be.<br />
The remaining arguments against such articles are arguments against having the data at all, either in single-list-article form or in 17000-individual-articles form: <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. These are the arguments that winnow the all-too-often-added padding (telephone numbers, teacher lists, forthcoming school plays and sports competitions, and so forth) from the school articles yielding the bare single-sentence descriptions, of course. However, as long as these "list of" articles meet <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_98bd.html" title="Wikipedia:List">the purpose of lists</a> by providing <i>more</i> information than the raw data do alone, by dint of collating and summarizing those data and providing general information; and since these "list of" articles are <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">appropriate topics for lists</a>, I vote <b>Move</b> to the correct List of high schools in X form, <b>Keep</b> with the cautions that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a repository of links</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>, and <b>send to Cleanup</b> for all but one of the articles which do not meet the standard of ("List of") <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_schools_in_Connecticut_6c1b.html" title="High schools in Connecticut">High schools in Connecticut</a> and simply do not contain enough data to meet <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_98bd.html" title="Wikipedia:List">the purpose of lists</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:39, 2005 Feb 7 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. At a first read this article looks like a possible hoax or nonsense, however it is generating a number of hits on Google (10,000+), so it does pass the Google test.

<li><b>Sigh</b>. Lee Carroll has written a bunch of books which are available on Amazon and he and Kryon seem to pass the Google test. By Wikipedia standards, we have to keep this -- meaning that we will now have another embarrassment on the Wikipedia. There will be two groups of editors hurling "POV warrior" insults at each other. The first group will be trying to have the article say, effectively, "Lee Carroll is either a New Age kook or a con-man trying to bilk you out of your money". This will be the truth. The other group will be fighting to have the article say "Kryon is an disembodied entity whose pearls of wisdom for humanity are channelled by Lee Carroll who has kindly published 26 books about Kryon." There will be RfC's, mediations, arbitrations, cooling off periods with the article blocked, and lots of pastel-colored template boxes permanently on the article. It will end up saying "Lee Carroll is either a kook, or he is a con-man, or he is channelling a disembodied entity of a higher order, named Kryon". --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:26, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, it has a distributor and is for sale on amazon anyway (sales rank among DVDs: 51,462), so it's <i>slightly</i> above a movie some guy made with his friends. The $2000 budget makes me think the actors were hardly paid. This <i>could</i> be a very weak keep, but the article says nothing.

As late as some 100 years ago, many Chinese people did believe that China (<b>中</b>國, literally "middle kingdom") was the center (<b>中</b>) of the world. The invasion of European powers shattered the dream. Many Chinese abandoned the ethnocentrism and turned to be self-hatred or become white men's ass-kissers. This history indicated Chinese ethnocentrism was real. Therefore, it deserves a responsible and well-researched article. To me, this is not something to be ashamed of. If this article is finally kept, I'll remove all current material and do a better version of it. I don't care about the arguments over ther with "Jewish ethnocentrism". Censorship is not my thing. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 12:35, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Toytoy makes a valid argument, and it was one I was going to make on the "Jewish ethnocentrism" argument: There is a valid and well-documented part of Chinese civilization that is directly tied to the idea that China is the intellectual and cultural center of the world (which at one time was probably true, but that notwithstanding...) That said, my vote for this article is still "Delete", because this article is devoid of unique content. Toytoy's point should be considered, and I think such an article would be quite informative. Unlike Jewish ethnocentrism, which is an external (to Judaism) construct invented and used by anti-Semites to ridicule and delegitimize Jews, "Sinocentrism" is a native Chinese concept, indeed one that has played (and continues to play) a very important rôle in Chinese culture. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">TShilo12</a> 00:57, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I see a lot of knee-jerk reactions on this page by individuals that obviously are not considering merits and just voting on preconceived notions. Deleting this page has nothing to do with inclusion versus deletion. One can vote to delete this page and still safely vote to include every school in the country without fear of being called a hypocrite. Back in the dark ages of wikipedia, it was necessary to maintain lists because this was the best way to group similar information. Now, we have the category, which does a much better job. I am against including every school, but if schools are all to be kept, I would not object to categorizing them in a variety of ways, but categories are the answer, not unweildly and unmaintainable lists. I feel that some people are voting here because they see the word "school" in the header and stop their rational analysis at that point. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:02, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The debate rages on. For what it is worth, I tried this with the List of Manitoba School Divisions by first listing each of the school boards, then an alphabetical list of schools in each division. Two words: 1)In, 2)Sane. I hit the 32k wall early. Categories are the way to go with this I think. I created the category incorporating the original division list (which is complete and accurate) and have been removing them from the list as articles are created. A project like every school in the states being listed is just crazy IMO. Creating categories on boards/districts/divisions or whatever term they use in the states seems like a better way to go. Placing each of the 17,000 public schools in one list makes it exceedingly difficult to find any or even a group of them. Categories just make more sense as a way to tackle this, I think. <a href="../../../w/e/a/User%7EWeaponofmassinstruction_5523.html" title="User:Weaponofmassinstruction">Weaponofmassinstruction</a> 05:44, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't know why some people are arguing about deleting lists of schools. <i>This</i> article is a list of <i>lists</i>. Such a thing is plainly better done with the category mechanism, irrespective of how schools are handled. The advantage that lists have over categories is that lists can contain redlinks.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The problem with using a form vote is that you tend to look silly when you use it in a strange place. This is not a vote for deletion for a school, but for a list that would be unwieldly if ever completed. Deleting this list in no way implies that schools are not encyclopedic so your objection seems odd. This is a debate over how to organize information on wikipedia and not a debate on whether schools are encyclopedic. It makes me wonder if you are really paying attention or just slapping this form explanation on whenever you see the word "school" on vfd. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:14, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Another article with a weird POV title created by a Shi'a apologist apparently to post anti-Sunni Shi'a polemics <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 19:42, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - OneGuy is on a rampage deleting everything i do and write.</p>
<p>The Topic is important, it reflects one major muslims, Alis, feelings toward a important event. It is to long to fitt in a biograpy and since its a "hot" topic, it needs ample referense to prove its validity, something i have included. If OneGuy's problem is that he thinks its not NPOV, then he should address it, preferably with proof, not voting for deletion only because it dosent suite his image of what Ali felt and did. In short: Ali DID opposed Abu Bakr, as is evident in authentic Sunni sources i quoted and its important for understanding the difrent event that emerged from that moment. If OneGuy has a problem with the title, i would have no problem renaming it to "What Ali sought of the first Kalif" or somthing similar.</p>
<p>I challenge OneGuy to bring ONE hadith that shows that Ali supported Abu Bakrs nomination for Khilafa. (unsigned comment by <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a>)</p>

<dd>The title of the article is not neutral "Ali opposed Abu Bakrs Kalifat." You moved your Shi'a POV even to the title. The title must be neutral <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 03:00, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>X opposes Y</i> isn't necessarily non-NPOV. Someone could easily write a neutral and factual article about, <i>e.g.</i>, the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control. It's an historical fact that opposition over who would lead the Islamic Caliphate lead to the Shia–Sunni split, isn't it? <a href="../../../j/27/r/User%7EJ%27raxis_bbb0.html" title="User:J'raxis"><b>J’raxis</b></a> 06:27, 2005 Feb 3 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If Sunnis dispute that Ali opposed Abu Bakr, then of course the title is POV. As far as I know, Sunnis accept that Ali did initially oppose Abu Bakr for a short period but then accepted him as a Caliph after that. To make an article out of that is clearly nonsensical. And what's with quoting all these hadith on this minor point? The fact that Ali initially opposed but then accepted Abu Bakr can be written in one line into Abu Bakr's article without cutting and pasting all these hadith.
