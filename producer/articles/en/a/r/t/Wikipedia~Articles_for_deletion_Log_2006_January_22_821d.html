<p>An article on this topic was originally created at Remixography of Mariah Carey, and was subsequently deleted (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Remixography_of_Mariah_Carey_01ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Remixography of Mariah Carey">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Remixography of Mariah Carey</a>). The content of this new article is different enough from the earlier article that it does not qualify for speedy deletion, but the reasons for why it was deleted still stand. All of the articles on Carey's singles contain information about their most notable remixes and alternative versions. This article, however, fails to establish the notability of any of these remixes or if they were officially commissioned by Carey's record label. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 00:01, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There appears to be a debate at the <i>Lost</i> television series forums and blogs (where its current claim of notability is allegedly asserted) whether or not this band ever existed. Nearly <i>all</i> online sources appear to agree that it actually never did, and that in fact the production mistook a certain band named Geronimo Black for some reason. Thus there is no real reason to keep an article that seems to assume otherwise. - <i><b><a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhaedriel_2584.html" title="User:Phaedriel"><font style="color:#22AA00;">Phædriel</font></a></b></i> <font style="color:navy;">♥</font> <i><sup><a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhaedriel_a4cd.html" title="User talk:Phaedriel"><font style="color:#22AA00;">tell me</font></a></sup></i> - 01:08, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am saying that to delete this article would be a grave mistake, &amp; am emphasing just how fiercely I believe this. Part of my zeal for this article is out of surprise that no one else until this moment has spoken up in defense of it -- even an article that said it was a fictional band &amp; never existed outside of Lost would justify the article's existence. (However, this morning I discovered a web page about this group &amp; added it to the article, so I'd say that either it <i>did</i> exist or is a noteable hoax by the creators of Lost.) In short, had I a "save this article" chit as a long-time contributor to Wikipedia (or any credibility), I would spend it on this article. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 16:52, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>even an article that said it was a fictional band &amp; never existed outside of Lost would justify the article's existence</i> -- that's where you and most everyone else here disagrees. As for that link you added, there's no <i>there</i> there. As I noted on the article's talk page, domain registrant information suggests that this is just another hoax website set up by ABC or some enterprising fan.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There's no acceptable form for an article like this, with virtually no verifiable content and non-notability besides a less than 20s scene on <i>Lost</i>. What can it be reduced to? One unexpandable line. That's like saying we should have left the page <a href="../../../5/4/0/540.html" title="540">540</a> when its sole contents were (4+8+15+16+23+42)*5. It won't be difficult to recreate the article... notice the page <a href="../../../4/_/8/4_8_15_16_23_42.html" title="4 8 15 16 23 42">4 8 15 16 23 42</a> which was resurrected recently, and instead of being deleted this time, is headed to a redirect. I'm most certainly not opposed to having this page resurrected should the band one day prove pivotal. But, the situation with <i>Lost</i> cruft has gotten beyond reasonable limits, and I'm of the opinion that these types of pages are an embarrassment and discouragement to those who diligently work on the <i>Lost</i> articles. As editors, it is our responsibility to hold Wikipedia to a higher standard of quality in the information we present. We've just deleted the article on the "security system", for example, because of its hefty OR and unverifiability. Will there possibly be a page on the "security system" when the show is done? Sure thing. But just because the "security system" may one day have its own page does not mean that we have to have any old poor quality page that gets made now. There's just not enough on the "security system" to merit an encyclopedic article under Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The same applies to this "band": it may very well be that this is critical to the future of the show (which, note is speculation)... but what may one day be is not an excuse for retaining a substandard article that lowers the quality of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaryonyx_f960.html" title="User:Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a> 06:02, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This article isn't being advocated for deletion merely because its a fictional band. It is advocated for deletion as non-notable, unverifiable, originally researched cruft material, mentioned for a few seconds in a single episode. There's a rather obvious difference between being a factual, accurate article on a recurring fictional character and a made-up article of a very minor fictional reference, IMHO. As for DriveShaft, I don't think it should be an article, either, even if it is Charlie's band. However, it has more accurate content derived from the show itself, and a more central role to a main character, so the argument for that band's inclusion has stronger footing than this one's.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaryonyx_f960.html" title="User:Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a> 18:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>Rebuttle</b> 2sec films - are a ligitimate style of filming, and has and is growing in various areas of the Southern United States of America, such as LSU Baton Rouge, University of Birmingham and the University of Alabama. There is also a film festival located in Shreveport, Louisiana that supports and encourages the 2 second film style. [MovieSauce.org] (Which has recieved entries from the entire world, and other festivals such as Slamdance, which is held in Park City, Utah during the Sundance Film Festival.) Also, the term 2 second Movie is not ligitimate because there are no "movies" that are 2 second style - only shorts.</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> at least it's not a vanity article (quite the opposite in fact). <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Ruby</a> 03:01, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>.

If you doubt his notability, just do a Google search for "Robert S Mendelsohn" - over 10,000 results, nearly all of them about the person in question. Him being considered a "quack" does not make an article about him any less interesting or encyclopedic. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 04:34, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Multiple issues here about Mendelsohn's credibility, credentials, and whether he was responsible &amp; authoritative, but notable he is. His name gets 11,500 Google hits and he's the author of multiple published books.

<li><b>Keep</b>, per AdelaMay. The Dr. might or might not be bonkers, but is borderline notable just for publications and chair/president of this and that.

<li><b>Keep</b> Due to the fact that the google hits exceed 10,000, he has authored several books and has other various credentials; this decision should not even spark a contention. -- <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalluste_ff2c.html" title="User:Salluste">Salluste</a><small>|<a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">talk</a></small> 15:15, 22 January 2006 (UTC-5)</li>
<li>Comment: Looking at the first couple of pages of Google hits, he is mentioned quite a lot (perhaps because there are few MDs who provide similar quotes) but there isn't much substance to the actual mentions. Some of what there is is rather odd - a claim that <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspirin.html" title="Aspirin">Aspirin</a> alters blood clotting factors for instance - that would be Warfarin, Aspirin alters platelet adhesion - and reduces vitamin C on a "nutritional" site.</li>

<dd>I'm not American, and it is hard to judge what the National Health Federation is about. Is it more like the BMA than the National Front, to use an English example?</dd>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Not a Hoax. Contact the National Republican Congressional Committee and talk to Congressman Tom Davis's office and ask about Mr. Ronald A. Smith's Republican of the Year Award For Virginia for the Year 2001-2002. This was publicized by the NRCC with a press release in March of 2002. Mr. Chris Hill was the Republican of the year for Florida for 2002. I'm sorry but you apparently do not realize that they gave this award to one businessman from every state. Every item can be backed up in this listing or otherwise it would not have been put up. Also it has been listed on the internet at a separate site for several years with the exception of a few minor changes made to this update. Also this webpage was edited before and someone keeps changing it back to what it was before we had finished perfecting it. Please do not do that to our work again. If you take exeption to anything in it then please just contact us directly. We will be glad to back up whatever should be backed up with proof over any detail. \Wikistatman 09:03, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It is not right that you attack the credibility of Mr. Smith. We have removed the article and will be working on a version that includes whatever the reliable resources require as by way of info or formatting. Mr. Smith did not put this article up but it was put up by employees. There are numerous articles written in Newspapers including USA Today as well as his appearing on CNN, MSNBC and Dateline NBC and as well as a number of books that outline his family and his life available at bookstores as well as Walmart. Also his appointment as Chairman of the Business Advisory Counsel and as Republican of the Year for Virginia in 2001 (awarded in march of 2002) was announced by the NRCC (National Republican Congressional Committe) in a Press Release in March of 2002. We will prep the required reliable source list as soon as that is prepared and then put it back up again. Wikistatman 12:43, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - As the author of this article, and as a Princetonite, Bent Spoon supporter and friend of the owners, I assert that the Bent Spoon is significant both locally and nationally. Many may be familiar with the <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slow_food.html" title="Slow food">slow food</a> movement, where food is treated as a culturally significant and socially encompassing process, not simply an act of consumption. Whereas many ice cream shops claim to make their own ice cream, it simply means that they buy a premade base (eggs, cream, sugar, etc.), add their own flavors and then sell it as 'homemade'. In contrast, the Bent Spoon buys local products and starts <i>absolutely</i> from scratch, which is incredibly rare (ask your local ice cream shop if they crack their own eggs). This is significant because modern agricultural and consumption practices are potentially not <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustainable.html" title="Sustainable">sustainable</a>, and any business that embodies at the heart of its mission a commitment to the <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustainable_development.html" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a> of its community is certainly notable. Also notice that I added a link to a New Jersey Monthly article profiling the Bent Spoon from January 2006, which potentially lends credibility to its status as 'notable'. Perhaps the entry does need to be edited to sound less like an advertisement. Any suggestions? Dzaback 02:09, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I hate to go so much against public opinion, however, I tend to do a lot of studying of religious/occult subjects, and pagan gnosticism actually goes far beyond just this one site. There has been a lot of study in this area with quite a few books published that touch on the subject. I'm very familiar with a lot of the concepts that are on this site and I can personally attest that this site is NOT merely original research. Although searches on the phrase "The Gnostic Pagan Tradition" may all point to this website, you will find that you will get hits on phrases such as "Pagan Gnosticism" and "Gnostic Paganism" that do not just point to this site. I believe that this topic should be retained and just re-worked to be less of an out-right advertisement. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortonew_82d5.html" title="User:Nortonew">Nortonew</a> 01:58, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, nomination in bad faith; Till has shown some notable influence in the skeptic community, in large part because of his previous association with evangelical Christianity. And here's something that's amusing: One of the "few people" that Till has debated is Gastrich, after which, Gastrich posted a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.politics/msg/029cd6b7a633aa3d" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.politics/msg/029cd6b7a633aa3d" rel="nofollow">"gay urges" email forgery</a>. There's obviously a personal history between the two, and I've suggested before that it would be a good idea for someone like Gastrich, who is completely incapable of acting from a neutral POV, to recuse himself from these kinds of things. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 06:48, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nonetheless, I'll correct his lie by omission. Several years ago, Farrell Till was suspended for 1 week from posting on my internet forum for being abusive. During the suspension, he broke the rules by registering with a fake name and it was banned. Next, he registered a different, fake name, and it was also banned. Incidentally, both aliases spoke very highly of him. Consequently, I played a bad joke on him by posting that letter, <b>but</b> I did apologize, afterwards. Dave Horn's selective memory and unforgiveness just goes to show why many people don't feel the need to apologize for things and act in a Christian manner on the internet. Detestable people like Dave Horn will hold it against them until the day they die. Fortunately, since I've repented and sought God's forgiveness, I've been forgiven by Christ and that's what really matters.--<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 20:23, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Having established himself in many venues as disingenuous, at least, there's really not much point in going into whatever details might have occurred before Gastrich's "joke." The fact is that there was noting to omit because it was not relevant to the point. Whateveer might have happened before Gastrich's fraudulent email is entirely irrelevant to the fact that he did issue the fraudulent email. His apology only occurred after he was outed as the forger, and he had no choice. There was no "selective memory" on my part. Whatever excuse that Gastrich might have had for the behavior are entirely irrelevant. It was a juvenile, mean-spirited, hateful thing to do, but it's par for the course for Jason Gastrich, and it helps to establish and affirm a pattern. Gastrich attempts to justify bad behavior by two criteria. First, he will shift the burden of responsibility by blaming another person for "making" him do what he did. Then he'll excuse the whole thing by claiming that God forgives him for it.</li>
<li>Gastrich believes in "once-saved, always-saved," which means that he can pretty much do anything he wants, regardless of what anyone else thinks of it, and he's "forgiven," so it's all good. What Gastrich almost always forgets is that he's also supposed to be a witness for the Gospel and for Jesus Christ, and so his character and actions must be above reproach. An occasional lapse can be forgiven by others, but when one demonstrates a pattern of false identities, forged emails (we know about <i>one</i>, which means that there may be more), and sock puppets, as well as hostile behavior and sensitivity to criticism, then there is good cause to view anything and everything that he does with suspicion. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 20:40, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It could be a one line stub about an atheist talking parrot, and I will vote to keep it rather than allow my name to be part of a series of what are clearly retaliatory AfD actions.

I think this one is valid so voted delete, but I understand the reaction to anything you AfD as I think you are overreacting to something.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> and agree -- nomination for deletion was made in bad faith. Gastrich is clearly retaliating for AfDs on "Christian" articles, which is well within his character. The funny thing is that most of those "Christian" articles were nominated by a professing Christian (and another professing Christian is taking him to task for it on his "talk" page...hurry to read it before he deletes it). Finley's activities as a pioneering Internet radio talk show host, among other things, make him notable. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 04:27, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> There are obvious WP:POINT issues here but let's try to deal with each article on its own merits. In this case, Ghits is not an appropriate criterion.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - are books published in India in the 1970s generally listed on Amazon?

<dd><b>Comment</b> expanding a bit: it does strike me as rather ethno-centric to claim this person isn't "notable" based on the information generally available in the English Google, Amazon, and such. I, honestly, don't know how to proceed in gathering more info given it would likely be in Hindi or another of the <i>many</i> languages of India (18 official if I recall correctly). But I'll hazard that anybody who went against the majority culture in his time frame is notable. For example, going against the caste system early as he did was quite a stance. That system is still a major issue in India and it's interesting to note that there is a reactionary Hindu nationalist party that was only just recently voted out of power. I can't help but feeling that to ignore him is to say that prominence and/or significance in a non-Western country is inherently "not notable." <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li><b>Keep</b> - anyone reading my AfD votes knows I am a HUGE fan of google searches, but in this case this is the wrong way to go. This nomination is remarkably US-centric. Amazon.com is not big on books published by Indian presses decades ago. Nor is an English-google search going to tell you that much about Indian authors. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says that for deceased people we must ask: <em>Has the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field?</em> I note that atheists tend to cite this person as influential - see <a href="http://www.objectivethought.com/atheism/history.html" class="external text" title="http://www.objectivethought.com/atheism/history.html" rel="nofollow">this history</a> (where he goes by the name of Gora) which cites him as one of the most influential atheists in history or <a href="http://www.atheism.ru/old/DulAth17.html" class="external text" title="http://www.atheism.ru/old/DulAth17.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> (in Russian) which labels him "India's most prominent atheist."

<dd>50,000 Google hits is nothing in the context of a worldwide movement like atheism. I just might accept this as indicative of notability in relatively small contexts/movements/etc.
<dl>
<dd>Well, you know, if you take too "broad" a view of things, what's the point of the Wiki itself? Humans are just a minor species on a trivial planet in a galaxy of billions. In terms of the US American atheist "movement" (so far as the term applies) Johnson is the president of one of the more (if not most) known organizations American Atheists, Inc. Which derives most of its notability from being the organization founded by O'Hair in the wake of the (in)famous prayer in schools suit. Johnson is the first president of the organization after the disappearance and death of O'Hair. She's also the president that got the organization through the period of confusion when O'Hair disappeared. She also appears on national talk shows, is quoted by national publications, and AA, Inc. has lobbiest in D.C. She may not warrant a big bio at this point but I can't see deleting her entirely. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<dd>Relax! I find it very easy to see why this article should stay, or that it should never have been AfD'd in the first place. Especially not to make a point. But sometimes wikipedians need to convince not by stating what they know to to be true, but by showing why it is true. Cite external sources, etc. - and then 50,000 Google hits (or 30,000, or 25,000) are not going to cut it. Or shouldn't be.<a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">&#160;AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 20:07, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Relax? Oh no, I'm not upset or worked up or anything like that. Just commenting on the issue of notability. I'm actually agreeing with you in a sense (the comment of "notability in a smaller context" that is). She's notable in a local context (US American atheists and organizations) even if that's a "drop in a bucket" from a broader, worldwide point of view. I'm not married to AA, Inc. I'm not even a member. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K. Bilbo</a> 20:42, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And now that I think about it, I could see a <b>merge</b> with an article on AA, Inc. Maybe it's too soon for her to have a separate article? I'm not sure really. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K. Bilbo</a> 20:46, 22 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it's difficult to say. It may even be the other way around - notable now, no longer notable when she steps down. Time will tell. I'm in favor of a separate article now because I have the feeling (due to what is basically my own definition of notability) that many users will start a WP search with Ellen's name as the entry point. It would be nice to have some sort of feedback system regarding actual use. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 21:30, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That is a common sentence for hippy people, that's what some people reffer to. There's a game, "Yoshi and Mario."

<li><b>Comment</b>. If I (the article's author, from some time back) were to try and defend this as notable (and I am not necessarily doing that), I would say something like: "A child of a notable person is obviously not, for that reason, notable. However, it could plausibly be argued that if the otherwise possibly unnotable child has done something relating to the notability of the parent which is in some way quite interesting, it could make it notable. In this instance, it is somewhat interesting that the son of the discoverer of plutonium, and head of the AEC, became an anti-nuclear activist." But that would probably be a stretch. Anyway, it is just a little stub, Wikipedia will be no better or worse off no matter what happens to it, in my opinion; I have really no investment either way, and I am not writing this in any sort of remorseful tone. In all reality I'm not sure why I wrote the article in the first place -- I must have been making some edit's to his father's article and thought, "Oh, I'll throw the son in too." Not much of a reason, in retrospect! --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 02:22, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I never made any secret that I was asked, because I really cannot see what the problem is with that. Any other site would be happy to make new recruits. If you compare and contrast this to something like Reggie Finley's site, I have to say that there I was never treated as less than equal because I was new. The fact that that has happened here I find disgusting. I don't treat people like that who turn up on my groups and sites. And another thing, David, as you, being a co-moderator of that group are very well aware, the Google2 Beta group called maleboge.org also has been recruiting people into Wikipedia to beef up your side. So if you think that this "meatpuppetry" - a phrase I never heard anywhere but on this particular site - is so wrong in your view (remember, it isn't in my opinion) then aren't you the more to be blamed for being implicated in it than I am? You are in my experience one of the more fair-minded people on your side, so I hope you'll take due account of that point. Uncle Davey 10:02, 25 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why do you insist on polarising this as sides. I don't know what you mean about recruiting. Possibly there was commentary but since all involved had been active in wikipedia for a while (except WarriorScribe) i don't see whom was recruited to where. You'll have to be more specific. In some cases i was recruited to articles by Jason Gastrich himself. You can see that on my talk page. Ironic isn't it. More often than not newbies are helped a lot by the community. Your appearance in less than neutral territory, with a metaphorical gun, no less, meant you lost your honeymoon period. I am certain that if you leave Gastrichs shadow you will get the welcome you deserve. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 10:12, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><em>Uncle Davey:I have to say that there I was never treated as less than equal because I was new. The fact that that has happened here I find disgusting.</em> I'm sorry to hear that you are disgusted. However, wikipedia has policies, and one of these is that votes of new users are usually discounted in controversial or close votes for deletion. Hopefully, you can understand why the policy is here: if it wasn't: (a) votes for deletion would be vulnerable to sockpuppets (b) votes for deletion would turn into campaigning contests, testing which side can garner more personal friends to go and vote. Anyway, I'm afraid the policy is not up for vote or for a debate here.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Actually, the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sean_Sinjin_bd04.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sean Sinjin">first AfD</a> was brought because User:Galgitron felt there were some privacy issues in the edit history and was asking for deletion of the article because of that, which is really not a criterion for deletion. Notability or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>-worthiness was not mentioned. This being the case, I suggest that this nomination by <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">User:Jason Gastrich</a> is not disruption to prove a point, but instead is now a "proper" policy/guideline-based nomination instead. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 07:34, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

She is a prolific writer and artist, contributing to many games (some that I didn't mention because of respect for her privacy). She also writes extensively on the subjects of conservation and Atheism (which is why I put Atheist in the categories), and esoteric subjects like <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bog_iron.html" title="Bog iron">Bog iron</a> (notice in the external links on that page, there's a link to something she wrote on bog iron.

<li>I don't agree that redirecting the word "duplicator" to a Calvin and Hobbes page would be a very good idea. Whoever's searching for it may not be looking for something Calvin and Hobbes related, and if they aren't familiar with the strip, it'd be very confusing for them to be sent to the C&amp;H page after searching for, say, a machine that duplicates things (or whatever, I don't know). This is especially so since the information on Calvin's Duplicator is quite far down the C&amp;H page. However, more experienced Wikipedians may disagree. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimpatico_4705.html" title="User:Simpatico"><font face="georgia" size="3">simpatico</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimpatico_a0b6.html" title="User talk:Simpatico">hi</a></sup> 06:07, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've never heard of the Star Trek replicator, but nevertheless feel the Duplicator would kick its ass.&#160;:) Obviously, people's awareness of these fictional objects varies, but since "Duplicator" and "Replicator" are not the same word and do not refer to the same, or even related, things, it doesn't make sense for the former to redirect to the latter. If any redirect is done, it should be to the C&amp;H page. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimpatico_4705.html" title="User:Simpatico"><font face="georgia" size="3">simpatico</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimpatico_a0b6.html" title="User talk:Simpatico">hi</a></sup> 08:59, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>[EDIT]</b> Forgot to mention that would want to delete all attached articles as well (which obviously is a huge lot). Not opposed to recreating (or merging existing articles into) a much smaller sort list, but the articles that exist now are basically copied straight out of the games' manuals, which is excessive to say the least. ~<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarblespire_61cf.html" title="User:Marblespire">Mbsp</a></dd>

<dd>I say <b>save</b>. I personally have plans to go through and fill out a lot of the information here, taking screenshots and looking up information, writing articles for the various ships and such. I can't speak for what other people do on Wikipedia, but I come here to read about things that interest me with a level of depth and detail I can't get other places--plus guaranteed-to-work links to relevant articles, right in the article text. When reading about a movie, I like to have links to all the actors. When reading about a game, I like to have links to the weapons, items, etc. If you propose the removal of this information, then you have to do the same thing for lots of other articles--Star Fox being one I read recently. What, are you going to go through and eliminate information and screenshots about the ships and such just because nobody's ever going to use it? If this information was here already, <i>I</i> would've already read through it all. That alone is an indicator that it's interesting and relevant to <i>someone</i>. I have no idea what the Peter Parker quotes have to do with this. <a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 09:53, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The Naha article is not so long that streets need their own articles, nor is this one so especially important. Probably Heiwa and Kokusai are famous enough for mention in the Naha article; there might be a small number of others. The information on Heiwa-dori will be easier to find if it's in the city article. Naha used to have a red link to this (under a different spelling, I guess), but I removed the link. (If we keep this article, then of course the link should go back in.) I don't see how WP:CORP applies, since this is a street, not a shopping mall.

<p>Possible vanity. Very little mention of notability. So he interviewed a few famous people? Almost every link from other articles consists of "Interview at Brian M.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to clear Mr. Palmer's name, it's not vanity. I posted it, since several of my friends were discussing his interviews and someone wondered who he was. As long as there's a plethora of information on furries and Transformers on Wikipedia, I'd say keep it. Folks interested in how Onstad connects to other modern "offbeat" pop culture icons may be interested to see an online writer connecting them. [[User:Aristagoras|Aristagoras]</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- could be useful article -- ugly (or ugliness) is a well known concept that seems distinct enough from beauty to require its own article. As for the assertion that this is an attack page, it may be as it stands but if you look at the history you'll see that this was once a legitimite article. Also, perhaps would be a good idea to add some of the old text / gargoyle image from the old (pre-redirect) <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugliness.html" title="Ugliness">ugliness</a> article (see history) to beef this up a little bit and hopefully get the ball rolling on some worthwhile edits. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECooldude02_c673.html" title="User:Cooldude02">Cooldude02</a></li>

<p>This is an alternative <b>food</b> that helps on the functioning of the intestine.

It is not a medicine, it should be eaten like a "compote" or a sauce. The use of fruits is a knowledge of public dominium, the inovation is that was found a mixture that has this value.

<p>It must be understood of the point of view of science. There are many articles written about it in Brazil. The only one written out of Brazil was written in Austria where it was classified as an invention. The article that we are discussing about in Wikipedia can help many people, but as any invention is associated to an inventor and to a company. It has to be decided if the article related to an invention, that can bring health, not using medicine, using fruits, is important enough or not. Tinus doesn't need to think that the name of the inventor is a secret, because it is not. It is just not the foccus of the subject. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> Sandrahans (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sandrahans_1c60.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sandrahans">contribs</a>) 19:36, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> on above: "The foreign-language article is enough" is exactly the wrong reason to delete this. The whole point of having Wikipedias in every language imaginable, even constructed and fictional ones, is to make information and knowledge available to everyone. I don't mean to sound like an overbearing American or anything, but frankly how many people speak Swedish compared to English? If the subject of the article is notable (and I am not totally convinced that it is for the English-speaking community). How can you be sure it won't be kept up to date? And how can you be so sure it can't be written well in English, especially given that the English version is longer than the Swedish version? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 17:56, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Replies</b> on above comment: maybe you are right in that it should not be deleted. However, the point in deleting it is that it isn't a good and valid English explanation on the subject; and the reasons that I'm sure it won't be kept up to date is is 1) that it isn't now, even 2) that certain members of the NGO's board have told me they are having trouble with the article not being correct nor updated as it should, when it should. However, the main reason would be that it simply isn't of that much interest for and English-speaking community, as You say. That was my intention, even though I didn't realize how it would be lacking on this discussion page (haven't suggested deletions before...&#160;:) ). Don't know if that 'straightens out some questionmarks', it's how I see it at least.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWille_Raab_3de6.html" title="User:Wille Raab">Wille Raab</a> 20:33, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>This was originally AFD'd mid december, but the tag was removed. There is no information about reasons for tagging apart from info below. While this young person is cleary a good role model, the hindsight of the 8 weeks since the story appeared gives a clearer view on him. The claim that the story received national attention is clear hyperbole, it appeared briefly on NBC, did the blogs for a week and was then forgotten. The man is now one of many who serve his country, and he <b>may</b> have a bright political future ahead of him, and if so deserves a wiki spot, but at the moment, he is simply an student leader who signed up. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMNewnham_fbea.html" title="User:MNewnham">MNewnham</a> 17:50, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Coalition forces" actually has a much more general meaning than this. Using it only to apply to this single coalition is faulty. If someone wants to do a complete rewrite and include this in a greatly expanded article, go ahead, but that's far from a straight keep. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:10, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Perhaps this should be turned into a disambig page, pointing to various coalition forces in history (if and only if they used that specific term). <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_forces.html" title="Coalition forces">Coalition forces</a> would then point here (or you could do it the other way around).

<ul>
<li>Yes. Band and bio articles can only be speedied if they make no <i>claim of notability</i>. If such a claim is made, we should still use AFD. If it's patently obvious that the band fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, I would probably speedy it, but otherwise not. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 00:31, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, in this case there's no claim to notability and the article is a confused mess. <b>Speedy delete</b> as nn-band/nn-bio. And to previous voters, if you call for a speedy deletion, please tag the page with the relevant tag as admins are less likely to spot and speedy it otherwise. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 00:31, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whether or not the station has an article does not affect my position. If there were an article, however, this show could be worth a brief mention.

<p>Comment: The above is a sampling of articles on my debtism.com website. Tens of thousands of have read my articles since I started last year. No advertisements, Just an attempt to get to the truth about tax and welfare programs and sharing it with the widest audience possible. Since all I get is “delete” response from wikipedia, I’ll not waste any more of your time NOR mine. I'm neither notable, not do I care to be. I am doing my best to bring attention to significant Social Security, tax and welfare problems that have little effect on me; but may impact my sons and grand-son in a manner they cannot yet conceive. Sorry about posting here. I should have done more research before wasting a lot of time. Thanks anyway SargeK</p>

But I personally use a big German kitchen knife the size of my arm and would probably find a Rada knife to be uncomfortably light and whippy, so so far I've resisted buying them. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:37, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, there aren't that many cutlery makers based in the US, and Rada seems to be very commonly sold for fundraising purposes. I'm told they have a rather high "oh, my grandmother had that knife" factor, for whatever that's worth. As I said, though, they aren't particularly high profile, though there seems to be a good number of google hits (raw number, around 200K for "rada knives"). On the other hand, Google Groups only comes up with a couple of hundred references, with seemingly none past 2004. Make of that what you will. I would say they are within certain circles, but a little research is called for. (And the knife design itself is very notable -- all-metal construction like Global, but very, very different in overall design.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 06:52, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have three singles from this album, from different dance collection CD's. This was 90's novelty dance group with moderate sales. "Mr Personality", "Short Short Man" and "Lick It" were released as singles.

<p>Although I don't doubt that this and the 5 other related articles above are genuine-enough traditions in Pontic/Turkish folklore (original creator has used the same reference work for each), having them as individual articles under generic phrases doesn't make much sense. Several of these entries are rather confusingly written, and what's more appear to be direct translations of the cited Turkish reference work. Any encyclopaedic material which can be salvaged from these ought to be <b>merged</b> into the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_folklore.html" title="Turkish folklore">Turkish folklore</a> article (currently only a list of these articles), and the articles <b>deleted</b>.

<dd>Stop repeating the Original Research argument. It is clear you do not understand what you are talking about. I've read the rule and it does not cover what I am doing at all. I am taking data straight from a canon source. So it can't be original research. BTW, the TNG TM doesn't have any information on the Akira. It only has inconsistencies between the GCS class, and thats explained away in the DS9 TM by changes in the design. And once again you've not actualy stated the rule which the DS9 TM violates. You would write off the entire TM because it contradicts SOME information. Stop cherry picking the rules AM. If the TMs are inadmissable, then all non-canon information is inadmissable. If visual analysis is original research, then dialogue analysis is original research and the entire article violates the rule. Its a very simple concept of reality.

<li><b>Comment</b> Let me say again, this is simply a content dispute with another editor. I oppose his addition of his own original research to this and other articles, so his friend blanked it. I pointed out that blanking pages is considered vandalism and likely to get him banned and the proper way to delete pages is to AFD them.

<dd>If you have something meaningful that you're getting at, say it. Otherwise, don't waste time with irrelevancies. While I do post on SD.net, I'm not a Trekkie and don't particularly care about Trek in general. This article means very little to me, but improper admin actions do interest me a great deal. Simple observation does not constitute original research; as far as sources go, counting the weapons on a ship is no different in that regard than listening to Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech or looking up the text of Washington's first inaugural address; it's there for everyone to see. The original research rule doesn't apply here, and I think you know that, because if it really did, you'd have shown how by now instead of simply repeating yourself. As it stands, your definition of original research covers almost everything on Wikipedia, to say nothing of this article. Or it would if you were even halfway consistent. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 18:46, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you don't have a particular interest in Star Trek then you may be unaware that there are no consist figures for weapon counts. Everyone looks at starships like the Akira class or the Nebula class and comes up with different numbers. Alyeska has studied screenshots and come up with his own numbers. That makes it original research. And please remember, people who disagree with Alyeska's analysis are "stupid".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Akira_class_starship&amp;diff=36283642&amp;oldid=36282494" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Akira_class_starship&amp;diff=36283642&amp;oldid=36282494" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> The idea with the rules about verifiability and original research is that we can point to our sources to back up our edits.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I can look at the Enterprise and declare it is black too - not that this will be true, but the point is that opposition does not mean the death of an analysis. As long as Alyeska could justify his decisions for inclusion/exclusion of a suspected TT/phaser point, it is still valid. So put it up, along with any rebuttals, and let other people decide.

<dd><b>Weak delete</b>: I have no big interest in Star Trek, but I do have a interest in Visual Analysis of Sci-Fi, so here I am. Here is the crux of the issue, no? For some reason, people have a wierd and arbitrary Macro/Micro divide when it comes to visual analysis. For "macro" things (generally meaning entire ships or their general shapes), they tend to accept it. But for "small" things (even as big as the relative size of ships, let alone tiny torpedo launchers), they call it Speculation, Original Research...etc - all of which involve the base point of ignoring it. This is even though both involve looking at the screen and taking down what one sees. Why is one guy Original Researching because he looks more closely and sees more details than the other? Is it his fault that you aren't paying enough attention? Aren't the sources for both people the same, so in principle equally verifiable? As for detail disputes, as a Star Wars guy I can tell you sadly that even purported official sources can't find their butts with both hands and a flashlight. There are at least three "official" lengths in circulation about <i>Executor</i>. Does that mean no conclusion can be made? Of course not - all the lengths are simply written in some context on the page. I suggest Involved Parties do the same here - put up some Big Pictures of Akira, and circle all the points that are definitely torp tubes/phasers/whatever in red and the disputed ones in yellow, followed by a explanation of the disputed areas. That would provide the needed verifiability - everyone can check out the same picture and decide for themselves. IMO, either taking down what's shown in the film is Original Research, or it isn't. From the number of movie and anime descriptions I see on Wiki, most would consider this action Valid rather than Original Research. Imposing arbitrary Macro/Micro limits is IMO hypocritical and arbitrary. As for TMs, AFAIK they are not canon, so let's not include them - but the films and TV episodes are, so they can be looked at more closely. In any case, what's left of this page after so called "Original Research" is removed is so little that it might as well be combined into some other page. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazuaki_Shimazaki_06cb.html" title="User:Kazuaki Shimazaki">Kazuaki Shimazaki</a> 05:16, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
