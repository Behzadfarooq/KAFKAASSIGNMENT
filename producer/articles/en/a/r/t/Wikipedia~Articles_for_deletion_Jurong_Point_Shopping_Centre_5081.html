<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>(was delete, see below)</i> If the page defenders want to make a run at establishing notability, I would give them a day or two to do it.) Page fans, per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">Wikipedia's notability guidelines for businesses</a>, you need to come up with at least a few non-trivial articles about the mall in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The easiest way is to go to your local library and ask a librarian to help you search newspaper records, or just call the mall and see if they have a press clipping file you can review. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 15:03, 13 October 2006 (UTC) <i>Update: after waiting "the few days" mentioned above, I think there are a lot more reasons to delete.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I've worked places with parking lots bigger than 700,000 square feet, and those lots don't get WP articles. Why should size matter unless the mall is notable specifically for being "the world's largest"? I don't see that we should include every nation's largest mall, every nation's tallest building, etc. unless there are verifiable third-party sources featuring that fact. A local newspaper's article saying "mall being expanded" is of little weight by itself, as every mall has probably gotten a two-paragraph blurb in its local paper. Is this one Singapore's largest or just "yardstick of other ... malls"? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The small land area of Singapore limits the size of architectures, which make Jurong Point one of the largest and most notable in Singapore. Perhaps Jurong Point is insignificant compared to American or whatever standards, but are you saying that we are supposed to neglect local standards when editing articles relating to local events/places and adopt only American standards? <b>Slivestré</b> <small>¦ <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlivester_47dd.html" title="User:Slivester">Pfrt</a> ¦ <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlivester_Photo_Archive_acd6.html" title="User:Slivester/Photo Archive">PAve</a> ¦ <a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlivester_8e09.html" title="User talk:Slivester">Dcn</a> ¦ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slivester_f89c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slivester">Cntn</a> ¦ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Slivester_203e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Slivester">Ei</a> ¦</small> 05:25, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. I'm saying we are supposed to adhere to Wikipedia standards, including verifiable significance rather than whether a couple of local people claim importance without evidence. Note that at least one other editor claims to be from there and claims it's not more significant than other shopping centers. Freddy's General Store might be the most important shopping facility in a town of fifty people in South Dakota, but that "local standard" isn't evidence of Wikipedia importance. Otherwise WP would be swamped in articles for a hundred thousand malls "one of the largest and most notable in XXX" for which nothing encyclopedic could be documented. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 13:58, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Tens of thousands of people visit the mall every day..." - sources? The problem with this article has been clearly stated early on by Uncle G - sources are needed! Without sources, anyone can say that about any place and there's no way to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> what they are saying is correct. If I were more skeptical and hadn't seen the place myself, I'd say the page writer is just making it up. "Major" and "many people visit this place" are what you can hear at the kopitiam <small>("coffee shop", for non-Singaporeans)</small>; (un)fortunately, Wikipedia is not the kopitiam anyone can edit - sources have to be provided. <a href="../../../a/w/y/User%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3b01.html" title="User:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh</a> 02:14, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've no idea what you are talking about? The nomination said the subject is not-notable, which is false. The source to these facts is already given in the "external link" before the nomination. If the nominator missed it, and someone had to highlight the infor, it is perfectly alright and that is what I was trying to do above. On the other hand, if one editor doubt another's comment for no apparent reason and don't bother to do his/her own research or even follow up with the links, that is not very constructive.--<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 05:37, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>First, you are making the assumption that my photo is meant to support that particular claim. Where did I make this association? Second, your statement "factual, written references by third-party sources" suggests that I am not an independent source, and that only "factual, writtern sources" are permitted. Is this true?

<dd>What claim would your photograph be considered a source for? As for my statement on the need for third-party sources, if persons provide direct evidences (in this case, a photograph) of a certain state of affairs, those evidences may be used as Wikipedia sources only if they have been published by a reliable publisher. If you edit the article to insert your photograph, the burden of evidence for that edit lies with you (the user who has made the edit).. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 08:26, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I beg to differ in opinion from Awyong. I live in Hougang, yet I know this mall very well indeed, and have been frequenting it since it opened in the late 1990s. The impact it has on the commercial landscape in the West is pretty obvious, for prior to its existance, the lack of a centralised commercial facility meant it was spread across a far larger area around the various neighbourhood centres. Such an impact is difficult to judge from its physical size, but to say it is non-notable for what it is physically is way too dismissive.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 14:19, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My statement above does not regard "permissibility". It regarded deletion criteria. From a logical point of view, it is perfectly possible for "presence of non-independent source" not to be a deletion criterion, and for "absence of independent sources" to be one. As for your observation on other articles, again I must state that I prefer to judge each article on its own merits. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 16:41, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>An article can have both independent sources and non-independent (related) sources. A good article will use both independent and related sources. The issue isn't whether or not the related sources are used. The issue is whether the independent sources are available and used. If the independent sources are not available, the article should be deleted as a consequence of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If the independent sources are available but not used, the article should be improved by using them. The best evidence that the independent sources are available is their use, but pointing out other sources that cite such independent sources is sometimes adequate. The opinions of individual editors that something is significant enough to cover carry no weight compared to the opinions of independent sources. We ignore related sources in discussing notability because related sources are inherently biased.</dd>
<dd>I also think it is obvious from my comment that I said <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> was the standard.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is a major difference between the two. WP:INDY leads with a one sentence summary of the essay that is an argument from policies. No such summary of WP:LOCAL exists or is possible. To top it off, WP:LOCAL says in the section entitled "Creating articles about places of local interest" that references should be included in an article about a local place of interest. So I can also argue "Delete because the article does not have the references required by <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>." WP:LOCAL is a reason to delete the article, not to keep it, because the article is not up to the level that WP:LOCAL expects. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:39, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The basic requirement of most notability pages -- two non-trivial references in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources is not onerous, and has not been met.</li>
<li><i>Verification:</i> Not one statement on the page is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> by any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. As written in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small 'garage' or local companies are not likely to be acceptable."</li>
<li><i>Advertising:</i> The page as it is written reads like advertising copy, and its only function is to advise readers of the amenties available at the mall, and to direct readers to the mall's website. This fails for several reasons: (a) <a href="../../../a/d/v/Wikipedia%7EAdvertising_29d3.html#Advertisements_masquerading_as_articles" title="Wikipedia:Advertising">Advertisements masquerating as articles</a> are not only inappropriate, they may be speedy deleted; (b) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>; and (c) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not advertising</a>.</li>
<li><i>Incurable</i>: As I've said, the page's defenders have had several days. I don't see that any of the problems above are curable, much less all of them.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> On the contrary, there is nothing wrong with the article, Jurong Point is notable and verified. The article is referenced, NPOV, not disputed, informative, and has a picture. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 00:44, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> May I point out, that the conclusion "notability is not established" is no longer governed by whether this comes under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or not, but whether the sources which are already listed are <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">Independent</a> enough to be considered <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>. As is the case for many above, I dispute the notion that non-independent sources are always <b>assumed</b> to be unreliable. None of the stated guidelines above explicitely rule out the possibility of reliable non-independent sources, and <b>not one person here could proof that those sources are indeed unreliable</b>.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 11:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Please do <i>not</i> change reason for nomination</b>: To clear up the confusion the last post engenders, as the nominator I state again that the proposed reason for deleting this article is that it does not meet the relevant notability criteria. In this case, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> applies, so <i>multiple</i>, <i>non-trivial</i>, <i>independent</i> sources must be quoted by the article to establish its notability. As it stands, the article contains only one such source, whose reliability I have <i>not</i> questioned. As for non-independent sources, whether they are reliable or not, the article can of course contain them, but they are <i>not</i> eligible as notability criteria under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 14:57, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are multiple such sources. In the above, Mailer has already given another source from the <i>Business Times</i>. Let me add another one from a govt. agency <a href="http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2138" class="external autonumber" title="http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2138" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. So, any remaining problem? This Afd is already a futile effort, we are just entertaining each other here&#160;;), which is alright. But basically, if the article was to be deleted, it would just be wasting the contributors' effort and reducing the comprehensiveness of wikipedia (although some editors don't care about shopping malls, but the majority do.) We can discuss forever, but in short, the reason cited for deletion is really very weak. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 22:47, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The webpage quoted by Mailer above mentions Jurong Point Shopping Centre when stating that a new large mall may be built near it in 2008-2009. That is <i>not</i> a notability assertion for the present mall. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 04:41, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As stated above, non-independent sources <i>can</i> be used <i>as sources</i>, sure; they just cannot be used as notability criteria under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.
