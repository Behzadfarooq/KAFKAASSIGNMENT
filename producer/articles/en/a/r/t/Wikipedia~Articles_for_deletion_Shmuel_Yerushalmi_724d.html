<li><b>Keep</b>: Shmuel is not unpublished. I have seen his works in translation in Al Ittihad. His poems were certainly notable enough to gain the attention of the Israeli Internal Security authorities. The references at on the article are sufficient to demonstrate <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Protest poets are rare in Israeli society, and I do not know any other case of a poet who has made the transition from right wing Zionism to anti-Zionist communism. He is a contravertial individual and you may not approve of his political ideas. But <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Abuse_of_deletion_process" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">the deletion policy</a> clearly states
<blockquote>
<p>"XfD (deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked, whose perspective is against ones beliefs, or which is not yet presented neutrally."</p>

<li>Eh, assume good faith. Of course his politics are repugnant to me, but that is not why I nominated him for deletion. I resent the supposition. Noam Chomsky's politics are also repugnant to me, but I do not dispute his claim to notability. - <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETragic_Baboon_8a4d.html" title="User:Tragic Baboon">Tragic Baboon</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETragic_Baboon_9011.html" title="User talk:Tragic Baboon">banana receptacle</a>)</small> 14:32, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Abu Ali, "Protest poets" are anything but rare in Israeli society, in fact <i>non protest poets are rare</i>. We don't need every single one of them, only the notable ones.

<li><s><b>delete</b> It is quite possible that he will become a notable activist and perhaps a notable poet, and I wish him well at both, but I dont think he is N quite yet</s> vote changed, see below. .<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>:I think that the testimony of a country´s Security Serice when they investiagate a radical activist and consider him dangerous and inform him that they keep an eye on him, and this is reported by reputable media both in the country itslef and internationally, is a reliable proof of finding him notable as an activist. The Security Service can be considered an impartical witness, they have no interest in Wikipedia, they only have an interest in which activists is notable and which one is negligable from their point of view, and they clearly consider yerushalmi notable. Adam Keller 23:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Why delete this? Yerushalmi is a well-known poet and activist. His arrest and interrogation were widely noted around the world; his comments are frequently quoted; and his poems (in Hebrew at least) widely available. The claim that he is non-notable is wholly spurious. --<a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 02:12, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Jaakobou's opinion above is prejudiced and uncalled-for. There are over 1.5 million articles on English Wikipedia, and I had not come across this one until I saw it mentioned on <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Keller_adf3.html" title="User talk:Adam Keller">User talk:Adam Keller</a>; nobody canvassed me for support. I have, however, herad of Shmuel Yerushalmi, and have previously, off-Wikipedia, forwarded his poems to friends. So I agree that he is notable and deserving of an entry in Wikipedia, and I object -- quite genuinely and independently -- to deleting the article. In any case, Abu Ali's message to Adam Keller was transparent and available for all to see, so it can hardly be considered an underhand attempt to subvert Wikipedia. But whi knows how many off-wiki messages may have been exchanged by editors trying to delete this article. Any attempt to discount our opinions will be strongly resisted. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 14:37, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. "<i>Yeruhalmi is ones along poets write hebrew, that write against Zionism and in support of the peace and equality</i>": He writes against Zionism indeed, though the support of peace and equality lies in the eye of the beholder - anyway, while that stance might seem worthy to some, I fail to see what makes him notable by <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">WP:N</a> standards. Wait until he gets his poetry published by serious publishing houses and reconsider then. Publishing vaguely "<i>in different literary and political sites,</i>" is pathetic, even if these unnamed cites should be named eventually. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 01:41, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Shmuel Yerushalmi publishes his poetry and essays in an open web forum and participates also in real life political activities. He is not notable by the Wikipedian standards set in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<p><s>*<b>Weak delete</b></s> Was interviewed in Sikur Memukad (whose reliability I am unsure of) but together may be enough to make arguably notable. However, a single mention and a very one sided interview is not enough to write an article.

<li><b>Delete</b> This guy writes poems on the internet blog website called "Bama Chadasha".

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I have changed my vote from delete, on the basis of the evidence of publication, and the apparent attempt to delete the article on what might possibly in some instances be political grounds.

<li><b>Delete</b> Per Leflyman and tickleme. This person is not notable now. Heck, I'VE written poetry in Hebrew, where is MY article?! Just being in a small subcategory doesn't make you notable, otherwise we should have an article on afghani poets in British Guyana, there are not too many of those either.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't know if there are Afghani poets in Guyana (which is not British any more, it is a soverign state). If there were, they might well have gotten a Wikipedia article, Wikipedia has pages on all kinds of small minorities in all kinds of places. And if an Afghani poet in Guyana got investigated by the Guyanan Security Services for a controversial political poem, that might well make him noteworthy. By the way, how come so many people take such an intensive passionate interest in an obscure, unknown political polemicist? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Keller_28af.html" title="User:Adam Keller">Adam Keller</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> an unusual and impressive number of editors have turned up to vote delete. Many of them are familiar to me and routinely revert my edits on sight. But they haven't put forward reasoned arguments for deletion beyond assertions of lack of notability (based on ignoring the citations in the article itself. More significant are the contributions of JoshuaZ and DGG who both changed their votes from delete to keep after examining the evidence and finding that the requirements for notability have been met. Will their voices be heard, or will their voices be drowned out by those who want to erase pro-peace Israelis from Wikipedia? We will see. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">ابو علي</a> 16:48, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
