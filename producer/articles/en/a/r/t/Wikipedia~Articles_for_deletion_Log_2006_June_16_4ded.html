<dd>Nor is it a floor wax or a dessert topping. More to the point, <i>Wikipedia is not paper, but it is also not the Library of Babel, nor is it an endless and tedious compendium of every bit of trivia and gossip and useless, insignificant "facts". It is an encyclopedia, not a dumping ground. That means we have a duty not to mindlessly compile facts but to present them in a concise and usable manner, making judgments about which facts are important and which are not.</i> - Gamaliel, in some AFD or other. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:12, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to admit, this one has me at a little bit of a loss. It appears to violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> by being an indescriminate collection of information, as well as being unencyclopedic and impossible to ever make anything approaching complete thereby being POV in what it includes or leaves out.

<dd>You seem to just hate the concept of lists. Lists <i>aren't</i> encyclopedic and were never meant to be, its just another tool for organizing the encyclopedic entries contained within Wikipedia. We use categories for the same purpose. Lists are almanacical, or almanac-like. Almanacs contains pages of information sorted by one of the variables. Since lists can be sorted by one of the variables they are inherently useful. I rarely use the index or footnotes in any of the books I read, but I don't call for them to be eliminated since they are useful to others. You seem to be confused and think that lists are not allowed in Wikipedia. Please read <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_98bd.html" title="Wikipedia:List">Wikipedia:List</a>. Lists have become so important to Wikipedia that there is now a featured list. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 03:31, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your deliberate ignorance annoys me. If I hate lists so much, why have I contributed to several? Your assumption of me basing deletion decisions on likes or dislikes annoys me. I have stated how I believe this list violates several wikipedia policies, and you are violating wikipedia policy by not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> that this is in fact my motivation. You are free to disagree with my interpretation of the policies, but you cannot deny I am making a valid argument based on policy. You are being civil, so you are not rising to the level of a personal attack or anything so awful, but you are being impolite nonetheless, and I would appreciate it if you stuck to rational policy arguements rather than making value judgements and lecturing me.

That seems to be a violation of policy. Here's a dubious example: "<i>Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn, 35 years. She was his stepdaugher and 22 years</i>". Now, to my knowledge, Woody was involved with Soon-Yi's mother (Mia), but was not legally married to Mia, and Soon-Yi was never a step-daughter. If she was his legal step-daughter, he would be guilty of a serious criminal offence. Further, there have been conflicting reports as to whether Soon-Yi's exact age is known. Now, my understanding of facts, may well be totally wrong.

The formatting needs to be standardised. The final category "Less than 10 years" seems a bit pointless. It's open-ended, so presumably a relationship with an age disparity of only 6 months could go there. The smallest disparity currently shown is 6 years, hardly eyebrow-raising. I'd remove the final category, have a minimum disparity of 10 years as a criterion for inclusion, and rename the list "List of relationships with a significant age disparity" or something like that. But to remove the list altogether would be to decrease the sum of human knowledge about interesting things, and I could not possibly support that. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 08:53, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact that the guidelines for selection are somewhat arbitrary is unavoidable.

<dd>What point of view? Its done using math I learned in grade school, subtract the little number away from the big one. Try it. Are you sure you know what "misogynistic" means? Is it misogynistic to keep seperate male and female lists for all the Olympic records? And finally the numer 10 is no more arbitrary than using 10 in top ten lists...you have to choose some number.
<dl>
<dd>The point of view is that you hold AgeX-AgeY=DifferenceZ&gt;10 to be of some signifiance and something worth noting. As for <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">misogyny</a>, it indicates discrimination and prejudice against women, although sexism is perhaps a better word in this context. Regardless, it is completely idiotic to lower the limit for women, simply because they're women. No, your stupid analogy has no bearing on this; separate Olympic records is due to differing physical ability which plays no part whatsoever in age disparity between married couples.

The simplest might be to move the article to "List of relationships <b>by</b> age disparity" or some such thing. Also, it would probably be better to replace the word "relationship" with "romantic relationship" or even "marriage" (my mother and I have a relationship with a 25 year age disparity). If you're still concerned about having a glut of 1-5 year disparities at the bottom of the article, there's nothing that says we can't divide this by the decade, as in Category:Entertainers who died in their 20's, <a href="../../../e/n/t/Category%7EEntertainers_who_died_in_their_30s_b060.html" title="Category:Entertainers who died in their 30s">Category:Entertainers who died in their 30s</a>.

<li>How can subtracting two numbers bring about a lawsuit? Any lobbying was for people to vote, not to support or condemn the article. What are you considering unverifiable, their ages? It comes directly from the Wikipedia article linked. If the ages are wrong correct them. My campaign for people to read the article and vote is no different than a "get out the vote" campaign in presidential politics. The dissemination of information is what Wikipedia is all about...right? If I violated a rule somewhere quote it to me. Lobbying and "get out the vote" is only restricted in votes for admin status, if I remember correctly.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have changed the excessively arbitrary criteria to a simpler and if anything overinclusive straight five-year cutoff. I have also added {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}}, since it doesn't cite sources. Obviously it will be hard to complete, but not impossible, and in any case that's true of many lists. But it's definitely verifiable; also neutral (it no more expresses the POV that age discrepancies are interesting than the existence <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships.html" title="Age disparity in sexual relationships">Age disparity in sexual relationships</a> does: both assume that the reader may be interested in their content, and it's certainly verifiable that <i>some</i> people are); and isn't inherently original research <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">as we define it</a>.

<dd>It's not a magic number. It's picked for the sake of convenience. Alternatively, the article could be changed to List of articles by age disparity, and all marriages included, but it's unlikely that anyone is interested in even a five-year gap.

<li><b>Keep</b> Many of the arguments on this page are long-winded and redundant, so I shall endeavor not to do the same. This article is meant to educate the reader, and also to serve as a collection and congealing of knowledge and information spread among hundreds of other pages. Any argument about usefulness is as POV as anything else. The information included in the article is factual. If you have an issue with the facts, CORRECT THEM. If you don't like the 10/5 issue, make your opinion known, but don't vote for deletion. If every article was deleted from Wikipedia simply because it was in error, or someone disagreed with the design, layout, or information included, Wikipedia would be just another unheard of website. Socrates said that "The only good is knowledge and the only evil is ignorance." This page, while not necessarily knowledge unto itself, is nonetheless a collection of information from diverse other places - just as Wikipedia itself is. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilton_Stanley_31bb.html" title="User:Milton Stanley">Milton</a> 03:13, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ah, I apologize that I failed to diligently comment on every entry on the article. Perhaps a few copied and pasted samples will make it less generic? Maybe I should summarize a little? Or perhaps I should simply comment on your own diligent discarding of many keep votes as "generic and spam-oriented" as you have. That certainly isn't generic.

<dd>If you like... but when I comment on AFDs I read the article first, then I try very hard to find information... often going to considerable lengths... and then make my decision while listing what I did to justify that decision. At the very least, I recreate the work and reasoning of someone else and verify that what they have said is correct before stating my agreement with them. I don't respond to spam requests, and I don't use cut and pasted, pre-prepared speeches that quote ancient philosophers. Perhaps I'm working too hard to this "discussion" lark, but that's just me. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:23, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I want to congratulate you on being original in that last comment, and also in forming your arguments. By not descending to baseless accusations and unsupported arguments, as many others on this page have, you've shown your genuine opinion.

<dd>I'm sure you did... your detailed and accurate references to the article's content and use of quotes from ancient philosophers, just screams diligent and careful judgement of the material under discussion. The suspicion that you were <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAMed</a> as an inclusionist, showed up, copy and pasted an argument from a pre-prepared list, modified one line to include an argument that was mentioned in the discussion and posted it in an effort to add another "keep" vote and try to stalemate it all into a no-consensus is completely unfounded. Your follow up comments further show that you have given careful consideration to the material. You are a shining example of proper AFD conduct, and I urge others to examine your contributions and see for themselves. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 07:20, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Motor</a>, yes my argument was pre-prepared, I admit: after reading both the article and the discussion on this page, I sat at my computer and took the time to organize my thoughts into an intelligible vote. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Motor</a>, I disagree with your assertion that Socrates doesn't matter since he lived so long ago. Thanks for your very kind comments about my AFD conduct, I was very surprised, after our recent discussion, that you would take the time to compliment my comments, and furthermore finally admit that your entire "Inclusionist spam means no vote" asininity is ridiculous. It means a lot. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_feed_the_troll.html" title="Don't feed the troll">Have a good day, buddy</a>.

<li>Who said Socrates "doesn't matter"? Accusing me of trolling because I point out certain inconvenient facts about the mass-spamming that happened, and conduct of some of the inclusioninsts summoned? And finally, there's still not a single point that is relevant to this article in any of your posts. No doubt the admin who closes AFD will still obediently headcount it though.

<li><b>Delete</b>. POV. The explanatory sentence starts out fine with "The older partner is listed first" but "followed by the magnitude of the disparity" smacks of sensationalism. "followed by age difference" would be less *gasp*like in tone. The explanation is effectively forgotten when the entry has "x was older" even though the older partner is listed first. Women are given almost three times the "was older" notation than men. I counted three with men, eight with women. That strikes me of the entertainment magazines trumpeting in surprise that the woman's older. And does 10-5 years really constitute a remarkable age disparity between two adults? ..<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJaguara_dac8.html" title="User:Jaguara">Jaguara</a> 06:58, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Keep, rework and rename</b> Although the subject matter is potentially the subject matter of a Wikipedia article, it suffers presently from three inherent defects - a) potentially excessive length due to the fact raised that all such groupings have an age disparity; b) apparent non-verifiability at present; and c) What is a 'relationship' and how do we ascertain whether two (or indeed more!) people are in one?

<li><b>Weak Keep.</b> There is little need for a list like this as almost all marriages have an age disparity of at least one day (my mother was born 38 days before my father.)

<li>Weak <b>Keep</b>. I too was talk-spammed. As an inclusionist I lean against deletion in most cases, but this article had me really, really tempted- there's a lot wrong with it. The gender disparity in the list should be addressed. The criteria for list inclusion should be tightened seriously. The minimum age disparity should be at least 20 years (a generation). Marriage of minors should be moved to a different list entirely. Sources should be provided. The list should require committed relationships such as marriage for inclusion. That said, the list makes a good reference of examples for an article on the social effects of May-December marriages and the like, so it shouldn't be junked entirely- just MASSIVELY reworked. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedneckgaijin_3655.html" title="User:Redneckgaijin">Redneckgaijin</a> 16:07, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is a frequently discussed topic in celebrity gossip, at least. The less than ten years section definitely needs to go and I'm not entirely sold on the 10-19 category, either. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 16:43, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The topic is worthy of note, but the list needs some serious work. A 5 year age difference is hardly notable. Even 10 or 15 years probably isn't enough to justify inclusion on a list, given the sheer number of such relationships. However, a very large age disparity is unusual, and due to the unusualness, is notable. The list needs to be winnowed quite a bit, but the topic itself is worthy of inclution. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoIdeaNick_49e4.html" title="User:NoIdeaNick">NoIdeaNick</a> 04:16, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> on "generic" keep opinions: there is no reason that anyone has to look at an article before making up their minds as to whether it should be deleted. Deletion should arguably be determined by the <i>topic</i> of a page, not by its <i>content</i>; if someone first started up <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Album_Notes_-_Classical_84b2.html" title="Grammy Award for Best Album Notes - Classical">Grammy Award for Best Album Notes - Classical</a> <small>(yes, that was <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random</a>)</small> with the content "faksighewigu84", it would be reasonable to say "replace with a quick summary and keep" (if it weren't speediable, anyway). Likewise, if someone started ajg399399999 with a brilliant article on [insert topic here], it would be correct to say "merge anything useful and delete" even without having to read the actual content. Whether people have read this article is irrelevant.
<p>Frankly, I don't get what anyone is supposed to say about the specific article altogether. It's basically just what the title says: a list of relationships sorted by age disparity. I find it disturbing that not alluding to this directly puts some people under suspicion of being shills or something.</p>
<p>And finally, I would like to note that it <i>is</i> definitely good to point out that people's opinions were solicited; I don't object to that (which is why I did it for myself). But questioning the legitimacy of those opinions based on the logic that they must address the content of the article rather than its subject is unreasonable. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 19:15, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's not important to check the content, and do a bit of research to check what other articles are available... y'know, basic research before commenting (merge is an option, you know). Right-oh. That's certainly an... interesting argument to try. As for you being disturbed, well... I highlighted <i>only</i> those people whose votes were solicited *and* at the same time rather obviously did not put even the slightest effort into their comments. I feel that was a good compromise, since the kind/size of spamming engaged in here is explictly discouraged. I'd also like to note that votes of the kind "Keep, the topic is worthy of note" is not any kind of argument, since there already is an article on the topic of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships.html" title="Age disparity in sexual relationships">Age disparity in sexual relationships</a> -- and the difference can be/is discussed in context. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 19:41, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a>, by your logic, one could say that "Delete per nom" or "Delete, listcruft" or "Delete, it's gossip" are "no-effort" comments.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with me pointing out those users who did *all* of the following: responded to the spam, made no effort at commenting on the article beyond a simple generic statement, and did not reveal the fact that they had been requested to come here. I *specifically* (and noted this publicly) did not criticise those users who did not fulfill the above criteria -- and I have a list of users who were spammed, and many of them did comment in this AFD, with no reply from me. But hey, why let things like simple facts get in the way of confusing this issue further? - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 21:48, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Highlighting people who were spammed is valuable. Criticizing them for not putting effort into their comments is not. No, it is not necessarily important to check the content of an article, for the reasons I stated. And yes, "this topic is worthy of note" is a valid argument despite the existence of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships.html" title="Age disparity in sexual relationships">Age disparity in sexual relationships</a>, because "X" is a different topic from "List of X". —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 21:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't "highlight people who were spammed" -- as I explained above, I was more selective. Yes... criticising people who were spammed, didn't reveal it, and not putting the slightest effort into a comment is perfectly correct thing to do... and if it happens again, I will do exactly the same thing. And yes... it is necessary to examine the contents of an article before commenting, again, as I explained above since delete or keep is not the only option. And no, "the topic is of note is not a valid argument" since there already is an article on this topic (which a commenter might know if they'd done more than just look at the title)... and in this case it's not just a crappy list made up of gossip. But apart from that lot, you're absolutely correct. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 22:18, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Simetrical, I said I wasn't going to comment further, but your remarks compelled me to. I agree with your comment completely. I too was messaged by Mr. Norton, and I didn't mention it. I also didn't mention that I was living in Tennessee, that I was a male, or that I was a college student - any of these facts are readily available online. Thank you for your comment - you may have noticed that I accused motor of trolling earlier - while he may not be doing it intentionally, the vast majority of his comments on this page have been inflamatory and, while perhaps not intentionally so, aimed at belittling those he was commenting on. He has been attempting to reduce their comments to worthlessness, all the while behind a thin veneer of caring about the integrity of this page.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. I confess, however, that in the past I've read this article myself and enjoyed it, although this temporal cold war business serves as an object lesson to any writer who thinks time travel is a substitute for creativity. Memory Alpha has made it clear that they don't want it, as has Wikipedia. I suspect, however, that this article, or one very much like it, could have a long and fruitful history on someone's personal website or wiki. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is severe fancruft and full of opinion. While the fact that there were continuity problems with the series may be encyclopedic, the nature and discussion of those problems on wikipedia are not necessary. During the last AFD it was proposed that the article be moved to the Star Trek wiki <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Main_Page" class="external autonumber" title="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. It would be prudent to do so and simply mention in the original Enterprise article there were continuity issues and let people goto the Star Trek wiki and read about it if they so wish. This article contains a lot of original research, referencing many alleged fan opinions that would be impossible to source properly here. Not to mention the title of the article is "alleged" problems, which conveys a clear message that this article is opinion. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This is now the third time this has been AfDed, and it survived both previous times. No convincing reason given to overturn those results.

<dd>It is original research when just about every paragraph contains sentences like "Some fans..." There is no citing for that. The last AFD wasn't a keep either, it was a no concensus.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: As has been noted, this is the third time someone tried to have it deleted, and both previous times the VfD failed. This is starting to look less and less like a serious request, and more like a "Star Trek doesn't belong in an encyclopedia" campaign.<br />
The article is not original research. People keep saying that it is nothing but fan stuff, hoping perhaps that people won't read the article itself to check? Because, in reality, the article cites no less that 49 different Star Trek episodes and 3 books. This article has more sources than roughly half the articles on Wikipedia -- if this gets deleted for being unverifiable, then so should most of Wikipedia.<br />
The article belongs on Wikipedia. "Star Trek" deserves more than a single page saying "TV series aired from 1966 to 2005, see MemoryAlpha for more details", which is what it will be reduced to if some people had their way. But more than that, this page provides useful and relevant information on the last Star Trek series, and how it fits (or doesn't fit) into the huge and rich Star Trek universe. It is necessary to understand the public reaction to Enterprise, which led to the first cancellation of a Star Trek series since TOS in 1969. Not exactly an event that will go down in History, I'll grant that, but then again, Wikipedia is not Britannica. There are less relevant articles allowed to stay on Wikipedia -- one need only think of <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketchup_on_hot_dogs.html" title="Ketchup on hot dogs">Ketchup on hot dogs</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_neologisms_on_The_Simpsons_2683.html" title="List of neologisms on The Simpsons">List of neologisms on The Simpsons</a>, for example. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 20:08, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><small><b>Delete</b> It's OR. It's as simple as that. The nature of the article invites OR. There have been cleanup tags present for over six months and they haven't helped. This doesn't belong on Wikipedia, and for what it's worth it doesn't belong on Memory Alpha either because they don't endorse OR. It belongs on fan forums. I tried to clean this up months ago when I was fairly new to Wikipedia, but even my edit left opinions in (partially my own). This article can't exist without them, and verification of lines such as "many fans suspect..." cannot occur without linking to biased forum discussions. Star Trek should be on Wikipedia.

If it has been through two prior AFDs and remains in this shabby state, there is no reason to believe that it will be cleaned up. Finally, this is about fiction, and at least in my opinion the only portion of the article that has any hope of being encyclopedic is the introduction, but without the body the intro isn't article worthy.

<li>That's one way of looking at it. Another explanation might be that no consensus = no consensus.

<li>No..its the nature of AFDs. When opened, they're left open for 5 days, but the AFD is so busy people often do not go back 3 or 4 days to see what was nominated then. After the first day or two the only people who generally see the AFD are people going to the article who may have a biased opinion and not represent wikipedia as a whole. Renominating the AFD, especially on a controversial subject ensures that you get a more general concensues of what wikipedians feel on the issue rather than it being lopsided. Not relisting the AFD leads to situations where you have fan groups muddle the process and hurt wikipedia because they're able to just show up in a force of a few and muddle the discussion. If admins closed properly and actually considered the arguments on both sides like they were supposed to instead of just tallying it up like a vote (which they'll claim its not) this wouldn't be a problem for many controversial issues. If you read the talk page you'll see that the artcle can't be edited. Its been tried and the nature of this article is that its opinion. There is no cleaning it up. Once you take out all the unsourced opinion, conclusions, etc. you don't really have anything worth being an article. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:04, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your opinion and the informative lesson on AfD history and procedure. Incidentally, I see nothing particularly controversial about this article, nor do I think there is any potential to "hurt" wikipedia, whether it is kept or deleted. I don't think those type of scare tactics are necessary, nor do I think you score any points by attacking admins. The article has been here far longer than you have, and during that time wikimedia has gotten much stronger. I also think your logic is badly flawed concerning relisting, since if everyone relisted on a daily basis, following your lead, it would make a total mess of the process. You further claim you want participation in the discussion, but not from "fan groups" (whatever that means). People interested in a given topic, if that's what you mean by "fan groups", are responsible for contributing almost every article on the site. They should be allowed to speak. Their contribution shoulld not be belittled. In fact, you only want participation from people who agree with your opinion, and you feel entitled to argue with everyone who disagrees. Returning to the article, the talk page gave me no indication at all that this "can't be edited". If the topic is viable (and in this case "important"), the article can be edited. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:09, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article as it is and has been for the last year consists mainly of original research and unsourced opinion. That hurts wikipedia, which is why there is a policy against it. My logic isn't flawed. If the article is listed once and forgotten about, on the first day you may get a general idea of what wikipedians feel. I never said I didn't want input from the fan groups, I said that if you leave the AFD that is all you get and it becomes lopsided. Relisting helps balance the AFD and ensure a proper concensus on a controversial issue. It doesn't allow a fan group to stack the discussion by posting to their project page or any other method they may use to keep inappropriate articles on the site. They're free to speak, but this IS a discussion. Any point they make I'm free to counter as that is how a discussion works. To this point as myself and others have poitned out, there hasn't been a single comment made to counter the claim of original research and unsourced opinion. The bulk of the responses have been "keep it because its been worked on hard" or "I like it". These are not valid reasons to ignore <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. As to the talk page, not the talk page of the article, the talk page of this project page. I'm not the only one who has expressed the feeling that this article is beyond saving.

<li>There is no need to repeat your views on the "controversial" nature of the article, or how fan groups are distorting the process, or "hurting" wikipedia. Essentially, it looks to me like you are trying to engage in some type of vote stacking deal by flagging an article you nominated on a daily basis on the AfD page. It is unfortunate that noms feel they have to seek new ways to game the system. Other than that, regarding this article, your opinion has been quite clear. I thank you for restating it.

<dd>I'm free to continue the discussion with whoever I choose. If I have nothing to say about someone's opinion I won't and if I do, I will. When you are dealing with groups who can sometimes contain over zealous members, sometimes you have to be diligent to ensure a process is fair. For even mentioning that I felt the article wasn't encyclopedic I was attacked on the talk page. I'm also not gaming the system, I'm ensuring a balance to prevent gaming from the other side. I'm also not the only one who feels that fan groups will post in force to muddle debates. I might be gaming the system if I was out actively posting on people's talk pages and speaking with people outside wikipedia encouraging them to come here and vote against this article but I am not. I'm simply using the system laid out to ensure a proper concensus. Maybe you look down on that because with a proper concensus the article will be removed? If you think it has merit, I might suggest you go about editing the article to remove all of the original research, conclusions and unsourced opinion. However at that point the article would likely be too small to be an article on its own and would likely be required to be merged with the Enterprise article. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:46, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My arguments and those of the others who have argued for deletion have stood on their own. And not one single person has managed to address the issue of unsourced opinion and original research in the article. Countering a person's irrelevant argument isn't a personal attack. That is called discussion. There hasn't been a single good reason to ignore the WP:OR and WP:V issues in this article. What happened at memory alpha only illustrates that this article isn't the important piece of information to the Trek community that some claim it is. Even though its completely irrelevant to the discussion if the people insisting on keep feel the need to bring it up, then something equally irrelevant can be brought up to counter that point. In 5 days all we've gotten from the keep side is "Just because" and "I like its" and "I worked really hard on it". These points thrown against WP:OR and WP:V are as relevant as saying "We should keep this article because I'm wearing blue shorts today". So if you want to continue to put forth irrelevant points and pretend they have some meaning in this context, well I don't think you get to have a monopoly on that. You were given an opportunity on the talk page to continue the discussion on the points of OR and V, and when the picture was drawn very clearly for you, you stopped talking. So I commend you for at least making the effort to actually try and defend the article and the point you tried to make, but no one has come up with a good reason for keep in the face of that, nor have they gone ahead and improved the article by removing that content even though a couple have claimed its salvageable. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:04, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It looks this article is going to go the way of the dodo. I would advise anyone who is <i>seriously</i> interested in cleaning it up (ie finding verifiable citations to all the original claims it makes) to <b>save it to their userspace</b> before it disappears. Whether someone does that and makes the necessary (drastic) changes will be the true test of whether those who have argued it should stay and merely be cleaned up are really serious about bringing it up to Wiki standards. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_L_Rattigan_f48b.html" title="User:David L Rattigan">David L Rattigan</a> 17:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: So is it OR or copyvio? If it's copyvio, then the article needs to be deleted/rebooted regardless, but I haven't seen the proof of such as claimed on Star Trek Wiki and (lately) here. If it's OR, then perhaps elements of it can be re-integrated into the Enterprise article. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 17:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The copyvio was only pertaining to the discussion on memory-alpha. He was just pointing out that they weren't interested in it even before it was discovered that it was a copy of the work from here, and considered a copyvio by them. The problem here is just the OR. If someone wanted to make a very basic and sourced list of the opposing items and include it as a section of the enterprise article (As it shouldn't be very long) that would be fine as long as it didn't turn into another bit of justifications and opinions, etc. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:59, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that is the way forward. So we would have: TOS Episode says A, notably Enterprise episode says B, without further comment. I do believe that this neutral approach can be more than a stub. As an example I will do a rewrite here of the Cloaking section:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cloaking In the episode "Balance of Terror" (TOS) Spock states that such technology had been, until then, only a theoretical possibility: "Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain — selectively bending light. But the power cost is enormous. They may have solved that. " Yet previous to this, the NX-01 encountered several races with cloaking technology, and even took possession of and used a cloaking pod from the Suliban. In the episode "Minefield" (ENT), the crew of the NX-01 encounters a Romulan ship with cloaking abilities as well as a cloaked Romulan mine field.</p>
<p>-Would we agree that there is no OR in the above passage? If so can we not do a similar job on the other sections? Thanks <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 18:30, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>clean up the usage of "several" its ambiguous it could be 3 it could be 10. The quote doesn't add anything to the paragraph it just serves to lengthen it, its already been stated what Spock said and it what episode. I'm also not sure I like the "Yet previous to this" transition. It gives the wrong tone to me. I'll think about that. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:32, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have added the new-cut down version of Cloaking (above) to the article. I respectfully submit that it contains no OR, and that if the rest of the sections were rewritten in a similar way, they would be more than a stub. If no-one else volunteers I guess I could do it - but I would need a few days. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 19:51, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You probably do have that time. THere is currently a major backlog on the AFDs, and the relisting I did actually extends the AFD. It isn't scheduled to close for another 24 hours or so, but there is a 3 or 4 day backlog beyond that. We should also consider a new name for the article, because alleged is a loaded word, and like someone mentioned perhaps this could be made into a broader article to cite all Canon contradictions between all series. Continuity Contradictions is a neutral term, it could be spiced up a little if needed as long as the tone and meaning aren't changed. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:00, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cool. Here's another attempt which I will add to the article. If others want to revert they can.</dd>

</dl>
<p>Weapon technology According to "Balance of Terror" (TOS), the Earth-Romulan War which took place around the time of ENT was fought using atomic weapons. However, the NX-01 is armed with futuristic 'phase cannons' and 'photonic torpedoes', and the Romulan ships seen in ENT have a similar armament.</p>
<p>-No OR in that, I think... (I hope) <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 20:14, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I might take out "According to" it makes it sound authoritative or correct. When writing try to make it so that you could transpose the two contradictions in the paragraph without changing how one might interpret it. Using "In" there or some derivative of that would be more appropriate. Its also unneccessary to put attention on phase cannons or photonic torpedos like that. Perhaps refer to them as energy-based weapons, everything about the series is futuristic. Something like this:</dd>

<p>Weapon Technology In "Balance of Terror" (TOS), reference is made to an Earth-Romulan War which took place around the time of ENT, it was reported to have been fought using atomic weapons. Through-out the series the NX-01 is armed with phase cannons and photonic torpedos both energy-based weapons. The romulan vessels are also similarly armed. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The last time it was put up for AfD was November. No concerns about short time spans between AfDs this time around, please.</li>
<li><i><b>Deleting this will not cause the sudden existence of multiple shit articles. This is not a merge target.</b></i></li>
<li>There is no verifiability whatsoever, and this will not improve with time.</li>
<li>Every time it has been up for AfD, there was no consensus, with many keeps relating to things irrelevant to the actual article: Pokémon Hydra fear, and time spans between AfDs that didn't satisfy some.</li>

This is a group with no albums, and the only source we have for their tour appears to be a press release/booking solicitation for the band. Previous AfD was closed early due to speedy deletion of the article; at the time, the <i>source</i> mentioned the "tour" but the article did not. However, the speedy deletion has been reversed now, but as the previous AfD was closed, we have to start over.

<li>You'd be surprised, I listen to a lot of obscure music, although not as obscure as alofoque. Bands do promos at clubs and bars all the time, doesn't mean they're notable.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The problem as I see it is in interpreting the language at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: "international concert tour." There is no guidance on what this includes and I think there needs to be based on this afd. A number of bands I have known (in college etc.)—completely non-notable in every way and which never garnered any wide fame—went on "tour," playing gigs in bars and other small venues in other countries. Does this fit the "international concert tour" standard? I think not, and it fails the 'Potter Stewart test' of notability. This is separate from the question here of whether the source of the reported tour is reliable. I would propose that we think about giving the ambiguous phrase some limiting parameters. A band that has played a few gigs in other countries but is not famous by any standard should not have a loophole claim for notability solely based on their ability to travel --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 15:17, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the contrary, I think that if a band has shown initiative to tour outside of their "home base" if you will, it shows that they're not some random guitar band. The WP:MUSIC guidelines are designed so bands with some assertion of nobility can be kept, it's not designed to keep bands and groups like this, who appear to do some actual touring in and out of their "home base." I have no clue what the "Potter Stewart test" is, though. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:26, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Their initiative is irrelevant, their actual notability is not. Likewise, WP:MUSIC guidelines are <i>not</i> designed so that bands with assertions of notability can be kept, the guidelines are an attempt to define standards for what <i>is notable</i>; assertions of notability simply take an article of the no-investigation-necessary-to-delete, speedy criteria. Potter Stewart was a U.S. Supreme Court justice best known for his opinion in an obscenity case, where he said in sum and substance that it's hard to define obscenity, but I know it when I see it. The concept has become generalized. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 15:46, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, right. Knew the case, not who said it. It's interesting to note that it was probably one of the single worst rulings ever, and I'm appalled that it's being applied here. Regardless, I think the basic standards here have been met. If you want to change the basic standard, I think it's a discussion at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, not here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:24, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You misunderstand. I'm not proposing changing the standard. I'm saying that your citation and interpretation of the words "international concert tour" is idiosyncratic and overbroad but understandable given the lack of interpretive guidance for that expression. The standard should not be changed. It should, however, be given the clarity necessary so that people don't make the mistake of thinking, at the extremes of rationalizing interpretation, that a band which plays in someone's backyard in another country has met that standard. A band that has played a series of nightclubs abroad is not, I think, what is meant by "international concert tour".--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 16:58, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How bout those that imply notability? I know, that sounds tautological. Look: Notability is not conferred by playing or not playing in certain venues but by what the type of venues played in implies about a band's importance. Things are notable because of their impact. The criteria is used not to show that things <i>are</i> notable because they meet the criteria; rather, because notability is difficult to measure, they set forth criteria that things that are notable tend to share so that we can recognize their notability. So we can't take an autocratic approach and apply standards blindly. In the case of bands, you know that booking at bars and the like is easily done by band solicitation. Filling a 30,000 seat stadium is done by invite because the band is already recognized as important by third parties. There is a middle ground between these two, and it is to that knife's edge that we have to apply some pure Potter Stewart judgment, which is why afd's on articles which are not clearly one way or the other are difficult. Here we have indicia of the band being nobodies (google lack of results, etc.), and no reliable source but an online radio write up existing in a vacuum, and what text there is doesn't give us anything but nightclubs and local appearances. We're meausuring whether the band is well known, cited, thought about, referenced, influential, groundbreaking, etc. Since playing in nightclubs doesn't help us measure this, it's a poor basis for establishing notability. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 20:53, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>well, for one, even some of the most notable local venues (for instance, I'm in the Boston area, and the Middle East is a very well known club, and is mostly booked - even by quite notable indie bands - by "band solicitiation." At some point, we simply have to recognize that the touring requirement is designed for bands that take the initiative to expand their notability as opposed to possibly using Wikipedia as a springboard. In the example of this band, however, calling a band that doesn't speak the english language and which plays a rather obscure form of reggae nobodies because we struggle to find sources we can read is a bit much. We obviously disagree on this one, and that's fine as a matter of interpretation, but I do feel you're being unnecessarily - and possibly unrealistically - strict on this one. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:58, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When I say nobody, I mean it in the sense of notability— they are nobodies the same way I am a nobody. But I think you're right, that that might have been a poorly thought out vocabulary choice. Look's like the article will be kept on no consensus anyway.

<li>An old version (if I recall correctly) of WP:WEB requested Alexa ranking better than 10,000, or a forum with over 5,000 members. The new one requires the site to be notable not according to the amount of traffic it gets, but instead the repercusion of the website in the media, giving opportunity to small sites that has been featured at different dates and for different reasons in CNN, eWeek, New York Times, and other notable publications. From what I saw, this site has a great following, but has have little repercusion in the media (at least, I couldn't find it featured anywhere). -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 01:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. To say that the Protomen have gone unnoticed by a large portion of society is an extremely ignorant statement, one which I believe would be awful for a longtime user of Wikipedia to say. As this place has been created to provide the masses with information about everything that can be documented, would it not be proper to include even the most unknown bands that exist? The Protomen, however, are by far well-known, especially when compared to the three-piece group down the street that broke up after a gig. The aforementioned publication, Nintendo Power, has been in print since 1988, and has millions of subscribers. Many start-up bands who happen to receive some attention in professional music-oriented magazines usually do not receive as much press. Furthermore, the website GameSpot.com has linked to the Protomen's website, a small piece of advertising provided by a community which receives hundreds of thousands of hits on a daily basis. As if that weren't enough, nuklearpower.com has a similarly high number of unique hits every day, and they, too, have mentioned the Protomen. On one occasion, the sheer amount of traffic that the site endured put it under, yet it was not run on a home-based server with very little bandwith; it is, in fact, hosted by a professional hosting company. Also, the band has sold out of several pressings of their albums already, which is more than some artists manage even if they are licensed by a significant label. On top of that, they have sold their albums to people all around the world, ranging from places like Japan to Sweden. Though they have not toured internationally, they have in fact toured in several different states. Therefore, I conclude that they are not in fact a simple "garage band" and do not deserve to be labeled as such, nor should their Wikipedia article be deleted. --RazMasters 11:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would agree against the requirement of needing more magazine articles under their belt. Wiki states that multiple features are needed, but does not specify a number. Two should by all rights count as multiple. Additionally, in regards to tours: the band has traveled to other states for shows, most recently to Clarksville, Indiana. As for a wider fan base, fans have traveled from literally all over the country (I happen to be from Arizona myself) to be present at their performances. The band has shipped many copies of its album overseas. Even if one might consider them to be a 'garage band', then one would have to conclude that they even more notable for being a garage band that fits these criteria.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am strongly against the deletion of this article. Two different charges have been leveled against it: That the band is not noteable enough, and that the article is a repost of a previously deleted article. First off, The Protomen are notable. As stated in the article, the band has had articles published about them in Nintendo Power, Mix Magazine, and other various publications. The concept behind the band is unique, and their popularity is growing rapidly, especially for such an independent, underground production. The main avenue for gaining new fans is the internet, and as such, they have been linked to from popular internet sites. Most importantly, they have many devoted fans and are gaining more every day. Secondly, this article is certainly not merely a repost of a previously deleted article. It is newly written. Even if it were a repost, it has been modified enough since its creation so as to disqualify this charge. This article should not be deleted; please reconsider. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimzor_c57c.html" title="User:Timzor">Timzor</a> 06:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. As if my former entry on this page were not enough, as people are stating that the band does not meet the criteria mentioned in the linked-to article, here's what they do meet: 1. "Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...)." 2. "Has been the subject of a half hour or hour broadcast on a national radio network." (They have been played on true radio stations, not simply internet stations, although they were independents.) 3. "Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above." (The Protomen have written all of their own works.) 4. "Has been the subject of a biography published as a book, or has several articles by at least 2 different authors in the peer reviewed publications." (They have been reviewed in published newspapers; even if said newspapers were independent, they were printed papers nonetheless, which were distributed to potentially hundreds of people.) 5. "Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style, technique, repertory or teaching in a particular music genre." (As mentioned in my previous post, they include: Nintendo Power magazine, GameSpot.com, NuklearPower.com, and several unmentioned independent sites.) There are five reasons alone, but the Protomen could roughly qualify under some of the others, if one were to be loose with the rules. This would not be a bad thing to do, as: "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion." And that is per the Wikipedia article on deletion itself. Therefore, I reiterate that their page does not deserve to be deleted. --RazMasters 10:04AM, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for striking out the <i>Keep</i>, as I did indeed not know that it could be counted as a second vote. As for #1, I do not understand how one could view a publication such as Nintendo Power as being trivial when few magazines published in the United States have as large of a reader base. It's in the millions, and the magazine has been in publication for nearly ten years now. People of all ages and from all over the world read it. They were not just mentioned in passing, either; the Protomen had an entire article dedicated to them in issue #201. As for the radio station information, I will get that and post it by the end of today if possible. The same goes for the reviews. RazMasters 19:35, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Perhaps The Protomen were non-notable six months ago, and perhaps even three months ago. However, after three unique waves (that I have been aware of) of rising popularity since last October, The Protomen are no longer non-notable. As mentioned, popular sites such as nuklearpowered/<a href="../../../8/_/b/8_Bit_Theatre_78bd.html" title="8 Bit Theatre">8_Bit_Theatre</a> have linked to the band, and mention has also appeared on other notable sites, including the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machinae_supremacy.html" title="Machinae supremacy">Machinae_supremacy</a> boards, at the bottom of a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamespot.html" title="Gamespot">Gamespot</a> article, and on the now-defunct cult boards at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny_Arcade</a>. In late October/early November, a number of popular videogame blogs, including <a href="../../../k/o/t/Kotaku.html" title="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>, picked up an article written for the Radio Free Internet blog about The Protomen (article available here: <a href="http://radiofreeinternet.imjasonh.com/index.php/archives/2005/11/08/89/" class="external free" title="http://radiofreeinternet.imjasonh.com/index.php/archives/2005/11/08/89/" rel="nofollow">http://radiofreeinternet.imjasonh.com/index.php/archives/2005/11/08/89/</a> ). In addition, dozens of independent blogs across the country have made posts proclaiming the strength of the message that The Protomen present through their music. Some fans were so-compelled to see the band live this past April that they traveled more than five hundred miles to Nashville for their first live show post-Internet-celebrity. I am one such person, having driven just over one thousand miles round-trip from Chicago. Of course, such factors are personal; apparently, via the wiki music guidelines, even the strongest up-and-coming bands are doomed for deletion until some arbitrary numeric popularity is achieved (via some common form media representation, regardless of community support). At the very least, as a Chicago native, I wonder how Chicago-local band <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Circles_bc9f.html" title="Russian Circles">Russian Circles</a>, acknowledging they play excellent music, can obtain secure wiki status where The Protomen must fight (indeed, in accord with the quick-sniping tone of most delete votes) even though, as I have personally seen, The Protomen have a wider worldwide following (though more scattered), and a more important message--though, again, personal feelings seem to sway little here. As far as traditional evidence: I have sent a scan of the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Power_90d1.html" title="Nintendo Power">Nintendo Power</a> article to RazMasters (who mentioned intention of acquiring the article to subsequently post) as proof of this article's existence. I also submit a link to a recording of the local-channel broadcast that was previously mentioned, which can be found here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4B8te4gu4Q" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4B8te4gu4Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4B8te4gu4Q</a> which is still a recording of a local program, but I have trouble seeing how the continuous viral-media-style spread of The Protomen's popularity, at this point, fails to constitute notability. The Protomen have defined a new genre, achieved a following that has been producing a wide variety of fan-art since January, and have sold out of copies of their album at least twice since October. In the sad event this community does, in fact, decide The Protomen have yet to achieve their popularity at this point, all who are posting for deletion should be aware that they will attain notability eventually--and probably sooner than later, with a wave of shows being planned for this coming October.Rohsiph 00:14, 17 June 2006 (UTC) <small>User's first edit</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the full page article in Nintendo Power was enough alone to justify notability. Everyone needs to realize that those of us whom know of this band live in separate states and even countries because of the media and press this band has received recently. You can shoot down two of our sources if you'd like, but theres still all the other sources that are featured right here in Wikipedia and we only need one of them to prove notability. I also have to disagree with you on the Mix Magazine article, there was quite a bit of information available about The Protomen, enough to get another bunch of fans anyway. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraxis_e156.html" title="User:Draxis">Draxis</a> 12:37, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If you've simply stated that the article seems to be entirely about the university, does that mean you haven't read it in its entirety? The article opens (as many do) by leading the reader to their destination, which is a meeting with the Protomen. Also, you've cited the Mix Magazine as an example, but have neglected to mention the worldwide press that it proffers; additionally, by not commenting on the Nintendo Power article, you seem to be ignoring that as well. As aforementioned, Nintendo Power has millions of readers all over the world. Mix Magazine is published in dozens of countries. How much "stronger" must their evidence be? It does meet the requirements of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and we have explained why. Outside of people voicing their personal opinion, I have seen no one manage to effectively counter what's been said in the Protomen's favor. (And as for the radio station mentioned, it is also broadcast live over the internet, meaning that its potential listener base is limited only by what their servers can allow.)

I do not believe you can dismiss the five paragraph read on the band as being trivial, given it is giving the band high praise and includes a picture as well as a fairly lengthy read in and of itself. Combined that with very large and notable online sources (including, but not limited to gamespot, penny-arcade, and others) spreading the word of the band and what you have is alot of publicity that the band itself did not attempt to generate. It is through these sources that almost all of us have found The Protomen (from all around the world) and many more will no doubt continue to do so. I could see how all this could be dismissed if it were mere advertisements created by the band itself, but that is most certainly not the case. I believe this bands popularlity and non-self generated coverage is being sorely underestimated. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraxis_e156.html" title="User:Draxis">Draxis</a> 16:54, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Having been watching this discussion for some time, i decided to look over the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> criteria and I feel that they have met the following: Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media ((as was verified by the Nintendo Power and Mix Mag articles)), Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style, technique, repertory or teaching in a particular music genre. ((While im not sure if this can be verified, they have become quite reputable for their style in the articles that mention them, so i apologize if this does not fit for them)) Scathien</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> He's pretty much just repeated what the rest of us have been saying. I still strongly feel both of those criteria have been met. While you can argue the later, I don't believe it can be argued at this point that they have been featured in multiple non-trivial publications. This next statement is not directed at Wicke, it's in general: I have seen no valid argument beyond linking to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> or claims of sockpuppetry. This is not a vote, anyone whom is a sockpuppet is irrelevant. Our defense supported by facts has been presented. I have not seen a single person provide any compelling argument as to why these two criteria (among other things that would prove notability) are not legitimate and honestly I don't think that's going to happen given the strength of the "multiple non-trivial publications" argument. People can continue to point fingers at sockpuppets, they can continue to link to the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> but the fact remains we have provided factual resources and proof; these are the things that must be defeated, not each individual user in this debate.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Doesn't meet notability requirements, and it bothers me how thin and almost deceptive RazMaster's evidence is. The Mix Magazine article isn't even about The Protomen; they're just mentioned in passing. Sorry, RazMasters, I understand that you're a fan and you're trying to slip this one by in any way you possibly can, but I've looked at the evidence and this is not notable. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 13:25, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The entire last five paragraphs are about The Protomen. Panther &amp; McDonald are members of the band. Please review the article and reconsider your statement. There is also a full page spread article above on the band from <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Power_90d1.html" title="Nintendo Power">Nintendo Power</a> and links to other notable internet-based media and press sites. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraxis_e156.html" title="User:Draxis">Draxis</a> 13:48, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Please review my above comments. You have still given NO indication of either why the Mix Magazine article is trivial in your opinion (given five paragraphs about the band, they seem pretty featured in an article to me) nor any inclusion of the other sources we have confirmed and presented here in this debate. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraxis_e156.html" title="User:Draxis">Draxis</a> 20:09, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't have to defend myself to you. I feel that a five-paragraph blurb is trivial, and non-trivial coverage would consist of two or three pages. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> does not say "Has had more than 250 words written about it in reliable and reputable media," so I have the right to my own interpretation of non-trivial coverage. Similarly, the Nintendo Power coverage seems bordering on trivial, as well as bordering on non-reliable/reputable media. It's not a reputable music publication, it's the mouthpiece of a video game company giving one-page coverage to a band that writes songs about one of their games. Don't get me started on how you guys feel being played on a 100 watt college radio station is an assertion of notability. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 20:16, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though I can respect your arguments on the physical articles to an extent (noting I wonder how any highly meaningful and unique, yet unpopular example of anything could every meet the guidelines based on what I understand of your interpretations, which I state because of what I understand as the purpose of Wikipedia as collecting meaningful information in a free, easy-to-access source), you are still ignoring a plethora of evidence for notability from Internet sources, both notable (to the point of having pages on Wikipedia), and trivial. If it really is part of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines to ignore all such articles, which there is a clearly-stated exlusion for the trivial examples but none (that I see) for the notable sites, I have to ponder the irony of Wikipedia itself as a database proliferated via the Internet.

<dd>WP:NOT a soapbox for launching your video game project. It goes the other way around, my friend: you have to be well-known to have a page here. You can't make the article and hope that the article will bring you enough links to make your project well-known. That just doesn't make sense. And this wiki has nothing to do with prediction. That's quite correct, and means that we can't predict anything about this video game.

<p>The Wikipedia subtitle is "The Free Encyclopedia". One, it doesn't cost money, and two...it's supposed to be free, meaning that as long as an article is not illegal, flaming, or incorrect, it deserves a place on wikipedia. This article is not an advertisment, we are a legitimate movement, and alot of work has been done on Custom Wars. As I said above, it deserves some recognition, not just people deleting it because "it doesn't have signifigant press coverage" This is supposed to be a free (meaing freedom) encyclopedia. Therefore, things that don't have much press coverage should be able to get in. Deleting something because it isn't well known is against the spirit, in my opinion, of wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Davidhowland14 (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidhowland14_66f8.html" title="User talk:Davidhowland14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Davidhowland14_a51c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Davidhowland14">contribs</a>) 19:08, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Vapor So Far = Not Yet Article. Welcome back when there's a "people actually <i>play</i> this" kind of release out. I'd be more willing to vote keep on games that are "near beta" and are either commercially developed or open source; commercial games have $om€ £€v€rag€ that $hou£d h€£p, and OSS games can at least be forked by people who care in case original devs quit... but regrettably, closed-group fan projects have an annoying tendency to go forward at snail's pace and rarely actually materialise. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:37, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello, I'm fox. I'm in charge of CW, and I'd like to explain something to you who vote for delete. Advance Wars, the game that this is based off of, is a popular game. It has a fairly large community of websites and forums, most of which contain thousands of members. This, Custom Wars, is going to be the biggest thing in the AW community that has ever happened. It will be mentioned everywhere, and I see no reason why you shouldn't consider that noteworthy. If we fail to gain the attention I expect, I will personally delete or have deleted, the article. However, if you wish to delete it before then, then being the next couple of days, I would think of it as prejudice against a whole gaming community.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. FreeLance Fox has said the magic words: "This, Custom Wars, <b>is going to be</b> the biggest thing in the AW community that has ever happened. It <b>will be</b> mentioned everywhere..." I admire your confidence, and I encourage you to work towards that vision. But notability is evaluated as of <i>now</i>.

<li>I'll give you that, it's true, it hasn't been released YET. However, within a few hours it will be. Note that I was told nothing goes in wikipedia that is in the future unless you're SURE it will happen. And... I can't be positive, but I'm 95% sure. If you guys can extend the deletion warning for 2 days I'll keep my word. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreeLance_FoX_d736.html" title="User:FreeLance FoX">FreeLance FoX</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreeLance_FoX_42d4.html" title="User talk:FreeLance FoX">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FreeLance_FoX_2ba6.html" title="Special:Contributions/FreeLance FoX">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>Not encyclopedic details about current tricks in an unimportant business in a country with comparatively weak service sector <i>(reworded here because the original formulation caused misunderstanding, sorry --<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 13:27, 16 June 2006 (UTC))</i>.

<dl>
<dd>OK, I'll try to explain: <i>What on earth makes Pakistan a not-so-much-important country?</i> Pakistan is an important country in some aspects; but in the event mgmt, leading countries are somewhere else. The turnover of the business in Pakistan is AFAIK comparably small and its world influence is negligible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Please explain why an article on 'janitory services in the USA' would be deemed more useful/notable?</i> You do not understand me well. I think that that article would be not encyclopedic as well. It is not reasonable to have here articles about all businesses in all regions, I think. We must select the important ones, in order to ensure enough knowledgeable editors to maintain the articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>If Event management is an 'unimportant business', please enlighten us as to what is an important business?</i> The rule about important businesses can be derived from <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. If there is at least one company important enough to fulfill <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, then the business can be regarded as important. Or at least if all companies in the business, taken together, are important enough to fall under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, then we can discuss about it. But I fear that all companies in this business in Pakistan, taken together, are not important enough to match this - at least the article does not indicate it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Finally, do *you* know anything about 'Event Management in Pakistan'?</i> Please, be not personal. The question of my knowledge is irrelevant here. We should discuss what to do with the article, not try to examine other users.

<li><b>Delete</b>, this appears to be an unnecessary fork in a way. What makes <i>Event Management in Pakistan</i> conceptually different than <i>Event Management</i> in any other country? If this article somehow laid out a strong case that Event Managment in Pakistan comprised a set of unique cirmcumstances that did not apply to Event Management anywhere else in the world I might be persuaded to opine Keep, but that does not appear to be the case. The only difference is that the examples are localized (names of companies, costs of certain services, etc.)... taking those out, this could refer to Event Management anywhere, thus this article is too narrowly focused. Also, content in several places seems to violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a how-to guide.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> (but moved to Event management in Pakistan). Why wouldn't we keep Event management in the United States or anywhere else? I don't think <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is the standard for judging an industry -- it's not the individual businesses that are important, but how things are done. Is there really nothing important to say about how event management procedures are handled differently in different countries, and how it came to be that way? There could be interesting details about national culture or history revealed by such an article. Because of that, it's irrelevant how well-known the country is for event management. (In fact, event management in the least-developed country might be the most interesting article.) That said, this article does a poor job of it, and I don't know how easily it can be made into something much better. Step one would be get rid of all the redundancy with <a href="../../../e/v/e/Event_management.html" title="Event management">event management</a> in general; unfortunately, that's most of the article.

<li>I too have heard of this party, its ideology and its attempt to make its mark on the Australian political scene. Currently its membership consists of its founders and other young adults with a vision of the type of "Australia" they wish to live in.I believe that we should be fostering the ideals of our young who will be our leaders of tomorrow. The article is to be commended and "The Party" though in it's infancy encouraged. I dont profess to know all the poloicies and protocols of Wikapedia though I have always thought it was to make available information to others and sharing accurate information about the everchanging political scene is sharing information. Others mention that this party is not yet registered though author of the article clearly sets out it's intention to do so. Do we restrict articles just to estabished identities so to speak whilst minimising the ability of others to conceptualise?

I have not finished the article, which is why it does not have information. I agree that he this character plays a minor role but there are several characters in the bleach section who play even less of a role (for instance the 1st squads lieutenant). I believe wiki should have info on as many characters as possible which is why I added this character and I will continue to add new characters such as Rupee, Kuukaku, etc. -Thundercock</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. when i made grimmjow, shawlong, edorad and ill forte i left out d roy and nakiem for a reason...we saw little to nothing from them. no released states, none of their VERY SHORT fights were interesting, and they lack charisma. they had all of ten seconds of time, i can stretch il forte into an article but i don't think d-roy has anything worth its own article. even if i tried to stretch it i'd get a good paragraph at most, its not that wiki shouldn't have as many anime character articles as possible, it's just that d roy doesn't have enough to make an article. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimjaw_e4de.html" title="User:Grimjaw">grimjaw</a> 18:15, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. In my opinion, that was no need to make this article, but if it is already done, why not? At least we know more about him than we know about Sasakibe Chojiro (I'm not suggesting the deletion of Sasakibe's article, once we can still discover more about him... as much as Dee Roy). - <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccess_Timeco_62f9.html" title="User:Access Timeco">Access Timeco</a> 15:46, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I would also nominate the Sasakibe article if there was no potential for expansion. However, who knows, he may play an important part in the story in the future. Dee Roy, on the other hand, is dead for good (in fact, completely disintegrated) so the little information that exists is all we will ever have.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I added something there now, maybe it's worth. But, I said in the very article, what was added is not 100% official. Well, about not having more informations about him, I wouldn't be sure. We still have Grimmjow's flashbacks and, who knows, the present! Remember that Hollows don't die (again) after being destroyed by a zanpakuto, they're puriffied and sent to Soul Society. So I think there is still a little chance we know more about Dee Roy. - <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccess_Timeco_62f9.html" title="User:Access Timeco">Access Timeco</a> 16:20, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"University of Florida recently recognized Gary R. Gerson, by naming its business school’s new accounting hall in his honor. The firm described Gerson Hall as a three-story, 36,000-square-food structure—the largest freestanding accounting school in the country. It opened in Spring 2004."</p>
<p>I think that says it all.

<li>Looking at some articles, it appears that it is named after him, however, I'm getting a vibe from the articles that it was named after him because he donated a lot of money.

I don't know whether this makes him notable enough or not. I note that the other people who were admitted were notable but I don't know whether Gerson was. He certainly shouldn't be speedied.

<p>With all due respect, Brad does <i>wonderful</i> work for Wikipedia - however, I don't think he is notable enough in a typical encyclopedic sense to warrant an article. At minimum, I think merging the content to another page about Wikipedia would be a good compromise, but at the moment, my inclination is to delete. It is analogous to a bibliography of a respected citizen associated with a respectable corporation, but nonetheless, this particular case inclines on the side of being not notable. I would like to encourage some thoughtfulness in this AfD - granted, if the page ends up being deleted, it does not mean that it cannot be recreated later - it simply means that the current form of the article is suggesting that, say, for example, there isn't quite enough public, easily accessible material to write about the subject. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 13:35, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I tend to disagree. I realise that they all can't be completely verified, but they <u>do</u> add to the article on Muse and make it more complete. To not add anything about them, in my opinion, would be wrong.<br />
I didn't add the page because Muse are <i>special</i> and deserve to have it. I merely added it for completeness and as a seperate page so that it would not get in the way of the main article. Also, it's the only band where I can contribute information about the promotional stock. I would encourage information on other bands' promos to also be started.<br />
If lots of people disagree, then fair enough delete it. If not, then it should be kept and added to.<br />

<li><b>Delete</b>, This one could be argued either way, but at least in my opinion, promotional releases should not be included here as they are not really part of an artist's discography per se. The exception to this in my mind would be if a group released a promo that contained songs or versions of songs that were not available commercially, so the only release of said song was on the promo. I don't know if this has ever happened, but in that case I think the promo would obviously be sought after by collectors/fans of that band. To be fair, I am not overly familiar with Muse and a cursory check didn't seem to indicate the latter situation existed on any of these promo releases, but if it does, I would suggest the album in question get it's own article linked back to the main Muse article. The rest of the selections (particularly those that are not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> should be deleted along with this page.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Cool, fair enough, I'll agree then. Some of the promos/EP's have different versions of the songs, but I guess they can be mentioned in passing somewhere else.

<li><b>Comment</b> my opinion is but one view of it, so I wouldn't start digging a grave for this article just yet... but my personal opinion is that you could definitely justify an individual article for any promo EP with song versions not avaible on their commercial releases (like I said, I don't know enough about Muse to know which promo's would have these) and then link these articles back to the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muse_%28band%29.html" title="Muse (band)">Muse (band)</a> article. Another thought... you could just <b>boldly</b> merge this whole section into <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muse_%28band%29.html#Discography" title="Muse (band)">Muse (band)#Discography</a> in a separate section after studio albums.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I didn't start this article but I wrote some words there. The word Lusophobia is used and has a meaning. In Portuguese it is <i>Lusofobia</i> and expresses hostility toward Portugal or the Portuguese language. It is like <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophobia.html" title="Anglophobia">Anglophobia</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeophobia.html" title="Judeophobia">Judeophobia</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russophobia.html" title="Russophobia">Russophobia</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">Serbophobia</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - If we have articles like anglophobia or russophobia, lusophobia is also notable. It's true that it seems like original research, but only because it is unreferenced, despite that, it contains valid content. I think we should contact the user who wrote the article and ask him for the references, instead of just deleting the article. If he can't indicate the source, then we could delete it. <a href="../../../a/f/o/User%7EAfonso_Silva_8531.html" title="User:Afonso Silva">Afonso Silva</a> 17:59, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I've added a reference to the use of the term in a Brazilian context <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/hispanic_american_historical_review/v080/80.4mosher.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/hispanic_american_historical_review/v080/80.4mosher.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> - perhaps it might be more appropriate for an article to be put on the Portuguese language Wikipedia. I thought that the link to the Geoffrey Hull article covered its use in the context of East Timor and Australia would have sufficed (although virtually nobody in Australia apart from him would know what the term means). However, I admit that the term in this context is more tendentious, which is why I've removed the sentences about language, and Paul Keating <i>did</i> use those words about Portugal. Nevertheless, the term and the concept Lusophobia certainly did exist in 19th century Brazil.

<li><b>Delete</b> it is a non-argument to say that we need a list because articles that could potentially fall within the category have not been created. We do not need to have placeholders for every thing and entity that might get an article. They can be added to the category as they are created by people who are interested, and if they are unlikely to be created, it saves on waste of space collections of red links.

<p>I honestly don't feel either way. I would like to see what Wikipedians think about articles such as those. One can argue that Wikipedia is not a indiscriminate collection of information, and that this is complete listcruft. Otherwise, one can argue that this is simply a very, very long list of references and sources. I want to see some consensus and arguments before deciding myself. <b>Abstain</b> for now. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe"><small><b>'</b></small></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/p/o/User_talk%7EApostrophe_d228.html" title="User talk:Apostrophe">Feeling chatty?</a> ) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Apostrophe_7a7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Apostrophe">Edits!</a>)</sup> 15:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Delete, the publisher can record and present this type of bibliography on its site if they so choose. While this seems comprehensive, it is highly unlikely it would ever be kept up for years to come (beyond points already made).<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 18:49, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hummm... Well, I started this thing for three reasons: 1) I wanted to contribute in some way, 2) I am often annoyed that I cant find a good bibliography of a particular villian so that I can pick and choose what comics I want to get, and 3) It seemed like a good, informative idea at the time. I suppose this page could be (in a way) considered a reference page for all of the information in the main article. But, if it's just useless, well, then there's no use in it staying. =) --Kelly Chartier 01:56, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't agree that the information within these articles is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate</a>. None of the examples listed are pertinent and I don't think that these bibliographies violate the spirit of the policy. Morever, as stated in <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="meta:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wiki is not paper</a>, there is no reason why there shouldn't be an article for every Simpsons character and a table listing every episode. As such, I see no reason why there shouldn't be a complete bibliography for these prominent members of Batman's rogues gallery. As for the argument that upkeep would be a problem, I don't agree. With the exception of Catwoman, none of these characters is featured in a monthly series. While I would agree that trying to maintain a catalog of every appearance by Superman, Batman, or Spider-Man is a fool's errand, those are special cases (and if some fool volunteers, I won't stop him). However, on average, I don't anticipate that there will be more than one or two new issues to add to these lists each month. This is easily managable. Also, as far as whether the publisher chooses to create a similar bibliography, I don't think that's relevant. Either this information does belong on Wikipedia or it doesn't. This is my vote to say that it does. GentlemanGhost 03:50, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Mild Delete</b> I'm pro merging them into pages, but ... it's a list and I'm not sure it serves good purpose. An argument could be made that 'Villain Appearances' might be encyclopedic, but I'm leaning to no. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 06:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just thought I'd put my two cents in about merging: I don't think it should be done for continuous characters. For smaller characters, merging the bibliography with the article will be fine, but for a bigger character the bibliography will be too big and the article will look like crap. I made this mistake and people hated it. --Kelly Chartier 20:40, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> These bibliographies were apparently split from their source articles due to length. As these bibliographies help to establish verifiability of the source articles and provide useful references for research, I highly recommend they be kept. Actually, if possible, I'd recommend similar bibliographies for other characters from comic books and other fictional sources for the purposes of verifiability and research use. - <a href="../../../c/n/i/User%7ECNichols_7db0.html" title="User:CNichols">CNichols</a> 04:10, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I see no harm in keeping them up. They're handy referances and I have fun contributing to them. I'd also like to work on other characters. --GORE-ILLA 00:02, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> All of these characters are major popular-culture icons with considerable mainstream recognition beyond comics fandom, and all have had their own books seperate from the main Batman/Detective Comics series. I wouldn't like to see this same level of detail for just any random character, but for the likes of Joker, Penguin, Two-Face, and Catwoman it seems reasonable enough. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 23:03, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Well, my response is a given, but I thought I should put in an argument: personally, I would love to simply have a link to a website that has a bibliography that is complete. But there is no such thing. And, if there were, it would rely on the webmaster to update the bibliography. Since everyone can contribute to these bibliographies, chances are that the bibliographies would be the most complete. Which is very nice for collectors or researchers. --Kelly Chartier 05:46, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"University Teaching Fellow" usually means that the academic has been given an award/title/position as an exceptional teacher of students/or as a lecturer. Its used in the US too, and in fact may be an import into the UK.

<li><b>Keep</b> or add every park to the Paris article. Since that would make the Paris article too long, simply keep. Lists are a valuable way to organize information separate from the main article but easily accessible. They are different from categories in the flexibility they offer for organization and annotation, and the ability to contain things that aren't articles yet. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 11:50, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Although it's true that an encyclopedia is not just a list of information, lists have their place even in a well-organized encyclopedia. Fg2 makes a brief, but powerful defense of lists, provided that they give flexibility, organization and accessibility. I'd also say that their utlity extends beyond articles that aren't yet written to include the connections they make among those that have been written. We don't want -cruft, but neither do we want to automatically delete any list and list-like article. Does this page show that it is more than just a collection of information? Yes. It has organization in it and thought behind it. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 02:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. After defending the list of parks in Paris (above), I find that I can't defend this list. The page on Paris did more than simply list parks or group them geographically. It organized them thematically in four groups: woodlands, parks, gardens squares. This article doesn't do that. The only organization it has is geographic and, while that's obvious an obvious way to group fie stations, it also means there isn't sufficient thought behind it for an encyclopdia article. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 02:46, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>1. Donna &amp; Tom are NOT Avago presenters, they are merely linked to it.<br />
2. The album demos can be heard via myspace - it is of parodies, and covers. Perfectly viable.<br />
3. Dmn (aka Madison) has a personal vendetta against me as a user - so I think that he should be disabled for marking my pages for deletion.<br />
4. Also - whoever said neither of us are 18 yet, rubbish. Are you bad at Maths? Donna is 18, and 19 in November, and Tom is 18 in July. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelterSkelter88_9026.html" title="User:HelterSkelter88">HelterSkelter88</a> 23:34, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> HelterSkelter, I have absolutely no opinion of you whatsoever (I'm sure you're a fine person), and I certainly don't have a vendetta against you. With that said, this article is vanity. These people (you and your friend) are completely non-notable. Having an album on MySpace couldn't possibly mean less- I could very easily record some crap, put it on MySpace, and then write a WP article on myself claiming notability because I'm on MySpace. Because the article is vanity, it's also POV. But above all else, this will be deleted simply because the subject is, in Wikipedia terms, highly insignificant. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:52, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not true! The article cites important references to show that the blog is more than a vanity blog or diary and in fact a respected source of news and analysis about China's rise--arguably, the most important news story of our time. China Confidential is a sign of the growing influence and reach of blogs that help to shape opinion and influence mainstream media coverage. Aside from possible racism--discrimination against Chinese--there is no apparent reason for delting this entry.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by AndrePachter (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrePachter_ecc8.html" title="User talk:AndrePachter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AndrePachter_e954.html" title="Special:Contributions/AndrePachter">contribs</a>) 20:30 (UTRC), 16 June 2006.</small></li>

<li>Vanity page? Non-notable blog? There are nearly 700 articles in the archives. Take time to search via the internal search engine, using key words such as Taiwan; military buildup; rural unrest; human rights; Nigeria; Congo; Peru; oil; diplomacy; urban underclass, etc. Another example of why the non-notable criticism is deeply offensive and plain wrong: China Confidential recently broke a story about a crackdown on foreign law firms operating in China. Within a few hours, The Wall Street Journal Law blog referenced, quoted and linked to the article, copying the China Confidential headline almost word for word. Four days later, the Associated Press and Interfax picked up the story.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by AndrePachter (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrePachter_ecc8.html" title="User talk:AndrePachter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AndrePachter_e954.html" title="Special:Contributions/AndrePachter">contribs</a>) 21:13 (UTC), 16 June 2006.</small></li>

OK. For some reason alabamaracistboy who hates chinese has targeted this news site, which has published as a daily blog since April 2005. If any of you idiots had bothered to search properly you would go to technorati and find over 200 links to China Confidential articles. You would also note that the Wall Street Journal blog is akin to a newspaper column--or is that not notable enough for a Wikipedian? You would also read carefully and find that AP and Interfax ran the law firm crackdown story four days after China Confidential broke it, but failed to credit China Confidential by name, which is typical for wire services. The point is, China Confidential is an internationally respected source of news and analysis and indicative of the blogging phenomenon. Or is the wiki phenom all that counts in your insular, sick world? Go to China Digital Times and search China Confidential. Go to Global Voices Online and search China Confidential. Go to China Law Blog and search China Confidential. Go to Technorati--specifically, to the US-China Relations tag--and you will find that China Confidential has dominated the discussion with up-to-the-minute news and analysis.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> Racism is a serious accusation, Andre. Please explain yourself.

<li>Racism is unfortunately as American as apple pie--and tragically international. Though our site is assisted and accessed by people who every day struggle against China's authoritarian system, we are painfully aware of the double standard that seems to exist for Chinese companies, websites, individuals who dare to assert themselves. Are we hypersensitive? You bet. Perhaps your Wikipedia has an article about discrimination against Chinese immigrants in US history. What are we to think when we are targeted in this manner? China Confidential is legitimate, nonprofit, non-vanity daily blog offering up-to-the-minute news and analysis regarding China's rise--perhaps the most important story of our time. The entry that alabamaboy is apparently determined to delete is non-promotional. We did not even link to the blog because we were afraid it was too aggressive (for Chinese who don't know their place). The article is factual. And it places the blog in the context of a global phenomenon that is transforming the Internet--again--as well as journalism and politics. The very fact that China Confidential--which is published, edited and written under pen names to protect certain sources and preserve freedom of travel--can achieve the audience and recognition it has speaks volumes about the credibility and appeal of its content. The editor was in fact interviewed on the BBC, which linked to China Confidential, on the day of the White House summit. And China Confidential's "bloggertorial" about the diplomatic disaster was referenced, reprinted, hyperlinked around the world. But ... we are just a Chinese vanity operation in your view.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by AndrePachter (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrePachter_ecc8.html" title="User talk:AndrePachter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AndrePachter_e954.html" title="Special:Contributions/AndrePachter">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the blog appears to meet the notability criteria we would normally use to assess blogs. The article does need a serious cleanup, to be sure, and the behavior of whoever is here advocating it is nothing short of abusive, of course.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>--The subject of the article seems to meet the notability requirements. The article itself is very unencyclopedic and needs serious wikifying.

<li>We agree and again apologize to all concerned. Please understand: sometimes, when one is involved in a struggle--and it is a struggle to maintain our unpaid network and adhere to our commitment to daily reporting and analysis--there is an unfortunate tendency to treat even legitimate criticism as condemnation. The content of our blog, however, does not reflect our response to perceived insults here (the business about vanity and non-notable blog). Though published under pen names, the content, while deliberately opinionated and at times somewhat sensationalist, is compelling and credible. We have build an audience on this basis alone. Naturally, we like to think this reflects positively on our work. But it also highlights the power of the Internet and the ways in which two converging technologies--blogging and broadband--are truly transforming the medium and the news and information businesses. Perhaps this is why the powers-that-be in China--who have blocked our blog--along with countless others--so fear the phenomenon. So ... thank you for your patience. Please try to include an entry about China Confidential. We are small but still significant--and frankly notable. All we care about is accuracy and fairness.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by AndrePachter (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrePachter_ecc8.html" title="User talk:AndrePachter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AndrePachter_e954.html" title="Special:Contributions/AndrePachter">contribs</a>) 17 June 2006.</small></li>

<dd>Note from Alabamaboy: I'm not going to respond to the comments about me being racist and such (which, to anyone who knows me, would be laughable). What the article's editors should know is that I originally speedy deleted this article as nonnotable and a possible vanity article because of the zero backward links to the site using the Google search tool. When the article was recreated, I brought it to the larger deletion forum so people could comment on the proposed deletion and see if the consensus agreed to delete the article. I should still note that it is against Wikipedia policy to have the creators of a site create an article about their site on Wikipedia (that is the nature of a vanity article here). Wikipedia does not exist to promote anything, no matter if the item being promoted is a blog which (as in this case) appears to be doing very good work.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 18:27, 19 June 2006 (UTC) Thank you for the note. We sincerely apologize to you. We made no effort to hide the fact that we ourselves contributed the article and did not know this was frowned upon. But ... we could easily have contributed the piece under a different name. Instead, we made no effort to hide our involvement because we saw nothing wrong with it. Nor do we have any attachment to what we wrote. We frankly find it difficult to write in the encyclopedia style--it's not our thing. We simply want to be included, feel that China Confidential is important enough to rate mention. Rather than reach out now to a friend to rewrite the piece, which we could easily do, we preferred to leave it for consideration and editing by others. However, we are open to suggestions and advice.-Andre Pachter</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Is anyone else really worried about what direction this page could EVER go? Andre seems very defensive, to the point of calling people racist. I worry about how encyclopedic and fair the WP article on China Confidential will be. And I'd like to see citations on all the statistics and claims made in the article. Is there someway we would put this AfD on hold for a month and see whether the rhetoric can be toned down? <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanet13_ca5f.html" title="User:Janet13">Janet13</a> 05:29, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Lists are a valuable way to organize information separate from the main article but easily accessible. They are different from categories in the flexibility they offer for organization and annotation, and the ability to contain things that aren't articles yet. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 11:56, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> It might be useful for the red-links, but a single article to list every rail-station on the planet?

<li><b>Keep</b> but reorganize. For countries that have their own lists, the only entry in this article should be a link to the list (e.g. India). For countries that do not have their own lists, people can add stations to this article, and when there are enough, or someone's interested, they can move the content to a list for the country. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 11:56, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. The problem with this list is that it is so incomplete as to be useless. Nothing for Africa, Middle East or South America. Some countries have a link to a national list whereas others have a small number of their major stations listed. I understand the argument that perhaps this list could be fixed. Realistically, however, it never will be and probably cannot. There are a couple of other considerations. Firstly would anyone ever use it? I doubt it - they are far more likley to go to the national article. Secondly such an incomplete list like this will adversely affect the reputation of WP. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 18:14, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but reorganise. I am all for railway station lists e.g. my work on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_South_East_Queensland_railway_stations_c468.html" title="List of South East Queensland railway stations">List of South East Queensland railway stations</a>. However, a world-wide one (I would even say a national one too, unless it is a smaller country) is just plain silly. There are far too many. Further, does this include passenger rail, metros, monorails, light rail, freight, underground postal railways, &amp;c &amp;c? The proper format for this page is found at the bottom, where it gives internal links to the lists for each Australian jurisdiction. This would be a good page to find the right jurisdictions and then find the railway station, not just a global search. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 20:59, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Categorize</b>. I've never seen this as a recommendation (in my 2 weeks on AfD discussions), so let me explain. Often I think the purpose behind these lists would be better served with the creation of a Wiki category. Two common criticisms of such lists are contradictory: 1) They don't include everything, so therefore they're incomplete and arbitrary OR 2) They include everythere, so therefore they'e indiscriminate collections. The addition of Wiki categoris might solve this problem: they make it possible to link articles without setting up a separate article-as-list. I'd suggest a uniform style: "Railroads in X." It would then be possible to have a supra-category "Railroads By Geographic Area" and include on that page the many separate "Railroads in X" categories. Go <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#How_to_create_categories" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">here</a> for instructions on how to make a category. Is this an acceptable Wiki solution? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 21:23, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep:</b> Contents is WP:V, NPOV and notable. List is useful for those who are interesting in learning more about the subject. Having similar lists for other top-40 markets would be a good idea actually. The list does have more information then the category has, and it is OK that the info is partly redundant to the template.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>comment/inquiry</b>. Lots of lists get nominated for deletion. Today, on the discussion about railway lists I suggested the use of categories rather than lists. However, I notice that this list seems to get a less hostile reception than others (raiways, cemeteries, Disney characters' names in other languages, Harry Potter characters' names in other languages). Could someone explain to an AfD-newbie (me) why this is? I am a list-maker and list-user and generally have an approach to lists that is more inclusionist, "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>" than that of many other Wiki-editors.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> I would argue that there is no claim of notability in the article. For the record, I'm also an associate producer on The 1 Second Film, thanks to my $2.22 donation, and I think everyone should be a part of it.

<li>I only created an account to stress my point. I've seen this guy doing stand-up in Manchester alongside Steve Coogan (who stated quite clearly that at the age of 19 he is already a major comedy talent). I can see your Crystal ball argument but the fact remains that Tobias Cunningham is already notable in the respect that I've just mentioned.--Anxious14 01:12, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete and Comment</b> It's not an argument. It's a statement. And already notable in the respect that you just mentioned?

Maybe what I'm saying is only a statement but what about what you are saying? Is that not a statement by you saying that you don't know who this guy is? I think so.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The info sounds entirely plausible but given the near non-notability of the person, the author really has to give some citations or verification. Without that, it's impossible to judge the veracity. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 22:24, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Trefor Jones' <i>The Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who</i> is probably as accurate as a stat book can be. The book references Football Association records, club records, various libraries and record offices, the details of various other club statisticians. No Cashmore is listed, thus we can say with 99.9% certainty that no such player played for Watford. So, with the various details of Dennis' life all non-notable, the only possible reason for a keep is the claim that he helped design Watford's Family Enclosure. I checked Oliver Phillips' official history, and the chapter on 1982-87 contains a single mention of a "new family enclosure in 1982." Still, whether Dennis designed it or not, that's not really a justification for keeping the article.<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornetMike_bb8b.html" title="User:HornetMike">HornetMike</a> 22:25, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Thanks for your messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can assure you that "this person" is certainly not a hoax, and I am just glad that his family have not seen this.</p>
<p>I am not sure why Denis is not listed in the current Who's Who, as he has been in previous editions. In fact Trefor Jones is actually related to Denis (his nephew), as his mother was Denis's sister. You can verify this be contacting Trefor Jones direct, or via the archives at either the Watford Museum or Watford Football Club.</p>
<p>Would it help if I can get a copy of a Watford football programme showing Denis? I understand why you have to be vigilant on which articles you include, but I can assure you that the information is 100% accurate. Moreover, would it be useful to get Trefor to write a corroborating letter, or have some input?</p>
<p>I actually represent Denis's grandson Ian Cashmore (Trefor would be his great uncle) for his tv and radio work, and he has asked me to deal with this for him, which is why I have made these posts on his behalf, but I have no problem asking him for Trefor's details, and for a copy of a programme if this is any use?</p>
<p>Please let me know what you need from me to resolve this.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> A letter from Trefor would be classed as original research I'm afraid - are there previous copies of the who's who floating about somewhere? What we need is something like that from either Watford Football club or another media source that identifies him as a player.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Thanks for getting back to me so quickly Charlesknight!</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure there are previous editions around. I am going to ask Ian to get onto Trefor (who will no doubt have copies of them all!!! And I will also ask him to get hold of a Watford programme if possible.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I might the club a call and see if they have something on file there.</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice, and I'll get back to you when I have more!</p>
<p>PS. By the way, I think HornetMike has misread the article, as it was not Denis who designed the Family Enclosure, it was his son Raymond (Ian's dad) who did this. It was part of a competition in the early 80's which Ray won.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have now received a copy of a Watford football programme from Ian dated 30 Novemeber 1929 which shows D.Cashmore in the players lineup. I have posted a copy of the cover of this programme together with the players diagram and an enlargement of such.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been advised that Ian has spoken with his Dad who says he has many of Denis's Watford medals if you would like them to be posted here. Obviously that will take a while for him to do, but in the meantime hopefully the proof the attached programme provides will be of interest to you. Ian's dad is also going to contact Trefor, but since any evidence he can provide seems to "not be admissbale(!)" I am not sure what he will be able to offer.</p>
<p>Ian has pledged to check his grandfather's listing on here soon (as his schedule allows), and provide any additional dates / names etc which might be required. I have also just added more exact dates to the main listing.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, and I hope that this will resolve the validity of the listing.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notability for this table comes from it being that of the monarch couple the first Elected <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Finland_b3fc.html" title="King of Finland">King of Finland</a> and his queen. This is worthy encyclopedic issue, since the Finnish monarchy, then soon defunct, was partially based on royal ancestry of its elected king and his family. Perhaps the name of the person/article is badly chosen, as it does not explicitly reflect that this concerns the Finnish monarchy (if I understand correctly, Charles above waged a (hostile) move war to suppress the evidence of Finland from Wolfgang's naming), and therefore the name could rather be changed: something like Ahnentafel of the Finnish royal couple.
