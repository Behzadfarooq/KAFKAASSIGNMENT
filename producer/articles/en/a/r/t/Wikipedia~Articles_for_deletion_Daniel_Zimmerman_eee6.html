I feel the need to make a few points. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is not a Wikipedia policy, just a criteria. The page clearly states that the concept of notability is contentious. The political process that makes Democracy like governments great is the participation of those people who win and lose. To claim that those who lose elections are not important is silly. Anyone seeking to do any research on Congressman Bobby Jindal (a "notable person" by the guidelines listed by those above) should be able to get data on all of his opponents. Wikipedia would be an incomplete reference if it only contained information about the winners and failed to mention those who tried to win the seat but lost. I also was not notified of this potential action taken against the article, as suggested by the Articles_for_deletion#AfD_etiquette| Afd Etiquette <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 22:56, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was trying to be brief. The political process relies on people who come forth and discuss the issues.

<li>I am not saying that Wikipedia should be an indiscriminate collection of information. However, Wikipedia is also supposed to be <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html#Bias" title="Neutral point of view">unbiased</a>. If Wikipedia will only contain information about the winners of election, it can hardly be said to be unbiased. Should every person on the face of the Earth have a wikipedia page? Absolutely not. However, those to take part in the political process, win or lose, play an important part. Obviously Wikipedia agrees that those who run and win are worthy of mention. The Wikipedia <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_election%2C_2004_3726.html" title="U.S. House election, 2004">2004 House Results page</a> not only mentions those candidates who ran in all races; it also links to their pages. If Wikipedia did not want pages for people who run for office then why does that page link to each and every candidate? (Not all have pages that have been started. However, all of them have links). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 05:13, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The losers of national elections are deserving of mention. However, that does not mean that each one deserves an entire article devoted to their person. As far as I'm concerned, the only significant information I'd want to know pertaining to losers of elections who are otherwise non-notable is their political party and the voting results by tally and percentage, which is most easily listed in a collective article such as the one to which you linked. If you could update the article to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> by noting references, especially those to "significant media coverage" as has been mentioned, then I would change my vote to keep. On a side note, my high school civics teacher ran for state senate as an independent party candidate. He ran quite a campaign, and received a significant number of votes, but lost (as is usually the case with independent party candidates). All of his students, including myself, thought it was quite a remarkable event given the amount of effort he put into campaigning. Despite my opinion of him, which is that he was a great teacher and person and would have made an excellent state senator, I do not think him notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia. The same goes for you; it's nothing personal. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERishodi_bcca.html" title="User:Rishodi">Rishodi</a> 06:41, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>If the people who participated in Congressional elections are not "deserving" of a Wikipedia page then why does the 2004 Congressional Race section of Wikipedia include links to each and every page belonging to each and every candidate in that race? I could understand your point IF that page was written and only included textual references of the candidates. However, the page includes links to Wikipedia pages of each and every person who ran. Please tell me what "significant media coverage" is and I will endeavor to link to each and every article that is available. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 14:27, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

The only way this article will not be deleted is if you prove notability using multiple verifiable sources. As the article currently stands, I would guess that there is some media coverage on the election information presented in the first paragraph, but as for the last two paragraphs, if the information presented there cannot be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>, then it is <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity information</a> and should be removed. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERishodi_bcca.html" title="User:Rishodi">Rishodi</a> 18:06, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why would the editor of that page make each person's name linked if the editor did not think all where deserving of a Wikipedia page? The page can be created with plain text for the names of candidates and when one of those candidates has a page that is added, the Election page could then be edited. On the verifiable issue, I have just added some pages linking to several different sources verifying certain facts stated on the election. Some of those pages not only mention the races, but they also mention the information in the next paragraphs. (For example, articles referring to the election mention the fact that I am seeking my Masters in Computer Science). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 21:03, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

If you can point out points in the article where I have been "vain" then point them out and i will edit them (or edit them yourself). It seems to be "odd" at the very least to think that had I posted my own article with an ambiguous Wikipedia name and pretended to not be me that this would be an issue.

I still intend on doing so based on the news reports of the election.

<li>I will again point out that if I had been "sneeky" I could have created a user name on Wikipedia that was not my name. Then nobody would have known who created the article. So my honesty is causing the "vanity" issue because I was honest in presenting who I was to the Wikipedia community. If the decision is made to delete because "I" created my own article then all you are doing is forcing people to be dishonest when creating pages where they have something to do with the subject of the article.

Had you been "sneaky", you probably still would have been discovered eventually. I imagine that the personal information you have included in the last two paragraphs is very difficult to verify, and that clue alone suggests that the editor who provided that information was someone personally connected to the article's subject.

<li><b>Comment</b> Irrespective of the spirit in which the nomination was brought, other delete "votes" resting on adequate, independent grounds had been cast, so "speedy keep" is likely inappropriate, even in view of criterion four. If the argument is to be that, where a nomination is thought to be brought in bad faith, any deletes that espouse the same position as the nomination ought to be discarded under criterion four (or ought not to be recognized for the purposes of closing a debate as "speedy keep"), we are left then with the prospective situation in which a nomination, evidently brought in bad faith yet nevertheless justified on other grounds enumerated by the nominator, is to be closed as "speedy keep" even where our guidelines, generally, would seem to militate in favor of "delete". <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:58, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please see my comment on the discussion page of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> about the addition and deletion of political candidates. In breif, if holding a certain office is enough to gain notability then running for that office should be enough to gain notability. Otherwise, wikipedia will be seen as biased towards certain candidates in a race. Either, we cover all candidates in a race or we cover none. It is that simple. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 01:07, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia. It is supposed to be a place where people can do research.

<li>Its no wonder why so few people run for office or even have an interest in politics. The way you people trivialize those who take part in a major election is really disgusting. What % do you think makes a candidate "notable" enough to qualify for your approval? I was PROUD of my campaign, not necessarily because of the results but because I was able to help victims of Hurricane Ivan by collecting goods to be donated to them. The ONLY reason I dont have that information on the page currently is because there was no news coverage of that event so under Wikipedias policy it would not be verifiable. But people are willing to let campaigns for national office to be forgotten because of some %. I also want to state, yet again, that if Wikipedia allows for one candidate to be listed then it should allow for all candidates to be listed otherwise it will be seen as biased towards certain candidates and against others. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 14:35, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Suggestion</b>: People who sell <b>5000</b> copies of a book are somehow notable enough to get listed on Wikipedia but someone who got over <b>12000</b> votes for a national political office is not notable enough? What sense does that make? If selling 5000 books (not a large number of books to be sold) is notable enough to have an article on Wikipedia then someone who received more than 5000 votes in an election should also be notable enough to have an article. Ill stop editing my own page and allow others to remove all that is not verifiable from the articles listed to stop the idea of self promotion. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 14:35, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - "Disagreements" are common on WP, if fact, "disagreement" are probably par for the course here. It is only through mutual, logical dialogue and constructive debate that meaningful articles will be created. If we all were constantly in agreement, there would be no need for "talk pages", "AfDs", "RfCs", etc. I submit that a "disagreement" at another article is not a valid reason to discount my opinion regarding this one. I constantly monitor the AfD page, nominate AfDs and vote in AfDs in my areas of expertise often. Please, per the WP guidelines Mr. Zimerman, assume good faith concerning my ability to be objective.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 20:53, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You did not assume good faith in my edit of the Sean Hannity page, describing the change as "petty". Your entrance into this discussion was made only after you made that comment. Had you assumed good faith towards me perhaps I would have been able to assume good faith on your part. You have also stated that you will go back and revise the Sean Hannity article tomorrow based on nothing but your own opinion and not based on any attempt to reach a consensus FIRST and have shown that you will not be acting in good faith in that discussion. You have shown that when it comes to the Sean Hannity article you will not be attempting any "mutual, logical dialogue" or any "constructive debate" and that you will unilaterally remove my addition to the Sean Hannity article when I have provided multiple, verifiable, sources that show Sean Hannity incorrectly representing the Preamble. Why would I beleive that you would act in good faith in this discussion as well? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 23:15, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Again, you are obfuscating the facts. I described the <i>incident</i> you wished to include as "petty", not your efforts themselves. I have made every effort on that talk page to present logical arguments and rebuttals but you refuse to engage in <i>discussion</i> and simply state the same thing over and over. I haven't reverted your POV because I refuse (good faith) to engage in an edit war.

<li><b>Last comment on this topic</b>: This is my final comment on this issue. If this issue was merely about <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> then I would simply appologize for being ignorant of that specific Wikipedia policy. I pledge from now on to follow the guideline about not writing <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Dealing_with_articles_about_yourself" title="WP:BLP">about myself</a> and would hope that others would also follow the same suggestions that are presented about dealing with <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_bite_the_newbies_82aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't bite the newbies">newbies</a> like myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>This conversation is about more than just <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, it is also about notability. Perhaps it seems vain that I am making a stand on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a> issue on the article that I wrote about myself. However, I personally do not care if I have a Wikipedia page about me. My life will go on just fine without it and if it is the opinion that my page should be deleted then so be it. That does not change the fact that I strongly disagree with those who wish to delete ANY article just because the topic of the article is not deemed "notable" by that user's standards. My proposed compromise would be that someone else should go through the article and delete all of the information that is not verifiable, and making sure that the remaining information is follows the NPOV policy. And i will only stick my head in to the page in the manner deemed appropriate by the BLP polcy. We can then go to the other places like <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> and start the discussion over there as to what political races and candidates should qualify for inclusion in Wikipedia.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 23:31, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> nn person. Does not pass WP:BIO. Also a little <b>comment:</b> Even if other less-notable people or subjects have articles here on Wikipedia, it does not mean that they set the lower limit for notability. Wikipedia has more than one million users, and as I see it the only person who can set a definitive notability requirement would be <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimbo</a> himself! Thus we are likely to find some articles being kept even if the subject is less notable than others being deleted. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 01:16, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Lest malign motive should be imputed to my vote, as it has been to others', I should say that I've been a <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Jindal_5c46.html" title="Bobby Jindal">Bobby Jindal</a> critic since before <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Weekly_Standard_ccd3.html" title="The Weekly Standard">The Weekly Standard</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a> fell in love with him. Notwithstanding that, though, the subject is non-notable; it is clear that, of the sundry details of his bio, only his candidacy for the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_of_Representatives_5a56.html" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> might confer notability, but unsuccessful candidates for the U.S. House are not notable exclusively in view of their candidacies (recognizing <a href="../../../n/b/d/WP%7ENBD_62b7.html" title="WP:NBD">WP:NBD</a>, I would nevertheless observe that we've arrived at the conclusion that unsuccesful candidates are not de facto notable on several AfDs of late). There are candidates who, as a result of events during a given campaign, become notable, but solely standing for election, even as the nominee of a major party, does not a notable bio make. DZ's position that, where verifiable and neutrally constructed, all articles, irrespective of the notability of their subjects, ought to be kept is often essayed, but there is surely not a consensus for that view (neither, further, do I think ever there will be nor do I think ever there should be). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:54, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
