<li><b>Comment</b> Hello all. I am an admin of the BS01 Wiki (Or Utopia as noted on this page). Personally I think that this page should be deleted. The maker of this page, a co-worker of mine, has done nothing to this page. All it consists of is the wiki itself. So I, an admin of the wiki, thinks it should be deleted. Obviously this should be enough to get the job done. But now, I must give some other comments... Bionicle Sector 01 is the most trustworthy and reliable database of Bionicle knowledge for the storyline itself. Quite frankly, I find is funny that you guys take hits on google as a criteria for a website. BS01 does not need to explain what Bionicle is, because all fans that use the site know what the heck it is. It is a database for storyline information. As for the wiki, that is entirely different. The wiki is an add-on of the site and has grown considerably: It it now the biggest database for Bionicle storyline information. <b>Consumed Crustacean</b>, sure you guys have a page called Bionicle, but your pages on Bionicle are very inaccurate. In fact, it is a running joke on BZPower, the largest forum site for Bionicle, that Wikipedia is very inaccurate. Even the writer of Bionicle himself deems it false. XD. ~Utopia from BS01 Wiki</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Well, considering that Wikipedia gets over forty <i>billion</i> hits a day, and that your "Bionicle" site isn't even in the Alexa top hundred <i>thousand</i> sites for hits, one would think that if you were serious about this subject and found the information on Wikipedia lacking, you'd improve the article. Surely there are devoted fans of these toys somewhere who consider it more productive to get the message out than to jeer. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 05:16, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Oh, believe me, we don't just jeer. We majorly help changed Wikipedia's pages on Bionicle. We almost made everything accurate, but then some other nutcase (as some member once called them) edited in pure speculation. So we actually do both. As for hits, I wouldn't doubt it. Bionicle isn't exactly your greatest of subjects. Besides, Wikipedia is huge: Just about everything is here and everyone over the entire nation, and sometimes elsewhere use it. So I find it highly unfair to compare both sites. I mean, let's look at the facts. Our wiki has 9 sysop users, only 5 or them are true staff. You guys have almost 1000 admins. Now, the ratio of admins to members is about the same for both of our sites (last time I checked) so if you compare that... 6/1000 is a pretty big difference. Not enough to minimize the gap in hits, but oh well. And also, why do you quote Bionicle? You guys can't exactly compare any wiki to BS01 Wiki because there is a much smaller population going at it. ~Utopia</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would like to apologise. I was busy that day and I could only complete the wiki part of it since that's the place I know the best. I will go and update it as soon as I can. (which is not now) Again, I am deeply sorry. (And Utopia, you are a Moderator, like me, not admin. Swert is admin...) - <a href="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bioran23" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bioran23" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Bioran23</span></a> <sup><a href="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Bioran23" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Bioran23" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Quick-Speak</span></a></sup></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Also, it is NOT a non-notable site. As I stated already, it is supported by the site BZPower, and of which does shows up within the top five of BIONICLE on Google. May I also say that the BS01 members is actually BZPower members. BS01 does not have it's own forums, meaning that it's forums are supported by BZPower. The admin CM has left of which is correct, but it has been passed down to administrator Swert. And also, although there are approx. 600 and more members, they have many unregistered members who read it without signing in. As far as I and Utopia knows, information of the wiki has been quoted more than once on BZPower as proof to many things. As Utopia stated already, Wikipedia's BIONICLE page is being laughed about for it's strong inaccuaracy and lack of information, unlike BS01 Wiki, which has many DETAILED pages on different objects and Locations (Of which I tend to) plus detailed entries on the characters. I found it rather rude to comment on a site which you know nothing about by just "Looking it up on Google as if it is the best source in the world" while your pages are being joked by 30000 people around the globe. And also, Wikipedia is huge, yes it is, but you can not just comment on something which is smaller and seems to be less important in your eyes. You and I are all humans, and you and I are all living organisms, there is no difference. - <a href="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bioran23" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bioran23" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Bioran23</span></a> <sup><a href="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Bioran23" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Bioran23" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Quick-Speak</span></a></sup></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Bioran, technically, we are all admins. Saying admins is for simplicity sake here because they don't have "moderators." They have different terms, we have different terms, so I'm just speaking in their language. And also Bioran, I see some problems with your comment. You see, we are talking on WP now, and must play by their rules. Now they say we have to be seen by google, for us to have our own page. Although I think it is unfair as well, that is the way things work. But now, using humans and wikis in metaphor? I have to say that there is a difference. But in the end, this duscussion is just a train derailing: It can't be stopped from its doom. Per say their...<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> rules this page is to be deleted. Sorry I couldn't add more...~Utopia</li>
