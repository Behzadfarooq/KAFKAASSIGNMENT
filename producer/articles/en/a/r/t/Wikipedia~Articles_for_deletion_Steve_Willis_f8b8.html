<li><b>Keep</b> I used to listen to Today with Steve Willis when we lived in Ireland, reception was not great as we lived outside Dublin, but he was very popular. Reading the bit about the gaps in the programme makes sense. I did remember those. He did often read emails out from people in Spain, Gibraltar and the UK. That programme I can say with certainly was a syndicated programme. ClaireLMillington 13:42, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There are google hits for "steve willis.eu" which is exactly what he gives on air. I used to read the news on 2fm overnight, and later went to Galway Bay FM. I knew Steve Willis, back in about 1999 when he used to use the RTÉ Radio Centre, to present his programme up until 2001 if my memory serves me right. I am now the Group Editor for <b>Galway Now</b> magazine. He certainly is notable in Ireland. SineadNiNeachtain 15:23, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not a sock/meat puppet by any stretch of the imagination. I am a "Willisette" which is what he calls his female followers, he was pulled up back in 2004 for using the term "WOG's" meaning Willis's Old Gals, a play on Terry Wogans TOG's. hence I am just a listener to his show, He was also connected with Telford FM and friend of Ian Perry, former presenter of Beacon Radio's Midnight Line. I see the comment on the steve willis website has gone again. Along with some slight realignments. It was their at 07.00h this morning. Beetroot1 18:15, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find it even more amazing that they listened to a Northern Irish radio station in Ireland, especially as its transmission site is relatively well shielded and its only cross-NI coverage is on DAB - which very few Irish people have receivers for. I also find it amazing that every listener who "heard him" a few years ago happens to stumble across to this to vote, and that they're all avid AM radio listeners as well as FM and DAB - must be hard keeping up with three modes of transmission to follow eh? --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 18:56, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a radio broadcaster myself, (as explained in earlier comments) It is quite possible to listen to any radio. My last radio station was Galway Bay FM and we used to listen to Red FM (Corcaigh) online. I think the comments of 80.189.171.58 are quite plausable. She did not say that she listened off air or online. Also Ireland is a general term, again non specific, (ROI/NI. She says she lives in Berks. UK, After checking the IP, I do indeed see a London connection, and Newstalk 1152 I would have thought would be receivable in that area. I really cannot believe we are all debating how well known he is. What do you all want? Me to put a photo of him on the Galway Now website? SineadNiNeachtain 19:24, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I would also like to see this. "Hard evidence" doesn't cover websites you or any of the other supposed people who've voted on this thread own/run/work for, for a start. So far, the only "hard evidence" we have is that he does two hours a week on a student-run AM radio station, which means he fails entirely on notability requirements.

<dd>OK, that proves what new information? That he works on a AM student radio station.... which we already knew as the sole provable piece of information about him.

<dd>I don't know who he is because he's not notable in the wider radio market, or the Irish one, and I haven't heard his show because I don't live in Wolverhampton, or indeed listen to AM radio or community radio at any stage. And when/if he was on Phoenix FM, well, I don't live in the car park of the Blanchardstown Shopping Centre because their signal doesn't go much further.

<dd><b>Comment</b> No-one is denying that he exists. The debate is whether he is notable enough to appear in the Wikipedia. Given that he is just one of many presenters working in a local radio station, his notability is very much up for grabs. That he's (ineptly) been using sock-puppets to vainly promote himself in Wikipedia is, to a degree, a secondary issue (though it hardly helps his case).
