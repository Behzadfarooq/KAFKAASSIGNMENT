<li>STOP attempting to change the facts regarding NCAHF and Stephen Barrett. I will report you for violations and see that your bias is exposed in every way possible. You will not be able to censor me without a fight I assure you. NCAHF has no legal corporate status and you are trying to bury that fact with bullying and censorship. STOP IT NOW! YOU may think you know more than the seven justices of the California Supreme Court but that is only a delusion. Leave my factual posts alone.</li>

<p>This comment in the bio could use a citation: "Rubin went directly from high school to graduate school at Caltech, enrolling simultaneously as an undergraduate."</p>
<p>That alone is not very notable. After all, undergrads can take graduate courses. What would be better would be a citation that verified that Rubin was <i>accepted</i> into a graduate maths program straight out of high school. The way it is worded now is ambiguous, unsourced and non-notable. At minimum a citation would help. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 13:56, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm. Actually, you're right. Could matching my High School's web site for the graduation date against the math geneology site help? I can't think of a secondary source for the combination, at the moment. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 15:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, actually, I <i>was</i> accepted as both an undergraduate and a graduate student (or, to be precise, a dual graduate/undergraduate student); the idea was that I was to get separate BS and PhD degrees in 6 years. However, I failed enough undergraduate courses that meeting the undergraduate requirements was problamatical.... But there would probably be no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, as admission records are not public records. Still, there is unlikely to be a secondary source, and, as noted before, a primary sources would not be easily obtained.... — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:31, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This whole <b>Erdős number</b> business seems silly. Do people take this seriously? It seems that Erdős wrote around 1500 mathematical papers and most were co-authored. An <b>Erdős number</b> of 2 sold for $127.40 on eBay. Rubin was second author on his paper with Erdős so it’s hard to tell what his role was. Did Rubin himself ever author any significant work? It would be great if someone could dig up some sources to get this bio on track.

<dd>Actually, I don't think it meets <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a>. The first paragraph seems to provide adequate notability, noting I'm one of five 4-time Putnam exam "winners". If you don't like it, suggest an AfD. (And, BTW, the Putnam exam site provides a secondary source that I was an undergraduate, as it's only open to undergraduates. My years as a graduate student have a secondary source at the math geneology web site — and this comment falls under one of the execeptions to <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, that of correcting errors.) — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 15:31, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't questioning the fact that you were an undergrad (obviously you were), but that you were admitted to a graduate program straight out of high school. <i>That</i> would need a source.

Note that the Lowell prize is not a professional prize, but a student prize and so of limited value and notability.

<dd>Agreed. Has he contributed anything noteworthy to mathematics? Any noteworthy papers as a mathematician? What does he do today, to begin with? Is he a professor of mathematics at a university? That is, while his achievement in winning the Putnams is somewhat interesting, is he noteworthy for anything else? 66.108.106.230 22:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC) Allen Roth

<dd>I don't claim to meet <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, as I'm presently working in industry, rather than as an academic. One could argue that having an <a href="../../../e/r/d/Erdos_number.html" title="Erdos number">Erdos number</a> of 1 might, in itself, meet <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. As for my most notable results — where could we find a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as to what was a notable result?

<p>I'm sure point 1 is listable, and point 3 can be referenced when the book is published. Point 4 can probably be referenced from the California Secretary of State's records, although records that old may not be online. If I find a cite for point 2, I'll add it. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 16:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non-trivial means I think more than just a mention in the listing or a table (wiki is not a directory). Also, how does a published paper or patent qualifies an author for notability? It qualifies the subject of that paper/patent.</p>

<dd>Actually, there was an article in <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_magazine.html" title="Time magazine"><i>Time</i></a> on me, probably in 1966 or 1967. But I'm not sure I could find it again; my mother's "brag" file disappeared in one of our moves. However, the articles about the <b>first</b> USA Mathematical Olympiad (where I'm one of eight), and the Putnam exam (one of five or six) may qualify. As for your <i>alleged</i> multiple authors, I don't feel that multiple articles in conspiracy theory journals by conspiracy theorists about conspiracy theorists theorists, or intelligent desgin journals by intelligent design proponents about intelligent design proponents necessarily qualify as notable publications .— <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 21:36, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You should cite the Time article then, and just put [reference needed] tag as someone will find it eventually (maybe in Time archives<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/archives" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/archives" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). That makes a huge difference, in my opinion, for this article. As far as your blurb about conspiracies is concerned: Cybernetics and Systems, Kybernetes , Nonlinear Dynamics Psychology and Life Sciences, Complexity<a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jabout/38804/EditorialBoard.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jabout/38804/EditorialBoard.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, etc. As you say, they are all together in this. <a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakinekaki_88a8.html" title="User:Lakinekaki">Lakinekaki</a> 21:56, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
