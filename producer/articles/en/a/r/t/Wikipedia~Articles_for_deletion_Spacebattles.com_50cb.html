<p>Contested PROD with "fails WP:WEB and WP:V: non-notable forum/website, nothing is referenced, no chance of anything being referenced", however it was contested. I wholeheartedly agree with this reasoning. I don't see any reliable independent third party sources, nor do I think there will be any. My googling has not found any as of yet. Fails the Alexa test (~190K), if that happens to be your thing. Doesn't rank highly on Big-Boards either. <b>Delete</b> as failing WP:V and WP:WEB. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 01:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Just what would qualify as a reference? It is possible for facts to exist without having an outside website to reference them. And SB.com is linked to other websites. The Alexa rating itself isn't Wiki policy and shouldn't be grounds for deletion. And SB.com does rank well on Big Boards when you check things other then the first stats. And it just so happens that SB.com is owned and run by Kier, one of the primary developers of the VB Bulliten Board software. It should be noted that things far less notable have their own pages. Such as individual pages for minor characters in rarely watched TV shows. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 01:40, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> official policy excludes facts that exist without any outside source. And "If article X then article Y." is a fallacious argument. The infamous Argumentum ad Pokémon has long since been refuted, as shown below. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:57, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Pokemon Rule, i.e. there is an article for every Pokemon in existence. Also, SB is central to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> community. <a href="../../../e/2E/_/User%7EE._Sn0_%3D31337%3D_919f.html" title="User:E.

<li>When you can cite the same range of in-depth sources about this web site that are cited at <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html#Notes_and_references" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur#Notes_and_references</a>, you can validly employ that argument. Of course, you will have at the same time cited sources to demonstrate that the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria are satisfied, which is the argument that you <i>should</i> be making here (but are not).

<li>None of the editors wanting this article kept have presented any valid arguments for doing so. Your weapons are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">sources</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">sources</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliability_cfb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliability">sources</a>, people. Please cite sources to demonstrate that the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria are satisfied. If you don't, and simply continue making fallacious arguments such as the above, you won't make a case for keeping this article. This is not a vote. Arguments based firmly upon our <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> are what count. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:57, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable website; Wikipedia is not a web directory for advertising fan sites. Supposed Pokemon "rule" is fallacious. Wikipedia is not a dumping ground.<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:59, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with Bwithh. This is simple advertising for a non notable website, which has nothing special associated with it. The pokemon argument is fallacious. The simple fact that some event, and some bit of information has been created or occured, doesn't automatically qualify it for Wikipedia. The event, whatever it is, must have some recognisable intrinisic value. This article doesn't. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScope_creep_3ef9.html" title="User:Scope creep">scope_creep</a> 03:10, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. To Ben W Bell, the original Spacebattles.com website hasn't been updated for a while, but if you google it, you will find that Spacebattles forums are third in the listing.

<li><b>Comment</b> Had you actually bothered to read the website in question you would realize that it is not a gaming website. That you wrote it off by calling it a gaming website shows you voted against it without any attempt to see the truth of the matter. As it stands, I keep hearing people talk about how UncleG got it right. I am still waiting for an explanation as to why the Sidekick article which met all the stated requirements got deleted. And knowing that the Sidekick article was deleted regardless of the requirements, why should I even bother with your rules knowing full well that its going to be ignored just like it has in the past? You've killed any respect I once had for Wikipedia policies now that I see how they are being applied in a cherry picking standard where people just remove pages they don't like. Encyclopedia's are supposed to be repositories of knowledge. Not elitist publications that say "No, your not good enough for the people to learn about". <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 04:49, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><b>keep</b></i> So what you're saying is that we should not look to Wikipedia for information? Because that was what he said he was doing, and you just stated that that was the wrong way to utilize this page. Also, nobody has yet said that providing sources will prevent deletion. Thus it seems rather fucking pointless to the people who made this site. <i>Italic text</i>And it's not even self promotion.<i>Italic text</i> So there's no reason to delete it neither, save for the does not cite it's sources thing, which should be warned of first, which it wasn't neither, and isn't even a guarantee because now, it suddenly isn't influential enough. Unlike the aforementioned Bulbasaur article. To put it this way, the ones who argue for deletion cite a flaw, and then nominates for deletion. Then they inform the writers that providing sources won't save it because it isn't noticeable enough. Then the writers are informed that articles of less note, that should also be deleted won't be, because, well.. Because. And nominating those articles for deletion because they violate the same rules that are almost being followed, are <i>Italic text</i>disrupting wikipedia. And any complaints about this are completely irrelevant for some reason. Which is for some reason not intellectual dishonesty? So remember people if your article is deleted, don't list other articles up for deletion for the very same reason, especially if they qualify for deletion... Anyway, what you guys who want to delete are saying is that it's getting deleted because it isn't verified, right? And that if we add sources that verifies things, it won't help anyway and it is not worthy enough and it's self advertising and so on. Then someone comes in and argues your point, and points out unfair treatment, and thus get's slapped with a giant fish slapping dance version of "that's not relevant to the debate"... <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakonKL_78ac.html" title="User:HaakonKL">HaakonKL</a> 20:54, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
