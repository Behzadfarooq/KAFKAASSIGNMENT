<p>Procedural nomination because a user has disputed whether a consensus existed to turn this into a redirect the last time we got into the whole <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_Regional_Municipality%2C_Ontario_8b85.html" title="York Regional Municipality, Ontario">York Region</a> thing. The user has not only violated 3RR over it, but has registered new sockpuppets to keep reverting even after being blocked. Thus I'm asking for a new consensus: is this a <b>keep</b>, a <b>delete</b>, or a <b>merge into <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaughan_municipal_election%2C_2006.html" title="Vaughan municipal election, 2006">Vaughan municipal election, 2006</a></b>? No vote from me since this is a procedural nom, but I will say that I'm really not too clear on how we can consider unelected municipal council <i>candidates</i> notable enough for WP inclusion, when the very same city's <i>actual incumbent councillors</i> haven't been able to pass the AFD bar. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:20, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This, at least the Nevada leg, is the only maglev project in the US that has funding. Given that it is the cheapest of the proposals to build per mile, the only interstate proposal, and the one with the most support from people and government it has a chance to become reality. How can anyone claim that only 3rd party sources are available when over $45 million for the planning phase was included in a bill signed by Bush? This maglev has not been ruled out as the major people mover to the new Las Vegas airport. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 19:11, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Still reads like a lot of crystal-ballism: <i>"This is one of the most likely maglev train projects in the world"</i>, <i>"it has a relatively high chance of being built..."</i> Maybe if it could stick more to established facts: this is the proposal, here's what's happened. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:09, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If I'd known FreplySpang was going to add my comments above to the article, I might have phrased them a little differently. However, I stand by everything I said, and it looks like this has led to further improvements to the article; I hope this has made the case for keeping it conclusive. (I don't know why there's a fact tag on the "it would be the first long-distance line" assertion; there's presently only one such line in the world and it runs from an airport to a city center; this would be hundreds of kilometers long.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 22:28, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable D-list Elmer Gantry wannabe. No actual accomplishments. Believe me, I checked this guy, fixed up the biased and poor language, formatted and wikified, researched publisher info on his vanity-press "publications", tried (and failed) to find citations backing up <i>any</i> claim to <i>any</i> level of notability (besides his website). I'm especially pissed because after all that, I decided not to AfD the article despite his clear non-notability, because, enh, too lazy. Response? Reverts with insulting edit summary, addition of more mendacious and biased material, refusal of editor to respond to polite requests to engage. Giving him a pass on his non-notability a mistake, I guess, so deletey-time. "Lou Engle is an influential leader" is just plain false. He's a nobody.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The notability page establishes several consensus criteria for notability. Engle does not qualify by many of them, but does qualify by the criterion for published authors, and by the 100-year test. To illustrate the latter, I consider Engle to be analogous in his role and activity to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Rowland_5964.html" title="Daniel Rowland">Daniel Rowland</a>. Anyone researching turn of the millenium American revivalism would be ill-served by Engle's omission from the history, 100 years from now. I'm sorry if the editor felt personally slighted by my <b>npov smear</b> comment, but the use of <b>self-published</b> appeared prima facie to be an intentional mischaracterization. Whatever the editors intentions were, I still consider the incorrect use of the term to be belittling. The deletion project also appears to be consistent with this agenda-based editorial plan. Please do not attribute to me edits which I did not make. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminorex_1d55.html" title="User:Aminorex">Aminorex</a> 19:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>What Aminorex is talking about is a message I left on <i>his</i> talk page taking him to task for an edit made by someone else, which I did due to a engregiously incorrect misreading of the page history. I apologized on your talk page and I apologize here, Aminorex. Stupid mistake, but why are you bringing it <i>here</i>? (I don't know what you mean by "agenda-driven plan". I'm an inclusionist, and I <i>cleaned up</i> the article and left it <i>even though</i> the guy is clearly non-notable; I only thought better of it when I saw it got messed up again and I saw a long stretch of edit warring, not worth it for a guy who's just not notable.) I don't know exactly how to characterize his publishing; it's a special case. He's certainly not published by normal, commercial publishing houses; They look to be small fundamentalist publishers. Perhaps "specialty publisher" would be the term, or maybe they are a form of vanity press. I used "self-published" and I guess that was a slight mischaracterization, but to leave the impression that he was published in the sense that we use the term for normal published authors would also be misleading. As to the main point, I'll comment below. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:49, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would dispute that Engle is a "published author" in the sense that the term is commonly meant. Although I think its probable that his publishing houses <i>exist</i> in some sense, I sure couldn't find out much about them. This goes way beyond not having a web site; they don't seem to have a web <i>presence</i>. I think at least one of them is defunct. These are not big players in the publishing world. I don't know where the line between a vanity press and actual publishing house lies. As to the rest... the original article makes as his big claim to fame that he "organized" something called CallDC that got a crowd of "400,000". I couldn't find any mention in the regular press at all - not a clipping, not an 'also in the news' note, nothing. The only other real mention was in another fundamentalist website, where they gave the crowd as "75,000" and characterized Engle's involvement as being "among the speakers" at the event. And that's his <i>friends</i>. 75,000 is probably a great exaggeraterion itself, but who can tell since <i>there is no mainstream press coverage of the event at all</i>. For all I know it was 750. And remember, that's his <i>main</i> claim to notability that the article made. (Since then, more has been added, such as his being "actively involved in the leadership" of a planned <i>future</i> event, along with some frankly bizzare ramblings about theology. Whatever, but I hope any Keep voters also volunteer to re-clean and re-verify the article and keep watch over it (have fun), 'cause I ain't gonna. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 20:13, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Specialty presses are not somehow unreal by virtue of their specialized audience. Examples of specialized publishers which have wide respect are abundant, and many very influential works have been published by specialized or ephemeral presses. I agree that one of the publishers in question has been dissolved or, as seems more likely, absorbed into Destiny Image, and that none of Engles publishers is among the top tier; in fact they represent a subspecialization of Christian theological publishing, however, if there is a mall near your home, I'm sure that you could find many current titles published by Destiny Image, or by Wagner, in the Charismatic or Pentecostal interest section of a Christian book store. I don't think that the unverifiability of the attendance numbers of The Call gatherings is a strong grounds for refuting the notability of the organizers. I do have personal knowledge that Engle was among the organizers at The Call in Kansas City and in San Francisco. If his role in The Call D.C. was inflated by my edits, I hope to correct that error. I understand that the theology espoused is a minority one, but that doesn't impugn the interest of the topic to researchers. The movement represented is very real, has numerous well-known proponents, and certainly several hundreds of thousands of participants in North America alone (millions seems more likely to me, but my sampling is very unscientific, and certainly suffers from selection bias). While there are hundreds or thousands of leaders of local influence, Engle is among a handful with national and international influence of note. Others would include Goll, Joiner, Bickle, Cain (now in disgrace), and Strom (who has dissociated himself, but remains influential and is closely related, if no longer affiliated). The web presence of these people is very small, when compared to practical impact, and I think it is misleading to derive notability from Google statistics for this group. They seem to invest most of their efforts in speaking to sympathetic groups in person, and organizing on a face-to-face basis, and perhaps consciously avoid the web entirely, although I speak here in a hypothetical frame, as I have no actual contact with any of these persons, except as a casual observer of their activity and its consequences. I think the ongoing activity is also of interest, and substantiates the notability of the organizers. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminorex_1d55.html" title="User:Aminorex">Aminorex</a> 21:28, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I've looked into this a bit more. It seems that Lou Engle was in fact one of the principal organizers of The Call D.C., as he was the person to whom the U.S. Park Service issued the permit which secured the Washington Mall for the event. The event is generally attributed to Engle and Che Ahn, in the literature. I personally consider organizing a national event attended by hundreds of thousands of people, involving thousands of local churches, and establishing cooperative links with dozens of national organizations to be a noteworthy accomplishment, whether one considers it favorably or unfavorably. Moreover, every indication is that Engle's activity is expanding and influencing a substantial youth subculture of "Riot Christians", through his involvement with Teen Mania and Rock for Life. "D-list Elmer Gantry" is a profoundly whiggish spin and does not accurately represent this persons role in U.S. culture. He speaks routinely to gatherings of tens of thousands of people. That makes him at least an "A-List Elmer Gantry". I would rather characterise him as a midpoint between Pat Robertson and Martin Luther King, Jr., but with much less media involvement than either of these two figures.<small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminorex_1d55.html" title="User:Aminorex">Aminorex</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAminorex_f488.html" title="User talk:Aminorex">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aminorex_0eaa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aminorex">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>I'm perfectly prepared to change my vote if you have any web sites or other citations you could share with us?

<li>Just a note to inform the readership that I am engaged in collecting references in publications outside of the influence of organizations associated with Engle, and gathering verifiable facts to support the notability claim.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In case the 700 Club reference is considered marginal (many non-notable people appear on the 700 Club, certainly), I would observe that he was also covered on ABC's Nightline in December, 2005, in connection with the Justice House of Prayer Project. He is also one of the organizers of Rock for Life, a series of rock concerts, mostly in California and in the U.S. rust belt area.

<li>Well, such matters are subjective.

<li>This term doesn't 'bother' me; I simply don't think it's notable enough to merit a seperate article. As well as this, there's not much than can be said about it that can be made into anything other than a glorified dictionary definition.

<li>That sounds like a challenge to me! This is one of the great things about Afd - sometimes articles that survive the process go on to become really valuable additions to the project. From all I have read I think that there is a good amount of source material, and Calgacus says that he has some good material in his own library, which unfortunately he does not have access to at present. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 10:11, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you and Calgacus think you can make it into a worthwhile article, please go ahead. If you do, I'm happy to eat my words. But I can't really see how a single term and its (perhaps widespread but abscure) usage can ever escape being a glorified dicdef, however many quotations/references you may be able to add. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStringops_3dcb.html" title="User:Stringops">Stringops</a> 15:45, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - so that's 8 references in 14 years. Should wikipedia have articles on every made-up term used at least once by a local newspaper?

<li>That's the strangest argument I've ever heard. Should Scottish king then be merged with History of Scotland. On this logic, there would be no Scotland-related articles except History of Scotland. And as History of England "has ... genuine and notable relevance to Scottish history", should it be "merged" with History of Scotland? - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 18:30, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Everything that comes out of that man's mouth is notable? What is he, the conservative pope? This is a pretty well-known party, but the Bill O'Reilly reference doesn't magically make it notable.

I think Spring Fling at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">my alma mater</a> is a lot better known that SexPowerGod, but there's no mention of it even at the University's writeup, much less a separate article—which there certainly should not be.

<li><b>Comment.</b> True, it's not fancruft. I would like to see them all in one article because they are all related. This deals with my previous delete vote, that we're not a bilingual dictionary. A merge is fine with me, but I find separate articles unnecessary. If you're learning a languague, an encyclopedia is not the way to go. This is my first time dealing with such an article, so it's a learning experience for me. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>T</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE"><font color="gray"><b>K</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TKE_3c8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>E</b></font></a> 06:07, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Maybe we could take this as an opportunity for us grammar-interested editors to get together somewhere else and discuss what constitutes "morphology cruft" in grammar articles and how to avoid it. I do agree that bare listings of morphological paradigms are not optimal for a grammar article, but it's often done. Ideally, the function of such tables should always be subordinate to prose descriptions of what is characteristic or special about a grammatical system. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 06:42, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. As the grammar articles get larger, there will be natural breakouts such as grammar of Catalan verbs, and what-not.

<li><b>Keep</b> I dunno, I must be a little bit crazy, but who the heck are we to judge what is "artistic" and/or "clever"? If you think the humor is lowbrow or juvenile or "offensive" that's your opinion. The humor is largely identical to the types of humor found in Chappelle's Show, for example, and the video is WILDLY popular in the gaming community. I suppose the standup of, say, George Carlin is also not "clever" and "artistic," then? I also don't understand this "we're trying to be an encyclopedia" stuff. Wikipedia is never going to be an encyclopedia along the lines of Britannica, that's just the nature of the beast. And if we feel we need to live up to that standard of stick-in-the-assness, why have we not deleted every ten thousand word otaku article on Final Fantasy tertiary characters or on Warhammer 40,000 races? This is merely and completely a judgment call on the part of people who feel that the subject matter of this article isn't "highbrow" enough for wikipedia. What an irony. The Juggernaut Bitch article is well written (I know because I wrote it), and it accomplishes the rare feat of being complementary to the humor of its own subject matter. I'm so sick of the antiseptic cast that wikipedians seem to feel we need to throw onto every single article. What makes something really an encyclopedia is that the articles are not only informative, but interesting. Anyway, enough tirade. I think this is a keeper, unless we're running out of hard drive space of Wiki servers. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERiseAbove_b64c.html" title="User:RiseAbove">RiseAbove</a> 07:23, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your concerns, but what "sources" do we really need? This is a short film, created by fans. You can easily verify everything in the article by simply watching the film, which is linked on the page. Also, I'm still confused as to why this page has been singled out, as opposed to literally thousands of pages on Wikipedia that deal with subject matter much less widespread than The Juggernaut Bitch video (again, how many people really care about the vital statistics and motivations of Sephiroth, the main bad guy from Final Fantasy VII? And yet he has a frickin' saga for his page... Again, I call discrimination here, there seems to be a bias against this article because of the tone and language of the subject matter. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERiseAbove_b64c.html" title="User:RiseAbove">RiseAbove</a> 00:24, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>And Marvel comics (and their parodies) won't be? And while you tell me where you could find sources (i.e. games manuals) for Warhammer and FF7, you don't explain why this is relevant to this particular article; an article that concerns a subject matter not susceptible to being sourced. It's kind of like accusing a page on a fantasy novel for not having sources because there are no books of commentary written about that novel.<a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERiseAbove_b64c.html" title="User:RiseAbove">RiseAbove</a> 01:49, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Keep, with a vengeance. What “sources” are required beyond the video itself? Nominating this page for deletion is an unfair and irrational attack. The only motivation I can see for the “debate” here is the video’s trespass upon the humorless and politically correct sensibilities of the self-consciously high-minded. Wikipedia is populated by hundreds of ludicrous pages authored by pathologically obsessed fans of some inane enclave of gaming or popular culture (I think more pages are devoted to Final Fantasy minutiae than are afforded the plays of Shakespeare). These pages seem to survive the cut through pure teflon blandness, but when the subject involves humor of a highly vulgar (though hardly immature) color, out come the censors, knives sharpened, to cleave us all to some imagined standard of lofty gentility. What it comes down to is, Wikipedia functions as a repository of knowledge. This page provides entertaining, yet NPOV, description of an extremely popular internet video that does, in fact, exist. I see no reason this fact should be expunged from the social record, especially since precedents have now established that Wiki has plenty of tolerance for internet memes (and for countless subjects far more asinine than this page.) Wiki articles are not guesses as to what future historians might find of interest; they are written for the benefit of people today. And the fact that the page enjoys Google hits and redirects suggests that people are finding use for it. Spotlessmind</li>

<dd>I agree with Spotlessmind, and I would like to say further that his argument is not only well reasoned, but also well written.

<dd>So... what if I were to write a few articles commenting on the video? If we then cited them in the page, would it suddenly and magically transmogrify into a page worthy of being on wikipedia? This no original research and citing sources stuff seems arbitrary and easily manipulated. And, regardless of the policies of wikipedia, the fact remains that MANY people use it as a "first stop" for information, especially on subjects like this. Are we going to actively destroy an informative article that could be helpful and interesting merely because it does not follow the letter of the law?

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Pretty much, yes, we will. Perhaps instead of numerous impassioned pleas for Wikipedia official policy to be ignored in this case (more or less because, well, you wrote the article and you like the subject matter), you could devote those energies to verification of the video's notability. Many people <b>do</b> use Wikipedia as a first stop for information, and they trust Wikipedia's usefulness for that because there are policies to trim out ephemeral, self-promotional fancruft. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:09, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then you have abandoned common sense in favor of obdurate and irrational adherence to bureaucratic stipulations. I submit the following:</dd>
<dd>Verifiability- Video is linked at bottom of page. Video exists. Quotes listed on page are reproduced as heard in video. Verification complete.</dd>
<dd>Notability- 200,000 hits within 2 weeks. Clearly popular. Do you, then, presume to decide what is “notable” for the rest of us, over the actual usage practices of the people whom Wikipedia serves?
<dl>
<dd>I once ran up 5,000 hits in a single hour on my personal website just to see if I could do it. Your own site's counter on how many hits you claim to have isn't in of itself proof.
<dl>
<dd>Considering the page achieved significant hits before this ridiculous controversy broke out, Occam's razor would suggest that the hits were acquired legitimately, rather than being the result of an hour-long coordinated effort by a 40 man team hitting refresh to drive up the hits on a Wiki page for absolutely no reason.

<dd>Spotlessmind, you're my hero. Also, for the record, the video has been viewed close to 2 MILLION times on YouTube. That's not counting Google Video, and every other video site on the net. Clearly notable. Clearly verifiable. And, by the way, anybody who "ran up 5,000 hits in a single hour on [his] personal website just to see if [he] could do it" is somebody who's rational judgment should be questioned, to say the least.

<dd>I wasn't adding that to say it's the reason for my vote. Not every little thing on the Internet deserves its own page in WP. Far more popular memes haven't netted a notice on WP, and I can't see why this should. But thanks for the borderline personal attack.

<li><b>Keep</b>, article author here. Can't argue the standards by which a deletion is judged, but some clarification is in order. (1) I am one of the developers. (2) All three of us are industry professionals working full-time on VC-funded games. Googling my screenname 'Darien Kane' will return some articles and past projects by me. (3) JogosBR ('GamesBR' in Portuguese) is an initiative from the brazilian government to award original game proposals, game demos and complete games with robust cash investments (link is provided). I'm not affiliated with the government, but given the novelty of this practice, I believe JogosBR should in fact have an article of its own. (4) The prize encompasses self-publishing (hence the 'TBA' on the 'Publisher' field). (5) Zero Google hits is due to zero advertisement. (6) The notability of this article is not anchored to whether or not the game gets released or wins the contest (i.e. crystal balling); rather, it lies in the PhotoRank feature - which represents a paradigm shift in our industry - and to a lesser extent, in-game pedagogy. These two topics have been sparking debates among our peers, fans, collaborators and overseas partners (hence me posting on en.wikipedia.org instead of pt.wikipedia.org). I'm willing to rewrite the article to reflect that its less of an ad and more of a case study in social computing and e-learning (at least in Brazil). Thiago Aiache 20:58, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I just did reread it, and found no external links or references that would establish the notability of the game ... nor, with <b>zero</b> Google hits, am I much surprised. Since Brazilian sites reflect on Google -- I have an ex in Sao Paulo with whom I am in touch -- it seems to me that Occam's Razor applies: plainly this "PhotoRank" is an extremely flawed yardstick by which notability can be gauged. Perhaps you could supply some links pointing out where these debates are actually taking place? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:45, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I can only link to the lecture transcripts from the event where these issues were first debated, in middle March. It was the 'Conferência de Desenvolvedores de Games-Rio', which literally translates to Rio Game Developers Conference. The site is www.cdgrio.com.br. Transcripts (rather lenghty ones) are in Portuguese, but your friend from São Paulo can attest to their legitimacy. If this is still insufficient proof of notability, I can only ask that the article is moved to my User Space, as per one of the editors' suggestion. I kindly request that a redirect is provided, as I have linked the article on the document we submitted to the JogosBR contest. Thiago Aiache 19:59, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm ambivalent about this. In its current form I have no problem deleting it. I had been planning on changing it to an article on 4th generation fighters; trimming out most of the comparative aspects but keeping the basics, the comparative costs, and the DERA study. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 06:19, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I see that there are parts of the article which need some help with sourcing, NPOVing and general cleanup. On the other hand, in some sections the article actually contains a fair amount of external links which provide sources for the claims. I think that deleting the entire article would be too drastic a measure. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:28, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep as a technical measure</b>. It seems that this article is going to be renamed 4th and 5th generation fighter aircraft or something similar sometime in the future. The new article should probably incorporate the factual things from the current article. Of course, I only support keeping it in order to provide non-Admins easier access to its factual statements. Otherwise, I fully support deleting it. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EIngoolemo_dfa6.html" title="User:Ingoolemo">Ingoolemo</a>&#160;<a href="../../../i/n/g/User_talk%7EIngoolemo_94e8.html" title="User talk:Ingoolemo"><sup>talk</sup></a> 16:43, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete, move to User Space in preparation for new article</b> I've had resistance in changing the status quo, deleting would remove a lot of that resistance. Since I proposed the renaming, let me take it, work on it, and move the new content to the 4th gen fighter article, while keeping this deleted to stanch any effort to keep OR. I think we're all agreed that this article in its current form and title invites OR, but has some useful information. I think this is the best way to satisfy both viewpoints. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 18:44, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as this could be good information for the layperson, but needs to be renamed and cleaned up as above.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_punch.html" title="Donkey punch">Donkey punch</a> has a large section discussing cultural references, which lend notability to the topic. As for <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glass_bottom_boat.html" title="Glass bottom boat">Glass bottom boat</a>, I've removed the dictionary defintion from the disambiguation page. The <a href="../../../d/i/r/Talk%7EDirty_Sanchez_%28sex%29_5173.html" title="Talk:Dirty Sanchez (sex)">Talk:Dirty Sanchez (sex)</a> page also contains some information about why that article was kept. However, until the article contains more verifiable information about its widespread use, I consider it to be too much of a niche topic. As an additional comment, the article is poorly named (but that's easily fixable later).

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> or <b>Rename</b>. As far as I can see, no other Belgian statutes have an entry (which doesn't mean they shouldn't). However, most statutes are listed under a title that is the name of the particular statute, and the article itself is usually under a category for that country's statutes (i.e. "<a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_Information_Protection_and_Electronic_Documents_Act_473f.html" title="Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a>", which is under the category of "<a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECanadian_federal_legislation_f932.html" title="Category:Canadian federal legislation">Canadian federal legislation</a>").

<p>The content looks like a church brochure promoting the pastor rather than a neutral article.

Given that each article linked to <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_flower.html" title="County flower">county flower</a>, which has adequate citations and explanation, this was absurd, and I've been removing the templates.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> in so far as this article is factual information. However, I am sceptical that the edits to individual county pages (and pseudo-counties such as <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> which apparently has a county flower despite not being a county!) to record these flowers are appropriate as these flowers have no official recognition or historical validity. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValiantis_48f7.html" title="User:Valiantis">Valiantis</a> 18:58, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Whether <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> disagree with the concept of county flower is academic. In any case, no harm would be done if the sentence "Following a campaign by <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantlife.html" title="Plantlife">Plantlife</a>," precedes mention of county flowers in any county articles.

<p>Since the last time this article was nominated for AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_dead_and_distressed_shopping_malls_d1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of dead and distressed shopping malls">here</a>, we've forked out the malls that are verifiably defunct, and no longer operating as malls or closed outright <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_defunct_shopping_malls.html" title="List of defunct shopping malls">here</a>.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. There are reasonably objective criteria for a 'distressed' property most of which are unavailable to the general public. There are a couple of malls that have defaulted on their mortgages. Others have extremely low (less than 60%) occupancy. Most of that information would take so much time to research that I doubt anyone has done it here. I certainly can't fathom what criteria was used for inclusion here. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 23:18, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: "Distressed" is too vague. Even a specific meaning (say, vacancy rate), might or might not be notable with respect to the local economy. And the one mall on the list that I can really make an informed opinion on is not distressed by any standard. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 03:01, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd personally have to go with the <b>delete</b> side. I think there's a too-high degree of subjectivity involved, and a too-low degree of verifiability. Plus I just don't think it's that important, and while I may be wrong I don't think WP has ever established a consensus that all shopping malls are legitimately notable. For what it's worth, the only mall on here that I could speak to at all (Whitby Mall in <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitby%2C_Ontario_07df.html" title="Whitby, Ontario">Whitby, Ontario</a>) is one that I don't think would merit an article even if it <i>weren't</i> on some people's subjective lists of "distressed" malls. Bottom line, this just doesn't strike me as being a particularly notable or encyclopedic list. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:47, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, the article could still do with some more info and references to prove it can be more than a dicdef. Possibly it could be merged into <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_house.html" title="Public house">public house</a> instead, although I'm not sure that it belongs there. — <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford"><small>(talk)</small></a> 16:29, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I don't see to much of a grandiose article comming out of this. However their is a lot of document cultural event that do happen after getting drunk at a pub.

I'm pretty sure there have been much articles in the news about the stupid things that happen after the pub. Ie.: News facts, myths, etc. Also the term post-pub should be properly defined and it's origins stated. It is a term that I am unfamiliar with. b.t.w.: Oh! And I though it meant postpubescent, the opposite of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prepubescent" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prepubescent" rel="nofollow">prepubescent</a>! lol. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 22:37, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In response to Hahnchen: The gaming industry does not work like the music/movie industry. If a game gets notability, the developer (note not the publisher) automatically gains notability. It's different than say a music CD where if an artist makes a hit, the studio he recorded in isn't notable. But with games, the design studio to a large extent is synonymous with the game itself, and hence a game, whether notorious or critically acclaimed, earns it's developers notability. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 07:49, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm a keen gamer and drop in at <a href="../../../c/v/g/WP%7ECVG_903f.html" title="WP:CVG">WP:CVG</a> from time to time. This is not a notable gaming company, I could rolloff quite a few unknown development studios who only managed to put out 1 or 2 titles, and I don't think they're notable enough. Neither of their games has made an impact on the wider gaming industry, and it's not like they have the greatest output either. There are mod teams more notable than this. As opposed to SwatJ, I'm saying that not every software house is notable. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 12:37, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Urr ... no. This is a bit of a bait and switch. I read through both articles, and as far as I see, "Shiv-Goraksha Babaji" isn't the historical 11th century religious figure Gorakhnath. It is an alleged spirit that some guru claimed visited him around 1960 and <b>claims</b> is Gorakhnath, only he felt like renaming the spirit. That information from this article might be useful in the Gorakhnath entry I'll leave to others, but claiming Gorakhnath's notability for this article is tantamount to me writing a vanity article about my cat claiming that Jesus is possessing her, and declaring my cat's article notable because Jesus has a whole whopping lot of Google hits. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:56, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Do not consider on any point of serious scholarship to merge this article with the <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorakshanath.html" title="Gorakshanath">Gorakshanath</a> article. Gorakshanath was an influencial Indian personality who lived between 700-1000 years ago. Gorakshanath is dead. Shiv-Goraksha Babaji is a fictional character, the ultimate meat puppet a few people are attempting to breath life into. We have limited antecdotal reference to Shiv-Goraksha Babaji and no facts whatsoever of "his" objective existence. To say with a straight face that Gorakshanath is the same being as Shiv-Goraksh Baba one must be culpable for supporting the concept of physical immortality. This idea would be laughed off most WP articles in a heart-beat. There is no reason it should be considered here. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChai_Walla_24f5.html" title="User:Chai Walla">Chai Walla</a> 22:26, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> per nom; even by the standards of vanity pages, this one is overwhelmingly not notable. Any bio that has to include working for two days (?!?) at a hotel once managed by a brother of Tom Selleck in order to supply padding ... that's sad.

<li>I don't know how anyone can claim that the subject is non-notable or that the article does not assert notability. The article makes very clear that he threw a touchdown pass in a JV scrimmage game and that he was a pallbearer at his grandfather's funeral.

<dd>My point is that there is an uncapitalized redirect, and if one types in the capitalized phrase, it goes to that page, and redirects from there, making the capitalized redirect page unnecessary. See "<a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_lodge_of_ontario.html" title="Grand lodge of ontario">grand lodge of ontario</a>" and how it will redirect anyone who enters "Grand Lodge of Ontario" in the same way. <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer">Osgoodelawyer</a> 23:01, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I see that that only works in the search box, and not if there is a direct link to Grand Lodge of Ontario. Still, it's unlikely that someone would create a link to the incorrect page, but if you don't mind having multiple redirect pages, I'm cool with that. <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer">Osgoodelawyer</a> 23:07, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What? a bad faith nomination because my prod comments were different than my AfD comments? I am not aware of any Wikipedia policy stating that these have to be exactly the same. My original prod comment was, "does not meet notability requirements." Of course, my prod was promptly removed because you said that it did, "not indicate why TV documentary series would be nonnotable."

<li><b>Response</b>. My experience has been that when the AfD nominator names the editor who object to a prod or speedy listing before discussing the reasons for the nomination, it's a personal deal, not related to the appropriateness of the article. And IMDB isn't exactly where one would expect to find info on Canadian TV documentaries. If the nominator had assumed a minimum of good faith to begin with, he'd have done more than a superficial check; nothing about the article indicated hoax or negligibility. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 18:55, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>I am truly disappointed in this nomination. This is a nomination to pick on the newcomer. Really we have school articles (thousands). By deleting this article you are inherently trying to make a precedence to delete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_school_stubs" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_school_stubs" rel="nofollow">350 some articles that exist on schools</a> (and that's just in Canada. Get real, get a pro-active wikilife! Become a creationist and start adding to article instead of looking to destroy them. Not only that but I as per <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> there are no real valid reasons to delete this. I strongly consider this nomination to be wrong. I also believe that as nominator you should retract this afd and furthermore I suggest that you the nominator add {{Category:Canadian school stubs}} to the bottom of the article so next time you'll remember that school do exist!!!

<dd>The article exists as a vanity article for the school's football team only. Isotope tried to improve the article. We both said that you can't dedicate an article to a football team.

<dd>Ignoring the notability question for a moment, lets assume this gets kept because those interested in school inclusion are rendering opinions. I simply want to issue a challenge to anyone voting Keep to monitor this article and protect it from it's creator, who basically created it as a vehicle to publicize the Lakeshore Catholic Highschool 2003/2004 football team. I've tried to edit the content so it's at least a real school stub... but I can't sit here and engage in an endless edit war with the creator by myself.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 00:33, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If I was an administrator I would investigate these aligations of "vandalism" however, that sounds like it may turn out to be something of an edit war or even a violation of 3RR.

Once the edit war is complete then perhaps you may need an advocate (such as myself).

<p>This is aimed at Hahnchen for his rude, vulgar description of something that needs nothing more than what Gwernol wrote. I'm interested; why did you search for this page if you didn't want the information held within it? Do you randomly search pages to delete? Do you not have something more constructive to do? Such as write an article? Or donate to charity? Do you know how long it took me to write what is there? Sure; delete it if it's unencyclopædic (you spelt it wrong by the way), but after reading how you assert yourself I can't help thinking how little (if any) value to mankind you'll be. I don't want to be a part of something designed to share knowledge if it causes those who think they know best to adopt a discourteous derogatory façade simply because they don't approve. This page is publicly viewable so I can't show as much impoliteness as I would like. Good day to you Sir Специајіист горизонтајіьній создатејіь 01:55, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>User "Discopinster" is clearly not the sole objective force in deciding whether or not this venue is "notable." This venue has meant a great deal to very many people in michigan, and the subjective nature of a claim such as the one made should be reviewed. The entry "Haterhouse" has recently been edited, sources cross referenced and many internal links added (all of which obviously qualify to have their own wikipedia entries.) reconsider this, please.</p>

Unlike Ice age 3 the resident evil movie was properly sourced and made it through the afd. So the issue here is not on Cristaballism it is more on reliable sources. As is, the Ice age 3 article does not have enough substance (verifiable information). So as per the nomination of cristallism I shun the idea and even suggest it be renominated for deletion for lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. (lack of verifiable information.) You might be wondering why I did not vote delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> BTW: Seano1: you're incorrect. Operation Iraqi Freedom was the official name of the invasion. I'm acutely aware of this: sitting above my monitor is a certificate of service from the commander of the US 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade thanking me for service in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Furthermore my <a href="../../../d/d/2/DD214_38ee.html" title="DD214">DD214</a> and all of my pay stubs are coded Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Noble Eagle. Though you do provide a link, your reasoning is faulty. OIF was the name of the invasion operation. Cobra II was, according to Naylor, a "codeword" for the act of deposing Saddam from his regime. There is a difference between the operational invasion, and the goal of regime change: they were two different things, though closely related. Just thought I'd clarify this. This last part is not directed at anyone here, but I'm really getting sick of ignorant people claiming the name OIF is propaganda, to justify their own biases against the war. Whether you think it's right or wrong, the name is factually and undisputedly official: thus it's part of history. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 08:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
