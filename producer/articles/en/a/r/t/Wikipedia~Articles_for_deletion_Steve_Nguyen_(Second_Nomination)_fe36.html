<p>There are many Steve Nguyen out there such as myself. And I know I've done a lot more than this guy ever will. He's not a famous actor. He's a want to be famous actor with an unsuccessful company as far as I can tell. This is for his own self glorification and commercialization. I'm a CEO of my own company. Does that mean I get a Steve Nguyen page too? No, it's ridiculous. I've been googling for his company. It's not even an important company. It's his own two bit startup operation. Additionally, his first name is "Steven", not Steve.<a href="../../../e/g/g/User%7EEggy7726_090c.html" title="User:Eggy7726">Eggy7726</a> 05:07, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

His voice acting in video games (which games? what roles? the article doesnt tell us - they may well be obscure freeware games and/or minor roles (or it could be a completely false claim) and there needs to be verifiable reliable evidence that he has a special reputation for voiceacting and is not just a random guy - why do people assume without evidence that this claim about voice acting is something impressive or "probably notable"? As for the TV appearances, all his acting credits are as obscure extras<a href="http://www.tv.com/steve-nguyen/person/235308/appearances.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tv.com/steve-nguyen/person/235308/appearances.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - "crowd member", "Asian kid") and his small company are certainly not encyclopedically notable based on the article details. We also have no evidence that he is a prominent young entrepreneur (has he been profiled in <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_Company_b7e2.html" title="Fast Company">Fast Company</a>? Did he ever get a mention in the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>? Has he ever been interviewed for <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_magazine.html" title="Wired magazine">Wired</a>?). I checked out his personal and corporate websites - I came away with the impression of a guy with a huge ego, rather than indications that his company is a serious enterprise. IMDB profile only lists non-notable short films mostly yet to be released (no, an IMDB profile does NOT guarantee notability - their control for entries (esp. for in-production entries) is not stringent... one of the films listed as a production credit is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_1_Second_Film_a9a9.html" title="The 1 Second Film">The 1 Second Film</a> which is a gimmicky way of raising money by letting anyone sign up as a producer in exchange for $ (there are 5000+ producers) ). Taken the article at face value (ignoring verifiability concerns), the subject appears at best to be of modest local community or campus level of notability <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Followup</b> Regarding Steve's game credits, here is listing under that nameon the game credits database, Mobygames:<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,15606/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,15606/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which shows that Steve has primarily worked as a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playtester.html" title="Playtester">playtester</a> ("quality assurance") - which is about as far down the video game developer food chain as you can go. His single production credit is of dubious signficance, as he is also credited as a playtester on the same game (any game producer for a major company worth their salt does not get credited for "quality assurance" on his/her games, though obviously he playtests them). In any case, the video game career as a whole is not notable enough for a video games trade magazine, and certainly not enough for an encyclopedia. As for the voice acting, he was involved with sound on a couple of games - as the dwarf voice in Stonekeep<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/stonekeep/credits" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/stonekeep/credits" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (along with 20+ other people doing other roles. dwarf appears near the bottom of the voice credits). He was also one of three people on the sound effects team for Battle Chess 4000<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/battle-chess-4000/credits" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/battle-chess-4000/credits" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> the first afd discussion was closed poorly by an admin who did not exercise any judgement (afds are <i>not</i> determined by simple voting, but this one was treated as such), and that discussion would be a candidate for deletion review. The only evidence given by the keep voters in that first afd to demonstrate the subject's notability was a page from an <i>extras database</i> detailing his roles as an <i>extra</i> in a few tv shows, for which sometimes he was totally uncredited in the official show credits.

<dd><b>Comment</b> since anyone can add their own profile to Zoominfo for free (as the very link provided above says "This summary was created using information submitted by this person" i.e. by Steve himself), and claim whatever they want to claim in their zoominfo profile, this is hardly a reliable source. Even if it was, the zoominfo profile seems to use the same content as the wikipedia article, so there's no convincing assertion of encyclopedic notability.

The pictures are of this guy but none of the credits remotely match; no performance credits are listed at all, which raises some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> issues.

<dd>Yes, I think its possible though not certain - IMDB is not well policed and not very reliable unless its a famous celebrity page which would be policed by their agent. it may be that this Steve Nguyen signed up for the 1 second film and got mixed up with another guy) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:19, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Followup on films</b> I looked into this further, and I think this article's Steve Nguyen is the same person listed on IMDB. However all the films are crappy independent films, and when I looked up the film "Star Child: The Beginning" for which he has an associate producer credit, I found that <a href="http://www.rodeohard.com/view_category.asp?cat=55" class="external text" title="http://www.rodeohard.com/view_category.asp?cat=55" rel="nofollow">I too could be associate producer on this film for the modest sum of $49.95</a> (scroll down linked page). There are already 13 "associate producers"<a href="http://www.starchildthebeginning.com/cast.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.starchildthebeginning.com/cast.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, so its kind of crowded (though no uh... screenplay writer or director yet apparently).
