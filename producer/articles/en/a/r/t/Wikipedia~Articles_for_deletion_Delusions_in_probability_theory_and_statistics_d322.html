<li><b>Delete</b>, Yes, I agree, it is “original research”. Though attempts to explain definition of independence of events by means of “knowledge” and “information” are widely widespread in the probability literature but while I did not manage to find publications on the theme of these delusion. Only the simple Stoyanov's example where it is shown, that except for probability nothing operates independence of events.

After thinking about the article while rewriting it (and reading a comment Helgus makes on his <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHelgus_ab18.html#Discussion" title="User talk:Helgus">talk</a> page), I've come to realize that it's not especially different from a page like <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_infinitely_differentiable_function_that_is_not_analytic.html" title="An infinitely differentiable function that is not analytic">An infinitely differentiable function that is not analytic</a>, or any of the other paradox pages we have.

<li>PS: I realize that I haven't explained why it should be kept. Firstly, the reference casts doubts on the OR claim.

<dd>As explained by <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelgus_b293.html" title="User:Helgus">Helgus</a>, the lead paragraph is OR, but he took the example from the reference. Only, it is not clear what it is an example of. In Helgus words: "it is shown, that except for probability nothing operates independence of events". Maybe <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> can translate this for us. I don't discern any delusion or paradox in the example. See also Helgus' comment below.

<dd>Why split the discussion? An AfD debate is a discussion in itself; no reason to have part of the discussion on the talk page.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I don't understand your remark on the talk page at all. The article does not talk about information after Ryan's rewrite. Perhaps you could cut out the sarcasm if you want a technical discussion?</dd>
<dd>The point of the example is that the events <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are independent in the sense of probability theory, if p = 1/2. However, they are not independent in the usual sense of the word, as both depend on the throws of the coin. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 14:34, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As I understood it when I did the rewrite, the phrase "it is shown, that except for probability nothing operates independence of events" was intended to mean that in a mathematical (as opposed to physical) probabilistic experiment, events are "shallow": the only pieces of information are the descriptions of the events and the probabilities of each outcome, which are independent of the events themselves. This is the (or one of the) sentence which led me to believe that <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelgus_b293.html" title="User:Helgus">Helgus</a> was talking about lack of causality and hidden information. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 14:42, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article states that the terminology "independent events" has the unfortunate side effect of implying that "non-independent events appear to embody some kind of <b>information</b> one about the other", and this is then presumably a form of the misconception of the title. I tried to show by a very simple example that this is not a misconception but that indeed they do. The article also states as another form of the "misconception": "both [independent events] are constrained by a third, underlying variable". In the example of the article, both A and B <i>are</i> constrained by the same triple of outcomes of other events. It is almost as if the example was produced to illustrate that the presumed misconception is in fact not a misconception. The article was originally written with the purpose of showing that the lead paragraph of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_independence.html" title="Statistical independence">Statistical independence</a> was based on a delusion. This was later reiterated by the author on the talk page of Statistical independence. I assume the example given is indeed from Stoyanov's book. If it is not a counterexample to the "misconception" identified in the article, then what is it a counterexample to? I can only guess, but my best guess is that it is a counterexample to the following false claim, which is <i>precisely the converse</i> of the alleged misconception: "If two events are statistically independent, they are also independent in the sense that they are not constrained by a third, underlying variable". That this claim is indeed false is shown by Stoyanov's example for the case <i>p</i> = 1/2. I don't know if this is a common misconception, and I don't know whether Stoyanov claims it is one, but in any case it is not the misconception from the article. If the example is merged into Statistical independence purely as an example of showing how you can compute for this case whether the events A and B are independent, that's fine (although as an example for that it is needlessly complicated and not particularly appealing). If it is incoporated as a counterexample, we'd better find out from Stolyanov's book (which I don't have) what it is a counterexample to. The "misconception" from the article is unverifiable "original research" as far as I'm concerned. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:25, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't agree that the concept is original research, just as any example in mathematics, appropriately accompanying the theory it's a part of, is not original research (up to a point). It is not unencyclopedic to give examples of what something is <i>not</i> as part of describing what it <i>is</i>. This content should go in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_independence.html" title="Statistical independence">statistical independence</a> in this capacity. The example is not worthless either, as it illustrates <i>part</i> of the irrelevance of causality to statistical independence. Would it be original research to provide one or two more as illustrations of the rest? <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 20:14, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The above sentence contains a switcheroo from "concept" to "example". The example is not OR. The concept is. The concept is not the example. You write: "appropriately accompanying the theory it's a part of" — but that's at least a big part of what is at issue. The example is <b>not</b> an example of what is described in the lead paragraph. What is described in the lead paragraph is <b>not</b> illustrated by an example contained in this article. But even if it were an appropriate example, is the theory it is supposed to accompany and be a part of (presumably that which is described in the lead paragraph, or else what) a notable concept in probability theory, or is it just someone's misguided pet peeve? How do we know without reliable source? I can write an article about the common pitfall of making a copying error, replacing a "2" for a "z" in a formula, and illustrate with a valid example how that leads to an incorrect result. Is that then not original research because there is an example accompanying it, even though it cannot be properly sourced as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>? --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:07, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a huge difference between swapping 2 and z, and swapping causal and statistical independence: the first one has nothing to do with anything more general, but the second one is an important part of understanding probability. To be clear: I think the "concept" is that of statistical independence, and I think that the allegedly original idea in this article is a clarification, similar to a statement like "In number theory, (<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>) refers to the greatest common divisor of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> rather than their inner product or their ordered pair". It's a necessary clarification because when people conceptualize dependent events they think of causality, just as in the previous sentence, it would be necessary to clarify for an analyst that a commonly used symbol does not have the accustomed meaning. Before we enter another round of this, please indicate whether you think that such a clarification is necessarily OR. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 03:14, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally I don't think it is necessary to state that statistical independence is not implied by causal independence. I'm not even sure what that means and if it is true. If you feel it is a welcome addition to the article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_independence.html" title="Statistical independence">Statistical independence</a>, please edit it, citing your source for this claim, of course; we don't need this deletion debate for that. If you then further wish to claim that this is a common misconception among non-mathematicians, please cite your source for that as well. And if you go on to provide an example, laudable by itself, please find an example that indeed illustrates the issue. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:35, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I added the notion of self-independence to both this article and the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_independence.html" title="Statistical independence">statistical independence</a> article, since this notion more briefly illustrates the difference between statistical independence and vernacular notions of independence. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 19:52, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Isn't it misleading to write, just like that, "an event is independent of itself"? Here is a less dry everyday (literally) example. The event of the sun rising today has no bearing on the probability of it rising tomorrow (assuming that probability to be 1), so these events are statistically independent, even though having a common underlying mechanism. I hope this example is illuminating (pun intended). --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:01, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That example is not as paradoxical in my opinion, since it does not address actual events of probability zero nor does it address the odder notion that something can be statistically independent of itself. I think the notion that an event can be independent of itself is powerful due to the seeming paradox; it gets to the heart of what the original author was saying, that independence is only statistical not philosophical or absolute. I have the example of picking 0.5 out of the unit interval in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_independence.html" title="Statistical independence">statistical independence</a> entry (to which I could add the Durrett reference if needed). Unfortunately, nontrivial real-world examples are hard to come by, since possible but zero measure events imply infinite divisibility or infinite time, either of which is arguably not a given in the current universe. Even the sun rise example need not be an <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almost_sure.html" title="Almost sure">almost sure</a> event (e.g., what if the earth is destroyed by a comet, etc.). (Perhaps a physicist could come up with a simple-to-understand real-world example where zero measure does come into play, one that both expert and layman can understand and agree upon, but I'm no physicist.) <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 03:52, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
