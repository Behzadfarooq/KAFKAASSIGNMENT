<p>Subject is not notable. He does not meet the criteria of notability for Wikipedia. The two sentences which claim notoriety are unsourced. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetuser500_3903.html" title="User:Netuser500">Netuser500</a> 15:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> He appears to be notable in his field (that field being conspiracy theorists). You may (or may not) consider him to be a nut-job, but that doesn't make him non-notable. Important nut-jobs are notable. He gets 43,000 google hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Kenn+Thomas+conspiracy&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Kenn+Thomas+conspiracy&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which for some things isn't much but for a conspiracy theorist seems like a lot. A lot of those hits are on Amazon and such advertising his book and his magazine; but some like this <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/GetTimeZone.aspx?redirect=/Gorightly" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/GetTimeZone.aspx?redirect=/Gorightly" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> are interviews that he's given on various topics. The article is unsourced and that needs to be fixed, but just a cusory google search leads me to think he is notable and should be kept. ~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small> 16:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP:</b> He has written several books from several publishers, none of which are <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity presses</a>, contributed to books by other authors, publishes a magazine, writes for other magazines (including <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortean_Times_295c.html" title="Fortean Times">Fortean Times</a></i>), makes occasional appearances on AM and Internet radio as well as broadcast television, and lectures both in the United States and Europe on a frequent basis -- and he is not a "nut-job" (whatever that phrase may mean to you), but a serious, sober researcher. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidkevin_1642.html" title="User:Davidkevin">Davidkevin</a> 19:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The criteria for <i>notable</i> is whether there are things published <i>about</i> him, <b>not</b> whether he has published his own works. I've quoted the criteria for authors in my remark above. Serious researchers usually have PhDs and experience as hired <i>researchers</i> at one or more universities. There are more than 1.4 million Google hits for "Anthony French" who is a notable professor. Mr. Thomas does not seem to me to meet any criteria of <i>notable.</i> BTW, I don't believe you should have removed my earlier signature from this page. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetuser500_3903.html" title="User:Netuser500">Netuser500</a> 20:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr. Thomas has professional research qualifications through his "day job" as an archivist at the Western Historical Manuscripts Collection in the Thomas Jefferson Library at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Missouri_dceb.html" title="University of Missouri">University of Missouri</a> at St. Louis, which I mention only to show those qualifications, with no endorsement by the university of his opinions or conclusions implied.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Without meaning to get overly personal, I have to confess that I wonder if this possibly has to do with you're not personally being familiar with Mr. Thomas' work? I've never heard of Anthony French, but I wouldn't make a similar claim for that reason as I don't know everything or everybody in every field. However, I do know that in his field, Mr. Thomas is regarded as a rigorous scholar.</dd>

<dd>As far as "notable", while it isn't academic, he has been a guest on the nationally-syndicated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Bell_b332.html" title="Art Bell">Art Bell</a> radio program at least twice that I'm personally aware, as well as on nationally-cablecast television and smaller-market radio programs. He writes regularly for the <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortean_Times_295c.html" title="Fortean Times">Fortean Times</a></i>, an internationally-published magazine about which there is a Wikipedia article, and lectures across the United States and in Europe.

<dd>I haven't done any particular searches on what other people think or say about him -- I never knew it was a requirement in order to write or edit an article about a person who is prominent in his field, even if that field tends to be beneath the notice of the mainstream press.

<dd>I see what I wrote is ambiguous. I am not accusing Mr. Thomas of using a vanity press. I am saying that to be notable, other people must have written about him. How many biographies of Mr. Thomas are available at your local library? A separate criterion for notability is the winning of awards for his works. Another is multiple independent reviews of his works. He fails all of these criteria. As for "professional research qualifications," he is not a professor who performs research for his university. He is an archivist, and his job has nothing whatsoever to do with the topics in his published work.</dd>

<dd>Here's another official criterion "If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor (based on the U.S. practice of calling all full-time academics professors), they can and should be included."

Although that page lists several criteria, any <b>one</b> of which is sufficient to be "notable," Davidkevin <i>cannot</i> name one which Kenn Thomas meets.

<dd>. . . Some folks on the political margins are feeling more maligned than usual these days. "When people talk about conspiracy theorists since Oklahoma City, they're talking about these militia types," says Kenn Thomas, editor and publisher of Steamshovel Press, a small St. Louis magazine.
