Since both are also advocated by some Liberal scholars, the term, "Constitutional Conservatism," is a contentious term and not particularly widely-used. The claim that the Founding Fathers were "pro-life, pro-religious freedom, pro-fair trade, pro-gun rights, and are almost universally strong supporters of private property rights," is an unscholarly, uncited, highly controversial, and wholly unfounded claim. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocracy_2cef.html" title="User:Robocracy">Robocracy</a> 12:43, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Retain</b>. Even though this is actually a redundant term because the essence of Conservatism includes a belief in strict adherence to the U.S. Constitution, it should be retained. In fact, this article should be expanded because the aspect of "Constitutionalism" in Conservatism is often taken for granted. Since the underlying principles upon which Conservatives base their belief system is the U.S. Constitution, and the current article on "Conservatism" lacks a detailed analysis of this aspect of Conservatism, this article should not only be retained but also should be expanded upon. Either that, or someone needs to undertake the task of adding a "Constitutional" description to the article on "Conservatism". Anyone who has read the "Federalist Papers" and related documents will easily find that the Founding Fathers were in fact, pro-States Rights, pro-religious freedom, pro-free market, pro-private property ownership, pro-Second Amendment to the extent that this included private ownership of weapons deemed basic to a people's-based militia, and the argument can be made that the Founding Fathers left matters like "abortion" as a matter for the States to determine legality. Since true "Constitutional Conservativism" is not something that is supported by true liberalism, it is a belief system that needs better clarification either as a stand-alone article or incorporated strongly into the article of "Conservatism". Even a small yet well-defined political party in the U.S. exists that is almost a perfect adherent to "Constitutional Conservatism". Check out: <a href="http://www.constitutionparty.com/party_platform.php" class="external free" title="http://www.constitutionparty.com/party_platform.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.constitutionparty.com/party_platform.php</a>. The "U.S. Constitution Party" prides itself on following the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. So, in summary, this topic, whether it remains a separate article or is incorporated into Conservatism must be included as a basis for Conservatism. <a href="../../../j/t/p/User%7EJtpaladin_87ec.html" title="User:Jtpaladin">Jtpaladin</a> 18:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please remember that our articles must be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">written from a neutral point of view</a>, and not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. This means we can't just have an article say, "this is constitutional conservativism because that's how one should read the Federalist Papers". Rather, an article on this topic would be along the lines of "Constitutional Conservatism in the U.S. is understood by a) this notable organisation to mean its political position, which is XYZ, as reported by this <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, b) a term used by notable theorist J. Doe to mean ABC, as reported by this <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, etc." Do you see what I mean? Oh, and another thing to keep in mind: Wikipedia is an international project. There are constitutions and conservatives in other countries than the U.S., too. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 19:53, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would agree with you if there were enough sourced information in this article to support even a one-sentence stub - but there isn't. And since I guess you're talking about the U.S., I suppose no U.S. Conservative would call themselves an "<i>un</i>constitutional conservative", so this article would get rather unwieldy rather fast. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:03, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jtpaladin and Neofreak, as noted above, I recognize that the term is used in political discourse, and the term is a broad generalization about Conservatives' views of the Constitution. Well, being so, there's not enough to say about that to maintain an article. The entire article, if properly sourced, would contain one sentence only: "Conservatives in America tend to assert a belief in textualism, as a basis for their beliefs." Not exactly a lot of content. Also, as I also said, the term is ambiguous because there are people who agree the Constitution should be upheld literally as the text plainly says, yet share liberal views. And so, the article on <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textualism.html" title="Textualism">textualism</a> is sufficient, covering the topic in a politically neutral manner. In fact, in hindsight, I think it would've been better to simply edit the article and send a re-direct to <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textualism.html" title="Textualism">textualism</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocracy_2cef.html" title="User:Robocracy">Robocracy</a> 21:25, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Question</b>Do you believe that the term is not used or unique enough to warrant a stub or do you think it is just a misused neologism that has a POV slant? Honest question. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 21:30, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Robocracy, I did not remove any of your comments. I find that untrue and insulting. I only responded to your comments directly under where you made them. If you don't want direct answers, simply state it and I will not do it. Your claim to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="WP:Vandalism">vandalism</a> is inappropriate considering the meaning of "Vandalism" in Wikipedia. If you have a more direct reference to vandalism and the method which I chose to respond, please direct me to it. Nevertheless, all your objections simple fly in the face of fact as I demonstrated in my responses. <a href="../../../j/t/p/User%7EJtpaladin_87ec.html" title="User:Jtpaladin">Jtpaladin</a> 15:58, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
