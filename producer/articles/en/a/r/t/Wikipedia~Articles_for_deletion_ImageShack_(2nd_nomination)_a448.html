Looking at the criterion, I think the original nomination correctly points out that it doesn't fit the criterion. I haven't worked with wikipedia closely enough to know about these policies, but it seems common sense for anyone familiar with using image hosts that imageshack is by far one of the biggest out there. It's obviously not going to be covered in news publications - what kind of mainstream publication writes a story on image hosts, and bare-bones image hosts (unlike flickr) at that? The lack of media coverage doesn't mean imageshack isn't big and widely used, take a look at Alexa: [<a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?cc=US&amp;ts_mode=country&amp;lang=none" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?cc=US&amp;ts_mode=country&amp;lang=none" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], currently #64 website worldwide, and the third largest image host behind flickr and photobucket. Also, for what it's worth, 36 million google hits vs. 44 million for photobucket. <a href="../../../t/e/j/User%7ETejastheory_c89d.html" title="User:Tejastheory">Tejastheory</a> 20:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not clear to me how the article survived the first nomination, if the participants were aware of the policies. I assume they were different back then, or enforced differently. I don't deny that ImageShack is well known and widely used, but that by itself doesn't fulfill the criteria. Neither does Alexa, which merely provides a short summary of what the site is and statistics of how many users of Alexa's software visit the site. --<a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 21:31, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Looking at the criteria that you linked to, I would have to agree that imageshack probably doesn't fufill those, but I'm not all that familiar with wikipedia notability policies. Surely, even without 'formal' media source, imageshack is one of the most widely well-known image hosts, and certainly one of the most top-trafficked - doesn't that count for something? <a href="../../../t/e/j/User%7ETejastheory_c89d.html" title="User:Tejastheory">Tejastheory</a> 21:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Both of your sources are highly questionable, due to their own relative obscurity and the fact that the cited stories read like press releases. I believe that Mashable exists purely for publishing "press release" materal submitted by the owners of sites themselves. That would essentially be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:RS">self published source</a>. Further, if it is indeed a legitimate blog, then it is also not a reliable source according to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. --<a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 18:02, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As it was pointed out, while self-published its allowed as long as the writer is a well known journalist which is the case since the author is a journalist for guardian.co.uk, so yes its quite reliable in that case. After some looking, you might be write about that particular article on Biosmagazine. Their top articles don't look like press releases as there is some editorializing in them, and it doesn't appear to be a blog, but in this case, the article is actually a mash up of several press releases. So while the content is reliable, that particular source can't be used to establish notability. Though there is still a point of common sense here, and realization that notability guidelines are not policy, and some critical thinking should reveal that while there isn't a lot of independent coverage it is the 52nd highest traffic website on the internet and the third largest image hoster. Its notable by virtue of its use.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 18:27, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Right now, the article is only an entry that belongs in an "internet guide", not an encyclopedic article. Popularity among the Internet community does not make a subject notable by itself, although this is understandably hard for Wikipedia editors to step back and realise, since most of us are familiar with that kind of thing. The article should be deleted because it will never get better; there are no facts to document that will show Imageshack having historical significants or major achievements (notwithstanding their glowing press releases published on artificial blogs). --<a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 14:57, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is an internet encyclopedia so popularity among internet users does make it notable. This website also isn't something that is mildly popular either, its within the top 100 websites on the internet. There are probably tens of thousands or more of articles on wikipedia which have no historical significance, I was unaware that that was a requirement, nor are major achievements. You've already admitted its a popular website. We also know how popular a website it is. Your proposal for deletion was based on the fact that you didn't think it was notable or in other words not popular or well known. In the context of people who would be online and reading this encyclopedia, imageshack is popular and notable.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 15:16, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think sheer use makes it notable. Being in the top 100 of trafficked sites and being the third largest image host in the world means that there are millions of users that engage in its services or view images that it hosts. ImageShack is not this big, but imagine if there was a single website that hosted the majority of all image content on the web. Sure it may not have social networking features or garner press coverage (because it's a mundane thing), but that fact alone makes it notable and relevant. <a href="../../../t/e/j/User%7ETejastheory_c89d.html" title="User:Tejastheory">Tejastheory</a> 20:59, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
