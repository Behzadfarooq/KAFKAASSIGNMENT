<li><b>Don't Delete</b> <font color="#FF0000">I feel, along with many that this is a valuable page, not only is it informative, it had no vandalism involved within it(as all events were tidied up that same day), and the school were fine with everything that happened, and even sponsored many of the events that took place. This should remain on Wikipedia, as it is educational for other schools, and in order to inform those who do not know about or what a //Muck-up Day// is. Please do not delete this as it represents a memorable and historic year for Highgate School and it's history.The event is clearly true, and can be further proven by the photographs. why is this a non-notable event or an article that falls under "Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense"? Having read both articles for both notability and BJAODN, it clearly doesn't fall into either category! within our school, and most other public schools in the country, a muck up day is common for every final year on the last day. The day consisted of fun, no vandalism and pure enjoyment between teachers and students. Within the discussion section, people are arguing for their desire for the article to <b>NOT</b> be deleted.jackp59</font></li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> -- How can you even think about deleting this?! This is a notable event for thousands in the North London area!

<li><b>Do not delete</b>As another comment states, all that is written in this article is factual account of the day's true events.

<li><b>Do not delete</b>Surely the number of comments on this page demonstrates the 'importance of the subject matter'. It was not only an important day in the history of one of the oldest educational institutions in Britain, in the history of the tradition of muck-up day, but also hugely important to all those who witnessed the day and were involved in it.b</li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> -- I am a keen wikipedian and one who was a witness of the event. In my, humble, opinion, it has a right to be on wikipedia as it was the most successful muck up day for a long time and the culmination of 13 years of highgate for many students. However, perhaps what makes it stand out most is that it marked the first completion of a co-educational 6th form- something which defied hundreds of years of highgate's history and made this day so monumental. This is certainly a notable event. Seb. SebM 14:27, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b>-- An important memory for all those involved. The actions that took place on the day were in no way insulting or demeaning to any party and the spirit of the day was enacted in a manner which was light-hearted and regarded well by both teachers and students alike. Given the significant amount of time and effort put into the events of the day, i do not see why the event should not be recorded on this website. It offends no one and those wishing for it to be deleted need to understand that the memory of the day is important for the students, for the teachers, and for the future Highgate School pupils. This article is not promoting or advertising an act of vandalism, but an act of celebration and unity amongst the pupils. 86.142.25.244 12:26, 30 May 2006 (UTC)Dean M</li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> -- I cannot see any good and justifiable reason for deleting this page - it is far better constructed and referenced than many other so-called "legitimate" events pages on wikipedia. The event was very real, and marked an important milestone of the first cohort of girls to graduate from highgate. It was also a very special day for all involved. This is certainly a most notable event!! Luc</li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> -- Definitely a notable event, and one which a site like wikipedia should record the history of. Would be a shame for something as enjoyable and fun as this to be lost in the sands of time. Worthy of record. SidVonDagger87.80.30.125 14:30, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I see no reason as to why this article is up for deletion. Wikipedia, in essence, is exactly what its slogan says it is i.e. "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit". Encyclopedia's are a source of information and tend to be useful resources. However, Wikipedia, as highlighted by Payneo, has limited information on Muck-up days in general and I see absolutely no reason why this article cannot be used as a prime example of what muck-up days should be about: having fun, having a laugh and making it one of the most memorable days of the school calender. This particular muck-up day is a milestone in Highgate School's history, as it is the first time that girls have participated in the tradition and this surely makes it a notable event, as not only does it mark the start of the evolution within Highgate but also shows how far Highgate has come not only as a school but as a community. I beg to differ and would like to ask <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">User:Starblind</a> where and in what form the "vandalism" actually took place? Also, <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">User:Starblind</a> goes on to say that Muck-up day is an "unofficial event at a single school". However, this statement is false as A) it is a traditional event at Independant Schools in the UK and so B) occurs at schools nationwide and internationally as <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">User:Capitalistroadster</a> points out that they had on at Mulwaree High School in Australia.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>While this article may seem to be of limited importance I would argue that this is not the case. From reading what is frankly a very well written and witty account I have a number of observations. Firstly with over 100 people involved in the proceedings it seems that this page is not without a solid base of interested viewers. Secondly, coming from England I am well aware of the tradition of muck-up days and it is in this light that I believe this page is of great use. Many pupils take the opportunity of leaving school to cause violence to the local community, run riot and generally create unberable havoc. However the ideas used by the Highgate pupils were neither destructive nor troublesome to locals or staff. Therefore if in future years pupils searched wikipedia for inspiration for their own muck-up days then Highgate school seems like an exemplary example to follow. A final point I would add is the standard of written English in the article would no doubt also act as something which more unruly pupils (who would have already been disuaded from dangerous actions) could learn something from. Well written and commendable, i hope this is not deleted.86.138.120.15 14:46, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>"Votes" was a bad choice of words. What I meant to say was that I agree with all the comments made above in support of deletion. Wikipedia cannot have articles on every annual "muck-up day" in every school around the world – and nothing in this article suggest that this muck-up day was more significant than the many thousands of others. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 09:32, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This article provides a prime example of a successful muck up day. Other than this article Wikipedia has less than 100 words about muck up days - events that are part of a tradition for many secondary schools in the UK and across the world (in particular Australia). There is very little published information anywhere for those wanting to find out more about muck up days; this supplys those interested with a great illustration of one. Payneo 15:12, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This would be a good argument for expanding the <a href="../../../m/u/c/Muck-up_day.html" title="Muck-up day">Muck-up day</a> article on Wikipedia to include more general information about the type of things that commonly happen at muck-up days around the world. But it's not a reasonable argument to justify why Wikipedia should have an article about one specific muck-up day at one individual school whose muck-up days are not any more significant than those at any other school around the world which has them. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 10:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Cannot be verified"??? 500 pictures will not have been faked 'Molerat'...your argument seems to revolve around the fact that other, more significant events do not have wikis - this is a non sequitur. The article itself also points out that it is of interest to both the many thousands of Old Cholmelians and much of the North London community. It is time to remove the chip from your shoulder and get rid of your prejudices against private schools and their 'traditions'. It is only by working from the bottom-up that Wikipedia serves its purpose. This is my vision of the Wikipedia of the future.<b>Keep</b>129.67.43.240 23:39, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
