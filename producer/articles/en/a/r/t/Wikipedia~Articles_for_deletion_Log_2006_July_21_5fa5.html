<li>Dr Hoeflin is indeed notable. He has been written up in various books, mainstream magazines, and has also been the subject of television interviews. He is one of the pioneers of high-end psychometrics. He was the first -- or perhaps second -- person to create an IQ test that would reliably measure IQ above 3 standard deviations above the norm. These tests were carefully and extensively normed and received widespread media attention. This is especially important because in the area of very high-range psychometrics -- which can perhaps shed much insight into the nature of minds and IQ in general -- there is virtually no-one at work.
<p>For the past ten years, he has been at work writing a book which selectively filters and organizes philosophical concepts. The first two volumes of this book, "Encyclopedia of Categories", have been published. They are almost 700 pages each, and contain much original and noteworthy thought.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.12.116.65 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.12.116.65.html" title="User talk:64.12.116.65">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.12.116.65_02eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.12.116.65">contribs</a>) 2006-07-21 15:30:48 (UTC)</small>I have just created a user account.

<li><b>Keep</b> But DELETION will doubtless be done, and by some hip-hop high school student who has been a sysop for a few months. Here is the State of Wiki re deletions: "Despite excellent efforts put forth by many of you (and I thank you for the help), the Mega Society article has been deleted. I see that the Hoeflin article has also now been nominated for deletion, and I suspect that this is suggestive of a trend. Coincidentally I was talking with Stephen Wolfram a month or two ago and he commented that he had noted that Wikipedia articles were actually growing shorter on average. When one reads "deletionist" credo on Wikipedia, the main reason given for deleting articles is that too many articles tend to junk up lists. In other words, the world is too complex to fit into a neat categorization, so let's just prune the world to fit. This is reminiscent of attempts to "reform" language. In the end the reason given for deleting the Mega Society entry was that people had never heard of it. So slowly Wikipedia is regressing to the mean, which is something like an eighth grade reading level." Perhaps everything be deleted except of course any hip hop articles. And this must be done ASAP obviously, to protect the Wiki notability. SOUTH 18:22, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While I understand your frustration, your blanket charecterizations of all sysops as teenage hip-hop aficianados is insulting, immature, and patently false. I also note from my associations with various High-IQ societies that there is often a correlation between their members and an inflated sense of self. Not all of us whom G-d has blessed with IQ's significantly above 150 need to broadcast it to the world and preen. Anyway, innate intelligence is more often a gift (although honed and sharpened by use) and not something we should use to foster a sense of superiority. <i>Au contraire</i>, it should engender humility. That being said, we have standards. For better or for worse, and in this I mourn our society's fall with you, <i>hoi polloi</i> have ascribed a noteriety and notability to people with the ability to run together monosyllabic, mispronounced, bastardized words to some rhythmic structure, and shower them with money and fame. Is it something we should be proud of? No. At this point in history, does that phenomenon exist? Yes. I daresay that the author in question here would be recognized less, be it his work, his appearance, or any other element, than the #500 rapper on some chart. He fails notability in my opinion, and in the opinion of many others. Is this “fair”? Doubtful, but it is the case. Also, my personal opinion is that <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa.html" title="Mensa">Mensa</a> is notable for its size and its scope, regardless of the immaturity of many of its individual members. Mega, Giga, Promethues, and the like have nowhere near the membership, name recognition, world-wide dispersion, or influence of <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa.html" title="Mensa">Mensa</a>, and all of them, as they stand now, likely fail our standards. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 18:47, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The mere existence of a <i>single-member</i> IQ society where the member has an IQ of, say, 250 (even as measured as a child) would be highly notable. And how else would such a society gain recognition (as if it needs it to be worthy of note) if encyclopedias summarily dismiss it?

<dd>1) The issue of "junking up lists" seems of little relevance on the internet, where one doesn't have to worry about huge printing costs, huge volumes of paper, etc. One could look at the internet as an electronic junkpile or treasure trove (dependig on one's perspective) of lists - i.e. "links" allowing readers to follow webs of association as far as they want.</dd>
<dd>2) Proponents of "delete" cite issues of "notability", a term which has also been acknowledged to be ill-defined, its interpretations subject to the biases/whims of the writer or judge.</dd>
<dd>2a) Often, the ostensible (surface) motivation behind a decision is merely a mask, hiding deeper, truer motivations. This leads to isues of "political Correctness". Our society has indoctrinated us to believe in PCness as a virtue and means towards ultimately greater tolerance and humanity; doubters have been coerced into publically pretending belief in the creed. The underlying dogma - that we really are *fundamentally* equal (vs. "equal in legal rights") assuages many people's fears. We all know that some people currently seem smarter and/or more talented than us; at the same time, a part of us fights against acknowledging that levels of ability in some areas may be largely innate. We can save face when looking in the miror by saying "He and I are innately equal; he merely benefited by more opportunities, lucked out in the crap shoot of life."</dd>
<dd>Persons and groups whose existence and/or work threatens the ego-massaging opiate of PCness are due for deletion.

<li><b>Comment:</b> How is Hoeflin less "notable" than the Miami Beach Senior High School - just one of many urban high schools with the list of celebrity grads (scattered over decades) that one would expect from many large, urban schools? Is Wikipedia "cluttered" with info on the thousands of urban high schools in this country - most of which are of interest only to their students, staff and alumni? Does such information possess the potential scientific or cultural importance that would render it valid as "encyclopedia material"? Hoeflin's work, although perhaps known by few, at least has import to scholars investigating high-end psychometrics (whether or not they agree with his findings, the findings themselves may have seminal value.) <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESol.delune_b60c.html" title="User:Sol.delune">Sol.delune</a> 20:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)sol.delune</li>

Now, how would it be to cut the crap, and move on to deleting his beloved articles straight away. I mean, I can do it on my own, just substitute the content with whatever.

<dd>Stevan, anything you say as an anon will be ignored if the closing admin follows the Mega Society's deletion process of just counting the non-anon votes. Of course head counting itself at the end of an AfD is a clear violation of Wiki policy -- but it seems an established illegal practice. I am going to take things to a higher level, but in the meantime I strongly urge you to create a user account and talk page. Byrgenwulf is a menance to Wikipedia and needs banning before he does any further damage as the self-styled leader of the anti-IQ Jihad -- you can be most effective in restoring sanity by completing the login and registration process yourself. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>Self-styled leader of the anti-IQ Jihad?!? Mr Price, please substantiate that accusation. I think the user you are addressing in the message above is a far greater menace than I, looking at the vandalism/"experimenting" he has just performed on an article (see below). I'm not an anti-IQ Jihad -indeed, the more I think about it, the more I would like to see an article on high IQ subculture; I merely do not wish to see Wikipedia abused as a repository for arbitrary information. And I certainly don't think I need to be banned. I have done nothing wrong! This article was not nominated by me, nor even a "collaborator", but instead by <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a>, who judging from his talk page seems to be a respected member of the Wikipedia community. Indeed, there have been 5 "IQ-related" nominations of late, of which two came from me, two from <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a>, and one (the Mega Society) from <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a>.

<dd>I fail to see how describing someone's argument as "non-notable" is uncivil -- the description was applied to the assessment made, not to the user, and, furthermore, seemed IMO to be valid: it <i>was</i> contradictory. Although it does help show what a "load of old bollocks" the notion of notability is; it is now used a subjective, meaningless phrase that is bandied around when ever someone doesn't <i>like</i> something. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. After reading this lengthly debate and checking out the article it seems to me that this "high IQ guy" must warrent an article. Not because he is a high IQ guy but merely because this stub is quite good even though it is weak on the <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a> side of things. Certianly this is not a vanity page but it is a weak article overall considering its lack of sources and is in dire need of them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I find it amusing that you will delete entries based upon a supposed lack of "notability". How can you define such a nebulous thing? Psuedouridine is a rather small niche molecule that only biochemists interested in tRNA synthesis would have any knowledge of. My remark goes to your approach to a supposed "open" community forum, where anyone may post information for others to peruse. What I think you have by introducing "deletions" are a group of petty people that will, in effect, enact a New Speak effect upon your webpage--eventually obviating it, as a more useful and less restrictive online encyclopedia comes along. I will cite one example of this and you can mull this over amongst yourselves. There is a very notable person, Ronald K. Hoeflin, former contributor to OMNI magazine and inventor of intelligence testing at high levels of deviation from the norm. He is also affiliated with Marilyn vos Savant. She too is notable for her high IQ and parade magazine contributions. Soon you will be routing all those persons form your webpage, because some snippy high-school student or misanthrope is offended that they aren't a genius, or just for malice. Anyway, that aside, the point is Ronald has been designated as a possible entry for deletion. I don't intend to get into your system and attempt to play by "your" rules. I want you to know that they are flawed. There was no common consensus on the removal of the entry for "Mega Society" -- yet you allow ample space on your webpage for people to engage in family tree history and so forth. I suggest you review that recent case and tell me if it makes sense to you. And is it true that the final decision for the removal of the entry was placed into the hands of an 11th grader? No wisdom to age correlation I suppose? I would say all of wikipedia is under siege by modern day internet grafittists that will remove information for whim and add what they and their peer group find trendy---where is the factuality then? I for one can find other sources for information, however for your enterprise here at Wikipedia, I see it slipping. But as a professor, I feel inclined to point to this as an example to students and colleagues that your webpage is not as valuable or serious source of information as previously thought. If I cannot rely on you to report the whole truth, bad and good, then how can I count on you at all? It should be up to the readers and consensus editing to articles to enrich them.... but to remove them outright? Ronald K. Hoeflin does exist, and he is a philosopher too. Will you be removing Descartes, Kant, Spinoza, Socrates, and Plato? I just see no end in sight to your silly WebPages system...you eventually will self-reduce to a compendium of 8th grade trivial pop-culture and not a vast source of knowledge of the larger spectrum of humanity.<a href="../../../t/k/r/User%7ETKRIB_77c2.html" title="User:TKRIB">TKRIB</a></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> [Added by old_skul] This AFD is a personal vendetta against the site and should be summarily discounted. Although the article could use some cleanup, it's clearly a page in history for many people and serves as a historical record of many of the social interactions that make internet forums generally interesting from a social standpoint. It would be detrimental to Wikipedia to remove this article. Old skul 15:02, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> [Added by DwarfVader] As the page describes Tribalwar has been a part of internet history, much in the same way that Something Awful, and the person named Maddox. Both have articles writing on Wiki, just as Tribalwar does. If Tribalwar were to be deleted for the reasons stated above those entries would have to be removed as well as they fall EXACTLY under the same qualifications that Tribalwar does. Bugs or Shane recently created his own unfourtunate drama over at Tribalwar, that resulted in him making an ass out of himself. He blames Tribalwar for this very incident and thus has choosen to attempt to have this article deleted in an effort to "get back at Tribalwar."---DwarfVader 04:41, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> TribalWar is a relevant staple of the internet and gaming community. It has referential ties to other similar websites such as Something Awful and 4Chan, and has several notable "claims to fame" such as interaction with CNN and Tribes community-specific LAN events. TribalWar is the last resource for any Tribes/Starseige/Earthsiege content and continues to renew its content to compete with modern gaming resources. This proposed deletion is a purely personal and spiteful event due to TribalWar forum mockery/embarrasment of Shane "Bugs5382" Froebel, and further discussion is a waste of Wikipedia resources. As noted by TribalWar Site Administrator Anthony "Rayn" Maio, Shane Froebel was a TribalWar staff member who was fired from the site several years ago, and this proposed deletion is only part of his ongoing vendetta against the community. --Fboftwfame 04:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Tribalwar is a great forum and has a lot of users. It deserves a wiki. Shane's personal problems with the site triggered this and that is not fair to Tribalwar. This AFD request is an abuse of Wikipedia 67.80.77.53 06:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Unseemly personal issues aside, www.tribalwar.com is deserving of a wikipedia article for several reasons. Firstly, due to the fact that it is directly linked to the popularization of the All Your Base phenomenon. The AYB movie that was cited in Newsweek as being one of the first incidences of homespun viral media was developed from original tribalwar forum content, and was posted there for the first time. The site and its content are therefore a legitimate part of history from an internet content perspective, and may serve as a reference for viral content history and research. Secondly, the CNN hotlinking episode, although minor, is a footnote that serves as a useful cautionary tale for internet content providers with respect to the practice of hotlinking. The many thousand people who were subject to the incident may or may not be aware of its background, and considering the sizable population of those affected, it is entirely justifiable to think that they may want a record of what really happened at that time. As such, the site is notable. However, it still admittedly requires some editing and provision of direct sources. LogRoller 06:28, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't see how this article meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which, by the way, is only a guideline, not "policy". The sole rationale provided for why this article meets WP:WEB above—that it has been covered by the press—is not sufficient, in my opinion. Note also that the presence of other articles on non-notable stuff on Wikipedia does not excuse or justify the presence of this article on a non-notable stuff. As regards sock puppets, you might have a technically valid point that these voters are not sockpuppets but meatpuppets.

<li>I agree that personal attacks on Shane should be kept out of this DISCUSSION (for the second time, this isn't a black and white VOTE sir). However, may supporters of the Tribalwar wikipedia article reacted in this manner because Shane's nomination to delete their article is based entirely on recent events on Tribalwar pertaining to images of his sister. Shane has even gone so far to try and negotiate with Tribalwar, reportedly stating "I will withdraw the Afd, if you can convince everyone, and I mean everyone on TW to post zero information on me and my family members ever again. That included everything: pictures, transcripts, images, and etc. everything. And that is the only compromise that I will give. One thing is broken, I will re-add it to AFD." I agree the Tribalwar wiki article might need some work to get it up to standards, but this is a gross misuse of Wikipedia administration tools by Shane. -Bonafide 67.174.18.197 14:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Whether the article should be kept or deleted is based on the merits of AfD nomination and the subsequent comments of other wikieditors. If the article has enough merit for inclusion in Wikipedia, then it will often survive the AfD process regardless of the nominator's motivations. With that said, most of the keep votes have either engaged in a personal attack against the nominator, outright declared this as a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a> nomination, or both.

<li>That's kind of an elitist attitude. Yes, I recently registered my account. That does not mean that I have not been using wikipedia as a source of information for a number of years now. I created my account so I could provide my opinion of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribalwar.html" title="Tribalwar">tribalwar</a> entry. I find this type of accusation insulting. the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribalwar.html" title="Tribalwar">tribalwar</a> wiki entry has existed since March of 2005, (possibly earlier than that, but the edits only show the last 500).

<li>Yes you are correct, being wholly unverifiable is a reason for deletion. My argument is that TW is indeed verifiable and does have citable sources. Just because the TW wiki page currently lacks those features does not mean it should be deleted out-of-hand. People citing those policies want this page to be deleted because of that without realizing the article can improved not deleted. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddps4cat_f103.html" title="User:Addps4cat">Addps4cat</a> 17:15, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you wish to argue that the article is verifiable, then <i>cite the sources that you argue can be cited</i>. For best effect, <i>cite them in the article</i>. Adding citations of reliable sources to an article is one of the best ways to argue that it should not be deleted. Just claiming that there are sources, without citing them or even giving a single clue as to what they are, holds little to no water, on the other hand. <b>Please cite sources</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:51, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personal attacks are never rightfully aimed at anyone on Wikipedia (<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>). Calling users meatpuppets is certainly uncivil (also a violation of policy: <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>) and possibly also a personal attack. Your criticism here is valid, and I at least will openly admit to not considering WP:CIVIL inviolable and knowingly making (possible) personal attacks. But this accusation is not random or unjustified. In my opinion, meatpuppettry is an apt and evocative description of externally influenced collusion (I have provided the evidence earlier) to sway consensus on Wikipedia, which makes one of the most fundamental and inviolable policies—indeed the backbone—of Wikipedia, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>, impossible.

<li>Alexa is misleading for this type of site since Alexa basically measures page views, and sites like this get tons of reloads from their users. 80th on big-boards is pretty feeble IMO.

Big-boards itself is pretty specialized, so 80th place is really no big deal. It might be evidence (not conclusive) of notibility if a site is in Big-boards top 10, but certainly not 80th. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 22:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I agree wth <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielross40_5058.html" title="User:Danielross40">Danielross40</a> in that this is likely a bad faith nom but that does not excuse the fact that this article does not verify anything with outside sources. Also, I found the language very inclusive and after reading the article in full i did not come away with much valuable information about Tribes or even thefurum itself really. So, if this article gets a rewrite with NPOV and is given good sources i would suggest keeping it. But until then this article is mainly useless for the outsider as a peice of esoteric fan/gamecruft.-<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: larger"><a href="../../../%28/c/h/User%7E%28chubbstar%29.html" title="User:(chubbstar)"><font style="border: solid 2px orange; background-color:#991199" color="white">(chubbstar)</font></a></span> <sup><small>— <a href="../../../%28/c/h/User_talk%7E%28chubbstar%29.html" title="User talk:(chubbstar)"><font color="#FF4F00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_%28chubbstar%29_19f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/(chubbstar)"><font color="#FF4F00">contrib</font></a> | <font color="#CD00CD">14:51, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</font></small></sup></li>

<li><b>Delete if</b> there is no verification in the following week. The strip seems to have had its fame on a mailing list, which wouldn't register Google hits. Further, its heyday is in the distant past, by Google cache standards, so the claims are possible, but there would need to be some <i>lasting effect</i> of this former "meme" for there to need to be an article. Things like "All Your Base" are dead horses, but they persist a bit. Has this? The article doesn't give us reason to believe it did. Did it lead to some outgrowth? The article doesn't tell us.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that some of the article is completely useless especially the development. The player trends has importance and should mention that Blizzard now includes DotA Allstars as part of the tournaments. Does need citations, but that is difficult to find whereas if you actually go on Bnet you will see more people play DotA than any other custom map. Outside of the game development section, the article is not a game guide as it does not suggest what heroes/items do. What I think is most important is that this is the ONLY version of DotA still played. That combined with its popularity and inclusion in tournaments should merit a keep. <a href="../../../t/c/l/User%7ETclphz_3fbe.html" title="User:Tclphz">eventine</a> 14:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

If DotA:Allstars is the version use for that and is the <i>only</i> version of DotA still being played, why not just merge whatever useful information there is into that article?

<dd>DotA article is a history of the development of DotA spin offs, but none of the other games are really popular to such an extent. In my opinion, the DotA articles should be merged.

<dd>Typically, people who want to keep the information but not the article vote something like <i>Merge</i> or <i>Trans-wiki</i>. There also is no reason that we can't merge the information now and make the vote irrelevant. Do you really think identifying the source of every character is encyclopedic? There like 49 characters and 20 items. That seems like excessive detail. Regardless, if that's the information here that ought to be retained, let's copy it to the main article and be done with this. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 17:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The article is nonsense and OR, and can be speedied as such - the author is essentially multiplying a physical constant by some random value that came from nowhere. The idea could be added to the <a href="../../../o/b/s/Observable_universe.html" title="Observable universe">Observable universe</a> article. But all the values I see here are suspect, and don't specify what they are talking about. Does mass mean baryonic matter or all matter? Either way, if one assumes that the "mass of a critical density universe" listed on the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Orders_of_magnitude_%28mass%29.html" title="Orders of magnitude (mass)">Orders of magnitude (mass)</a> is for the observable universe (otherwise we can't really go converting density to mass, can we?), then the mass of the observable universe given there implies that <span class="texhtml">Ω &gt; &gt; 1</span>, and more like 2, which is really wrong, so I assume something must be wrong with those values (or I am not thinking coherently). I'm removing them for now. An easy order of magnitude estimate would be <span class="texhtml">Ω<sub><i>m</i><i>a</i><i>t</i><i>t</i><i>e</i><i>r</i></sub>ρ<sub><i>c</i><i>r</i><i>i</i><i>t</i></sub><i>V</i><sub><i>o</i><i>b</i><i>s</i></sub></span>, and is probably obvious enough that it can't be considered OR, but I don't want to do anything like that right now.
<p>As for the IJTP article, I can't get to it, and it isn't in Citebase. It is really old, too (1994), before any of the really accurate measurements of the important values. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 10:22, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Haven't looked at the IJTP article, I only wanted to demonstrate that the subject of the article was a valid one, eventhough the article itself was complete crap, which in my opition would just require a rewrite by someone with some knowledge of the field (not me in this case) and not an AfD. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 05:47, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Otherwise an intelligent layperson might well wonder, <i>if the universe has infinite extent and finite matter density, how can it have a finite mass?</i> There are many subtle points lurking here, but the first thing which needs to be explained is that the "observable universe" is defined wrt some event, such as "here on Earth in rougly 2000 AD", and corresponds to a finite region of spacetime whether or not the universe itself is infinite in extent. Of course, once you understand the meaning of the term, "mass of the universe" begins to look a bit silly. "Average density" is less silly, but also needs to be explained; do we try to estimate "density now" (e.g. on some hyperslice orthogonal to the world lines of dust particles in an FRW model) or "density averaged over places we can see as it was at the time which we can see now from where we are" (e.g. averaged over past light cone from here and now).

Michaelson also competed in Olympic Trials, narrowly missing the Olympic team (highest honor for a US swimmer) and competed in the Connocophillips National meets.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> thanks to the attention paid the page by not one but two different editors, the notice was gone for 25 minutes in total. I can't speak to extension policy, so it may be that one would automatically lie. If it's some sort of totality of the circumstances test, I'd hope the prompt replacement would weigh heavily in favor of no extension. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 01:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The AfD is running 16-5 keep, so an extension seems pointless. Keeping the AfD around for another day or two means the final would be maybe 19-7 keep.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't imagine how this could be considered to border on copyvio, and more than any other TV episodes' descriptions would.

<li><b>Keep</b> – A TV series that airs a list is not cruft in-and-of-itself. I also agree with several people on here that GSN is <i>NOT</i> a minor cable network; while it is certainly not on the level of networks like ESPN or MTV, it most definitely has a niche audience (just like ESPN and MTV, incidentally). Speaking of which, a regular list-type show that airs on MTV or ESPN isn't considered cruft, but a list-type show that airs on GSN <i>is</i>? PS – If there is copyvio issues, send it to another editor for a rewrite; problem solved.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> this is no less crufty than a show like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Greatest_Canadian_f665.html" title="The Greatest Canadian">The Greatest Canadian</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/c/Hockeyville.html" title="Hockeyville">Hockeyville</a> and it is a very useful reference which is not found elsewhere (not even on GSN's website) - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 02:36, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> What Qaqaq said. This isn't just a list, it's also a television series airing on a cable network that's available to more than half of US households. I even get it up here in Canada. There are articles on TV series here that are a lot more obscure, or air on networks with much less saturation. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilraven_ff94.html" title="User:Kilraven">Kilraven</a> 02:40, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Тhis has gone beyond being serious. It's become a joke. Wiki as a concept sucumbs to its own openess due to the will of a handful of people who make judgments on whether articles are qualified for entry into an encyclopaedia, yet none of the handful involved has any qualifications to do so whatsover, other than being here long enough. That makes Wiki an utterly silly thing. There are thousands after thousands of entries of anonimous people, but the handful of puberty (or God knows what other problems) striken guys is after the IQ related ones most likely in order to prove to themselves that "these horrible, undiscovered creatures of misterious aptitude can be overcomed afterall". Well, you know what, Wiki is not all that important as you would like it to be. Stevan Damjanovic</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> And you know, the joke is on Wikipedia and the admins. As you can see from Byrgenwulf's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=20060721074248&amp;target=Byrgenwulf" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=20060721074248&amp;target=Byrgenwulf" rel="nofollow">contribution history</a>, his very first edit to Wikipedia was on July 2, 2006. He made a few innocuous edits (and waited a week, patient boy) before beginning his onslaught against the CTMU article (and everything else related to Chris Langan). In light of this and the other specific deceptive tactics outlined by Tim Smith on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_July_20" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_July_20" rel="nofollow">AfD review page</a>, this user should be permanently banned. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 14:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This seems to have become a massive campaign now to thoroughly discredit me: if any passing admins could do something about it, I would be grateful. "Singlemindedness", DrL? Compare your editing history and mine...see how many different articles I have worked on, look at the article I am busy with in my sandbox etc. Drl, on the other hand has only edited articles to do with Langan, as has been pointed out by many over the past few days (not that that isn't her right, of course). And as for "deceptiveness"...Tim Smith never said I was being deceptive, he actually expressed willingness to work with me because I seemed the most co-operative among the editors who wished the CTMU to go. I think "deceptive", DrL, might however be used to describe linking to an out of date editing history, as you have done above. I am not making mayhem, but trying to make Wikipedia a <i>legitimately</i> better encyclopaedia, not by filling it with vanispamcruftisement, but by cleaning up articles that need help, writing new ones on neglected topics, and so on. And I actually <i>apologised</i> to DrL (see her talk page) for if what I have done has caused upset, because I strongly believe DrL is personally involved in many of these articles (I could be wrong, but an apology is not out of place, even then). Please stop this nonsense now, DrL. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 15:13, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> User CH/Hillman evidently fails to understand what a "shill" is. Strangely, the definition is right there on the Wikipedia page to which he links. Here's how "shill" is defined on that page: "A shill is an associate of a person selling goods or services who pretends no association to the seller and assumes the air of an enthusiastic customer."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The author of this article is not selling goods or services; the Ultranet is a project of the Mega Foundation, a nonprofit (charitable purpose) entity obliged to spend everything it takes in on its own maintenance. Nor is the author playing the role of seller or customer. Thus, the "shilling" allegation is just an abuse of the deletion process.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Wikipedia page continues: "In some cases, the members of an organization or the employees of a company may monitor and/or participate in public discussions and groups. Such people are not shills, since they don't attempt to mislead others." Anyone accusing anyone else of "shilling" would therefore need to present evidence that misleading information has been included in the article. If that were going to happen, it would already have happened.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia's anti-shilling guidelines are intended to prevent hucksters from using Wikipedia to fatten their bank accounts and enhance their personal prospects and the value of their personal interests. But that clearly isn't the case here. So please desist with the abusive and unsubstantiated allegations. <a href="../../../a/s/m/User%7EAsmodeus_3d16.html" title="User:Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> 19:56, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Asmodeus, if you had read further in that article, you would find <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shill.html#Shills_on_message_boards" title="Shill">here</a> the following sentence: "In online discussion media, such as message boards, discussion forums, and newsgroups, shills may pose as independent experts, satisfied consumers, or “innocent” parties with specific opinions in order to further the interests of an organization in which they have an interest, such as a commercial vendor or special-interest group." Now, whatever the articles of incorporation of the Mega foundation might be, and even taking into account that Wikipedia is not a message board or a "blog" (despite how some people choose to use it), the MF surely counts as a "special interest group". Therefore, someone who is affiliated to that group, particularly in an official capacity, and acts in a forum such as Wikipedia in manner promoting the interests of that group (like demanding that it have an article about it when it hardly merits it), <i>without declaring their interests</i>, is shilling. By definition. Moreover, DrL was caught posting links in the "Chicken or the Egg" article, posting links to the Mega Foundation website <b>which ask for money to view</b> (proof: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_chicken_or_the_egg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55761260" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_chicken_or_the_egg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55761260" rel="nofollow">here</a> is her edit; <a href="http://www.megafoundation.org/MegaPress/Titles/aokpreview.html" class="external text" title="http://www.megafoundation.org/MegaPress/Titles/aokpreview.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the link she posted). Now, I'm not sure where that money goes to, whether it is the Mega Foundation's coffers or Langan's own pocket, and nor do I care. But I do think that this action constitutes a gross abuse of Wikipedia for monetary gain. And, once again, shilling, as well as "link spam", <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanispamcruftisement_fe39.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanispamcruftisement">Vanispamcruftisement</a> and countless other offences. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 20:03, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That would have been my preference, but the TOC was a pdf page that did not identify the book. So I linked to the page that talked about the book, and also linked to the TOC.

<dd>That's a feeble explanation, I think. The link in question wasn't just some obscure little button on the corner of the page, the sole purpose of that page is to sell copies of Langan's book: right in the middle is a big $10 price tag, with Paypal information, etc. etc. Right at the bottom is a <i>tiny</i> little link to the ToC, which is clearly an ancillary purpose of that page. And I find it very difficult to assume good faith, DrL, in light of the amount of "good faith" you have assumed about me and <i>my</i> intentions. Nonetheless, I merely have merely stated facts: other users may interpret them however they wish. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 20:31, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Participants in this AfD should be aware that its initiator is engaging in vendetta. User Byrgenwulf registered at Wikipedia on July 2, 2006, three weeks ago, and launched an all-out editing/AfD attack on Christopher Langan, his notable and widely-publicized theory the CTMU (which Byrgenwulf irrationally disputes, but was quickly shown not to comprehend), the Mega Foundation, the Ultranet, and so on <i>ad nauseam</i>. Byrgenwulf even hurled himself into an AfD against an IQ society to which Langan once belonged, within minutes of its inception through the offices of a prior confederate. To illicitly gain support for his personal blitzkrieg against the CTMU, Byrgenwulf transparently misled and recruited people sympathetic to his viewpoint from areas of the Wikipedia web complex not directly related to the topic of that article, tarring it in the process. This is called "abuse of the deletion process", and it violates Wikipedia policy.</dd>

<dd>User Byrgenwulf is in the deceptive habit of demanding verification for everything he disputes - that is, everything he can dispute - until he manages to identify a verificative link which he can paint as violating some aspect of Wikipedia policy (all nonprofit entities solicit donations; they need to do so in order to survive, and nobody is allowed to personally profit from this). This gives him a pretext for expanding his attack, preferably with accompaniment by an unwitting chorus which he has actively misled and recruited from inappropriate sectors of the Wikipedia community. Regarding Byrgenwulf's spurious "shilling" allegations, people who post articles on Wikipedia are virtually all interested in the topics of those articles, and therefore belong to "special interest groups" associated with those topics. Ordinarily, they do not post a detailed confession regarding the exact nature of their interest; it is sufficient that they maintain neutrality, verify their edits, and maintain relevance to the topic at hand. User Byrgenwulf is simply attempting, once again, to twist and misrepresent standard practice at Wikipedia in order to gain a dishonest advantage over his victims.</dd>

<li>That sounds rather paranoid, and doesn't accord with the facts. I nominated this and the Ultranet, while other people nominated those other articles entirely unbeknownst to be.

<li><b>Comment</b> DrL, no-one and nothing is being "attacked" here. I don't really care about high IQ societies, personally, but I do care about Wikipedia being used by people to glorify themselves, their lovers, or their organisations by writing articles about them and then demanding they stay here on such tenuous grounds. I run a small non-profit organisation, and by the standards you are applying, DrL, I could write an article about it and put it here (it's been in the press a few times etc. etc.). But I don't, because I have self-respect, and because I am not vain enough to need Wikipedia to somehow "legitimise" or "verify" my organisation, even if I make the feeble excuse that "the article is to inform people": my organisation does not merit an encyclopaedia article at the moment, and I have the self confidence to admit that. I think the dignified thing to do is to wait until <i>someone else</i> sees the group as having sufficient import to merit an encyclopaedia article about it: this isn't a directory, a search engine, or a "who's who"; it is a reference work, a tertiary source. And, an encyclopaedia article about an NPO should discuss its myriad achievements and the contributions it has made to society (that determines its "notability"). I see none of that in the Mega Foundation article, which simply reads like a blurb in a business directory, with links to a website at the bottom. If you're so concerned, DrL, about all the other articles on these groups, why don't you nominate them for an AfD? Unless, that is, this "DrL" account is solely restricted to commenting on a certain individual, his ideas, and his clubs. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 06:59, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wikipedia is not a repository of people's "theories". It is an encyclopaedia, which means it is a tertiary source. But I must say, I agree with the comment on the "high IQ" subculture's behaviour: I would never have expected <i>this</i>...please, though, do not make the mistake of thinking that everyone with a high IQ is necessarily involved with these clubs or their petty squabbling for precedence; these groups have a tiny fraction of the membership they statistically could have - maybe that's why they feel they need to use an encyclopaedia to advertise. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 06:59, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He made a few innocuous edits (and patiently waited a week) before beginning his totally obsessive onslaught against the CTMU article (and everything else related to Chris Langan, including many high IQ societies and high IQ individuals). In light of this evidence of his single-mindedness and the other specific deceptive tactics that are outlined by Tim Smith on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_July_20" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_July_20" rel="nofollow">AfD review page</a>, this user should be permanently banned for making a mockery of Wikipedia's AfD policy and creating general mayhem. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 14:38, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b>: This seems to have become a massive campaign now to thoroughly discredit me: if any passing admins could do something about it, I would be grateful. "Singlemindedness", DrL? Compare your editing history and mine...see how many different articles I have worked on, look at the article I am busy with in my sandbox etc. Drl, on the other hand has only edited articles to do with Langan, as has been pointed out by many over the past few days (not that that isn't her right, of course). And as for "deceptiveness"...Tim Smith never said I was being deceptive, he actually expressed willingness to work with me because I seemed the most co-operative among the editors who wished the CTMU to go. I think "deceptive", DrL, might however be used to describe linking to an out of date editing history, as you have done above. I am not making mayhem, but trying to make Wikipedia a <i>legitimately</i> better encyclopaedia, not by filling it with vanispamcruftisement, but by cleaning up articles that need help, writing new ones on neglected topics, and so on. And I actually <i>apologised</i> to DrL (see her talk page) for if what I have done has caused upset, because I strongly believe DrL is personally involved in many of these articles (I could be wrong, but an apology is not out of place, even then).

To prevent possible misunderstanding, note that I acknowledge that it is not always inappropriate for X to edit and article about himself/herself/her organization, but in such cases, in my view, common sense and good manners dictate that X should disclose his/her identity. I believe that <i>good edits</i> will be easily recognized as such. But here we are talking about edits which seem to several users including myself to be misleading or unbalanced, and in such cases it may be appropriate to inquire about the IRL identity of the users who made those edits. DrL complained <i>" I would like to make a note here that some individuals are targeting Chris Langan and any group that has any connection to him"</i> This remark suggests--- at least to me--- that she may not fully appreciate the magnitude of the problem at Wikipedia with vanity cruft. I see no reason to think that anyone is "targeting high IQ organizations", but I <i>do</i> see good reason to try to remove vanity cruft. I think this goal would be best served in the case of Mega Foundation by deleting the article. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 22:26, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Enough, already. User CH/Hillman has no right to demand anyone's personal identity, and evidently fails to understand what a "shill" is. Strangely, the definition is right there on the Wikipedia page to which he linked above. Here's how "shill"is defined on that page: "A shill is an associate of a person selling goods or services who pretends no association to the seller and assumes the air of an enthusiastic customer."</dd>

<dd>The person who wrote this article is neither selling goods and services - the Mega Foundation is a nonprofit (charitable purpose) entity obligated to spend everything it takes in on its own maintenance, with nothing left over to put in anyone's pocket - nor in any way playing the role of "seller" or "customer", "enthusiastically" or otherwise. All he/she is doing is describing the Mega Foundation as it is described in its own articles of incorporation. So "shilling" is out of the question. It's just a nasty accusation designed to abuse the deletion process.</dd>

<dd>Now, here's an important news flash for Hillman and those who are citing his abusive opinions. Here at Wikipedia, using a handle is not considered "misleading others". If it were, then 99% of the people on this site would be "misleading others". So to establish "shilling", we'd need to find some piece of misleading information in the article. But CH/Hillman doesn't seem to have done that.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia's anti-shilling guidelines are sound.

<li><b>Comment</b> Asmodeus, if you had read further in that article, you would find <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shill.html#Shills_on_message_boards" title="Shill">here</a> the following sentence: "In online discussion media, such as message boards, discussion forums, and newsgroups, shills may pose as independent experts, satisfied consumers, or “innocent” parties with specific opinions in order to further the interests of an organization in which they have an interest, such as a commercial vendor or special-interest group." Now, whatever the articles of incorporation of the Mega foundation might be, and even taking into account that Wikipedia is not a message board or a "blog" (despite how some people choose to use it), the MF surely counts as a "special interest group". Therefore, someone who is affiliated to that group, particularly in an official capacity, and acts in a forum such as Wikipedia in manner promoting the interests of that group (like demanding that it have an article about it when it hardly merits it), <i>without declaring their interests</i>, is shilling. By definition. Moreover, DrL was caught posting links in the "Chicken or the Egg" article, posting links to the Mega Foundation website <b>which ask for money to view</b> (proof: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_chicken_or_the_egg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55761260" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_chicken_or_the_egg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55761260" rel="nofollow">here</a> is her edit; <a href="http://www.megafoundation.org/MegaPress/Titles/aokpreview.html" class="external text" title="http://www.megafoundation.org/MegaPress/Titles/aokpreview.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the link she posted). Now, I'm not sure where that money goes to, whether it is the Mega Foundation's coffers or Langan's own pocket, and nor do I care. But I do think that this action constitutes a gross abuse of Wikipedia for monetary gain.

<li><b>Comment</b> User Byrgenwulf has already been caught massively abusing the deletion process. He has a blatant vendetta against Christopher Langan and everything for which Langan stands and with which he is associated. (Byrgenwulf has nominated a number of articles for deletion in the last several days, and Langan is the common denominator in all of them.) That is what he is doing here, and how this AfD was motivated. This user (Byrgenwulf) is in the deceptive habit of demanding verification for everything he disputes - that is, everything he <i>can</i> dispute - until he manages to identify a verificative link which he can paint as violating some aspect of Wikipedia policy (all nonprofit entities solicit donations; they need to do so in order to survive, and nobody is allowed to personally profit from this). This gives him a pretext for expanding his attack, preferably with accompaniment by an unwitting chorus which he has actively misled and recruited from inappropriate sectors of the Wikipedia community. Regarding Byrgenwulf's spurious "shilling" allegations, people who post articles on Wikipedia are virtually all interested in the topics of those articles, and therefore belong to "special interest groups" associated with those topics. Ordinarily, they do not post a detailed confession regarding the exact nature of their interest; it is sufficient that they maintain neutrality, verify their edits, and maintain relevance to the topic at hand. User Byrgenwulf is simply attempting, once again, to twist and misrepresent standard practice at Wikipedia in order to gain a dishonest advantage over his victims. (What a surprise.) <a href="../../../a/s/m/User%7EAsmodeus_3d16.html" title="User:Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> 21:04, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I merely wish to see Wikipedia cleared of the plague of vanispamcruftisement from which it has been suffering, and it seems many other users also feel that its purpose is not to provide a worldwide open source "blog" for people to post their achievements here. And Wikipedia is also not here as a platform for NPOs, no matter how noble their aims, to solicit funding. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 21:16, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm simply informing people of the facts. Byrgenwulf registered at Wikipedia on July 2, 2006, three weeks ago, and launched an all-out editing/AfD attack on Christopher Langan, his notable and widely-publicized theory the CTMU (which Byrgenwulf was quickly shown not to comprehend), the Mega Foundation, the Ultranet, and so on <i>ad nauseam</i>. Byrgenwulf even hurled himself into an AfD against an IQ society to which Langan once belonged, within minutes of its inception through the offices of a prior confederate. To illicitly gain support for his personal blitzkrieg against the CTMU, Byrgenwulf transparently misled and recruited people sympathetic to his viewpoint from areas of the Wikipedia web complex not directly related to the topic of that article, tarring it in exactly the way we see here. This is all a matter of record. With all due respect, I ask that Byrgenwulf at least try to tell the truth. <a href="../../../a/s/m/User%7EAsmodeus_3d16.html" title="User:Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> 21:50, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Are you really insinuating that the members of Wikipedia:Project Physics are all blithering idiots who can so easily be misled by such a stupid, incompetent fool as you make me out to be? For example, the eminent mathematician <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Rubin_108b.html" title="Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a>, who said that the CTMU would be credible only among pseudo-intellectuals, and caught you out on grounds of factual errancy in one of your other rants against me? I have never been "shown not to comprehend" that silly "theory", because I have not wanted to indulge in a debate on it here (my snide remarks on the talk page notwithstanding), but I have repeatedly extended an invitation to anyone willing to defend it to discuss it elsewhere, an offer which has been ignored, repeatedly. Moreover, my efforts in the CTMU article led to the discovery of a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">"walled garden"</a> of vanity, advertising and illicit soliciting of funds (the "chicken and egg" article wasn't the only place that fundraising link was posted), none of which Wikipedia exists to support. Looking at the contributions of DrL and Asmodeus should prove that they are both <i>solely</i> interested, here at Wikipedia, in editing articles pertaining to Langan and his great and wondrous achievements. <i>That</i> is a matter of record; what Asmodeus has said is a matter of opinion, I am afraid, and a grossly slanted opinion at that. I would be ashamed of myself, if I were Asmodeus, carrying on like this. But perhaps that's just a peculiarity on my part. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 22:10, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You certainly succeeded in misleading <i>some</i> Wikipedia:Project Physics members. Again, this is a matter of record (you deliberately misrepresented a philosophical theory as a "pseudoscientific" theory of "physics" to them after being repeatedly corrected on that score). Arthur Rubin - who has not actually demonstrated any familiarlty with the CTMU - is apparently one of your unwitting victims. You certainly <i>should</i> be ashamed of yourself, if only for contriving to compromise the reputation of somebody being promoted, whether justifiably or not, as "an eminent mathematician". I would not have edited the CTMU article at all save for your discombobulated attack on it, and the same probably goes for others. You most certainly <i>have</i> been "shown not to comprehend" the CTMU, and yes indeed, it began right on the talk page for the original article. Not unrelatedly, there is just one thing the matter with your "repeated invitation" to "discuss the CTMU elsewhere": you clearly don't know enough about it to make it worth anyone's while, and you argue in such a way that such a discussion would be like trying to pin down a squirming eel. (Perhaps you could persuade Mr. Rubin to stake his reputation on such a discussion? Now, <i>that</i> might actually intrigue somebody.) <a href="../../../a/s/m/User%7EAsmodeus_3d16.html" title="User:Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> 22:59, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

He was drafted by a major team four years ago, but apparently ended his career after the 2003-04 season without ever making it out of the minors.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I fall heavily on the side of inclusionism, and don't see how keeping this article around until it can be expanded hurts Wikipedia; Wikipedia is not paper; obscure content isn't harmful; all schools are notable, et cetera; all the usual arguments — I won't waste your time with that. This is my alma mater, and though I haven't edited the article, I would hate to see it deleted. But I'm very busy and don't have a lot of time to expand it at present, and as it's been almost a decade since I graduated, I feel I lack the perspective to give it a fresh and current treatment.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As to its notability, AHS does produce a lot of National Merit Scholars (I was one) and does excel in test scores. It offers many advanced classes and programs (it was recently accredited with an <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Baccalaureate_b6c1.html" title="International Baccalaureate">International Baccalaureate</a> <a href="../../../i/b/_/IB_Diploma_Programme_9f29.html" title="IB Diploma Programme">Diploma Programme</a>). Its sports teams have at times won statewide acclaim. But about the most notable thing about it from my perspective is its excellent band program, which involves an astounding portion of the student body (about a quarter of it in my day), many of whom are also the academic leaders of the school (most of the National Honor Society is in band). The concert bands have the longest string of consecutive superior ratings at state contest in Alabama (at forty years), and the marching band routinely excels in competitions in the highly competitive arenas of Tennessee and Georgia. The bands have performed for governors and presidents. If anyone else thinks this is notable, I would be glad to write it up and add it to the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think this article is a lost cause. Austin High School is at least as notable as any other high school that's been allowed an article on Wikipedia (though I realize this is a contentious issue). It's one of only two major public high schools in operation in Decatur, Alabama, and has involved thousands of Decatur residents in its over forty years of operation. I think there's a good bit to say about this school, and its article could be helped a great deal by some love and care by a more recent graduate. If no such person comes along, I will do some research as soon as I'm able and expand it myself. —<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> 16:16, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please quote precisely where <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> made a "personal attack", I do not see such an attack on anyone, and I would suggest you take your own suggestion and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> when reading <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a>'s response. I think it is rather hard to suggest that saying "Get over it" is somehow a "personal attack".

As I have noted in months long since gone by, notability or the lack thereof is <b>not</b>, and never has been a valid criterion for the deletion of a high school article. Articles_for_deletion#Before_nominating_an_AfD clearly states: <i>Read and understand the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a>, which explains valid grounds for deletion.</i> <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> <b>nowhere</b> states or indicates that "non-notability" or "importance" is a "valid grounds for deletion" of a high school (or similar) article. If one reads the <b>policy</b> in the light of the <b>fact</b> that not a single, verifiable high school article has been deleted via the AfD/VfD processes in the course of the past 2 years worth of "discussions", I would humbly submit that nominating high school articles for deletion on the grounds that they are "non-notable" comes very, very, very close to a violation of standing policy - if not indeed constituting a violation of said policy. Might I suggest that if you are going to speak out "in defense of core policies" that a more precise reading of them be made before wildly suggesting that any and all nominations are somehow "rightful".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 02:09, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>I really do not understand why this article should be deleted. Austin High School and Decatur High School, are considered to of the best High Schools in the state of Alabama. To say that Austin is not notable is crazy.
<dl>
<dd>Austin's band program is outstanding. Not as outstanding as Decatur High School's, but second in the state, only behind Decatur High. I attend Decatur High School, and I believe that it should be kept. Our current band director, who has never gotten anything less than a superior rating at State attended Austin High. As <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> has said, Austin competes well with bands from Tennessee and Georgia. I am in Decatur's marching band and I have seen Austin in action. The Tennessee school practice marching band year round, and Austin beat one of them out in the Grissom Band Competition in 2005.</dd>
<dd>Also, one of the best sax players in the state just graduated from Austin. Both Decatur City High Schools ARE considered notable by any standards, and should both be considered great. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaGuy2007_e71a.html" title="User:AlabamaGuy2007">AlaGuy</a> 19:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Look, although I don't feel that being an IB school or having a good band program really merits inclusion in Wikipedia, that information certainly pushes the article in that direction. Why don't you add these things to the page, with citations, instead of just bringing them up in the AfD? The nomination was due to "no evidence of notability," not an argument that high school absolutely isn't notable. And yes, the IB information was added after the initial nomination. And no, that doesn't change my mind, although it's a step in the right direction. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcewolf34_9af8.html" title="User:Icewolf34">Icewolf34</a> 21:02, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>While this may well be verifiable, it's a small building, a shelter in a park.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Press kits are an important part of film advertising. The majority of movie pictures that we see in newspapers or magazines come from these. It could be useful to explain the different parts of a common press kit (<i>Anatomy of a Press Kit</i> if you will) and give examples. Also, although I can't remember any off the top of my head, some movies have had particularly clever press kits which might deserve mention. - <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus (ツィフィアス)</a> 21:15, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Your sane, the one's who want to delete this have simply gone nuts with the role playing game Wikipedia has become. Anyone who knows anything about WWII understands the critical role music played and would appreciate this article. In fact this is the only article in Wikipedia that my father in law, a vet from the South Pacific, found interesting. But I guess we need to make room for more shots of Pamela Anderson, fan comments on Star Trek:Enterprise, more comments on Klingon Language, to date one small child might speak natively in 10 years, and the Star Wars movies.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I would imagine that over the years such a page could contain a full list of the popular music of WWII, and would be an invaluage living reference for historians and artists looking at that period. It is Wikipedic because it strives to expand the overall knowledge construction, because Wikipedia is one of the few places where such knowledge can be held, and that over time it will grow to become a hub connectiong to information, say details and lyrics of the songs, references to the songs role in history (i.e. Favority with Americans in South Pacific).

<dd>Is it that admins are voting on this without knowing anything about WWII culture, or not caring, or they just love to delete?</dd>
<dd>There seems to be a clear failure on the part of many of the admins on this group to understand cultural studies and history, but sadly it does not stop the march to delete, which is now the admins favorite past time. Just an effort to make clear. WWII was a radio war, the first and only radio war. For most people the only connection they had to the mass media of that day was through radio, and radio generally plays a lot of music. Song were about the war itself, or about the strong emotional feelings that the war took place, or just pretty songs that people in the war felt. Some songs were big band songs without words, but were popular with the troops. But espeically for the American forces songs defined a time, a cause, a connection to home, a wall against fear, and a positive outlook which got the nation through. If you want to know whay the US won WWII and lost Vietnam and the Second Iraq War probably the place to look are the songs, WWII songs speak of motivation, hope, aspiration, unity; a sense of political purpose lacking in recent wars and significant. This type of page is one of the most significant types of entries that Wikipedia could have that a book can not, as more and more songs and composers, in theory, are added and not deleted (highly unlikely) this list of significant songs that define a period would grow. If there is a need to more clearly defined that types of music that goes in this list than that is NOT best done with a delete. In fact this list is probably a defining moment for Wikipedia. It is the kind of network information that a Wiki is best at capturing, in fact the only reason to have a wiki is to be able to produce these kinds of centre points. If Wikipedia can't keep a critical contribution to knowledge construction like this, while still having a massive Pamela Anderson article, a huge page on Jorn Barger who runs a blogs and is an anti-semite, and masses on the Klingon language, than it is clearly and "objectively" dead as a form of human knowledge collection. This article holds the entire soul of Wikipedia. Wikipedia could have been the only place to collect this historically critical information, and it looks to be deleted. Its sad to because a number of us would clearly like to make the case for why this is critical on the page, but one the Wiki admins get the smell of a delete they won't stop. I'm sure this article will be deleted and it will be a truely pathetic day for Wikipedia. Of course Jimbo "Ayn Rand contains all truth" Jones many enemies will be delighted, as will Britanica and Google and Microsoft, knowing they have little to fear from an "encyclopedia" which can't even understand how important mustic was to WWII. --<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhooker1236_22ef.html" title="User:Rhooker1236">Rhooker1236</a> 10:46, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>WRONG</b> An article called "The Role of Music in WWII" would be open to NOPV since there exists no semiotic or cultural study theory at this time as to what the role of music is? What is the role of Rock Music, of Jazz, of Kabuki? Such an article would be by its nature rather opionated and more on the level of theory rather then encyclopedic. An article outline the most popular songs from the war and about the war CAN be verified, the role of music in the war can not. I don't mean to be vitriol but that does not make sense at all. A list of songs is easier to approve as being from a time or of a content than a discourse on the function of that music.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm moved by Rhooker1236's remarks (I already voted keep though). I think Serpent's Choice suggestion of an article about the role of music in WW2 is also a good idea, but I'm still fine with the list for reasons stated earlier. Issues of verifiability can be handled the usual way--anyone wanting to challenge an entry can ask for a cite (but don't do that maliciously, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and challenge in cases where there's actual doubt). Replacing the list with a category does absolutely nothing to get rid of such doubts--instead of "why is this song on the list" it becomes "why is this song in the category". <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:16, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My problem regarding this topic really is in its titling. Rhooker1236 wants this entry to bring together "songs that define a period". And I will not argue; WWII is perhaps unique among major wars in that music, at home and abroad, played an important role in morale and even propoganda. The use of music in the period is verifiable. It is notable. It is encyclopediac. But that's not what this list is titled as, and so that's not what it would contain. Rhooker1236 writes how "[s]ong[s] were about the war itself, or about the strong emotional feelings that the war took place, or just pretty songs that people in the war felt." But a pretty song that was a morale motivator for soldiers or their families homeside is not, strictly speaking, a "song about World War II". Such songs should be pulled from this list. Any song written before WWII could not be <i>about</i> the war, and should be pulled from this list. And what about songs written 10, 20, 30 years after the war? How can we decide whether those songs are "about" the war? For many bands and many songs, meaning is left to the audience. For us as editors to determine which songs are meant to invoke the memory of WWII to an extent worthy of making this list is fundamentally incompatible with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (Another Brick in the Wall??). For what its worth, Rhooker, I'm on your side. What you are talking about is something that Wikipedia needs (and that, so far as I can tell, Wikipedia doesn't currently have). But <i>this list</i> is not going to produce the end you're looking for. Let this one go, and make a more appropriate home for the knowledge. It deserves better. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Partipants who proposed deletion early based on the old version and then didn't participate further should be downweighted for consensus purposes since they weren't referring to the same article. However, as someone said above, the new version should maybe have a different title. I don't see it as OR beyond other culture-related articles; it could use better sourcing, but it's still a work in progress. I think it's a promising article now.<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 14:40, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>References and sources</b> I have taken references for the work, but I have a full time job and I am in the process of changing jobs right now, so I can only do work in patches. If I am going to fill this out it will take a couple of weeks, if it is just going to be deleted I would like to know now so I don't waste any more time on it. The vote seems to be against it, but how decisions are made is never clear. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhooker1236_22ef.html" title="User:Rhooker1236">Rhooker1236</a> (<a href="../../../r/h/o/User_talk%7ERhooker1236_9d2d.html" title="User talk:Rhooker1236">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rhooker1236_17bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rhooker1236">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> after reviewing the updated content of the article (thanks for the note Phr), this is still a good use of a category. The non-list content of this article should be moved to a new article Role of music in WWII per Serpent's Choice above.&#160;— <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDolomite_0b0c.html" title="User:MrDolomite">MrDolomite</a> | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDolomite_8f87.html" title="User talk:MrDolomite">Talk</a> 12:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article is no longer a list at all, and at this point the article should simply be moved to a new title, since it's an entirely different article now. Issues of whether the article should then contain a list of songs are editorial questions belonging on the article's discussion page, not an afd (unless someone opens a separate afd for the new article). Unless someone objects (or does it first) I'm going to rename it to "Role of music in World War II". Also, kudos to Rhooker1236 for his work on this promising new article. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 20:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a great article for those of us whose parents fought in the war, or whose parents lost someone in the war. It can be improved. There were lots of articles about the music of the war. Broadcasts and records were so crucial to the war effort that vinyl Vdiscs of songs were created and shipped to the troops even while the musicians union was on strike and commercial recordings were not being made. Lots of emotion invested in some couple's special song. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (but retitle). I have rescinded my previous deletion endorsement in light of the current state of the article. It will need to be renamed; it no longer remotely meets the description of a list as Wikipedia knows them. Although edits to entries in AfD are permissible (and have likely saved this content), I am reticent to <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> enough to pagemove this during AfD, given its evolution during the process. Also the page will require substantially better sourcing in the near-term regardless of destination titling, but because the content <i>can be</i> verified, that is a matter for the page's talk and no longer for AfD. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 02:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Article is renamed</b> Per earlier comment, since no one objected I've moved the article to <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_music_in_World_War_II_84a1.html" title="Role of music in World War II">Role of music in World War II</a>. I left the AfD template in it but I think this AfD should be closed and the template removed. The article that was AfD'd and the present article have no resemblance to each other. Anyone still favoring deletion should open a new AfD. Discussion about the article content should go on the article talk page, not here. It's massively stressful to an article writer to have to make edits while an AfD is winding down. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 04:08, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This seems like a classic misapplication of the google test, which is not very useful for people who did most of their work before pre-internet. Even if he fails BIO (I haven't really looked into it), the article asserts enough notability which is verifiable from reliable sources like <a href="http://www.cornerstonemag.com/pages/show_page.asp?445" class="external text" title="http://www.cornerstonemag.com/pages/show_page.asp?445" rel="nofollow">this one</a> that I think he has enough notability to keep. This page needs work, but it shouldn't be deleted.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I support your arguments (and not only because I originally authored the piece!...). Steve Fairnie only played a bit-part in the history of music (and art), but his contribution had a huge effect on those whose path he crossed. U2 are the most notable example, but there are literally hundreds of others. His presence on the web has been slow to gain ground precisely because much of what he achieved was in the dark ages before Google, Wikipedia et al., but his legacy lives on, and I believe a Wikipedia entry would be appropriate. Thank you for your support, and I would gladly welcome rewriting in order to adhere more stringently to the Wikipedia thang!--<a href="../../../t/j/p/User%7ETjpike_1e25.html" title="User:Tjpike">User:Tjpike</a>

<li><s><b>Rewrite and add cites</b></s> Article is excessively devotional and not verifiable per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. It needs to be rewritten with neutral phrasing and verifiable external cites. The article should also be shorter in my opinion, given Fairnie's obscurity. Also, try to follow Wikipedia style (<a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>) about fonts, picture placement, etc, so the article visually looks like other Wikipedia articles (Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a gallery); the current layout may look good outside the encyclopedia context, but the way it stands out in Wikipedia is probably what attracted the deletion nomination.
<p>I just left you a welcome message with a bunch of links to Wikipedia policies and guidelines; please take a look at them. But I think your remark that Fairnie "only played a bit-part in the history of music (and art)" explains why this article is probably not encyclopedic. If you can document Fairnie's influence on U2, your best bet would be to mention that in the U2 article. You may have to go to the library to research suitable cites in printed sources--internet searches don't work so well for artists from this long ago. Anyway, don't get discouraged, do keep contributing, just try to get the hang of what kinds of articles fit into Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 10:12, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Vote changed to <b><s>conditional keep</s></b>. The rewrite is more encyclopedic but documentation is still skimpy. I did a quick search of several news and periodical databases (through public library) and couldn't find anything, which is a bit worrisome. However, nothing obviously controversial is being claimed.

<p>Thanks for those words of advice, which have made me more conscious of what is required and what is the "norm" on Wikipedia. I'll do my best to make the necessary amendments! --<a href="../../../t/j/p/User%7ETjpike_1e25.html" title="User:Tjpike">User:Tjpike</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Is this getting any better?...</b> I've taken your feedback on board on radically revised the page (which, incidentally, should be labelled 'Steve Fairnie', not 'Fairnie'... all part of the learning process). Let me know whether I'm any closer to the Wikipedia scheme of things in terms of presentation. As to whether he meets the notability grade, checking out the musician notability guidelines, I personally think he's in with a shout despite the aforementioned 'bit-part' aspect... perhaps 'essential cameo' would have been a better description! Yours, only too willing to learn! <a href="../../../t/j/p/User%7ETjpike_1e25.html" title="User:Tjpike">Tjpike</a> 13:53, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, much better. Please add as much documentation as you can. The cites really do make the article stronger, which I think you would want regardless. You can rename the page with the "move page" tab (actually you may not have that tab yet, new editors don't get the tab for a few weeks to slow down vandalism, but you can ask someone else to move the page). Probably better to avoid confusion by not moving it til after the AfD closes. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 02:27, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Further: I see now, some of the references given do document claims in the article. For example, the Willie Williams interview describes the U2 connection. But the references aren't connected closely enough to the article, so when the article says "Fairnie influenced U2" it makes me say "where's that documented?" since there's no immediate connection to the interview. The way to fix that is by adding footnotes, so next to the U2 mention, you'd immediately have a link pointing to a footnote that cites the interview. See <a href="../../../f/o/o/Help%7EFootnotes_8d93.html" title="Help:Footnotes">Help:Footnotes</a> for how to do this. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 02:37, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>OK, I'll add footnotes - I understand the logic in that. Can it also be useful to add direct quotes? (e.g. from his obituary in The Independent (10/03/93) , or various Melody Maker / NME reviews) Also, should record label information be included, or the fact that 'Hype' was among the first releases on Virgin Games, or the Robert Lax publication references? I think so much pedantic information wouldn't be necessary for a major league artist, but perhaps it's necessary here in the interest of accuracy and credibility?... Please advise. <a href="../../../t/j/p/User%7ETjpike_1e25.html" title="User:Tjpike">Tjpike</a> 06:55, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes of course you can use direct quotes, just keep them reasonably short, to not get in copyright trouble. As for the other stuff, it's pretty flexible, I'd say just find some comparable biographies and do what they do. Actually the more major artists have MORE detailed info, depending on how much work the article's editors were willing to do. For example, look at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Collins_af82.html" title="Phil Collins">Phil Collins</a>, which is a <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a> (i.e. designated as one of the best articles on Wikipedia). See <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html#Music" title="WP:FA">WP:FA#Music</a> for a list of other music-related FA's. Again, spend some time exploring the links in the welcome message for various kinds of advice about how to research and write good articles. <a href="../../../t/p/a/WP%7ETPA_a473.html" title="WP:TPA">WP:TPA</a> sums it up. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 07:13, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In the rules of Wikipedia for inclusion of biographies, one of the criteria stated includes--- "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". Wilson Lee Flores has authored five (5) books published by De La Salle University Press, which is part of one of the top universities in the Philippines. He had published thousands of newspaper columns, essays, articles in local and international publications which help shape public opinion.</p>
<p><br />
In my casual research of Google, there are 714,000 hits on the name Wilson Lee Flores. But since I don't have time to go over the entire contents, I didn't have time to verify how many are "unique" hits. However, there was never any mention in the criteria for Wikipedia biographies that an entry should have the most number of google hits of whether a million or ten million. I also read that Wilson Lee Flores is President of Anvil Business Club, a major business organization in the Philippines whose induction of officers in July 2005 was hosted by Philippine President Gloria Macaopagal Arroyo in the Malacañang presidential palace at a 3-hours formal dinner. Among the guests included foreign diplomats such as the Singapore Ambassador, cabinet officials, legislators, heads of foreign chambers of commerce such as the British and Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce and others. This event was on primetime television news and reported in major newspapers such as Philippine Daily Inquirer and Philippine Star. He is not only a multi-awarded writer, but a leader of a major business organization. <small>The above comments were all generated from the same IP address.</small></p>

I did not, however, anticipate this apparent <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet_%28internet%29.html" title="Sockpuppet (internet)">sockpuppetry</a>. Votes are coming into this AFD from anon IP editors whose only contributions are here and at the Flores entry. One anon editor entered his first comment down at the bottom, then went back up near the top to stick a second vote – four minutes later – in an attempt to vote twice. Musicloverasia has only one edit (at the time I wrote this), and it's the "keep" vote just above this comment. (New editors, all your edits are tracked and kept pursuant to the GFDL license.) There's absolutely nothing wrong with the Palanca Award - but I had never heard of it before reading this entry, and I still don't know much about it other than it's a Philippine award. Flores won his three all in the same year, 1987, and they were all for essays, not books. He won 1st and two other essays tied for 3rd place that year.</dd>

<dd>I listed this here because I just don't know if he meets the notability threshold or not. If the man is indeed notable enough to include in an encyclopedia, let's keep the entry, by all means. On the other hand, I have trouble keeping it if most of the votes here are from meatpuppets. I hope we get more unique votes. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 22:49, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The five books authored by Wilson Lee Flores are publicly on sale in Philippine bookstores, and those were published by De La Salle University Press. This fact can easily be verified by any person because De La Salle University Press is connected to one of the best universities in the Philippines. It is possible that the entry on Wilson Lee Flores was originally written by others, but the said subject had perhaps edited it himself in more details and probably over enthusiastically without fully knowing the rules of Wikipedia which correctly states that the point of view should be neutral. In objective assessment of this subject, he is an award-winning writer and author who merits mention in Wikipedia. A mention in Wikipedia is not to praise or to laud a person, that is why the point of view should be neutral and the entry should be edited in its point of view, but to delete it for wrong reasons is also wrong. That is just my honest and unbiased opinion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by MusicLoverAsia (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MusicLoverAsia_485d.html" title="Special:Contributions/MusicLoverAsia">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is becoming utterly hilarious. We are not nominating this writer for a Nobel Prize for Literature. Isn't his having won five times in the most prestigious Philippine journalism awards---the Catholic Mass Media Awards---enough to merit this article? The way some naysayers are so vehemently nitpicking makes this seem like a deliberation for the Nobel Prize or Pulitzer Prize. First there was a claim the books are non-existent, then those are now being criticized...there was an earlier claim that he won one Palanca award, when there were three awards...but now this is questioned because they were all won in one year...this discussion is becoming too hilarious, don't you think? I suggest we be objective and less trivial, let this article be and move on to more important things.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Pathetic excuse to let the article remain, as mentioned WP is informative, just put his name in the Palanca link (which is already the case) and thats it. Why does the article have to mention so many other events of this authors life which is hardly worth mentioning and quite ordinary to say the least. I would rather the author just reveal himself to the discussion group and not use anon ip and pseudonyms. I think this is an ego matter. So lets end this articles misery and as what the comment above says move on since if we leave this in other administrators who sees this article will nominate it for deletion again.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Agree that editing be done to ensure a neutral editorial point of view, perhaps that's the main problem of the complainant. The writer's having won 5 times in the Catholic Mass Media Awards seems to be noteworthy, not just his Palanca Awards, since it is without doubt the most important journalism honor in the Philippines attesting to integrity and excellence. I suggest that this fact not be ignored. I had already checked the credibility of the Catholic Mass Media Awards, and the Philippine media had reported his wins in recent years, and those awards should not be belittled even by the complainant against this article being in Wikipedia. The writer or his friends might be wrong in over enthusiastic descriptions of the writer before---and I agree those should be properly edited---but it would be equally wrong to be biased and to personally attack the writer's credentials or his works. Let us also not be guilty of being biased or frivolous in our criticisms. Thanks for allowing me to share my opinions.</li>

<li>(edit conflict (I saw the petition stuff)) Might as well cover the other supposed claims to notability: he got banned from somewhere, he founded a joke petition, and he committed suicide, all of which I could probably do myself within 3-12 hours, depending on how quickly I can procure a bottle of vodka and some sleeping pills. The petition is supposedly notable for its external coverage, but I read the Times article via <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a>. It's 8 lines long and doesn't mention Klerck at all.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>-especially after reading the previous AfD. I see this article being a real POV fork, in either direction. For those who love them, they can slather unsourced Weasel Words and craft it as a Wiki-Memorial. For others, it can be a lightening rod for troll vandalism. But on the whole, I don't see how all the sums merits an article. 1.) He was a notable troll. Trolls are not inherently notable and in fact tend to have a short shelf life. Is anyone going to be looking up a particular internet troll 10 years from now? But he was "famous" in his own time and to that extent I would think he warrants his mention on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a> page. 2.) The Petition. I could possibly see an argument for <i>this</i> having an article but in truth, it's best served with the mention it already has for on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings%7E_The_Two_Towers_%28film%29_fd9b.html" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)">Two Towers</a> page. 3.) He posted a suicide note on the web. Sadly, this all too common and the nature of his suicide doesn't have the unique element that <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Vedas_75dd.html" title="Brandon Vedas">Brandon Vedas</a> had in regards to internet culpability.

<li><b>Comment</b> I actually like the article for sort-of-literary reasons that are hard to explain. It somehow got on my watchlist a fairly long time ago and it does get vandalized regularly, so I end up looking at it again every so often when fixing it. Its view into Klerck's personality adds some character to the encyclopedia, or something like that. I'm reminded also of <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">User:Grace Note</a>'s and <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">User:Vizjim</a>'s comments in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sam_Sloan_1068.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sam Sloan">Sam Sloan's AfD</a> about AfD's on semi-notable, unusual personalities and I'm somewhat persuaded by their arguments when self-promotion isn't involved (and I'm a long way from being an inclusionist). Sam Blanning's remark that it doesn't matter who nominated the article is of course true, but the speedy nominator was blocked as a GNAA troll a few hours after making the nom. It will be ironic if a troll takes out the article after the regular editors have left it in peace for so long. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 10:50, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Speedy</b> someone whose biggest claim to fame was posting an online petition to get a movie title changed??? Even if successful (and it wasn't), it wouldn't be notable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:55, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually there is some circumstantial evidence that the petition was partly successful. As reported in the LA Times, the LOTR filmmakers did a big benefit premiere of <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> in NYC for a 9/11 charity, but then, subsequent to Klerck's petition making the internet rounds, they got cold feet at doing a similar premiere for the second film. However, it's not directly established (at least right now) that the second premiere was cancelled <i>because</i> of the petition. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 09:27, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The petition got press coverage from around the world, and someone thought it was notable enough to document it in the "Two Towers" film article in its own section (I don't think I would have gone that far). It's attributed there to Klerck (originally without a wikilink) but that immediately raises the question "what kind of person would have done this?". And where else is anyone going to find the info? My original "keep" sentiments were lukewarm but I feel somewhat firmer about it now. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 22:36, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - I completely agree with Agne. I was honestly strongly considering a Weak Keep, I guess partly in sympathy... but the points in keeping an article to Wiki standards outweigh that notion. The Two Towers Petition thing could be notable as an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a>, and yeah, could technically have its own article, actually. I see it's been merged into the film's article though, which I think is enough. His death, while tragic, is something that happens regularly in this world. Still, I think brief information about him in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">internet troll</a> article should stay intact as well though, as a sort of "famous example." Maybe a little more info could be added to the Two Towers article of his antic (maybe his death could fit in to the Trivia section, possibly, heh). -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 08:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as hard as it is for me to say - don't care much about the circumstances of nomination, this clearly fails WP:BIO and WP:V. All of this stuff sounds a bit fishy to me, especially the supposed trolling stuff (as in "disruptive behaviour even the most thick-headed hooligans can come up in two seconds flat"). And if all of this stuff were true, that <i>still</i> would barely climb above the notability threshold. The petition may or may not be notable in itself but that doesn't mean petitioner is. ("I believe every dog and wolf puppy should have an article." There. You can quote me on that. Now please make an article about me. Don't feel like? Well, neither do I.) And while suicides are always tragic, this is neither first of its kind nor notable in its own right, I'm <i>terribly</i> sorry. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:46, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I notice that the brand new user "Yunica" (who I suspect is yet another sock of the original nominator) recently went and spewed bogus {{fact}} tags all over the article, to make the verifiability issues look worse than they are (the tags were bogus because they were attached to items which were in fact already documented in the references section). I added footnotes to where most of the tags were, though to be fair there are still a few things needing to be checked out. Inserting those tags appears to have been a bad faith edit to manipulate the afd. If that was the version you saw, it would be nice if you could take another look. Most of the article is in fact pretty well sourced. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:57, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Even</i> with that stuff sourced, this person's notability is still rather marginal.

<li>Well sure, the newsmedia didn't report on the person because (like <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_the_Ripper_b953.html" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>) he didn't attach his name to his activity; but unlike Jack the Ripper, there wasn't a trail of bodies and consequent huge manhunt, so there wasn't that much attempt to find the person behind the events. What documentation remains is of some historical interest, but it's fading away steadily and is mostly concentrated in places like this, and is simply going to be lost if the article is deleted. I see preserving that type of hard-to-collect documentation as part of why Wikipedia is here.

<li><b>Comment</b>-I am a bit concerned at the path this AfD is starting to take, in particular with the isolating of users who favor <i>delete</i> for an examination of their "good faith". An AfD is never meant to be a vote and frankly, the three word "keep/delete per nom" reply is rather useless unless there is persuasive reasoning behind the view. Hence, there is not a need to "swift boat" the other side to try and cancel out their "vote". I do believe it is in the best interest of all to simply <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and state your reason for keep or deletion and leave it at that.

<li><b>Comment</b> Agne, it is part of AFD policy that new accounts are supposed to weigh less in determining consensus; I made notes of all the ones I noticed, not just the "delete" supporters, to assist the closing admin and to alert those who might find themselves "piling on". I also believe there is sockpuppeting going on given the number of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">WP:SPA</a>'s participating here, a couple of whom have already been blocked. I even see possible issues of censorship on the part of the original apparently-GNAA-connected bad-faith speedy nominator and his/her possible associates or socks trying to suppress this article and now the similar one <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Vedas_75dd.html" title="Brandon Vedas">Brandon Vedas</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brandon_Vedas_0e04.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brandon Vedas">AfD by another brand new user</a>). (That issue emphatically does <i>not</i> apply to the legitimate supporters of deletion on good-faith editorial grounds). Per Agne's request, I will stop adding such notes, but the closing admin and others should check the contributions of every participant. And, I only made such notes for the SPA's, not regular editors who favored deletion (though I responded to some of their arguments).
<p>Yunipo, on my first contact with the article, I also suspected the death (including the published obituary linked from the article) might be a hoax and I thought of AfD'ing it myself, but I checked it out off-web and confirmed it to my satisfaction, and that's how I started watching the article.</p>
<p>Re the WP:BIO complaints: I agree that Klerck's personal notability <i>per se</i> is marginal per the guidelines, but I think the biographical info is important as background and context for his widely-reported activities (the article currently cites newspapers of 3 or 4 different countries). As a web user who has to deal with trolls, I'm interested in their biographies, just as people concerned with terrorism might study the biography of <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Atta_1743.html" title="Mohammed Atta">Mohammed Atta</a>, to know what they're dealing with. Just about anyone (as Sam Blanning remarks) could do what Klerck did; and any airline pilot could do what Atta did--so <i>why didn't they?</i> One has to look for answers to "why do these guys do what they do?" and it's not enough to say "Atta attacked the WTC because he was a terrorist, end of story". So the biographies and their documentation are relevant in the search for understanding. That's why I find merging the petition stuff to the Two Towers movie and trashing the rest to be unsatisfactory. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 10:04, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>14 unique Google hits</i> - is a little misleading since the MUD only just settled on a single name (used to be a mix of Acts World, Acts MUD, ActsMUD and others).

<dd>The Google test can be a very valid notability test, as long as the search is done reasonably. The search query "Acts MUD" results in 29. Your example, 'acts mud', results in the 5+ million, but is not a good query as it is entirely too vague. 'acts mud zeth' (zeth for your telnet/www address) results in ~100, many of which have nothing at all to do with your MUD.</dd>
<dd>Your devotion to your MUD (I don't know if you're a player or an imm, but your nick combined with the places address suggests you are something) is most understandable, but the game is simply not notable, and Wikipedia is not a MU*-list.</dd>

<dd>The other MUD articles are similar because they are also non-notable and not encyclopedic. Having unique content in your MUD does not make it notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are different types of MUD, some commercial with huge advertising budgets, some homegrown, many medieval, a few sci-fi, a few historical, some big, some small. It seems sensible that the Wikipedia should have at least one real example of all of them. I think that Wikipedia should have at least one example of a historical MUD (note they are all quite small), so is it not better that you save deleting this article until someone adds a better example? --Jimbo06 13:26, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Well <a href="../../../l/e/g/LegendMUD_fd6a.html" title="LegendMUD">LegendMUD</a> is kind of historically focused. I think there are two issues here. 1 is that the Wikipedia Mods do not like lots of articles about individual medium to small MUDs. 2. There is not a very wide range of coverage in the MUD treatment on Wikipedia. If we separate out these issues then a sensible way forward is to ditch the individual articles and focus attention on having an article about MUD themes and genres. --Jimbo06 13:48, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would just like to point out that Jimbo06 is the creator of ActsMUD and the initial author of the wikipedia article. Also, this comment has been discussed in Talk:ActsMUD. -- <a href="../../../j/r/a/User%7EJRavn_4871.html" title="User:JRavn">JRavn</a> 21:19, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Come on boys (or girls) no need to make <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_personal_attacks_8865.html" title="WP:No personal attacks">it personal</a>, We all agree that the current situation needs a bit of thought. We all agree that Wikipedia needs to cover MUDs in some way, and that having a wikipedia page for every single MUD is possibly not maintainable. The question now is do we merge parts of this content into another article or lose the whole thing? We could merge all 5-6 articles dealing with CircleMUD MUDs into one article. Then the page could be maintained with half-a-dozen varied examples of how the CircleMUD has been and is being used. These examples could be replaced over time as required. -- <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZeth_f3e2.html" title="User:Zeth">Zeth</a> 10:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Jimbo06, the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> clearly states to mention if you have a vested interest in the article in question. I merely pointed this out in the interest of fairness, there is no personal attack here. --<a href="../../../j/r/a/User%7EJRavn_4871.html" title="User:JRavn">JRavn</a> 22:38, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what I am proposing is that we make a new page about CircleMUD games, and then over there to carry on the debate about what half-a-dozen MUDs we choose to show the wide range of CircleMUD uses.

<dd>The original issue still remains.

If we want to create a page devoted to examples of CircleMUDs, there must be something notable to say about them that specifically relates to those examples. I don't see what there could be that wouldn't better be placed on the <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUDs_762f.html" title="MUDs">MUDs</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/r/CircleMUD_405d.html" title="CircleMUD">CircleMUD</a> page. --<a href="../../../j/r/a/User%7EJRavn_4871.html" title="User:JRavn">JRavn</a> 22:47, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this is worth an article, it quite clearly explains an actual game which may not have many players but does exist. There are much more obscure things on Wikipeda.

<dd>I'm not sure that 'indiscriminate collection of information' is fair here. The MUDconnector is not a <a href="../../../g/d/f/GDFL_cdb5.html" title="GDFL">GDFL</a> or other free content licenced site, so its existence does not necessarily demand that a good collection of MUDs are not covered here. Encyclopedia Britannica website exists so should we delete all the articles that are covered there? Plenty of technical lists exist on the Internet, should we then delete all the descriptions of small software packages on this wiki? By no means!! The Wikipedia can provide much that the MUDconnector can not. Firstly anyone can edit, secondly there is the NPOV and so on. --<a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZeth_f3e2.html" title="User:Zeth">Zeth</a> 22:07, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know what you're saying Zeth, but again, Wikipedia isn't an indiscrimate collection of information. Just because anyone can add to it doesn't mean we should store any random knowledge we would like. You are more than free to create your own MUD listing wiki that anyone can edit - but that is not Wikipedia's purpose. It is commonly accepted that an article needs some notability to be on Wikipedia. It is also commonly accepted that Wikipedia articles shouldn't be listings (of websites, or MUDs) unless there is notability involved (such as a listing of America's richest people). ActsMUD, as cool as the MUD and its theme sounds, doesn't have any notability. Or if it does, it hasn't been shown yet - only examples of non-notability. --<a href="../../../j/r/a/User%7EJRavn_4871.html" title="User:JRavn">JRavn</a> 14:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Had I known beforehand that the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_identity.html" title="Canadian identity">Canadian identity</a> was on the block to be deleted, I would have objected.... Here are the reasons I propose to keep it...:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Length - most articles listed on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>, in my quick random survey, are short - a sentence to two paragraphs. <b>Canadian identity</b> was considerably longer. The length also supports that it is more than some random user’s vanity page, and has been a collaborative effort, one of the main goals of Wikipedia..</li>
<li>Notability - Canada is indeed notable (I hope no one would dispute that). I agree that the question “What does it mean to be a Canadian?” is a slightly different topic, but I would suggest that it is a question that is fundamental to the country. From the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> on, the simple answer was “not American.” Why was Canada formed? In part, to keep from becoming American. The same reason is why <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> joined confederation, why the west (now <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>) was the subject of a huge drive on the part of the Canadian government to be settled, and why the <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon_Territory_2a75.html" title="Yukon Territory">Yukon Territory</a> was formed. <i>See also <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_confederation.html" title="Canadian confederation">Canadian confederation</a></i>. Canada is also special in the fact that its boundaries were not defined by war, ethic group, or common history, like most other nations (Europe, especially comes to mind).</li>
<li>POV - it doesn’t surprise me that the article comes across without a NPOV. By vary nature, the article implies a point of view, because it is about how Canadians see themselves. As noted above, not being American is an important part of that. <i>See “Mild anti-Americanism” in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_literature.html" title="Canadian literature">Canadian literature</a> and the article on <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molson.html" title="Molson">Molson’s</a> <a href="../../../i/_/a/I_am_Canadian_13fe.html" title="I am Canadian">I am Canadian</a> commercials.</i> I would welcome anyone to edit out the POV, but I would challenge them to do so without removing the facts. In any case, the mild POV throughout does not seem to cloud the message</li>
<li>Uniqueness of topic - as you noted, the material here does not readily fit elsewhere. The topic is complex enough to require its own article, as demonstrated by its length. I read the articles that you suggested the material should be in, and found no significant overlap.</li>
<li>Accuracy - this, above all, it what impressed me most about the article - it explained what it means to be Canadian in a clear, concise, and accurate manner. It is the sort of article I would point my American friends to. The clear explanation in and of itself is reason enough, in my mind, to keep the article.</li>
<li>Suggestions for expansion/improvement (things I would be willing to undertake):
<ul>
<li>how the adoption of the maple leaf flag <i>see <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" title="Image:Flag of Canada.svg">Image:Flag of Canada.svg</a></i> has made the maple leaf <b>the</b> Canadian symbol
<ul>
<li>how the maple leaf (or Canadian flag) is frequently attached by Canadian travelers to their backpacks to keep from being mistaken for Americans, who are stereotypically loud and rude</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>British ties, their influence on things such as architecture (I’m thinking of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria.html" title="Victoria">Victoria</a>) and parliament</li>
<li>differences between French and Quebecois culture</li>
<li>folk songs such as <i>I’s the b’y</i></li>
<li>issues with a united country and culture over the vast distance (it’s over 5000km from <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_2caf.html" title="St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador">St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador</a> to Victoria, BC)</li>
<li>insuring relevant articles have a link to <i>Canadian identity</i> and the <i>see also</i> section at the end of the article remains relevant</li>

<dd>I believe that there is a seperate Canadian identity. One we've tried to define for 139 years. The main reason we try to make sure people know is so we don't get mixed up with our neighbour to the south. We don't like being called "American's" because we <i>aren't</i>. We have our own identity. In WWI and WWII, we tried to secure our own identity, seperate from the Brits.

<li><b>Further Comment</b> I suppose a section at the top (of the article) should be added explaining the significance of the Canadian identity to Canadians.

<li>The very suggestion that this specific "<a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_identity.html" title="Canadian identity">Canadian identity</a>" exists is POV itself, and best described as superficial make-belief (this coming from a proud Canadian).</li>

For another, much of it is simply redundant with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_culture.html" title="Canadian culture">Canadian culture</a>. And for a third, it's not an encyclopedia article — it's a research essay. And not one that would beat the grade curve, either. <b>Delete</b>.

<p>Right now, this article is complete fanfiction BS, claiming that this character's brothers star on shows on <b>other networks</b>.

<p>All articles apparently about a British band and its albums/EPs/singles, added by the user <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_6Z1X1W6_4562.html" title="Special:Contributions/6Z1X1W6">6Z1X1W6</a>: smells to me like a systematic hoax. The following articles are involved:</p>

<li>By The River</li>
<li>I Won't Forget EP</li>
<li>Who Decided?</li>

<p>I've never read about this band in the British press, nor have I heard one of their releases on the radio or seen one in a music store.

The Quennells also contains demonstrably false information, e.g. it says 'the band was nominated for two awards at the 2005 Brit Awards' but <a href="http://www.virgin.net/music/features/britawards2005nominees.html" class="external text" title="http://www.virgin.net/music/features/britawards2005nominees.html" rel="nofollow">this is not true</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - as it is, this is a terrible article full of original research and individual weapon listings for each map. After deleted, if anyone wants to start a more encyclopedic article complete with (gasp!) sources, I would not oppose that. However, this article is bad to the point that I don't want to see anyone base a new article off of this one or even to have it in the article history. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 20:11, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>, starting with a rewrite -- from scratch if necessary. The original Halo did advance the state of multiplayer gaming, and its place in gaming history is based as much on the success of its multiplayer as on its allegedly compelling story, so a separate article on the subject would be justified. However, after wading through <i>this</i> article, I had learned very little about the advances Halo actually made; most of this is an overdetailed exposition of all the aspects of Halo multiplayer that <i>didn't</i> set it apart from previous games!<br />

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Unlike the Halo 2 article, where I said keep, this one seems to be padded out with fluff. It's not original research, though. Things like player culture and gametypes should be covered, but the map list is overly detailed at best and perhaps unecessary. Revise it and see if there's enough left to justify a separate article still. And merge requests shoudl be done with merge tags, not AfDs. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 10:38, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment:</i> I've heard the phrase used (in the UK) for quite some time (even before Trainspotting, to which the article refers), so I don't think it qualifies as a protologism or even a neologism there. The trouble is finding a reliable source for it - there's no such definition in the OED's entry on "glass", and I'm not sure of Wikipedia's policies on slang terms and how to reference them. As slang goes it may be quite localised, probably not a term that's well-known outside the UK. Nevertheless, the article is a bit of mess, and I can't see it becoming much more than a dicdef, so <b>move to Wikitionary</b> <i>only</i> if a good source can be located, otherwise <b>weak delete</b>. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 21:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: why do we need sources other than the one the article <i>already provides</i>? Does the term's use in a well-known work of literature, which was widely praised for its accurate portrayal of the vernacular, not count as a reliable source for its existence as a slang term? All that's really missing is page references. That notwithstanding, the dicdef issue remains, and I'm not sure I can think of much else to say about it either... — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:24, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Various conjugations of the verb "to glass" have this meaning in the UK. Quite well known and certainly not a neologism. Still, basically a dicdef.

<li>Good work on that research there, GWO. Those really strengthen the case for keeping the article. If someone can use these to expand the article into describing the problem, talking about the steps taken by bars, event organisers, etc. to avoid them and so on, it'll become more than a dicdef too. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 16:16, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Given these sources, which discuss glassing and the political issues surrounding it, it appears that this article can be edited into a proper, referenced, article on the subject that can be more than a perpetual stub.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I strongly suspect this is a copyvio, as the author's name doesn't match username, but I couldn't find this thing with a few moments of googling. Might have been copied off of a print source.

<li>The authors name certainly doesnt match the username, because the two are entirely different. If you had taken the trouble of actually contacting either the author or hte username, you would realize that I (dipenda) am the Director, Programs at the Alliance for Peace-Nepal, and that we are working to enable and empower the youth in Nepal. One of the things we do is write up articles, and try and publicize it. If writing our own articles and submitting them to various websites constitutes a violation of copyright laws, then perhaps i need to study copyright laws properly. Sorry if thats the case. dipenda <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by dipenda (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dipenda_2451.html" title="Special:Contributions/dipenda">contribs</a>) .</small>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, we tend to be very paranoid what comes to copyright and licencing, and I for one had no idea and you have to admit the name didn't look like an acronym or anything, and you didn't even have an user page. (Organisations rarely just walk up and contribute something. Usually, when you see a copy-paste posting like this, it's more likely to be work of a random, unrelated, well-intentioned party who isn't aware of Wikipedia's licencing issues.) So apologies. Either way, there's possibility of copyright violation here, still: You're merely the publisher, not the author; has the author assigned the copyright of the article to you? If not, I sure hope they're aware of the fact that their work is distributed under GFDL, know exactly what it means, and they approve of it. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A Formula One driver who never qualified for a race and didn't even register a time in the one race he tried to quallify for - non-notable Robertsteadman 21:07, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this wasn't his only race by any means - just his only Championship Grand Prix. That's the problem with a lot of these articles - they suggest that a driver only raced in F1, which is never the reality. AFB almost certainly took part in other Grand Prix and many other types of race as well. It's just a matter of finding out what else he did. He would never have made it as far as a Championship Grand Prix without achieving at least a reasonable amount elsewhere. We need someone with some time to exapnd the article, not delete it. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 21:32, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Easily fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s criteria for sportspeople. A Google search of "Azdrubal Fontes Bayardo" brings up less than 10 unique results; of these, half are from WP and mirrors, and the other half list his name and nothing more. Thus, there is no verifiable information about him, so even if he did race in other circuits, there's no way he was notable enough (or, if he was, no way to prove it) to merit inclusion in WP. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:22, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, after just a minute or two on Google, I have found several things about him, such as the fact that he won the first race at El Pinar in Montevideo, in a Maserati 4CLT-Chevrolet. His middle name was Esteban, he apparently died just recently on July 9, and his nickname was Pocho. Just skipping over some South American sites, I can see a few results for him. When you Google, you do clearly have to bear in mind that people's names can be mispelt, particularly in this guy's case - and his surname 'Fontes' is often mistaken for a middle name. Rather than making assumptions about his career that you weren't able to confirm, leave this article for a while so that it can be expanded. I have flagged it on the Project page, so someone (or I can do it myself when I have time) will come and put some flesh on the bones. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 17:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's had over a year, but there are a lot of driver articles out there that need work, and as you have seen, Fontes Bayardo isn't the easiest to research.

In order to defeat the fatwa on this article, I will attempt to expand it today. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 17:50, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you'd better start deleting the other dozens and dozens of similarly notable or non-notable racing drivers then. What has made you judge Fontes Bayardo to be non-notable? There's nothing in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> which suggests he's non-notable, having competed in motor racing at the highest level in South America during the 1950s. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 19:02, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Instead of being flippant, why don't you actually explain why you have decided that Fontes Bayardo is not notable? He has won Formula 1 races in South America - he is notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> I appreciate that to non-followers of motorsport, Bayardo may seem too obscure but I'm afraid that not being able to appreciate the importance of his exploits shouldn't be a reason for deleting the article. The South American racing scene at the time was thriving and was almost as important as the European scene. A driver who did well in the South American formulae therefore cannot be ignored simply because he was a 'rich kid' or because he doesn't appear in a lot of english language websites. Personally I find wikipedia is enjoyable BECAUSE of articles like this which educate and inform, instead of the usual tittle tattle about obscure local 'celebrities' that others deem worthy of gracing the internet. I do agree however that the article ought to be expanded a little more.Type-R 00:16, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Measurements of "notability" by things like Google are practically irrelevant here. An American football player could be 'linked' to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a> and suddenly there are 1000s of articles about him on the internet. Had Bayardo been racing today, there would most likely be 100s of articles on the internet about him too. This does not make him less notable, just because the internet was not around at that time for thousands of amateur experts or news writers to write about his latest performance. Winning the aforementioned races is huge compared to the notability claims of <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movellan.html" title="Movellan">a Doctor Who villain</a> who appeared in one series, or <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerrea_Gilbert_4789.html" title="Kerrea Gilbert">a footballer who made 2 appearances for Arsenal and then went out on loan</a>, but these produce <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=Pxy&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=Movellan+%2B%22Doctor+Who%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=Pxy&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=Movellan+%2B%22Doctor+Who%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">2,900</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=pIe&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Kerrea+Gilbert%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=pIe&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Kerrea+Gilbert%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">46,200</a> Google hits respectively.

<li><b>Keep</b> Any idea how few Uruguayan drivers made it even this close to F1?! Uruguay being one of the poorer relations in the South American motor racing scene. A scene which stands in a similar relationship to Europe as it does in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> (no, I don't normally call it that, but I'm guessing that link is at least unambiguous!) - i.e. pretty important. Albinomonkey also makes an excellent point regarding 'Internet bias'. I also note that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is explicitly <b>not</b> policy. I wouldn't personally have an objection to some of these drivers being grouped into larger articles though - Uruguyan Racing Drivers if anyone wants to put the work in on the redirects, but I know some others have different views on that. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 18:26, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Weak keep</b> The tutiempo site doesn't count as independent confirmation - it just mirrors fallingrain in some way as far as I can see.

<li><b>Cheerfully speedy delete</b> <s><b>Weary, very weak keep</b> with a strong desire to revisit in 2 months -- and then drive a stake through its heart. If you look at the last AfD, nobody fought harder to get this non-notable hoax deleted. I'm just not comfortable re-AfD'ing right away. Somehow it seems like maybe it's against the rules. Talk me out of this notion and I'll be at the head of the "speedy delete" line. In the meantime, feel free to look at all the links I produced on the last AfD.</s> See the links I've added later in this RfA. Whatever the concerns about fallingrain.com, the NGA link convinced me that there really is a clearing or rock in Nigeria with that name. But then again, see what else I dug up about NGA names -- they list every possible name there's ever been including mountains, 829 undersea features and 8 different "places" in the Vatican. I may be in Makurdi in 2-3 weeks; I wish I had time to drive by those coordinates and take a picture of the squash field or whatever's there -- it won't be a town!

<dd><b>Comment/Response</b> I realize that this has been up twice before and only very recently reached no consensus. I was not aware of the article until just recently. And no, I wasn't brought in by someone wishing for it to be deleted. I hate that sometimes the most aggressive side in an argument wins based on tenacity rather than true consensus. I hate seeing AfD abused this way as much as I hate seeing wheel warring. That said, the first AfD resulted in keep because there were places online that mentioned it. The validity of those sources wasn't really brought into question. I read a bunch of stuff on teh interwebs, but I'm not sure where they got their data from. In the second AfD, only one keep was added after the verifiability of the online sources was questioned. The validity was questioned at the end of the discussion. This second discussion seems to have been focussed on a content dispute over whether the GNAA should be mentioned in the article and whether the town was notable apart from that. Obviously a real town in Nigeria is just as notable as the gazillions of U.S. census data articles. This resulted in no consensus. Given that something new was raised at the end and didn't seem to have been addressed, I thought that it was worth talking about. I looked at Google Earth well before this nomination occurred and saw that indeed that area of Nigeria is used for agriculture. There are fields and forest there, but I don't see anything that would have a population of 6000+. Given how close by all the "towns" listed on the nona site are, the population density would have to be pretty high to get that many people before crossing the municipality boundary. Index Mundi&#160;!= Google Earth. It is a data overlay over satellite images. If you had actually searched using Google Earth, as you incivilly implied I hadn't, you would find that it points to the <i><b>Free Software Foundation</b></i> in Boston. You can use Google Maps to search for <i>Gnaa, Nigeria</i> and return <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Gnaa%2C%20Nigeria" class="external text" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Gnaa%2C%20Nigeria" rel="nofollow">the same result</a>. I don't feel this is disruptive any more than deletion review is. I have no intention of nomming this again. The only thing that seems obvious to me about this whole episode is that the GNAA is having fun with it, people are upset that we might be furthering systemic bias, and we really don't seem to have a good way of determining what's actually out there other than personal interpretation of low resolution satellite images from Google. My last comment goes back to Nicodemus75's assumptions. Neither the nominator nor I, the first commenter, were involved in either of the first two AfDs. Please don't imply that we are repeatedly abusing process to get our way. —<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 17:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment'</b>. This article has twice been nominated for deletion, this nomination (3rd) was ONE DAY following the previous attempt which was 5 delete votes versus 9 keep votes which is BARELY a lack of consensus (some admins consider such a discussion result to be a consensus to keep). Your protestations and defenses notwithstanding, please refer to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Renominations_and_recurring_candidates" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Renominations_and_recurring_candidates</a> where it <b>clearly</b> states: <i>A process that resulted in article deletion or keeping, should generally be respected and the article not immediately re-nominated for deletion (if kept) or re-created (if deleted).</i> With respect to the verifiability of this place, please see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Verifiability.2C_not_truth" title="WP:V">WP:V#Verifiability.2C_not_truth</a>. There are PLENTY of online sources including respected atlases that list this town as a real place. It is not our job to get at the truth of whether or not Mapquest or other online atlases have it right, as clearly stated: <i>"Verifiability" in this context does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a New York Times article are true.</i> Attempts to deconstruct these online atlases are beyond the scope of purpose here. This location <b>is verifiable</b> under the terms of the policy established at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's likely that all these sites are working from a common source - which might be wrong. Still, as I said above the balance of probablility is that the place does exist. Certainly, one shouldn't delete because of a <i>possible</i> database error. There is also the notability question - but wiki has a strong tradition that settlements are intriniscally notable and NGA lists it as a populated place. Again NGA might be wrong but one shouldn't delete because of a <i>possible</i> database error. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 02:56, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Comment: It's <i>not</i> "obviously a real place". It's a place for the existence of which we have no non-Internet evidence.

<li><b>Keep</b>.

If we are to start deleting placenames in Africa because they are "non-notable", shall we also be fair &amp; start deleting placenames in the US &amp; Europe for the same reason? If you haven't figured it out, the trolls <i>want</i> us to delete this article for their amusement.

(As an example, one I am using at the moment not only omits a number of villages or towns that the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Statistical_Agency_%28Ethiopia%29_d618.html" title="Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)">Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)</a> mentions, but amazingly divides the <a href="../../../o/m/o/Omo_River_802c.html" title="Omo River">Omo River</a> into 2 different rivers.)</li>
<li>Having worked with the NGA database for Ethiopia, I'll freely concede that it has some interesting problems. However, no one has looked in the Nigeria database to determine what the story might be. The NGA records not only list placenames &amp; their longitude &amp; latitudes, but also flag it with such information as the type of place it is (e.g. habitation, locality, building, waterhole) &amp; if it is known by another name. "Gnaa" may simply be an explorer's error for some other placename. (<i>Note</i>: My excuse for not performing this investigation myself because I've been spending the weekend doing some house remodelling in 100-degree heat.)</li>

<dd>I have no horse in this race; with the right kind of arguments, I would be quite willing to change my vote above. My goal is to put only reliable information in Wikipedia. However, in all three deletion nominations, the same arguments &amp; evidence have been repeated. If you want me to persuade me to change my vote, I need to see the following kinds of proof:
<ul>
<li>Has anyone checked the Nigerian government records? Almost every country has a website: even poverty-stricken Ethiopia has an abstract of its statistical information online. I would imagine that the Nigerian census agency has a website, &amp; the necessary information to provide a decisive answer might lie there.</li>
<li>Has anyone taken the time to research this matter <i>in a reference library?</i> One of those with lots of printed things called books &amp; periodicals? Excuse my tone, but this reliance on the Internet for facts about Africa is about as useful as relying on the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica for facts about astronomy or physics. My local city library even has a reference line, so you could call &amp; get your answer without even leaving home. (And note: travellers have written books in English about Nigeria for over a century, some of which have been published in Nigeria. I'm curious to know whether any such works that <i>should</i> mention Gnaa do so.)</li>
<li>And let me repeat, how about a closer look at the NGA entry. For all we know, the answer may lie in that source. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 04:03, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I would love to explain it for you. If you look at that site, you will see that they use Mapquest to generate "matching addresses." Mapquest is not always accurate. Neither is Google Maps which labels a house two blocks away with my address. As for the date, that is the satellite image date. It is not a picture of that town; it is a picture of the region that town is supposedly in. The poster-size imagery is of the region. You will note, if you use Google Earth, that the image is at very low zoom. You could also compare visible roads to the nona map and see that there are around a dozen "towns" supposedly in the original image that comes up. So that's the explanation. It is, just like image mundi, just a data overlay of someone else's location on someone else's image.—<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 17:59, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How does that show how Fallingrain.com isn't a reliable source? The issue A.B. is bringing up is that Fallingrain.com is not specifically labeling Gnaa a town, but perhaps a region, territory, or other "place".</dd>

<dd>Nicodemus is right about the etiquette when I read it. Technically, my comment isn't in a box but it sure <i>is</i> a tally, so I struck it through. I think a reason for the rule is that unlike RfAs, this is not a vote -- we're just giving recommendations to the one admin who will actually make the real decision. Also, I'm not sure "etiquette" is binding but, heck, if we start ignoring etiquette, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judith_Martin_f0b3.html" title="Judith Martin">Miss Manners</a> will tell you we're on a steep slippery slope from "please" and "thank you" to mobs with pitchforks ... --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<li><b>Conditional Delete</b> If no more clearer definition of what qualifies as supermodel emerges at <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermodel.html" title="Supermodel">Supermodel</a> which could be applied to this list than delete.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I actually find this page to be useful. The names on the list are who many people, especially those in the industry consider supermodels. For example, the likes of Twiggy, Linda Evangelista, Gisele Bundchen, Gemma Ward, Daria Werbowy, etc.. This page is very useful. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELil_Flip246_7a32.html" title="User:Lil Flip246">Lil Flip246</a> 15:37, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Could you explain why this list is useful, and how it has been determined that "many people, especially those in the industry" consider those listed to be "supermodels"? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 16:16, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This list is useful because it shows who the term supermodel was used for. These models have the qualities as those mentioned in the supermodel article. If we don't have this list, people will just name random models supermodels. For example, Rachel Hunter who is NOT a supermodel. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELil_Flip246_7a32.html" title="User:Lil Flip246">Lil Flip246</a> 03:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Using your example, why not? She's internationally famous, probably has a higher-than-average income, has modelled for Sports Illustrated, Cover Girl, Estee Lauder, Revlon, etc., and has parlayed her modelling into other opportunities in the entertainment industry. As the term "supermodel" is largely made-up, it just shows the problems of trying to have a fixed set of criteria and the inherent subjectivity of the article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 17:59, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You answered neither of my questions. <i>Why</i> is it useful to show for whom the term "supermodel" has been used? And how have you determined (by what research) that those included in the list have the qualities (which qualities, exactly?) mentioned in the supermodel article, and those not included in the list do not have those qualities? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 23:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The term "supermodel" is a bit too fuzzy for my taste, and even if it wasn't, this would be better served by catergories anyhow. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 21:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. Those in the list fit the description described in the supermodel page. If we don't include this list, we will have everyone using the term loosely on those who Are Not Supermodels like Rachel Hunter and Caprice Bourret. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELil_Flip246_7a32.html" title="User:Lil Flip246">Lil Flip246</a> 17:45, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Lil Flip, <b>please only "vote" once</b>. You've already been corrected once in this regard. If you have further comments to make, please be clear that it is a comment and not a new "vote" (and please be aware this is not a <i>vote</i>, but a discussion regarding consensus: please read <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion#Discussion</a>). As an aside, there is no other way to use the term but loosely, because there is no set definitive criteria for being a supermodel. It's entirely subjective. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:01, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The definition and standards of a supermodel are explained in the supermodel page.
