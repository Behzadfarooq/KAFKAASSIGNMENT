<p>Not notable enough to have a page. There are thousands of thousands books. A book must be very very notable to have a page(e.g. Bible, Quran, Dante's divine comedy etc etc). I don't expect to find this book while searching in Encyclopedia Britannica for example. Aside from this, the scholarship of the author is also believed to be fundamentally flawed by university professors like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Ernst_52f3.html" title="Carl Ernst">Carl Ernst</a>, please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Furthermore, if there is any controversy, it should be addressed in "Criticism of X" articles.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 12:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It has received enough media attention to be notable. For example here is an interview about the book in Publishers Weekly: <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6368868.html?nid=2287" class="external free" title="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6368868.html?nid=2287" rel="nofollow">http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6368868.html?nid=2287</a> -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 13:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The book is quite notable, it has been featured on C-Span <a href="http://www.booktv.org/General/index.asp?segID=7722&amp;schedID=470" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.booktv.org/General/index.asp?segID=7722&amp;schedID=470" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1086" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1086" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and aside from being a conroversial book in its own right has been the topic of numerous news reports as well--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 13:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">User:CltFn</a> created a page for each of Robert Spencer's books in order to further Spencer's anti-Islam views. His views are controversial and not taken seriously by scholars to the best of my knowledge; he also runs a website that contains material that's arguably Islamophobic, as well as legitimate material. Most importantly, he isn't notable enough to have so many pages devoted to his views; the descriptions of his books can be added to his biography. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per above. The book is not notable enough to deserve an article of its own. Any useful content can be merged into authors' article or Critism of Islam page. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJyothisingh_3ee3.html" title="User:Jyothisingh">Jyothisingh</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Per Karl and <b>Comment</b> this sort of agenda pushing mass nomination should be banned. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 15:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Obvious keep</b> All books by this author nominated by this user, possible WP:POINT or something? Notable. <a href="../../../f/2E/f/User%7EF.F.McGurk_e625.html" title="User:F.F.McGurk">F.F.McGurk</a> 15:52, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> #348 in book sales at Amazon.com is impressive, as is the TV coverage. Criticism that the author is wrong or an editor doesn't like him are irrelevant to this discussion, and the standards stated by the nonminator for which books we should have articles about are not those established by Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a bad-faith nomination that does not cite policy in its deletion reasoning. There is no precedent "very very notable" in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a> proposed guideline or anywhere else (and by analogy, we should have almost no articles on television episodes or music albums if that were the case). The argument by analogy with Britannica is also outside of policy, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. The argument against the author's "scholarship" is a content dispute and does not belong at AFD. If the author believes a merge is warranted, use appropriate templates for that proposal.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:10, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - the author is already a NY Times Bestseller, any new books he writes are going to be notable by extension. (Compare to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> which states that all the alumbs of a notable band are considered notable...I don't see the difference here.) <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 19:38, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Largely due to procedure as it seems to meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a>. The book was the subject on <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_TV_5a39.html" title="Book TV">Book TV</a> on January 6<a href="http://www.booktv.org/General/index.asp?segID=7722&amp;schedID=470" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.booktv.org/General/index.asp?segID=7722&amp;schedID=470" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and another poster cited a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publisher%27s_Weekly_c64c.html" title="Publisher's Weekly">Publisher's Weekly</a> interview. These things I think make a book notable according to current guidelines. The nominator seems to want a stricter policy on the notability of books. I'm not necessarily opposed to a stricter policy, but I think a new policy needs to be discussed as AfDs alone will likely not create one.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 21:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, book published by a non-vanity press. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 01:43, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Quite notable. Islamophobia is not a good reason to delete an article about a book, and neither is disagreement with the content of the book.--<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 05:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Um, you do realise that this is a book that made the New York Times best-seller list? Even if we were to merge the content back into the article about the author, it would be <b>essential</b> to keep this entry as a redirect... and so even then, it doesn't need an AfD nomination. (And if you want to tighten the notability criteria for books, I'd suggest this one is very much a <i>bridge too far</i> as a test case...!) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 06:08, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and block <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">User:Aminz</a> from AfD's. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 06:41, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The fact that the book is thououghly debunked makes it no less notable. After all, We have an entry for The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and these books are about the same as far as accuracy and honesty goes. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> 07:43, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: If it's a <i>fact</i> that it's <i>thououghly debunked</i> (and I don't doubt this, I don't know either way) then please add some references and/or external links to this effect to the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This seems to be representative of the content of many if not all of the <i>delete</i> votes, so I think a reply is in order, in order to save everyone's time in the future. It appears to be purely an expression of a personal opinion. In terms of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:deletion policy</a>, it has little relevance to the decision. Having voted myself, I won't be acting as closing admin, but if I were, these votes wouldn't count for very much, even if they were numerous enough to seem significant at first glance.
