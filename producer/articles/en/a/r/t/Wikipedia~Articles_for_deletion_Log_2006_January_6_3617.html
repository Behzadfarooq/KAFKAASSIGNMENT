<li><b>Strong Delete</b> A few issues, first of all edited out the "Bands are closely related to Deathrock" part, because these bands AFI, A7X, MCR, Aiden, and other current <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Topic_73ec.html" title="Hot Topic">Hot Topic</a> style bands have nothing to do with the Goth genre or Deathrock.</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be noted, Goth-Punk is a phrase sometimes used to describe what <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deathrock.html" title="Deathrock">Deathrock</a> sounds like but non of the bands in the article.</p>
<p>This article has been heavily edited by the same guy who made the "Gothcore", joke article "BatlordCarcas", which is also nominated for deletion at the moment. He seems to try to incorporate his mallcore leaning into every article that he edits, that is why it did say "Goth-punk" in the Aiden article. - <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 19:31, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>According to their own articles AFI are "hardcore" and MCR are difficult to pin down, but described in the infobox as "post-hardcore/rock". Obviously if you were describing them to a friend you might call them 'goth-punk', but a genre isn't just any old adjective that can be used to describe a band. To meet Wikipedia standards of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, it has to be used to describe a distinct category of music by different sources who are all talking about roughly the same thing. (Although it looks like this is a relatively uncontested delete, I mention this now because imaginary genres keep coming up on AfD, and editors can find it difficult to pin down what makes a genre a genre and not an adjective someone made up).--<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 14:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Several people have voted to keep as the school is notable, yet I fail to find anything on the page that auggests it is. Has it been mentioned in the news?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't want to argue (your vote is a good as mine). However, I would like to point out that saying "one of the more prominent cricket leagues in America" is like saying "one of the more prominent <a href="../../../k/l/e/Klezmer.html" title="Klezmer">Klezmer</a> bands in <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozambique.html" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>." Heck, if I were to gather up a bunch of South Asian college students at Ohio State, divide them into elevens and give them bats and balls, I'd have one of the most-prominent cricket leagues in America by default. I'm afraid that some of the voters on this topic may not be aware of just how much of a nonentity cricket is in the U.S. I'd bet most Americans haven't ever heard of the sport.

The band is notable within the black metal scene, and I would cite from the notability guideline: <i>"Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture."</i> Multiple and varied black metal and general metal press reports can be found here: <a href="http://www.velvetcacoon.com/press/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.velvetcacoon.com/press/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Since black metal has its own page on Wikipedia, I'd assume that it is a notable sub-culture.

<li>I see. I couldn't tell from casual reading that those two albums were more "real" than the others. Could you reformat that section so that it is more apparent? Since you appear to be the primary author of the article you I assume you know about the subject well. If we end up deciding VC is notable then perhaps you should create an article for FMP as well. Wikipedia has a policy of requiring <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>; are the claims in this article verifiable if the band lies about themselves?

A list of press releases is not the same as "frequently covered", and in addition, by your claims about them being not truthful, it's hard to trust that web page, isn't it?&#160;:) As for diminishing overall knowledge, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>; many band articles are deleted every day for lack of notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> - This group may shortly be notable, so userfying the information might be useful. At present it would appear to have only one actual signed release with "Full Moon Productions" and thus does not meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> (cf., <a href="http://www.fmp666.com" class="external text" title="http://www.fmp666.com" rel="nofollow">FMP Prod.</a>) The notability of FMP is also in doubt because of the 40,000 Yahoo! search hits, only ~1000 actually relate to that company (crosslink with search term "black metal") with a number relating to a promotion company based in LA.--<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleuthero_444b.html" title="User:Eleuthero">eleuthero</a> 21:06, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Velvet Cacoon has made some of the best black metal of the last couple of years. Unlike most of you users who are commenting here, I actually listen to black metal (sorry if I am wrong) and am a fan of this band. Even if VC has lied about aspects of the band, or even releases, they still are a band, and a notable one in the USBM scene. I think that the fact that they have lied and formed an image that is fabricated actually adds to their importance. It is a social experiment that shows that we as music listeners are as much attracted to the "hype" surrounding the band as the music they create. All Music Guide is not the definitive source for all music, as it would imply. There is much notable underground music that goes unnoticed. It can only be used as a resource, not the only source for what "music" is. I have also talked to people who have some of the other releases, and they do exist. And I think you can consider them "notable" in the scene, as on FMP's message board, the latest VC thread has 2,140 hits. Pretty high. FMP was the first black metal label to be formed in the US, which takes the wind out of the argument that the label is not notable. This is a strong keep.--Fmalcangi 17:30, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> Velvet Cacoon is a real band, and Full Moon Productions is a real label. AMG/WP are not effective tools to garnering information on underground music.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Was heading towards a 'weak keep' when they got a Google hit which described it as one of the 'big four' studios in the Philippines, but it went on to say that those four "...are all virtually closed down due to the proliferation of individual and collective modes of film production". That was the only Google hit I could find that related to this company that looked anything like a possible source for an encyclopaedia article. As it stands, we have no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> evidence of anything, let alone meeting <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. And of the five blue-linked actors, we have two articles created by this article's author (who might themselves be deletion candidates), two actors with no apparent relation to the studio, and a redirect to a Tintin character. I'd really like to know what the 'keep' voters see in this article that I don't. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 19:37, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Further to that, it sort of seems from the few (very few) Google hits that this company existed and at least used to make films. But if kept, the article would have to be reduced to a tiny stub, since there's no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> that they a) made those movies b) worked in those genres c) were associated with those actors (those that appear to exist - both of them). And then the article would have to be watched to make sure that the unverified information wasn't put back in. Two last things worth mentioning: the official languages of the Philippines are English and Filipino, the latter of which uses the Roman alphabet, so the fact that Google finds very little isn't a language problem. And the Filipino Wikipedia doesn't have an article on this company. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 20:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not major media? I believe it's Australia's largest circulation newspaper. The link is in the article, which I assume you read. The CD was also prominently reviewed by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a>.

<ul>
<li>I did read the article, however I had forgotten that that the link was from the SMH. It was so brief, I assumed that you were talking about something else. It's not a major <i>music</i> magazine, which is the criterion I was referring to. See Category:Music magazines.</li>
<li>The lack allmusic entry in of itself means nothing, systemic bias and all. It's just an easy way to see if something passes the bar: two albums on major label, international tour, gold album, etc. These guys don't appear to have those.</li>

<li>Um, my point is that these inclusion guidelines were worked out by a very large number of wikipedians over no small amount of time, and if we are going to ignore them in this case it would be nice to know what the <i>reason</i> for doing that is. This isn't straight forward, so I may spread the word a bit to get a wider opinion. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 04:10, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It seems to me that it is you that is ignoring the spirit of the guidelines. You like to make accusations, but reviews in two of Australia's leading newspapers with combined circulation of over 400,000 is far more impressive to me than a mention in many of the so called major music media in our category. Furthermore, do you really doubt given this exposure that the Conglomerate has been mentioned in Jazz publications in Australia? Have you even tried to confirm this? And why you deny the connection with the Cat Empire is beyond me. At times I can not understand what motivates your zeal. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 07:59, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I'm just trying to be consistant and orderly, as is my nature. I'm sorry if I've offended or insulted you, or if you feel like I've made "accusations".

<li>I don't see how it's convenient to compare a country of 100 million people to a radio station with maybe 1 million listeners. In fact it seems highly misleading. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:58, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Let me reprase then: It's highly misleading to compare record sales in a large country with listener votes to a moderately-sized radio station. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:09, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, I'm not trying to mislead anyone. Did I do something that suggests I'm so deceitful or biased? I'm just pointing out similar topics -- countdown lists.

<p>I have been working on redirecting all the uninhabited substub islands to their respective atolls, personally I think that an article "X is one of the uninhabited islands in Y atoll" is so devoid of content that it warrants deletion for that reason, but I cannot be bothered to start up AFD debates for all of them. Now, this article is not a substub however, there is a claim to notability, but I cannot verify it at all. A Google search on "Patricia Raglin Kudafares" turned up <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=Patricia+Raglin+Kudafares&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=Patricia+Raglin+Kudafares&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">nothing</a>.

This article is obviously a fraud - it claims that the person won the Miss Universe 2005 paegeant and yet the very same Miss Universe page that it links to lists the winner for 2005 as someone else.

<li><b>Keep</b> All of the nominator's arguments are wrong imo. It is not indiscrimate because it is restricted to <i>nicknames</i> of <i>cities</i> in the <i>United States</i>. That's a pretty clear set of parameters. I totally fail to see the relevance of the point about original research; any of these names must be widely known so many people could have added them without doing research and many are also given in many <i>secondary</i> sources. If both of these ways of sourcing information are prohibited every single wikipedia article will have to be deleted. The claim that it is not verifiable is patently false. If there are some that are not verifiable remove them as errors, otherwise read the articles about <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> to discover how easily facts can be checked on the internet.

<li>Actually, a better recommendation would be to read <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>. Despite the assertion above that these nicknames are given in secondary sources, <i>not a single one</i> of them is accompanied by a citation in the article. Indeed, there are only two or three sources cited in the article at all (one of which is a source cited to <i>disprove</i> an element of the article). It would not be unreasonable for editors to come along and remove almost the entire content of the article and require that nothing be re-added unless a source was cited for it. This has happened to other lists. I strongly recommend that the authors of the article begin citing sources for each nickname immediately in order to prevent this. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:42, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The nominator should review Wikipedia policies about reversions and deletions.

<li><b>Comment</b> Did you also notice that 'Jax' was just one of three nicknames I reverted, none of which had any citation? <s>[[Wikipedia:Verification clearly says that</s> I would also note that airport codes are not the same thing as nicknames (I've never heard anyone call Tallahassee 'TLH', for example, although I did live there for a while). As it happens, 'Jax' has a long standing as a nickname for Jacksonville (well before the airport code was assigned), and I have a reliable hardcopy source for it, but I have to find the book, as I don't add unsourced material to articles. I'll add the citation after I find the book. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 22:28, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>rewite / build</b> This is in the process of being re-written and has received some initial amendments. However, some people would serve themselves and (more importantly) the audience of Wikipedia greater if they examined the mainstream version they are necessarily protecting, examined the evidence offered in some of the alternatives, and didn't simply dismiss something just because Graham Hancock also wrote it in a book! This page can and is being re-written - it is a process, just as some tweaks to bring neutrality were necessary and made to the 'main page'. Build the page, correct the bits that are not NPOV, and allow it to house the bits that otherwise will overflow to the 'standard theory' page. It is, after all, mostly arguable theory on <b>both</b> sides of the coin. FYI I am perfectly capable of writing neutral prose, although i do have my opinions; sometimes they sneak out. I'm sure you wouldn't do the same...--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenesisBlade_eebe.html" title="User:GenesisBlade">Genesis</a> 17:29, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thought I'd have a go at trying to rewrite the article to achieve NPOV and remove unverified evidence, but I had to give up after only a few paragraphs. The article is just too POV (e.g. "<i>These archaeologists claim that this amounts to sufficient evidence to state their model as though it were fact.</i>") and makes both "extraordinary" and EXTREMELY VAGUE claims without citation (e.g. "<i>The problem for any dating is that the age of the rock is of no help...</i>") . You'd have to remove so much of it to get it into an encyclopedic state that you'd be left with no more than a few lines. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 07:41, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> NPOV doesn't mean it must adhere to the standard point of view, yet in this case it has to state itself as different from the standard. Making any mention of its claims (apparently, dating an ancient building based on the discovery of a small amount of circumstantial evidence, from debris found excavated near by, DOESN'T comprise an extraordinary claim then?) is interpreted as against the neutral, yet its actually just against the common view. Not so long ago, the NPOV was that women were less important than men... to suggest different would have been considered outlandish, and any proof offered through logic considered unsubstantial. Things change. Sometimes. FYI what is 'wrong' about the statement 'dating the rock is no help'? it's a fact, surely! Dating the age of the rock is completely useless in dating the age of a building! this is an example of an un-neutral viewpoint taking editorial action on a piece; the veracity of the statements doesn't actually matter.--194.73.217.241 (Genesis) 09:17, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read the sentence again. As it stands here. Or in the article. It seems entirely counter-intuitive in both cases. IANAArcheologist but surely the purpose of dating is to <i>determine</i> the age of the rock, so how does that statement make any kind of sense? <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 13:56, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>...they don't date the rock itself; they don't date the actual building!? They date circumstantial evidence from the surrounding area; usually this has some authority, because the finds are clearly related. However, in the circumstances of the Great Pyramid on the Giza plateau, the evidence has been very meagre to come by. Thus they have found very little by way of viable archaeological finds, with nothing substantial to tie them to the actual building of the pyramid. Usually, with tombs, they have plenty of evidence by way of carvings or painting on the walls, non-gold artefacts left by the raiders... they have actual evidence tying the location to a person or event, even a god. It is not the case with the Great Pyramid. The question raised in some of the alternative theories of the age has been how valid the dating of these finds is. Yet, according to all the above, and discussions elsewhere, stating this is deemed outside the NPOV. That is to misconstrue, however, the meaning of NPOV. Neutral is not merely the mainstream view. Neutral is balance between opposing valid arguments, where they exist, and having the articles not express personal opinions. It is also exposing weaknesses in arguments where they exist. I am endeavouring to do the same to the alternatives, but at the moment I spend more of my limited time defending their right to exist than doing this. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenesisBlade_eebe.html" title="User:GenesisBlade">Genesis</a> 16:37, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is another obvious <b>keep</b> of a notable academic. She has published three books and probably many articles, and she has a leading position at a major university. What else do you want?

<p>This page is subject to high levels of bias towards this establishment. Wikipedia's goal is to give only the facts to readers, not an article creator's view of the facts. This line if of particular disturbance however: "the school's success is due to a well-rounded curriculum, skilled teaching staff, strong work ethic and a school-wide academic focus". No lines such as this should be featured in Wikipedia articles, as not only do they offend patrons of this online service, but they have no basis or evidence to support them. The reason this article should be deleted instead of changed, however, is because much of the information is misleading and/or deceptive. For example, the information that "BGS has consistently outranked all other Queensland high schools" is false. How is this statement justified, and upon what is it based? Also, "In most sports that BGS competes in, it ranks well compared to other schools". Where is the evidence? I have checked records of the school and found that in many sports it does not rank well, rather faltering quite near the bottom of the GPS competition's ladder. In conclusion, much, if not all of the Brisbane Grammar School article is plagued by bias and clearly deceptive information. This article cannot be redeemed, and must be deleted. <a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 11:32, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - are you seriously suggesting that you want one of Brisbane's Greater Public Schools deleted entirely because of few lines of bias!! Mate, simply remove the lines in question, place a notice at the top of the article and leave a message on the talk page just like you would with any other biased article. Do not put it up for deletion, especially if it is a high school.

<li>I am fully aware of the ability to clean up an article, but this article needs to be deleted. I have the sneaking suspicion that the comments above have been posted by patrons or teachers at the school. Stop now, because Wikipedia does not tolerate such disgusting deceptive behaviour. 'Jcuk' made an alarming statement: "clean up, as per the schools policy". This only confirms my belief. What you are doing is absolutely disgusting. This is Wikipedia. Wikipedia does not conform to some school policy, it conforms to the Wikipedia policy.

<li>What Jcuk meant by "per the schools policy" (note lack of apostrophe) is not "per the policy of the Brisbane School" but rather "per the Wikipedia policy regarding school articles".

I suspect, given the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tall_Poppy_Syndrome_561b.html" title="Tall Poppy Syndrome">Tall Poppy Syndrome</a> that surrounds the School, that Paaerduag is simply trying to harm the School (and satisfy himself) by putting this page up for deletion.

<li>If you even dare to mention that I am leveling ENVY towards whatever this school is (I actually live in Canada), I resent you. I simply point out faults in the article, and that is all I have done. For you, 'Theheadhunter', to think I am guilty of a personal dislike for the establishment in question, you would be severely mistaken, and I think that YOU should keep your comments outside of this page because it is YOU that has emotional attachments to this school. Oh, and incase someone else is going to criticize me of lying about my identity, I assure you ALL that <b>I am Paaerduag</b>.</li>

<li><b>keep</b>. I wrote this stub to do something about the topic that was started off with the wrong foot at the currently being at AfD article East Ukraine. The current name "East-West dissimilarity in Ukraine" may not be the best one and I would welcome any rename suggestion. The problem is that one can't introduce the reader to the concept of Eastern Ukraine without constantly referring to what in its history and demographics makes it different from Western Ukraine. One article, where the issue is discussed seems like the most convinient solution. For more, please see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_East_Ukraine_b0c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/East Ukraine">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/East Ukraine</a> and talk:East-West dissimilarity in Ukraine. This listing, OTOH, seems a retaliation of the author of East Ukraine for its being AfD listed (not by me BTW).

<dd>Edit summaries going back through early December show edit warring between several other editors. The point of contention seems to be between those who find "Arabic numerals" biased for whatever reason and those who argue from common usageI took the recent push for "Hindu numerals" to be as part of this.

<dd>There was a revert war mainly between two obscure editors who have since then disappeared. Their edit histories show that they never edited anything on wikipedia except that article. However, their revert war had nothing to do with naming of the article. I don't fully understand what exactly they were fighting for. Their discussion got hopelessly mixed with an independent discussion, in which there was a consensus built to rename the article to "Hindu-Arabic numerals", based on reasons that are summarized <a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArabic_numerals_naming_e7bd.html" title="Talk:Arabic numerals/naming">here</a>. After this name change, there was another vote to change the name back to "Arabic numerals." The name was changed back to AN despite a verdict for HAN, but the admin reverted that change later. The current name change was done by another editor, and currently the matter is under discussion. At no point, however, did anyone propose "Hindu numerals" as the title. All I can remember is a comment by the editor who created this fork, asking why is there the word "Arabic" at all in the title. This editor didn't contribute to the discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArabic_numerals_890a.html" title="Talk:Arabic numerals">Talk:Arabic numerals</a> apart from his vote and this comment. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 07:03, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm fairly new to Wikipedia so bear with me. You mean like this: <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategory_37f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Category">Wikipedia:Category</a>? So each company would have its own page, with a bit about their history, and they would all be put into a category which would automatically generate a list of them? I hope eventually to write something about the history of the battle between animal rights and laboratory animal breeders in the UK, which has been in the news a lot over the past 10-15 years at least So this would need a page to itself, but then this page could be linked to the Category? So it acheives the same result by different means? Arfan2006 17:44, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm not a fan of lists in general, but I can't see any reason to single this one out. These are notable companies because what they do is regarded as controversial. They make no attempt to hide themselves, and the claim above that it's a method to coordinate "terrorist" activity makes little sense since anyone involved in opposing these companies will already know about them. The page satisfies the criteria at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> and there's nothing in the deletion policy that would allow deletion. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:31, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. What about this list, for example?: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_motorcycle_manufacturers.html" title="List of motorcycle manufacturers">List_of_motorcycle_manufacturers</a>. I can't see it's any different other than the addresses not being present. Also, an outside directory will only have current companies and won't have it in its historical context. Would it be better if I removed the addresses from this page? Each company still links to its own individual page which could have these kind of details on. Arfan2006 17:35, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These companies are the subject of noteworthy controversy in the UK, precisely because they supply lab animals.

<dd>I've had a look into categories and it seems that a category can't have an introduction that ties it all together and explains the context and history behind the category as a whole. Also it requires that each member of the category have its own separate page, and some members may not warrant this, although they would still be noteworthy within the overall page. How is this problem usually handled? By having a standard entry *and* a category entry? Arfan2006 13:27, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Update: I've experimented with some categories and you can put an intro but the problem is it requires each item to have their own individual page and that isn't really appropriate e.g. I'd like to list all the Harlan premises that have closed separately, but at the moment they are all listed together on the main <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlan_%28company%29.html" title="Harlan (company)">Harlan</a> page, as I don't think they warrant their own pages.

<dd>What Wikipedia guidelines does this article break? I think it is of historical interest given the political climate in the UK over the past decade. There are many pages which have lists of frivolous and trivial things so I can't see why this should be disallowed. Should it be written as an article rather than as a list? I could add it to one of the animal rights pages but I think they are full enough already. Many of the companies mentioned have their own pages - this just ties them all together. I think that the suggestion it be deleted is just due to political bias and an attept to censor information. Arfan2006 17:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You make some valid points. Perhaps you can expand the introduction somewhat to give it a greater sense of context, and then I will consider changing my vote.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I say it's a nice comprehensive list, however several game articles have a weapons list that should be put into this article. Also, I've put a LOT of work into the article, and to see it removed would make me disappointed. Maybe a rename such as List of real-life weapons in video games could work? Because then we don't have to limit it to just first-person shooters, and maybe third-person shooter games (and certain other games such as <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_Evil_%28game%29_631a.html" title="Resident Evil (game)">Resident Evil</a>) could be listed as well. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonicBH_369d.html" title="User:TonicBH">TonicBH</a> 20:34, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Since I didn't want the work to be wasted, some of the pages that didn't have weapon lists or had partial/incomplete ones now have complete weapons lists (see <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightfire.html" title="Nightfire">Nightfire</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Soldier_of_Fortune_II%7E_Double_Helix_1519.html" title="Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix">Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix</a>, <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Terror_f2b8.html" title="Urban Terror">Urban Terror</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b> I dont see any propaganda or self promotion, unless you count the statements of belief as propaganda, in which case we may as well delete all articles about religious groups, as all are going to deal to some extent with that groups belief system.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hey. Thought id mention, being from the same areas mentioned in the Technobangman section and working in the film industry myself, i have heard whispers that two very well known forces in the British film industry are making a similair film (comedy). Apparently, the pair are fed up with the cinema critics giving them special attention, based on previous work in the industry. As a result of this frustration they may have used unknown names and an unknown production company to use during shooting. However, this could all be just a load of rubbish but i thought id mention it in case its useful.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hello I am Liam Burbridge, one founder of technobangman. the reason i have not been searched for on google is because I'M NOT FAMOUS. we are a low budget film production company and are trying to start out with barely any funds. a place on wikipedia would mean we can be searched for on this site and google and would be a great help. i would be happy to add sources to make technobangman more authentic if you told me how. thanks (liamcb@aol.co <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> <a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamcb_b497.html" title="User:Liamcb">Liamcb</a> (<a href="../../../l/i/a/User_talk%7ELiamcb_a2f7.html" title="User talk:Liamcb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Liamcb_337d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Liamcb">contribs</a>)</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi there, i would like to mention that Technobangman does exist and that I, Sean Brophy are in fact a background artist on Pegface, the company has only recently started and is yet to establish itself, if you were to give it a chance and not doubt its credibility then you will see that in a few years it Mr Burbridge and Mr Hullait will be hitting the Hollywood scene.

<li><b>comment</b> then in a few years we would be glad to have an artilce about them or this project. Wikipedia does not generally have articles about things that are not in some way already notable or of encyclopedic value. Things or people that might be notable someday are nor normally included. "I'M NOT FAMOUS", "trying to start out", and "yet to establish itself" all pretty clearly indicate that thsi does not belong in wikipedia. If Technobangman has recieved significant coverage in major media, please indicate this in the article, providing dates and story titles/headlines, and links if the content is online. Otherwise this looks like a probable delete to me. My previous vote is only strenghtened by these comments. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:10, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> The argument is very common these days, and there can be plenty room for both sides in the article. To use reductio ad absurdum, there's an article on holocaust denial and the wikipedia is not actually denying the holocaust. (I'm not stating the view that the two are equivalent; I am just making the point that the subject is very relevant, and it's existence does not imply the support of the belief that Christmas is under attack.)</li>
<li>The article is a morass of POV garbage - it's initial creation was someone making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. Nevertheless, it is decidedly notable, so Speedy keep it is. --Jeffrey O. Gustafson - <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_Contributions_507d.html" title="User:Jeffrey O.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>* The Anti-Christian groups are trying to hide the facts that they are suing us over Christmas. I received threats to not put up Christmas lights on my house, or else I would be sued. Check court records and see how many lawsuits are filed over Christmas, then you will see that there is a real war on Christmas. Ironic that the vote to delete this article was made on Christmas, when most Christians are busy and not on Wikipedia to defend the article. You can really see the bias there by the Anti-Christians and their hate. --Charles Schram 01:23, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. What's so extraordinarily special about the Toolstation Premier Division, a league of football/soccer sides from the Bristol (UK, not Tennessee) area, that merely being in the league merits an article for each team? I could see a team in the UK's top division being considered notable without further evidence of distinction. But I don't recognize anything about this local-area league that distinguishes it from hundreds, probably thousands, of other regional and local sports leagues. Can someone show citations more significant than listings of scores from newspaper sports sections?

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 1. This article has already been voted for to be kept, 2. The vast amount of internet sites that describe a circumcision fetish make it certain it is not simply made up or Original Research. That there are no reliable sources (medical peer reviewed journals providing articles about circumcision fetish) is not reason to delete it, as few fetishes as described on Wikipedia would actually qualify under that standard. It would open a slippery slope that would legitimize removal of most if not all fetish articles and ultimately most if not all wikipedia articles. Dabljuh 15:10, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If there are a <i>vast</i> number of sites that describe circumcision fetishes, why isn't there even <i>one</i> circumcision fetish site cited in the article (as distinguished from some isolated quotes on political advocacy sites)? The slippery slope argument is odd. No one is proposing removing <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_fetish.html" title="Foot fetish">foot fetish</a>, because foot fetishes aren't <i>completely fabricated</i>.

The raging battle for the conquest of manhood where only one will walk away a MAN ends in the loser being CIRCUMCISED. His glans bare and a scar to show his defeat.</dd>
<dd>Max, the Circumcision Master, preps the still warm, pink loose foreskin for it's exicution. First the Betadine, then the EMLA cream to numb the sensative nerves. The audience of 20 naked men (mostly CIRCUMCISED...ready to welcome a new member to their people) gasp as the Tara KLamp is placed over the doomed foreskin...then clasped...then......CIRCUMCISED!</dd>

<dd>"Like me, this guy also had a <b>circumcision fetish</b>. He loved thinking about it and planning it. So, our first sex play began with you show me your skanky skin, and I'll show you how one looks after it's had an adult circumcision. He worshiped my scar with his tongue. He sucked my flared, bare head. He begged me to fuck (dock) inside his boy-skin. I eventually bent him over and fucked his uncircumcised boy-ass. Our first time together was all about foreskin and circumcision. It was very hot. During future activities, we always included talk about my circumcision and his pending circumcision in our play. We even began simulating his own circumcision....tying him down and placing film canisters under his skin, etc. Eventually we bought a Gomco and a Tara clamp for our play. After about one year, we actually had him circumcised, which was very hot."</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> "If there are a vast number of sites that describe circumcision fetishes, why isn't there even one circumcision fetish site cited in the article (as distinguished from some isolated quotes on political advocacy sites)?" Circumcision fetish sites don't necessarily describe themselves as such. Circlist and The Acorn Club are clear examples. The "isolated quotes" are many and consistent. Features of the stories they tell are an obsessive focus on the details of circumcision and aspects of humiliation, submission and "punishment" (Humiliation fetishism is listed as one of the common types). <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHugh7_d3fe.html" title="User:Hugh7">Hugh7</a> 08:08, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Lists of tropical cyclone names is encyclopedic; "Tropical Storm Alex (2010)" is not, even though it is virtually certain that a storm of that name will occur in the North Atlantic and will turn counterclockwise." That seems to match future eclipses perfectly. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 15:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it's not a perfect match. While the chance of a tropical storm occuring in 2010 is extremely high, the chance that future eclipses will happen is orders of magnitude more likely. You could almost say as likely as the sun will rise tomorrow morning.&#160;:) Unless some *extremely* improbable event happens, such as the Earth being destroyed by <a href="../../../v/o/g/Voguns.html" title="Voguns">Voguns</a>, these eclipses will happen. I still wouldn't link to the dates, however.

<li>Maybe I've misinterpreted, but I interpreted that sentence, specifically "<i>even though</i> it is virtually certain", to mean that crystal balling does not necessarily exclude articles about subjects that are certain to happen. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 19:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The exact wording is, "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place." Basically what it would take to alter this schedule is a collision with a very large comet - a collision on a scale neither the earth nor moon have experienced in hundreds of millions of years.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well that's exactly my point. The <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> article already has a list of recent and upcoming (to 2020) eclipses across the world. The question I ask to the Wikipedia community in this AFD is whether or not a separate article is needed for China, with eclipses ranging from 1001 to 3000. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 03:34, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Solar eclipses can be seen from worldwide area is very different from solar eclipses can be seen from a specific location. For worldwide, total solar eclipses are common, about once every one or two years, but for a specific location, they are very rare events, about once every 300 years. So it makes sense to list these rare events in a separated article. — Yaohua2000 09:44, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But one could just check the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> page and look for eclipses in their region of the world (it says where the eclipse will happen on that page). Now, it doesn't go as far into the future as this article, but whether or not a list really needs to go to 3000 is a separate debate (which I'm sure those at the Solar eclipse page have already debated). --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 14:01, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I always wondering when I can see a total solar eclipse in my hometown when I was a child, total eclipse is rather rare, and it is not easy for a layman to work it out with enough precision, for people with similar questions, this article focuses on the previous and next total and annular solar eclipses from a specific location on the Earth, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> doesn't contain such information, and such information is also rare on the web. Wikipedia and this article gives the answer. So I think it is useful, and perhaps encyclopedic, if it has a worldwide view some time, it can be a great article. — Yaohua2000 20:26, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> does in fact have that information (or is being added). If I were someone in New York, I could go to the Solar eclipse article and look for the next time an eclipse will occur for me in that list (by looking for "North America"). Same thing if I were anywhere in the world. If I were in Beijing, I'd go and look for eclipses under Asia. Solar eclipse already has this worldwide view that you speak of, and so pages like this aren't needed in my opinion. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 21:01, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you did some research on this topic, you might not think so. Absolute most (&gt; 95%) total solar eclipses in North America is not total in New York. Even in Beijing, Beijing municipality is far smaller than North America, but during A.D. 1001 and A.D. 2000 period <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beijing&amp;oldid=30993185#Astronomical_phenomena" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beijing&amp;oldid=30993185#Astronomical_phenomena" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, 7 total eclipses occured from somewhere in the municipality, but only one visible in the urban area. So for someone only check total eclipses visible in North America, or even State of New York doesn't make so much sense to total eclipses in New York City. — Yaohua2000 21:33, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So then a column on the Solar eclipse page e.g. "Total eclipse viewable in" would be a good idea, but it still doesn't change that a list about China itself (when the information could be put on the Solar eclipse page and represent a worldwide view) is "listcruft" in my opinion, as Sceptre put it. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 21:41, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and keep the future listings too. Eclipses are one of the very few things that really are predictable. Physics and mathematics do not equal a crystal ball. I'm going to go out on a limb here because my father was a NASA scientist and I grew up with this sort of stuff. I see what these list creators are doing and it makes a lot of sense. There should be more lists like this for other major cities. The information at <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> is too general to be useful for eclipse enthusiasts. These are people who spend thousands of dollars and plan years in advance so that they can observe the real show during a solar eclipse, and by that I mean the very small path of totality where the sky goes dark. This sort of person would want to know, "Will there be a total eclipse in my metropolitan area during my lifetime?" If they're likely to be alive for the next one, then that saves a small fortune. These people would use a series of similar lists because they would designate easy points of travel: nearly two-thirds of the earth's surface is ocean and some of the rest is pretty uninhabitable. I believe this year's total eclipse will be in the Sahara desert. Solar eclipses are about the most verifiable information on earth and they're unquestionably notable. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 07:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> on 3 points. The first two: the article violates both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> as it stands since it does not cite the source of its information. Third point: Even though I am really keen on physics and astronomy as a hobby, this kind of info qualifies as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a> and really belongs on some astronomy website, where the information probably comes from. Taken to one extreme, if this article is kept then similar articles <i>for every country in the world</i> would be equally acceptable and IMHO is overkill. Taken to another extreme, since prediction of eclipses is not crystal balling, predictions from the beginning of time to the end of time would be equally valid, and <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28numbers%29_3077.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)">Wikipedia is not infinite</a></b>. To answer the above point about eclipse enthusiasts, any true eclipse enthusiast worth his salt (and I am one, though probably not worth my salt) would keep an eye on astronomy websites and/or news of upcoming events. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 12:21, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you carried that reasoning to its logical conclusion Wikipedia would become a very small project supported only by journal articles and books.

<li>The limited English language skills of these article creators hinders their ability to advocate for these entries. Had I noticed these nominations I would have defended them all.

<li><b>Keep.</b> If you are not associated with the timber, logging, arborist or forestry industries I can understand why you might wish to delete. If however, you were associated with one of these industries/communities/culture or if you were one of the 100,000 or so customers of his, you would not likely consider deletion. Within these communities Bill is a bit of a legend. He has at times spoken before the US Congress to improve safety standards in our industry and has served on numerous timber and forest industry boards over the years. Additionally, his company is a small business success story. Current annual revenues are over 25 million US$. While this certainly isn't at the level of a Sam Walton, it is a success nonetheless. I had hoped to expand the page with more information and accomplishments at a later time and mainly put this page up as a placeholder. I've certainly seen many lesser-known and completely obscure people with pages. He also published a book now out of print, <i>Reflections of a Timberfaller</i>. That's my two cents and incidentally, in the interest of full-disclosure I do work for Bill, but I put up this page on my own without any coercion. --Jcon95482 00:14, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Okay, I will defer to the general consensus as Bill's book was self-published and his presentations before Congress were prior to 1994, which is only as far the online Congressional record goes. His work with Congress was in the late 70's and early 80's when safety in the timber industry was mostly non-existent. He fought to upgrade safety standards for forest workers during that time. Anyway, delete per nom.--Jcon95482 23:44, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I added the page because I found articles for <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bern_Switzerland_Temple_a695.html" title="Bern Switzerland Temple">Bern Switzerland Temple</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Illinois_Temple_e662.html" title="Chicago Illinois Temple">Chicago Illinois Temple</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freiberg_Germany_Temple_391b.html" title="Freiberg Germany Temple">Freiberg Germany Temple</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/n/Kona_Hawaii_Temple_8de4.html" title="Kona Hawaii Temple">Kona Hawaii Temple</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laie_Hawaii_Temple_ce85.html" title="Laie Hawaii Temple">Laie Hawaii Temple</a> and about 8 others. There are basically a smattering of random articles on about 10 of the 120 operating temples out there, and no comprehensive List Of article anywhere. I initially made the article to be a list of the temples that could link to other Wikipedia articles, but saw that with just a little effort I could make external links to the LDS pages. Please don't interpret it as a dump of an LDS page, it is meant to be a foundation for a Wikipedia article that links to richer Wiki articles on each temple. It needs to be expanded. I think that the external links add value, but agree that at the core the page needs to point to Wikipedia articles. Maybe a table with the external link and with the Wiki link. I haven't done tables though, I spent an hour on it as it was, and I thought that it could be done later. If you delete this, I think that this article will eventually be created. <a href="../../../b/h/l/User%7EBhludzin_20c6.html" title="User:Bhludzin">Bhludzin</a> 04:15, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think a simple list like this can be copyrightable. There is also an obvious difference between important religious sanctuaries and Walmart stores.

<dd>This would be more akin to a list of cathedrals than a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ottawa_churches_755b.html" title="List of Ottawa churches">List of Ottawa churches</a>. There are about 145 LDS temples currently operating or announced; this list up for deletion is missing the newest to be announced.

<dd>There are a number of notable stories for each temple, which make it more than just a list of buildings. There are the stories of miraculous events at the dedication of the Kirtland, Nauvoo and Salt Lake temples, Wilford Woodruff said he met with the signers of the Declaration of Independence in one, Lorenzo Snow said he met the Savior in another, plus probably thousands of journal accounts from less prominent people - I am assuming that there will eventually be Wikipedia articles for all of the temples listed. <a href="../../../b/h/l/User%7EBhludzin_20c6.html" title="User:Bhludzin">Bhludzin</a> 18:25, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>All right, I removed all red links, and added square feet. I want to keep the official LDS links because they link to the church page with the current temple hours, phone number, etc. I want to add architectural style as a column in the table, but please give me a break! I have frantically spent about 5 or 6 hours on this page in the last day trying to keep it from being deleted. Please spare it so that I can have a break and come back and do the architectural style information in several days (I do have a life outside of this). I also intend to start doing Wikipedia temple pages, where I can add Mormon historical events relevant to each temple (unless of course I have to frantically fight to keep each one from being deleted).

<li>I want to do the Temple articles. I think it seems natural to have a list that indexes and links to them. But, (correct me if I'm wrong) if the list includes external links then the list must be deleted? The external links supplement the list with "live" information.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I removed the "list of links" nature of this page - and updated the table in a few other ways. I also added wikisectioning so that individual rows with specific temple information can be individually edited and directly linked. I suggest that these changes address the concerns of the nom.
