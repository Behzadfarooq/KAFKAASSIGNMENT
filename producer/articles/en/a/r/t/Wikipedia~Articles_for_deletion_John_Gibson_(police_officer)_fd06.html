<li><b>Keep</b> but possibly merge as already discussed. We have had issues before regarding notability of police officers killed in the line of duty, on the previous one the decision was keep because a new memorial foundation was created as a result of the death. In this case, there is less information, and I think that the best way to get this article kept is to merge it as proposed by Dhartung. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 15:43, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Any officer killed in the Line of Duty is notable, because we are the peace keepers and we are supposed to be treated with respect and dignity, we keep you safe at night, we look out for you, an officer getting killed is one less officer to watch over you and your property. I hope this article will not be deleted.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I agree that any Police Officer killed in the line of duty is notable enough to have an article here. I disagree that the names should be listed with the victims of the incident as Police Officers are not "victims". The officers intentionally placed themselves in harms way to protect others. To list them as victims implies that they had no control over their fate, when in fact they chose to put themselves in harms way(thus making them notable). I also disagree that <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Chestnut_82c6.html" title="Jacob Chestnut">Jacob Chestnut</a> is barely notable. being the "first" anyone to lie in honor at the capitol is notable, as a matter of fact if you did something earning you the right to lie in honor at the capitol, I'd say your notable enough to have an article here. <a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEMT1871_3b56.html" title="User:EMT1871">EMT1871</a> 22:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Man, I really wish people would stop acting like suggesting that this guy isn't notable enough for an article is a personal affront to them. Some of y'all need to take a step back and stop taking the nomination so personally. It has nothing to do with any of you personally. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:57, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I find suggesting that a police officer killed in the line of duty is not notable enough to have an article on here personnaly offensive. secondly I'm pretty sure this is a forum for expressing our opinions on the subject so if my opinion is to strong for you, oh well. I happen to feel pretty strongly about this one, as is noted by the fact that I am writting anything here at all, and it happens to be a very personal issue for many people here. I find it personally offensive that the topic is even up for debate. Considering some of the things that pass as "notable" on this website,such as soccer players and minor celebreties, an article about a police officer killed in the line of duty should not even be questioned. As a matter of fact I would think that anyone who is a member of "wikiproject: Law Enforcement" would find this debate offensive.<a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEMT1871_3b56.html" title="User:EMT1871">EMT1871</a> 02:18, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did not say that I found the opinions expressed "offensive." I said that taking this personally is an error. Further, at no time did I suggest in any way that any editor was not free to express an opinion on this or any other nomination. If you're going to whip yourself up into a dudgeon, please try to do so over things that are actually said as opposed to things that you make up in your own head. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:49, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Situation Resolved</b> I have taken care of the problem with this article and followed the direction of most of the editors in merging all of the articles. I created a decent article which can be viewed <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Capitol_shooting_incident_%281998%29_d02a.html" title="U.S. Capitol shooting incident (1998)">HERE</a>. The concensus was heading that direction and instead of letting someone else lead the charge, I took care of it. The information for the articles for the two officers and the shooter have all been merged into one. Let me know if anyone has any other problems with this new article. --<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaysleeper47_cafe.html" title="User:Daysleeper47">Daysleeper47</a> 14:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The only one making things up in their head is apparently you. First, "I did not say that I found the opinions expressed "offensive."...I never said you did say that, I said <b>I</b> found the suggestion that he is not notable enough offensive. Second, "Further, at no time did I suggest in any way that any editor was not free to express an opinion on this or any other nomination." My comment about this being a forum to express opinions was in response to your staement "I really wish people would stop acting like suggesting that this guy isn't notable enough for an article is a personal affront to them. " Your staement clearly shows a frustration at my opinion, the opinion of others, and expresses your feeling that we are too personally involved. I am free to express my opinion no matter if I take it as a "personal afront" or not and, i'll repeat, too bad if you dont like it. Thirdly, If you are going to suggest that a person killed while serving the community and protecting others is not notable enough to have an article here you should expect strong, heartfelt, opinions especially from the law enforcement community, firefighters etc.<a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEMT1871_3b56.html" title="User:EMT1871">EMT1871</a> 18:47, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh I thought this debate was based on wikipedia policy, and on if a topic was notable. I clearly stated my opinion, and portrayed it as nothing else than my opinion on the notability of the subject. As I said again too bad if you don't like my opinion I certainly didnt ask you to agree with me. I also stated my opinion intelligently and did not resort to the use of profanity and name calling nor personally disparage you. It would also have been nice if when you typed your previous response you had actually read what I wrote first since you feverishly responded to remarks I did not make. Responding to my remarks and opinions with profanity, name calling and personal attacks again will causes me to report you to the administrators.<a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEMT1871_3b56.html" title="User:EMT1871">EMT1871</a> 22:32, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
