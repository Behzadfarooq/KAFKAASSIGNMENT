<li>Leather Colin is a north east legend, although he is thought not to be real and only told to small children, with out as much detail OFCOURSE! He is well known around the area. He is so well known i have heard 'LEATHER' shouted by teenagers at numerous people whilsts wearing anything from a large leather jacket to a pair of leather gloves, and i remember doing it myself one day i must admit.</li>

<li>I also do recall being told of the leather colin story. Although some pictures may not truely posess the real story, it is a urban myth which deserves a place on this website. My grandmother was first told this story in 1938 and recalls the moment she thought she saw him as a child. Someone looked in the house early in the morning at her bedroom. There was an article featuring pictures was also posted in the local free paper - "News of Sunderland" in 1945 which ended after losses of money. Leather Colin, or Colin of the leather, is a great myth which keeps children of all ages in line and with a little fear at bedtime. And I believe that there is to be a FLASH movie produced to show real events and reports about it soon. Hope this helps.</li>
