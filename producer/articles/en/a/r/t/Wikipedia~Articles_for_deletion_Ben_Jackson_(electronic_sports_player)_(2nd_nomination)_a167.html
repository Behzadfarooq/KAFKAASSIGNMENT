<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Notable subject clearly passes WP:BIO having been cited by multiple non-trivial independent sources. He is also the top ranked player in a notable genre of gaming, Halo 2. 151.204.193.104 22:50, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I ran across this at the DRV, and I think it was handled correctly the first time around. If someone wanted to merge a couple of sentences into <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Gaming_b3d2.html" title="Major League Gaming">Major League Gaming</a> by creating a section on notable participants and convert this page into a redirect, I'd be OK with that, as long as any added material could be sourced properly. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 05:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I'm only seeing one independent reliable source. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 05:28, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> As weak as humanly possible. I think we have too much of these non-notable gamers because of systemic bias. Namely that things of interest to techy young men are going to be more notable to Wikipedians, who largely are techy young men, then they will to anyone else on the planet. Still he didn't seem to be any less notable than several other such who just got keep.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 07:54, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note I can easily switch to weak delete if we start moving against some gamer articles.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 07:55, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Moving against</i> gamer articles? Well, let's hope so, because there are plenty of contributors who haven't yet been upset to learn that a few guys here don't think their area is interesting enough for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:59, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not about interesting, it's about notable. Is every guy or gal who wins some gamer competition notable? Granted we only have 30 people in <a href="../../../e/l/e/Category%7EElectronic_sports_players_67f5.html" title="Category:Electronic sports players">Category:Electronic sports players</a>, but that's still more than <a href="../../../s/p/e/Category%7ESpellers_7fdd.html" title="Category:Spellers">Category:Spellers</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_pool_players_0af4.html" title="Category:American pool players">Category:American pool players</a> combined.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Keep</b> per deletion review. It's a serious problem that deletionists insist that sources be the equivalent of the mainstream media. This creates systemic bias. They surely need only be reliable in the correct context? BTW, ColourBurst, if you read this, you severely misunderstand <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. A person who cares about manga doesn't consequently own the articles about it. I can edit them mercilessly. But applying my own lack of caring to consideration of them is wrong. Do you see the difference I am suggesting? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:59, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was pondering this position myself for a while. Often times we delete notable topics within a particular field because no sources in that field are considered reliable. However, when I look at this subject from the eyes of a gamer, I don't see much importance. If I had to choose between having a bunch of crap articles about "professional" MLG gamers and having no articles about gamers at all, I would choose the latter. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 08:06, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Earlier I said that this should be overturned and undeleted, but in retrospect, I don't think that was the best option. Most of the claims of notability within these types of articles are extremely weak. "John Doe is a professional gamer working for <a href="../../../m/l/g/MLG_c3f2.html" title="MLG">MLG</a>. He won some Halo tournaments." This doesn't mean much at all. MLG is not a respected and/or important organization in the world of gaming. Are any of the gamers within the league important? Not really. The sources do seem to be fairly trivial in this case. Will anyone care about this person in 10 years? or 100 years? Not a chance. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 08:00, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
