<p><b><i>Very</i> not notable.</b> Let me remind you that "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other." There <i>are</i> no such sources -- Google News turns up only one hit for "David DeAngelo," and the reference is a single sentence long in a sex column. The article fails <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> for just this reason -- and <i>oh</i> how it fails <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. Look at the references that we <i>do</i> have after the past two years: (1) is total spam; (2) only says how large the dude's e-mail list is, and is not reliable nor independent of the subject; (3)-(4) are non-notable blogs, (5)-(8) are primary sources, authored by DeAngelo himself, (9) is an unreliable anonymous person who cannot spell his own name "Dmitri" right, and (10) is more total spam. We don't have sources because they don't exist -- and their nonexistence is a fact regardless of how many hits you get on Google with his name (102,000 as of this post, and a quick scan of the first 100 hits shows nothing useful for encyclopedic use.) -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 00:00, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>A disclosure is requested on your part. Assuming it's true that you are an anti-abortionist, do you truly believe that your anti-abortionist beliefs do not cause you to exhibit bias against the seduction community and against the subject of this article? I form this connection because successful seduction training results in increased sex which results in increased pregnancies which results in increased abortions. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Amit</a> 20:23, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your assumption is rather blatantly incorrect. I'm vigorously pro-choice within the first two trimesters of pregnancy, when 99% of abortions happen. Even if I weren't, you're trying to draw a very weak link -- from "anti-abortion" to "anti-sexual" to "anti-seduction," which makes very little sense on balance. My argument is simple: we can't do a biographical article on DeAngelo, because there aren't any biographies of him. We can't do a scientific article on DeAngelo's work, because he hasn't published his work scientifically. We can't do an analysis of DeAngelo's popular impact, because only one single book has been written containing any information on that (The Game); and this book discusses only one seminar and makes passing reference to an e-mail list. What remains? An article documenting DeAngelo's personal beliefs, citing his e-books and websites as sources. I don't think that merits an encyclopedia article. -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 00:30, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am aware of the references that The Game makes -- I own the book. And none of them are good enough to deal with either a biography of DeAngelo, nor an analysis of popular impact. The two references in The Mystery Method -- well, did you even <i>read</i> the two references? They won't help either. Again, let me ask -- do you intend this as a biographical article, a scientific article, a popular-impact article, or an article on what DeAngelo happens to personally believe? If it's doomed to be the last of these, do you really think that's encyclopedic? -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 02:15, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:I'm afraid I agree with Amit, your views exhibit bias. Neither have you explained how it violates said policies, nor given any specific reasons for deletion. Meaning, your sentence <i>violates daa-da-da</i> could be copy-pasted to 20 other AfDs without adding anything useful to the discussion. In addition to all of this, you ask <i>who needs this crap anyway</i> - i'd like answer - the people for whom we are writing this encyclopedia. An article on <a href="../../../b/7/_/B7_%28protein%29.html" title="B7 (protein)">B7 (protein)</a> is useless to a teenager surfing for porn, but is definitely useful to a high school student looking up proteins for bio class.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The book reads like fiction, is a primary source (not a secondary source), and was authored by someone who has a personal stake in the seduction community. We have no guarantee that the publisher tried to hold him to factual accuracy and verifiability; indeed, the (now-defunct) publishing imprint made a point of specializing in controversial materials. <i>The Game</i> is not a reliable secondary source -- not in the way that a New York Times article is. And Neil Strauss' New York Times article makes no mention of DeAngelo -- so we're supposed to believe that this guy is notable in the community? -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 02:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But again, I'd respond that they're not relevant enough to make the man notable. The first falls into a problem with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability." The single sentence describing DeAngelo is not that sort of in-depth thing. And the other two are editorials -- one is a story about some romance novel that a woman is writing; the other is a guy talking about how interested he was in something DeAngelo wrote. Think about what we're looking for in a biography; what we're looking for from a notable source. What's DeAngelo's birthdate? His hometown? How do we know that his name is "Eben Pagan"? What's his pickup-success rate? What's the national average? How did he grow up? What has he contributed to the world? Remember, encyclopedias aren't designed to cover <i>every</i> guy out there on the internet with a website. Right now, this article is basically a detailed (but poorly sourced) article on his teachings in the field of dating. Nobody can say whether those teachings are useful, because no independent meticulous research has been done on that. All we know, is that there is some dude, who believes some things, has a website, and occasionally does private seminars that don't make it into the news. If he could back up his assertions, then maybe he'd be a great psychologist or sociologist. But right now, he's nothing of the sort -- and we don't have the sorts of news articles saying, "sociologist David DeAngelo revealed decisive proof today that attraction is caused by such-and-such." There is a certain character to notability. DeAngelo does not have that character. -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 04:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I assert he is more than "some dude". Like I said before, seduction is not a topic most researchers delve into, for obvious reasons.

<li>Thanks for an apparently genuine reply. Note, however, that in the strict sense, notability must be demonstrated in the same manner that you have insisted must hold for this article. Therefore, as popular as the Daily Sun may be, and as important as the Theory Center may be, if they both don't have third-party external sources listed, they are a candidate for deletion. Are you getting the analogy? Yes, of course you are. But then why are you mentioning asking undergrads - isn't that similar to asking members of the seduction community about who the gurus are? Do you see the hypocrisy? Also, note that there are a dozen other unsourced Cornell articles that can be deleted. Do you still insist upon your extreme strictness? - Perhaps I should just AFD Daily Sun and Theory Center to see how that goes. Whatever your answer, I have a plan.</li>

<li>Oh, I'm not saying that "The Cornell undergraduates know about the Sun, therefore it is notable." Rather, I'm saying that "The Cornell undergrads know that the other three newspapers are not notable, therefore they are clearly notable. As for the Sun's notability, I'm fairly sure that the Sun has won awards for journalistic excellence, and the like. They'd probably be happy to furnish you with such references; it's one of the oldest college papers in the world.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>From my perspective, it's not just that DeAngelo is (imho, rather clearly) non-notable. It's that the last time this was up for deletion, people promised notability, they promised nice, third-party references, and there wasn't consensus either way -- the votes for "keep" and "delete" split the vote pattern. I feel like the end result was a sort of contingent keep -- "We'll keep this article around, but only so long as you make good on your promise to demonstrate notability and get this thing sourced." Several years later, it still hasn't happened.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Points:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>You say: <i>The Cornell undergrads know that the other three newspapers are not notable, therefore they are clearly notable.</i> You therefore assert NOT(A)=A.</li>
<li>I'm sure The Daily Sun is a fine newspaper, but it's the responsibility of the editors of its WP article's editors to include acceptable third-party references, without which an AfD is probably not unjustified.</li>
<li>You said: <i>let's not pretend this is an "underground restricted-access seduction community"</i>. Oh but a good part of it is. This part, in fact, is very large and popular once you get access to it. My point is that David DeAngelo is notable there.</li>
<li>You said a lot about how he is not very academic. In research there is a balance between how extensive your results are and how significant they are. I've had university professors talk about their research at length with the research often not being "rigorously statistically significant with very high confidence". The truth is that I don't mind that at all, and most would agree with me there. It's not your call to say that only rigorous publications have value. This ain't physics. From what I've often seen, sociologists performing rigorous research often tend to prove rather trivial things, like the chances of sex for women after alcohol consumption are higher than normal, or that yes women are proven to have longer relationships with men who are financially stable and not entirely broke - all that was very useful - bleh. From an academic perspective, the preliminary work done by David DeAngelo actually gives academic researchers something more influential to work on. Also something you should know that is that only a part of his materials are original - most are borrowed and well sourced.</li>

<li>I apologize about that; I appear to have misspoke. I meant "The Cornell undergraduates know that it is not notable, therefore it is <b>not</b> notable." That is, Cornell undergraduates may not be able to testify to a Cornell article's notability; but they <i>can</i> testify to its <i>non-</i>notability. Do you see my point?</li>
<li>Most articles on Wikipedia fail <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. (The ones that don't get promoted to FA.) Failing WP:CITE is <i>only</i> grounds for deletion if it's impossible to find enough sources to build a good encyclopedia article. And as far as I can tell, in this case, that's true.</li>
<li>In the sense that I'm using it, "notable" is not reflexive to a community. Quoting from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, the relevant Wikipedia policy, "Notability is not subjective... The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy." So even if a community believes a person is <i>noteworthy</i> (which is what I believe you're claiming), this does not mean that the person is <i>notable</i>.</li>
<li>You're right. It's not either of our call. Rather, it's Wikipedia's call -- and Wikipedia has made that call, in my favor. Wikipedia doesn't adhere to <i>truth</i> -- they adhere to <i>verifiability</i>; see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for details. You're trying to say that you don't care whether DeAngelo's work is rigorous -- <i>but Wikipedia does</i>. It doesn't matter whether DeAngelo is right or not; and I never speculated either way on that. But either way, this article must pass <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>: "Wikipedia articles must be based on reliable sources. Reliable sources are <b>credible published materials with a reliable publication process</b>; their authors are generally regarded as trustworthy, or are authoritative in relation to the subject at hand... The most reliable sources are <b>books and journals published by universities; mainstream newspapers; and magazines and journals that are published by known publishing houses</b>. What these have in common is <b>process and approval between document creation and publication</b>. As a rule of thumb, <b>the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication.</b> Material that is self-published is <b>generally not regarded as reliable</b>, but see below for exceptions." (Emphases mine. The "exceptions" mentioned will do you no good, because DeAngelo's writings don't pass those tests -- and they'd have to make up a majority of the article anyways, which is not allowed by the "exceptions" clause.)</li>

<dd>(edit conflict) Having a gf or not is not an indicator of if the article should be kept. Personally I <i>do</i> have a gf, a totally awesome one to at that. However not everybody chooses to have one, there are certainly advantages to being single over having a gf and for a while before her I was of the view those advantages outweighed the negatives. Alternatively yet another view point is that <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Amit</a> might have more than one, and plans to add another to his harem!

<dd>(ding, carriage return) <i>3.</i> Regarding notability, if a subset of the world shows that a subject is notable then that subject is notable. Because in the end, it is impossible for the entire world to have found a subject to be notable and thus we are always dealing with a subset of the world. Also additionally you claim that <i>noteworthy</i> and <i>notable</i> are not the same thing. To which I'll refer you to the opening sentence of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> which you yourself referred to: <i><b>Notable</b> is defined as "worthy of being noted"</i>. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 05:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's simply not how notability works. I am a prophet to a group of about half a dozen people. They consider me noteworthy. But I don't think that warrants a Wikipedia article. The opening sentence you quote is only eight days old as of right now; and may still require some revision -- but the rest of the article is crystal clear: Notability requires multiple reliable secondary sources. As I've been saying all this time, notability is really just an extension way to enforce Notability is a <i>guideline</i> to enforce the <i>core policy</i> of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>. WP:A says that it doesn't matter whether material is true or not; what matters is whether it's attributable to a reliable published source.

When Cambridge publishes <i>The Cambridge Companion to Seduction</i> to go with their <i>Companion to Atheism</i> and <i>Companion to Wittgenstein</i>, well, <i>then</i> we can start covering DeAngelo's speculations on Wikipedia.

So when a subset of the world has found a person to be notable then obviously they <i>are</i> notable. Because we are always dealing with subsets of the world anyway. So if your half dozen people had made you notable (according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>) then yes you would be <i>notable</i>.

<li>I'm saying that the criterion for notability is simply "there are good secondary sources," not "these people think that the person is notable." That's why I'm distinguishing the term "noteworthy" -- as in literally, "worthy of notice," -- from "notable", which has a precise Wikipedia meaning. As I (mis-)typed in my last comment, notability is a guideline meant to ask the question, "Can <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> be fulfilled?" -- and that's exactly what the question, "Is this notable?" means. And I still don't think we can write an article fulfilling <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. I really think that the few references so far found don't back up much, factually speaking. For example, I never got an answer to my question, "How do we know his real name is Eben Pagan?" The most that <i>The Game</i> will tell me is that the dude was a real-estate agent who teaches dating seminars that tell dudes to be "cocky funny." The American Chronicle expands this to "some dating-advice sites believe his writings will make you feel more confident."

<li>I spent long enough to realize that this article could only be a good citation for the fact "Some people believe that DeAngelo's work makes you feel more confident" -- since that's the only mention that DeAngelo's work gets. And yes, this article <i>is</i> from the blog-ish site AskDanAndJennifer.com; as proof, you can find the original article <a href="http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/dating-tips/is-shyness-keeping-you-from-the-girl-of-your-dreams/" class="external text" title="http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/dating-tips/is-shyness-keeping-you-from-the-girl-of-your-dreams/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Since it was an outsource to a third party blog, much like the comics or Dear Abby-ish columns in your normal paper, the American Chronicle likely did not do a thorough editorial review of their work. (And how do we know that the American Chronicle has this board of editors? It appears to be a web news service.) -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 18:28, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's a shame how biased the views of people like you are, given the fact that such people usually know little if anything about depth of the content to talk with such confidence.

<li>And its very interesting that you make comments like that when you know absolutely nothing of my views on the topic, or my knowledge of this man. I have read many articles on the "seduction community" and DeAngelo and I consider the man an idiot. However, this has nothing to do with my decision to vote delete, I have stated my reasons above. As much as Im sure you feel that everyone who has a differing viewpoint to you is either wrong or an idiot, the nice thing about WP is that we can all air our own opinions, hopefully without some little child crying because they dont match his.

<li><b>Keep</b> The only problem here is that the subject of sex/seduction is highly controversial and a spam/promo target. The article needs to be rewritten in NPV. STILL, this guy and his company are extremely influential. A search on Google for "Double Your Dating" returns close to HALF A MILLION hits. Notable enough for a WP entry. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 21:08, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: You seem to not understand what notability is. "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other." Do you see any criteria in that statement for "extremely influential"...? For "a search on Google"...? No, and for good reason. There are no secondary sources, and no good article fulfilling <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> could possibly be written about this man. The dude is non-notable, and that's a fact. -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 04:23, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Whiny comments like those by Drostie above illustrate the problem perfectly. Once a subject receives more than HALF A MILLION entries in the Google search engine, a WP article might become useful to a substantial number of readers because "Double Your Dating" qualifies as an Internet meme of its own. And yet some people engage in a systematic campaign to remove the subject just because it is controversial or personally distasteful to them. They would do better to help improve the article than trying to engage in selective censorship. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 19:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As per the above discussion, notability is not reflexive to a community. Though the community may be notable, not all noteworthy people in a notable community are notable. The real question is, are there reliable, independent secondary sources such that <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> could be fulfilled? If not, then the article cannot be reasonably written. -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 04:23, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What above "discussion"? I only see one comment by yourself. Plus I believe you probably incorrectly read what <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasuke_Sarutobi_1266.html" title="User:Sasuke Sarutobi">Sasuke Sarutobi</a> was stating. In my view it is that he said David DeAngelo is notable, and that <i>also</i> he is part of notable community. Or in other words he said he is notable, and then made an additional statement afterwards. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 05:42, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, and that comment was part of a discussion. In any case, DeAngelo's notability is precisely what's in question here. It doesn't help any of this to have people just saying "He is notable." Remember, AfD isn't a vote; and "notability" isn't based on the opinions of Wikipedia users. There have been no biographies of DeAngelo, nor a large academic (sociological) discussion in the peer-reviewed literature about his theories. He hasn't won any prominent sociology prizes. Without stuff like these, how are we supposed to write a good biographical encyclopedia article? -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 18:20, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't question that DeAngelo is notable within the seduction community; he clearly is. That's not the question here, though. The questions are whether he's notable enough for his own article, and whether there is enough material extant to write a biographical article which can pass <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. After digging through all the links, I'm willing to grant the former, sort of. The Orlando Sentinel article, along with a couple other passing references, is enough to establish that he's been regarded as an expert on seduction outside the seduction community. His case for notability is not as rock-solid as all the other persons on the list of "Notable members of the seduction community," all of whom have been the subject of reliable articles, but hey, some articles are harder to source than others. If the only question was one of notability, I'd change my vote. It's the latter question that I'm stuck on. Is David DeAngelo <i>really</i> a pseudonym? I'm quite sure it is. But where's the published biography? Is Eben Pagan his real name? Does he actually have a doctorate? What's it in? According to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, we could not even assert that David DeAngelo is a pseudonym unless we had a reliable source. What needs to be remembered here is that the article in question is <b>biographical</b>, which means there are policies which <i>must</i> be followed. <a href="../../../o/b/t/User%7EObtuseAngle_4728.html" title="User:ObtuseAngle">ObtuseAngle</a> 23:32, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> His contribution to the seduction community is of wide note, his seminars teaching <i>cocky comedy</i> and <i>body language</i> are popular.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'd also like to point out that within the seduction community, DD Style Mystery Juggler Ross, all of them are definitely notable. Now outside of that, DYD has columns on at least a dozen websites, like AskMen.com, Mystery has appeared in the newspapers half a dozen times, Style is a fixture on the celebrity circuits, for example the rumours involving his girlfriend Lisa and Robbie Williams were hyped out of proportion. There are just a few examples, many more exist. Deletion of DD's article signals that the community doesn't deserve space on WP, which is not the message we want to send out.
