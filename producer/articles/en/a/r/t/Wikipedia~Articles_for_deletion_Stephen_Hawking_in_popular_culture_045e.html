<dd><b>Comment</b> The existence of other similar articles is completely irrelevant to whether or not this article should be kept; the issue is whether or not <i>this</i> article meets the requirements of Wikipedia policy. Indeed, the articles you mentioned probably <i>should</i> also be deleted and I may nominate them in the next day or two (several 'in popular culture' articles were nominated for deletion yesterday and the consensus in all those AfD's appears to support deletion. Popular culture articles are inherently POV and suffer tremendous original research problems; what defines 'popular culture?' This concept of 'popular culture' is US/Western oriented and, as such, POV. This is inappropriate for an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 09:51, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as sadly there is no current consensus (that I know of) regarding "X in popular culture" sections of articles on wikipedia, so my guess was this was a split-off article primarily intended to reduce article clutter. To that extent, I'd say it was an admirable split-off decision as most of the information is trivial to a primary subject, but of possible interest to the topic of how this scientist has been presented outside of his scientific field. Obviously no one is going to argue that Hawking himself isn't notable, the question is the relative notability of the details of how his celebrity personality (as opposed to his scientific contributions) has been presented. <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity.html" title="Celebrity">Celebrity</a> is still a valid topic in it's own right, and I'd rather see this information in a sub-article than the main until or unless wikipedia decides that influence on pop culture is not encyclopedic. I agree <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Stevens_c046.html" title="User:Philip Stevens">Philip Stevens</a>' argument per <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> is superficially specious, but in this case I'd say there's some validity to examples of the overall trend which this article represents. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:36, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand your reluctance to&#160;!vote to delete absent your seeing a consensus, but I would submit to you that&#160;!voting to delete these articles, if you don't think they should exist, is how consensus is formed. As noted, a number of "...in popular culture" articles have been nominated over the last couple of days and in each case sentiment is running toward deletion and in a number of cases the articles have been deleted. See for example the AFDs for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_References_to_Calvin_and_Hobbes_d237.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/References to Calvin and Hobbes">References to Calvin and Hobbes</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_appearances_of_C96_in_popular_culture_d90e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of appearances of C96 in popular culture">List of appearances of C96 in popular culture</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rush_in_popular_culture_2_7fae.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rush in popular culture 2">Rush in popular culture</a>. I am comfortable in asserting that consensus to delete this sort of article <i>does</i> exist. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> I understand that some "in popular culture" articles have (quite correctly) been deleted, but I would suggest that your examples do not represent a consensus to delete all "in popular culture" articles but instead were case-by-case deletions of those specific articles. C96 or Rush certainly can't be compared to Stephen Hawking in a discussion of culturally pervasive individuals (in my opinion) so to my mind deletion of those articles (which I admit I did not read pre-deletion) wouldn't necessarily be representative of a larger consensus to delete by wikipedia editors.</dd>

<dd>Granting that some individuals have sociologically significant impacts based on a public persona larger than their personal accomplishments, and granting that some detail of how and when that state is expressed is of encyclopedic value, I went with a Keep vote based not only on the lack of consensus on the larger issue, but with an assumed acceptance that THIS individual is a clear exemplar of a significant pop cultural icon. In other words, lacking an existing consensus against <i>all</i> "in popular culture" articles occurs, Stephen Hawking is most definitely NOT a place to start building such a consensus. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 14:28, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that of the other articles Otto4711 refers to the AFDs of, this is by far the best article. But that's primarily because of a couple of useful bits and pieces scattered throughout the article, that show both Hawking's attitude to popular media and other people's attitude to him. I think this could (and should) be usefully condensed to a few paragraphs in the main article, which is why I feel deletion is appropriate). But for this article, it isn't as clear cut as for the others. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 14:31, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I would say that Rush is at least comparable to Hawking for purposes of this sort of pop culture article. There are other AFDs open which are also comparable, including <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cultural_depictions_of_Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._946e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cultural depictions of Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis Jr</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Who_in_popular_culture_1c82.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Who in popular culture">The Who</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aerosmith_in_popular_culture_d4ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aerosmith in popular culture">Aerosmith</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aleister_Crowley_in_popular_culture_e7af.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aleister Crowley in popular culture">Aleister Crowley</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cultural_depictions_of_Elvis_Presley_0d5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cultural depictions of Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. The only one that's running close to being kept is Crowley. I would definitely say that Elvis has had a far greater impact on poular culture than Hawking and his pop culture article looks to be on the way out. I'm not saying there is no place for "...in popular culture" -style articles. There are some that are well done including one for Joan of Arc and one for of all things the Superman logo. But these sorts of data dump articles where editors play games of I spy for everything that might possibly be in some way connected to or inspired by a person, place or thing are worthless. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:16, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

There is a precedent for splitting off sections into subarticles that go into detail on various aspects of a topic. Pop culture is always something (not me, so much but) lots of people are interested in. These subarticles are a good way to manage this sort of information. I suggest looking at <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Joan_of_Arc_d22a.html" title="Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc">Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc</a> as an example of how this type of article can be done well. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 23:03, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
