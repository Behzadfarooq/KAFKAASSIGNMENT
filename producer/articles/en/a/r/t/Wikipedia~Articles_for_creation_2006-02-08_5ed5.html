<p>Luis Fernando Ponce has arranged a set up of objects, on a little “stage”; each in front of what could be a heavy theatre curtain. These objects can primarily be identified as things, which externalise and exemplify the American society. In the majority of the images, the objects are portrayed alone or sometimes limited to a couple, so one in clear view can take a good look and identify each object. The light exenterates each of them, reminiscent of how stage lighting directs the eye for attracting attention. Making them stand out to tell a story as in monologs and small dialogs, and only by bringing all of these images together do a fully coherent story become apparent. These things carry references to the impression made on the mind and emotion elicited in the observer.</p>
<p>To portray objects could seemingly appear like a simple act, but to the genre of still life there is always a variety and complicated topics connected to it. And it is within this longstanding tradition Luis Fernando Ponce follows. These objects, in the photographs, of simple recognisable forms, strike a key by their portrayal of formal still life. Why do these objects meet on the classical scene? A single point is made accessible in a plausible ‘universal’ language. In this photographical series the objects are in the centre of the picture plane, and are the centre of Ponce’s pictures universe. In the western view the man function as the measures of all things. The meanings of the world are dependent on our own understanding and vintage point. The Coca Cola bottle, as seen in one of the images, does in itself not solely earn its meanings out of its own evolutionary history, but becomes first meaningful in terms of the anthropocentric metaphors we assign to it.</p>
<p>All photographs describes in the sense that they offer descriptive, visual information, with greater or lesser detail and clarity. These photographs go far beyond the interest of portraying objects as mere visual facts. They are objectified icons to exemplify two historically distinctly different societies. The images draw upon objects, which hold inter-woven symbolism and influences from the American society over the Guatemalan society. They shift between the literal and the allegorical, exploring the projection of one culture over another. Luis Fernando Ponce’s images resonate with sentiment: one cultures slipping away and the evident superseding of another, and sometimes even unwillingly witnessing the embracing ‘implementation of today’s world order culture’. Luis Fernando makes statements about the influence of this dominant culture over another. He faces the viewer straight on in his desire to ask them to be conscientious in the adaptation of elements of another culture into their own lives. The images are direct social commentary on ‘the great game’ of exploitation and new colonialism.</p>
<p>The work of Luis Fernando Ponce falls in the category of interpretative photography. The objects are depicted to hold and attempt scientific accuracy. The images of the Coca Cola bottle, gun, radio, plane etc. are bearers of cultural mythologies. In their staged way they carries personal and subjective interpretations. Although they present an apparent clear directorial mode, many of these images play with ambiguity, and are open to a variety of readings. Interpretative photographs need of course to be interpreted, and places the interpretative responsibility on the viewer. The construction of meaning may shift. It shifts naturally according to the audience, by each spectator, and their cultural making. That’s what makes for an interesting spectacle.</p>

<p>The Battle of Stable Hill takes place near the end of the book <i>The Last Battle</i>. King Tirinian, the Last King of Narnia, along with Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole (two human children from earth) and a few loyal Narnians fight literally to the death against the Calormenes, who have come to Narnia to rule it. This battle takes place after Tirinian learns that the Calormenes have already won most of the Narnians over to their side by setting up a "false Aslan" and having an ape tell them the will of this Aslan, and have taken over Cair Paravel by sea.</p>
<p>In the confusion of the battle, the Dwarfs who are fighting for themselves as a third party kill anyone they can hit with their arrows (often killing the hope of Tirinian and his small army). After a hasty charge at the Calormenes from the top of the hill, the faithful Narnians exhaust themselves and go back to a designated spot behind a white stone to rest. They have just enough time to catch their breath before the Calormenes charge up to the rock to fight them. The rest of the battle is a blur, but it ends will all the loyal Narnians finding themselves in Aslan's country (often considered a parallel to Heaven).</p>

<p><b>Structural moving</b> is moving a <a href="../../../b/u/i/Building.html" title="Building">building</a> off its <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation.html" title="Foundation">foundation</a> by some means of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transportation.html" title="Transportation">transportation</a>, such as a large <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">truck</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat.html" title="Boat">boat</a>. This is most commonly done with small, compact <a href="../../../h/o/u/House.html" title="House">houses</a>, such as trailer homes. According to the <a href="http://www.iasm.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.iasm.org/" rel="nofollow">International Association of Structural Movers</a>, buildings such as <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barge.html" title="Barge">barges</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship.html" title="Ship">ships</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lighthouse.html" title="Lighthouse">lighthouses</a>, movie <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater.html" title="Theater">theaters</a>, grain elevators, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">libraries</a>, etc, have all been moved in the past.</p>
<p>Structural moving is a difficult and expensive job. The building being moved is typically lifted straight off its <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation.html" title="Foundation">foundation</a> and then transported to a new, prebuilt <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation.html" title="Foundation">foundation</a> at another location. They can be transported mainly by <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semi-trailer.html" title="Semi-trailer">semi-trailer</a> or specialized <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat.html" title="Boat">boats</a>.</p>
<p>Structural moving may be performed for any number of reasons, but it can be that the building:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must be moved, because it is a historical structure</li>
<li>Must be moved, because it is in the way of development</li>
<li>Is in danger of a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_disaster.html" title="Natural disaster">natural disaster</a></li>

<p>An abandoned mansion and surrouning orange grove in the foothills of southern california. Designed and built by Edward Rustwhick, a rich texas oil baron for his wife Elizabeth; the mansion and surrounding orange groves were home to many curious oddities including hidden passageways, dissapering walls and winding corridors that forced guests to walk nearly 20 feet to move only 8. The Rustwhicks had only one child, a daughter, and rarely left the house due to her rare medical condition which made her extremely unconfortable when exposed to sunlight. Many of the workers on the orange grove remembered the daughter playing at night, running through the trees laughing; this was the only time she was allowed to be a child. Tragedy hit the Rustwhick family in 1912 when an earthquake hit the grounds engulfing half the house in debris. Even worse, Molly, the Rustwhicks daughter wasn't to be found. Presumed dead after an extensive search, the Rustwhicks dedicated a monument in the grove where she played. The Rustwhicks tried and failed to have more children until Elizabeth contracted tuberculosis and passed away. Edward, deep in dispair, emediately fired all of his workers and closed the grove, only to be visited twice a month by his niece Diane Costello. Years passed and the orange groves became overgrown and utterly unmanageable. 1934 On one of her visits, Diane found her uncle lying in his bead, dead, clutching a diary, one that none knew he kept. As the soul heir to the Rustwhick Estate, Diane renovated the house, Blocking off the earthquake ruined domicile and restarting from the ground up. Work was halted when construction workers reported hearing the laughter of a little girl coming from groves. Diane fired the workers and rehired. Again work halted, this time due to the workers seeing the image of a woman in a white dress whenever construction moved to the former room of Mrs. Rustwhick. Diane had had enough, she gave up renovation and resorted to living among the rubble, alone. When she passed away in 1989 the house and surrounding property was passed through a few family members until seized by her great nephew as a business oprotunity. Her nephew, an avid entrepernuer, saw the pure marketability of the "haunted house" and has since renovated it to the point of tourability.</p>
<p>Sept 1995, a crew of 7 construction workers disapered in the renovation of the House. Construction Resumed after an unsucsessful manhunt.</p>
<p>February 1999, The bodies of 3 of the construction workers were found in the collapsed catacombs/wineceller of the mansion.</p>
<p>June 2003, After near completion, a portion of Rustwhick Manor was deemed untourable due to dangers out of control of the owners. Contractors were hired to resolve the problem promptly. They couldn't. This portion of the tour had to be blocked off, resulting in a new "replica" area of the removed section to be built.</p>
<p>Jaunary 2006, Final renovation has been completed and Rustwhick Manor will open to visitors this October, curious visitors can visit the website www.rustwhickmanor.com for more information.</p>

<p>STAN is State College of Accountancy under the Ministry of Finance of The Republic of Indonesia. It was founded in 1950's by Gandhi (an official of the Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia) to supply the need of accountants and employee with adequate government financial ability. The name was STIKN (Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Keuangan Negara/State College of Government Financial management). It was located in Jl. Purnawarman, South Jakarta Indonesia. In 1960's the name was changed to IIK (Institut Ilmu Keuangan / Institute of Government Financial Management). The Institute provided some majors in Accountancy, Budget and Treasury, Taxation, Custom and Excise. The graduates of IIK entitled Drs. (Doktorandus - a Dutch academic title)like/equal to graduates of Universities ran by Ministry of National Education.</p>
<p>In 1979 the name was changed one more time: STAN (Sekolah Tinggi Akuntansi Negara/State college of Accountancy) and relocated to Jurang mangu Timur Village (Suburb of Tangerang Regency). The college offers majors of accountancy, Taxation, Custom and Excise, State Claim and Auction, Budget and Treasury. As it is under the Ministry of Finance, almost all of its graduates are employed by the Ministry of Finance. Some are taken by Supreme Audit Board of Republic of Indonesia (BPK RI) and State finance and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP RI).</p>

<p>RSA SecurID (r) is an authentication system that uses respective software on one side and the authenticator on another side. Authenticator is a small (car alarm size) electronic device with an in-built RSA codes generator. Each device has its own unique code generating algorithm that is identified by the serial number of the device engraved on the reverse side of it. Generated codes are device-dependent (due to the above mentioned in-built algorithm), random, being displayed on an LCD screen and they change periodically. This device along with relevant software, which validates the codes to see if they are correct and derive from a designated authenticator, is considered to be rather strong yet convenient mechanism of authorization and access control.</p>

<p>Matrixism or The Path of the One is an internet-based new religious movement (NRM) inspired by the motion picture trilogy "The Matrix". Conceived by an annonymous group in the summer of 2004 it has grown to attract a following of over nine-hundred people to date.</p>
<p>Matrixism is a syncretic or ecumenical religion. It uses references to "the matrix" from an obscure text of the Baha'i religion, called "The Promulgation of Universal Peace", to make a connection with broader world religious history.</p>
<p>Matrixism carries with it four main beliefs that are described as "The Four Tenets of Matrixism". Briefly these are; belief in a messianic prophecy, use of psychedelic drugs as sacrament, reality is multi-layered and semi-subjective and followers must adhere to the principles of at least one of the world's major religions. The sacred texts of Matrixism are the motion picture trilogy "The Matrix". The adopted symbol for Matrixism is the Kanji symbol for "red".</p>
<p>One of the two holy days observed by Matrixists is the anniversary of the deaths of Aldous Huxley, John F. Kennedy and C.S. Lewis. All three of these famous persons passed away on the 22nd of November 1963. Religious laws specific to Matrixism include the abrogation of the use of the human image in advertising and the abrogation of professional sports.</p>

<p>Katie is a thirteen-year-old girl, whose parents are divorced. Her mother and David, Katie’s mother’s boyfriend, are workaholics, so Katie hasn’t got anyone to talk to. Katie likes swimming a lot and she spends most of her free time on training for competitions. If she is at home she connects her computer to the internet and visits chat rooms. She meets someone, whose nickname is “Vallleyguy” and who pretends to be a twenty-three-year-old guy named Mark, and she chats with him a lot. She knows well about the risks of chat rooms and she is sure about she would never give out her real name, her address or her phone number to someone she meets in a chat room. Finally Katie gives Mark her telephone number, because he makes her believe that he hasn’t got a connection to the internet for more than a week. Next night, Mark calls and says he missed her much. Finally Katie agrees to meet Mark in hotel, where she stays for a week for a swim competition. They meet in his room, where he grabs her. Afterwards, there is an investigation and Mark, whose real name is Frank Kufrovich and who is 41 years old, has to go to jail for 18 months, because he grabbed at least three other girls and one boy and pornography has been found on his computer. During the following years, she asks herself various times about why only “Mark” was guilty and she is not. The book ends after Katie has given a speech about the story of her live in front of over 600 pupils.</p>

<p>The firm opened its doors in 1968 with six partners and eight associates, all of whom wanted to build a different kind of law firm. From the outset, we emphasized a single-minded commitment to excellence, an entrepreneurial spirit and a dynamic yet practical approach to achieving superior results for our clients. To compete successfully with larger rivals, we offered young lawyers opportunities for training and advancement through the ranks, giving them responsibility as rapidly as they could handle it, rather than relying on a preconceived schedule. We were 20 lawyers when we moved into our home for 35 years at 919 Third Avenue, and today, we are over 300 lawyers and doing business out of our new state of the art headquarters at 1177 Avenue of the Americas.</p>

<p>Anglo/Australian singer-songwriter Andy Martin was born in Bridgend, South Wales, UK. After re-settling in Melbourne, Australia in 1964 he attended the same school (Yarraman Park State School) as another soon to be famous British immigrant, John Farnham*. The two boys were in different classes and never met. *<a href="http://www.johnfarnham.com.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.johnfarnham.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnfarnham.com.au/</a></p>
<p>Andy had a relative in a well established pop band in Melbourne, "The Bellairs". Peter Braham played bass guitar and was the first live musician Andy had seen. One particular performance at Melbourne Town Hall was to leave a lasting impression on Martin. His father Peter encouraged him to take up the guitar and the father-son relationship was a difficult one at times, as it was obvious that Martin was gifted with words and melodies and held promise as being a composer but was studying the `wrong´ instrument. At the time, the young Andy was already learning the trumpet and had little time for a 2nd instrument. However, encouraged by his father, this was soon discarded in favour of the guitar and the young man commenced writing songs in earnest at the age of 15 years.</p>
<p>Whilst most guitarists spent hours learning and practising scales, Andy threw his attention into the study of lyric and song structure, at the behest of his father who insisted that there were secrets in the former and current top ten hits. A belief not proven until the Hit Factory created by Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman in London dominated the charts during the mid-1980´s. Further indisputable proof was later offered by Polyphonic HMI* who devised a computer program in 2003 to "predict" hits. This program is now in use by all the major record companies. *<a href="http://www.polyphonichmi.com/index.php" class="external free" title="http://www.polyphonichmi.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyphonichmi.com/index.php</a></p>
<p>The family meanwhile returned to the United Kingdom and Martin continued in his writing and after forming an amatuer band (The Pink Panthers) he joined his first professional group, The Rebels. His first visits to Tin Pan Alley in London were mostly non-productive but they served a valuable background for Martin´s later achievements. After spending two years with rock group "Chariot" Andy took the solo path in 1976 and appeared with The Rockin´ Berries, Hot Chocolate and Marmalade, amongst others.</p>
<p>Influenced mainly by The Beatles, Andy became fascinated by the works of Australian producer and songwriter John Farrar and followed his career studiously when Farrar re-located to London to work with former Shadows, Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch.</p>

</ul>
<p>In London, Martin met up with Chas Chandler of `The Animals´ and also Micky Most, a venerated producer of many hits during the 1970´s. Andy also met another legendary songwriter, Tim Rose and later on, became acquainted with Peter Sarstedt*, writer of the huge hit "Where Do You Go To My Lovely". The two became lifelong friends with Peter an influence and confidante´ of Andy, who saw him as being the last of the great solo-singer songwriters, one who had undoubtedly influenced a generation of music lovers in the hip generation. *<a href="http://www.petersarstedt.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.petersarstedt.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petersarstedt.com/</a></p>
<p>Demo´s were made of early tracks by Jonathan Rowlands, a music publisher in London´s Knightsbridge area and top session players like pianist Tommy Ayers were brought in to embellish the recordings. However, Jonathan Rowlands retired from music publishing to concentrate on childrens books and the Captain Beaky* character, before much work could be done with Andy´s tracks. These were acquired by Producers Workshop catalogue and Ralph Seigel in Germany. Further publishing deals were signed with EMI/Chappell and Campbell &amp; Connelly.</p>

<p>In 1980 Andy was booked to appear in South Africa for Cape hotelier Mike Kovensky and during this period met renowned SA pop producer Tully McCully. <a href="http://www.rock.co.za/files/mccully_inc.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rock.co.za/files/mccully_inc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rock.co.za/files/mccully_inc.html</a> This collaboration led to a meeting with Hilton Rosenthal* in 1884 of MINC records in Johannesburg and Andy´s first recording contract. Two singles were released on the MINC label and distributed via EMI South Africa, the second of which reached No.15 in the Springbok charts and earned Martin a SARIE award nomination. Other friendships were formed with notable South African artists, namely `Crocodile´ Harris, Zayne Adams, Bobby Angel and E´void. <a href="http://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(A).html" class="external free" title="http://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(A).html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(A).html</a></p>

<li>Hilton Rosenthal sold the MINC label to EMI and relocated to Los Angeles and formed Rhythm Safari Records after working with Paul Simon, Foreigner, Hans Zimmer and Juluka. <a href="http://www.rhythmsafari.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.rhythmsafari.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rhythmsafari.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Returning to Melbourne, Andy scored 2 further cuts with Australian artists, TC Cassidy (Festival Records) and Denis Walter (Sony/Columbia) See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Walter" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Walter" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Walter</a> He appeared regularly as a guest artist on GTV-9´s popular morning program `In Melbourne Today´ with Ernie Sigley* and Denise Drysdale*. In 1994 he won the Australian World Pater Songwriting Awards with his song "Save The World" and once again returned to London. *<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Sigley" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Sigley" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Sigley</a></p>

<p>Andy Martin now resides in Germany and released his debut CD `Intervals´ independently on February 11th 2005. His first number one was ROCKIN´ ON THE AIRWAVES via the London internet station <a href="http://www.aiiradio.net" class="external free" title="http://www.aiiradio.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.aiiradio.net</a>. A second track WATERFRONT STREET depicting Andy´s formative years in Australia gave him his 2nd number one. The album has since been released via 35 online digital distibutors, the first of which was Apple iTunes. On February 10th 2005, the day before the album´s official release, a 3rd single from the album (STAY - a duet featuring the talented UK vocalist Hollie Bourne) also went to number one, virtually guaranteeing that this album has made some form of musical history in the "independently released" retail sector. <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/andymartin" class="external free" title="http://www.cdbaby.com/andymartin" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdbaby.com/andymartin</a></p>

<p><b>Officer</b>: A surname predominately found in Kincardine Scotland, suggested origins include the following;</p>
<p><b>Officiaris</b> (Latin) clerk at a bishop's court, recorded instances dating back to 1202.</p>
<p><b>Officiar</b> (old Scots) Occupational surname with possible sources including military, ceremonial and Municipal listed on old Scots documents including bailie, macer and schirefs officiar .</p>
<p><b>Oficiar</b> (Spanish) dubious Kincardine legend involving Spanish Armada survivors who supposedly told captors they were an 'officer' to be held for ransom instead of getting killed and later marrying into local families. Probable spelling variation of Officiar.</p>
<p><b>Orfroiser</b> (old French) occupational surname maker of orphrey (gold embroidery).</p>
<p>Some armada vessels led by Duke Juan Gomez de Medina asked for provisions in Anstruther Fife and several vessels were wrecked around Scotland - including El Gran Grifon at Fair Isle, San Juan de Sicilia in Tobermory Bay and a vessel containing majolica pottery off Kinlochbervie.</p>
<p>Spanish word 'Oficiar' means to officiate or to minister.</p>

<p><b>Hate media</b> have been defined as media (usually TV, radio or press, though Internet plays an increasing role) which encourage violent attitudes and activities, tension or hatred between races, ethnic or social groups, or countries. They generally do so for political ends. Conflict is fostered by offering biased, one-sided views (which often build upon prejudice and stereotypes), in order to deceive citizens and to mobilise their support for violent action.</p>
<p>In the words of Journalist Keith Ferrell <a href="http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/online_hate/deconst_online_hate.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/online_hate/deconst_online_hate.cfm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, in their efforts to draw readers' support, most hate sites:</p>
<pre>
1. Capitalize on Paranoia;
2. Suggest Sanction from Above; and 
3. Exploit Fear of Armageddon
</pre>
<p>Acording to Radio Netherlands’ Media Network hate media are a constant danger: hate radio killed more than 800,000 people in the last decade, so its influence should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Among examples are the case of three Rwandan media executives who were found guilty of inciting violence during the genocide of 1994. Two worked for a radio station which broadcast lists of people to be killed and revealed where they could be found. The three were given long jail terms (BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3288267.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3288267.stm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). Indeed, it is claimed that hate radio first appeared in this region.</p>
<p>Europe has nothing to be proud of: the Balkans conflict was preceded by a steady build-up of hate activity by several media.</p>
<p>At a lower key, the COPE radio station in Spain has been widely accused, particularly in Catalonia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and the Basque Country <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> of breeding conflict, through two programmes: "La Mañana" and "La Linterna". The Madrid-based radio station was severely rebuked by the Audiovisual Council of Catalonia in a report dated December 19 2005. <a href="http://www.audiovisualcat.net/actualitat/pr21-12-05.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.audiovisualcat.net/actualitat/pr21-12-05.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>

<p>The 41 salute was invented by the punk/rock band Sum 41. As their popularity grew, they invented a salute that they would request the fans to do instead of the "fucking metal horns, just the 41 salute."</p>
<p>The 41 salute consists of you doing the bird with you left hand and putting your 4 fingers up with your right hand, which spells out 41 to salute the band.[for example see poopyhead43.tripod.com/ id15.htm]</p>

<p><b>Band Members</b>:</p>
<p>Thomas Erak [Vocals/Guitar] / Tim Ward [Bass/Vocals] / Andrew Forsman [Drums]</p>
<p><b>Band Overview</b>:</p>
<p>Melodic, uplifting vocals and harmonies, side-by-side with tortured, assaulting screams. Mathematically precise rhythms and complex fretwork, giving way to loose jam-inspired divergences. Pop-meets-punk-meets-metal-meets-rock in the unlikeliest of places: this is the musical crossroads where you'll find Washington State-based trio The Fall of Troy, skittering off defiantly in one direction after another, refusing to stick to any one established road. If it sounds like it all adds up to chaos, that's because it often does - but only in the same beautiful way as our own everyday experience. Given the chance to work on the new record with top producer Barrett Jones (Foo Fighters, The Melvins, Jawbox), the band jumped, and entered the studio in exactly the right mindset. "We didn't really go in there with a set sound in mind," says Forsman. "We just kind of figured it out on the spot. So the new album became more of a snapshot of us at the time than a posed picture." Which is fitting, considering that no two live experiences with The Fall of Troy are ever the same. Rather than plan out every aspect of their shows, the band leaves things open on stage, allowing for the music and the energy to take over. No one knows exactly when or how a song will change, or when the atmosphere will explode with electricity, until it actually happens. And while a record can't physically change from listen to listen, that sense of spontaneity remains a big part of what makes Doppelganger so powerful.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-08_5ed5.html" title="Edit section: Ramlink">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ramlink</span></h2>
<p>The Ramlink is a battery back ram device with multipurposes used for a Commodore Computer (C-64/C-128). It "MAIN PURPOSE" is to provide viable ram for the machines as an alternative to the common Commodore series ram based units. Not only does it provide an alternative, but even an upgrade as a matter of fact! It's ram card can hold up to 4 SIMM MEMORY CARDS in it allowing up to a maximum of 16 MB of resident RAM. Either 1 MB or 4 MB Cards can be used giving the user a variety of different amount of RAM possibilities (1 MB,2 MB, 4 MB, 6 MB, 8 MB, 12 MB, 16 MB, etc.).</p>
<p>The Ramlink is a marvelous piece of hardware in that it is MUCH MORE THAN JUST A MEMORY DEVICE! It has a built in JIFFY DOS KERNAL that upgrades STOCK MACHINES to be fully upgraded to the JIFFY DOS format, thus, allowing use of the Jiffy Dos Syntax, as well as taking full advantage of the speed that comes along with the Jiffy Dos Chips).</p>
<p>The Ramlink also has an RTC (REAL TIME CLOCK) option that allows it to be used with GEOS/WHEELS, Timeworks applications, and a variety of other software that makes use of the RTC CHIP for timekeeping purposes.</p>
<p>Due to The Ramlink being a "RAM DEVICE," it can also be either "shadowed," partitioned, or emulated as a different drive (1541, 1571, 1581, NATIVE, DACC)respectively. If used as a DACC device, it can be accessed for a partition set aside for DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS (DACC for short) allowing it to be used as the primary device for certain programs that will allow its use for such purposes (GEOS &amp; WHEELS again comes to mind here).</p>
<p>It also has switches on the top of The Ramlink for convience to the user. It has two device swap switches (8 &amp; 9) to swap with another drive for programs that only allow you to use device 8 or 9 to run. It has a system reset switch on it that allows a "WARM" reset of the computers memory contents allowing you to reset your computer now without having to switch it off completely ( a nice little concept). In addition to these features, it also has 2 toggle type switches on the top of the unit; one for switching from JIFFY DOS MODE (enable/disable) and "STOCK" mode, and the other for REU usage. The REU switch allows switching from Ramlink Mode (NORMAL)and DIRECT RAM EXPANSION MODE (DIRECT).</p>
<p>It has a socket in the back allowing "FAST" parallel access to the CMD SERIES HARD DRIVES, making the hard drive faster than normal (due to The Ramlinks incredible speed. More on that later), and has a socket for the power supply that powers The ramlink, and another socket for plugging in the battery pack.</p>
<p>The battery pack is used to save the information on The Ramlink for "SHORT" periods of time when transporting the device (for moving or to copy its contants to another computer, or whatever). REMEMBER, "SHORT PERIODS OF TIME." If you wait too long, all content will be lost!</p>
<p>The Ramlink must be plugged into a wall socket that is ALWAYS HOT! Without power, the Ramlink will lose all of its information and configuration settings. Which brings me to the next section.</p>
<p>Ramlink has many possible configurations available to its users. This is to offer The Commodore user the highest level of comfort and convience while still considering compatibility restraints. Like I said, IT'S A MARVELOUS DEVICE! :):)</p>
<p>It's (OBVIOUS) that the best feature of The Ramlink is PURE UNALDURATED SPEED! Thsi thing rocks! Some programs that i used to load in 2-4 minutes, now take only 1 second to load! INCREDIBLE!</p>
<p>To top it all off, you get a Ramlink Utilities disk to help you setup, configure, and modify The Ramlink to your liking.</p>
<p>This is the best device that I have ever owned or used for a Commodore Computer! A "must have."</p>

<p>I'm going to talk about Diabetes.</p>
<p>Diabetes is a disease where your pancreas doesn't work. This organ makes insulin and glucagon.</p>
<p>When you eat food, the carbohydrates, sugar, half of the proteins and ten percent of the fat will get turned into energy. Insulin is the hormone that lets the sugar, everything above gets turned into sugar, get absorbed into the small intestine to get turned into energy. A type 1 diabetic's pancreas can't do this.</p>
<p>A type 1 diabetic's pancreas cannot make glucagon either.</p>
<p>Glucagon is the hormone that stimulates the kidneys reserve of sugar when the blood sugar is low and when you are having a blood sugar related seizure.</p>
<p>A diabetic has to be very careful about what (s)he eats. Everything has a different effect on the blood sugar.</p>
<p>Okay, carbohydrates cause the blood sugar to rise because it contains sugar etc. Sugar does the same thing but faster because it goes directly to the blood stream.</p>
<p>Fat delays the absorbtion of carbs because it blocks the carbs from getting from where they need to go. After six hours, the fat wears off and you get a carb rush, which explains why you get tired after a high fat meal. I cannot eat many many many things b/c they have too much fat per serving. I always stay away from things that have more than 5 grams of fat per serving.</p>
