<p>So how exactly do we decide what a "covert reference" to another performer is? Some on the list are pretty clear-cut ("I'll clone myself like that blonde chick who sings "Bette Davis Eyes'"), while some are very dubious ("it stoned me just like jelly roll" is Jelly Roll Morton?) and most are just guesswork and speculation ("American Pie", anyone?) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 07:03, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b>. Rather than deletion, I'd suggest that this article and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_containing_overt_references_to_real_musicians.html" title="List of songs containing overt references to real musicians">List of songs containing overt references to real musicians</a> be merged into a single article with a less-strange name, perhaps List of songs containing references to musicians (with the lede text noting that only real musicians other than the artist of the song are considered in the list's scope). Songs which overtly name the person or group in question shouldn't be a problem, anything currently on the "covert" list will need a citation from a source (the actual artist, someone involved with production, or a biography, most likely) indicating that the "covert reference" is not actually overt OR. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:16, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>: This is a very interesting piece that surely has a place on Wikipedia. This list illustrates the greatness of a collaborative project: it has been a part of this encyclopedia for three years and has been continually edited by dozens of editors who have put in a great deal of work. Until tonight I have not been one of them because I wasn't aware of it, so I am not speaking on my own behalf, but on behalf of other hard-working contributors. Put one of your stickers on top, if you must, suggesting that references be added, and let the editors of the page consider if and how they wish to do so - in most cases it's a matter of reading the lyrics. But it should not be summarily trashed just because the policy du jour is remove, remove, remove, and a very small group of editors - far fewer than those who have diligently worked on this page for three years - have come to this page to vote it out as if this were an episode of "Survivor". Have some respect for the hard work of others and don't be so rigid. Does anyone remember "If the rules prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia's quality, ignore them"? (WP:IAR for those who like acronyms.) <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">User:Serpent's Choice</a>'s suggestion is also worth considering.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: although trivia, this list can be useful, and for that reason augments Wikipedia's aim of forming as comprehensive and in-depth encyclopedia as possible. Additionally, the majority of songs listed provide references for their listing through excerpts of lyrics. In this way, I fail to see how this is original research. This article has been around for a real time.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with saying that the songs themselves provide references, is that is only true when the exact name of a person is used in the song. But, and especially because the article is <i>covert</i> references, anything beyond that would be an inference, or a hypothesis if you will. It might be a hypothesis that any informed music-lover might make, but unless it <i>has</i> been made, and by a credible, referenced source, it must be considered original research. It is tough to prove a negative, but if this is indeed <i>not</i> original research, I'm sure someone will come up with sources, and I'll change my opinion. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 10:01, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

That means that if several people already have showed support for the nominator, adding nothing but a statement in support of the nominator <b>will not contribute significantly to the conclusion that is made by the administrator closing the discussing</b>. Showing support for the nomination certainly can be a good thing, but it is good to try to explain why this support is justified. Even better is to try to formulate the arguments for deletion in your own words, even if those arguments are very similar to those presented by the nominator. <b>If that is too much work or too difficult, it might be better to refrain from making a statement at all</b>.</i> -- <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeirdoactor_7234.html" title="User:Weirdoactor">weirdoactor</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/e/i/User_talk%7EWeirdoactor_eae5.html" title="User talk:Weirdoactor">t</a></sup><sup>|</sup><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Weirdoactor_bb16.html" title="Special:Contributions/Weirdoactor">c</a></sup> 20:27, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are cases where artists have said in interviews that they meant a particular part of their song as a reference to another person, event, or musician - a tribute - and in a quick scan I don't see any references to such interviews (wait, there is one reference included); inclusion of such would strengthen the list. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 14:44, 29 December 2006 (UTC) (changed from Keep to Merge, but my suggestion as to trimming and citing stands: --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 23:27, 29 December 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Keep, clean up and reference</b>. I am certain that a goodly number of the entries are verifiable (and some are discussed at length in the individual articles, which IMO is good enough for a list like this).

It can be renominated if/when the category is created. As to encyclopedic nature, songs with alleged cryptic references to real persons are an ancient and interesting phenomenon.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't mean this as a personal assault, but you opened a window I felt needed crawling through â€” what is being sought is an encyclopedic reason, not a wholesome or fun reason ... there is an encyclopedic reason afterall and that is establishment of notability. One artist referencing another artist in a work is a contributing factor to the notability of the artist being referenced and therefore contributes to the overall strength of the encyclopedia as a whole. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 23:32, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry for causing loss of people's work. But this seems rather OR-ish to me. The word "covert" is a red flag. Sometimes with overt references, one can rely on the primary source. But covert, means that a straightforward reading of the lyrics doesn't prove its true, and it might even by denied, with an alternate explanation of what the song is referring to. No independent reliable sources have presented. If anybody wishes to save this, I recommend copying to user-space, finding sources, and making a new artricle, with citations on every item. Any place, other than article space, would be good. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Encyclopedias are more than, and have always been more than, repositories of obvious knowledge. Some of the best entries in the Encyclopedia Britannica are about little-known, covert aspects of culture. Admittedly, these may be harder to verify than obvious knowledge, and may run closer to personal viewpoints than some might feel comfortable with. But they are, in their own way, the reason that we have Encyclopedias in the first place.

<li><b>Keep</b> I hope that it is not a surprise to anyone that musicians make inobvious allusions to earlier performers &amp; their contemporaries. Deleting this article does not solve the problem that some editors will try to push their own theories &amp; original research into this list; these tendentious editors will find other ways to accomplish their goals (will this also lead to a ban of any section header similar to "Trivia", "X in popular culture", "Cultural references in X", etc. that might appear in any article?). The proper way to fix this problem is on the Talk page for this article: state that a given claim <b>needs references</b>. If someone hasn't tried that solution before listing an article on AfD, it's hard to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> when the article appears here first. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 01:42, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I've seen people throwing around the "it's hard to assume good faith" threat quite a bit in this discussion, and frankly I don't understand it. Why is it hard to assume good faith? From my point of view, the lack of references <i>indicates</i> that the list probably is original research, which is a good reason for AFD. It didn't take me long to arrive at that reasoning either, and that reasoning seems like a fine one if you need help in assuming good faith. Moreover, I haven't seen any of the keep voters really tackle the OR issue in their arguments, other than just claiming it is not OR, or claiming it is impossible to understand why anyone could think it is. I would really like to see that addressed, and not because I'm convinced the article definitely needs to go. I am sympathetic to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West's</a> request that we consider how long it would take to properly source this, and vote keep for now, to give the authors time to source it. As such, and especially because this is not reaching consensus any time soon, I will change my recommendation to <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 11:20, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> There are now 15 explicit citations of sources. Moat of them have been added since the nomination, so I cannot criticize it; but it is out of date.
