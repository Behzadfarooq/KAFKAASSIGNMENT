<li><b>Keep</b> Oh, come on. FlareNUKE put up this article for deletion possibly to get attention on the comic in question's forum. This is a very notable webcomic (no, not something in a high school newspaper) that used to be very high up in the rankings on several webcomic ranking sites, but gradually fell due to the writer/artist going on a several month long hiatus. It has now returned, but is still recovering. However, it is still a highly popular comic, and still active. It is apart of the webcomic group "the Gewd Guys", which is a group including webcomic goliaths such as Chugworth Academy. Do not delete this article simply because some sad little fan wanted attention on a forum.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wait so 40+ pages on Oral Sex, or the meaning of Dirty Sanchez or how many times a certain porn star has taken it up the ass is all fine. But a page about a Webcomic that's been going for almost six years is a no no? What the hell? The fact is that there really isn't much on Wiki that's treally important. So why axe one over another? If you're going to axe the Loserz entry then you should axe all of the Webcomic entries.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>* Personally, I see no reason why the entry should be deleted. In my time reading and monitoring Wikis I've seen far more pointless stuff, Loserz has an active fan community and a long and proud history (six years in the webcomic world is a very long time). If you delete this page, then you might as well start deleting pages for other webcomics as well, which is just nonsensical</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>* Notable or non-notable...is it such a bad thing to leave the article up? What's the worst that could happen? It's not hurting anybody. Anyway Loserz has been linked to several other webcomic sites, and has spawned at least 100+ fan art. It should be kept. shoes22 11:13, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>* Come on people. Loserz has been running for six years and has an established fanbase. There are far stupider articles on wiki out there for you to delete. Foomartini makes a really good point. Articles about pornstars and the origin of the dildo is fine but a webcomic gets deleted? Give me a break.Gigaguyser 11:21, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't really see a reason to make an attempt to delete an entire page, it's really a waste of time. But I hate the self-importance of author and his fans, so I'll go along with the deleters. IrkenRed 12:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Notable and significant fan base. Above comment is based upon irrelevant issue of how the author/fans allegedly act, so I'd have to strongly disagree with IrkenRed. I'm not a forum contributer, so my vote upon a seperate judgement basis. <a href="../../../f/y/v/User%7EFyver528_628f.html" title="User:Fyver528">Fyver528</a> 14:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC) <b>Edit: Important comment relating to Alexa ranking</b> The URL that the non-notability judgement was made upon was loserzcomic.com, however <a href="http://loserz.scribblekid.org/" class="external free" title="http://loserz.scribblekid.org/" rel="nofollow">http://loserz.scribblekid.org/</a> is still widely used and was used for much longer than loserzcomic.com.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The comic in question not only is a notable comic in the webcomic community, holding several times high rankings in webcomic listing sites, but also has a strong active forum community that is active even when the author is on one of his many hiatuses, which are noted in the article. The webcomic is not currently a campus newspaper comic, although that's how it did start. How it began may have not been notable, but from the fans and attention Loserz has recieved it surely is notable in the webcomic community. The author is not "conceited", as I have not seen the author on this editing page. Also, the person who admittedly put the article up for deletion seems to have a bad reputation on the comics forum community. Wiki pages should not be deleted because someone doesn't like what it's about. I believe that Wikipedia is supposed to be about unbiased judgements and facts, not whimsical, arbitrary selections for acceptance and deletion and such. The facts are that loserzcomic.com does have a pretty good alexa rating for a webcomic that is being independantly published on the internet. It has an active community, and has been rated highly by webcomic rating sites in the past. This should show that, among webcomics, this comic is notable. Milam 21:18, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep: No reason to delete the entry. its just another piece of information, why remove it?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Remove it because it's not notable. Notable doesn't mean it's been around a long time or it has an active fanbase or it's been rated highly and whether or not the author takes hiatuses is completely irrelevant. It means "it is known <i>outside</i> a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact." A lot of great things in the world aren't notable. Nothing personal fans. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 01:45, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
