<p>There is nothing intrinsically notable about the chapter, and scholars treat the bible as a collection of narratives, and themes, rather than dividing it by chapter and verse (which are a mediaeval invention, anyway). Not one major encyclopedia, nor famous faith based encyclopedias (<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Encyclopedia_760d.html" title="Jewish Encyclopedia">Jewish Encyclopedia</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Encyclopedia_7d0b.html" title="Catholic Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a>, etc.), treats the bible in a chapter-by-chapter manner, and most scholars regard it completely inappropriate to divide it like this.</p>
<p>The article as it stands is nothing more than a collection of unrelated trivia, and this is all it is likely ever to be. It is true that <b>parts</b> of the chapter have been used at weddings, but that only makes the parts notable, not the whole thing as a unit, in the same way that <i>alas poor Yorick, I knew him Horatio</i> is an often used quote from shakespeare, but that doesn't mean we can justify an article concentrating on Act 5 Scene 1, all of Act 5 Scene 1, and only Act 5 Scene 1, of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">the play in question</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I fail to see your logic. This information is certainly better than <i>no</i> information.

<dd>I've been asked to clarify my vote. At a minimum, I think the article should not be deleted, but be preserved; be it in the article about the 1 Corinthians, or in a standalone article. I tend to favor the busting out of articles that can stand on their own from their parents, <i>see main article XYZ</i>, even when the sub-article is small. So if facing a choice between keep and merge, I would choose <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:26, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> not every chapter of the Bible is independently notable, this one is. It is the most common reading at weddings, was read at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, was the origin of the phrase "through a glass darkly". To Clinkophonist: the analogy with a Shakespeare play does not realy work. It's more akin to an individual sonnet, or perhaps <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_debd.html" title="Rosencrantz and Guildenstern">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</a>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:21, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>No, it isn't akin to a sonnet because it isn't a natural unit, the subject matter spans more than this chapter and/or breaks up within the chapter rather than spanning it; the "love" section starts at 1 Corinthians 12:31b and continues to 14:1b, and that it starts and ends half way through sentences demonstrates it was never intended to be a distinct unit. And what is worse is that the prophecy section seems to start at verse 9, i.e. the section that continues in chapter 14 starts in the middle of chapter 13, and the division that makes the love part mostly fit into its own chapter, rather than the prophecy part fitting into its own chapter is entirely arbitary. It is more akin to "lines 17-37" of a sonnet, where lines 17-37 are chosen for no notable reason other than that someone in the middle ages thought that lines 1-16 were a nice total size, and drew a line under them, then drew a line under 37 because lines 17-37 were about the same size. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 15:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> whatever is actually important (and much of what is there is not) into <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians_a231.html" title="First Epistle to the Corinthians">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a>. - <span style="font-family:'Brush Script MT',Phyllis,'Lucida Handwriting',cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User_talk%7ENunh-huh_50b3.html" title="User talk:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 14:53, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - if it is commonly used in wedding then it is notable enough to deserve an article. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinhunter_d2c4.html" title="User:Winhunter">WinHunter</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWinhunter_2903.html" title="User talk:Winhunter">talk</a>)</sup> 16:07, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It is a chapter of the most published and read book in history, that is commonly read in weddings...I think it's notable. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 16:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, as much as I am sick and tired of hearing that passage at every wedding I go to. Its "notability" (if such a thing is necessary) is quite clearly set out in the article. People may be interested to see that <b>this was previously <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1_Corinthians_13_c39f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/1 Corinthians 13">nominated for AfD on May 16</a></b>. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 16:27, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This passed its AfD with a "keep" result just two months ago and the chapter has not lost its notability since then. The suggestion that only "parts" of the chapter are notable, not the chapter as a whole, is misguided because the chapter is only 262 words long in the New International Version translation. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2013&amp;version=31" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2013&amp;version=31" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The notable parts are basically all consecutive with each other. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 17:02, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Its notable because its well known due to its wide use Knowing Is Half The Battle 23:19, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I was searching for (and found) this very page <i>yesterday</i>, which - to me - indicates a certain level of significance and usefulness in an encyclopedia. This article is, as Metropolitan90 noted, perpetually notable. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandyWang_b828.html" title="User:RandyWang">RandyWang</a> (<sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandyWang_f768.html" title="User talk:RandyWang"><b>raves</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RandyWang_7371.html" title="Special:Contributions/RandyWang"><b>rants</b></a></sub>) 23:21, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians_a231.html" title="First Epistle to the Corinthians">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a>. The information in this sub-article would be just as useful (and searchable) in the 1 Corinthians article.

<li><b>Keep</b> (or possibly <b>Merge and Redirect</b>). Here we go again! As stated last time: this is a key chapter from the bible which those interested in literature, irrespective of their own belief system, will want to know about. It should remain in Wikipedia in some form. By the way, has anyone spotted that this chapter is quoted in its entirety at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charity_%28virtue%29.html" title="Charity (virtue)">charity</a>&#160;? And Clinkophonist's argument is factually wrong - the WHOLE chapter is usually quoted at weddings. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattmm_a7ef.html" title="User:Mattmm">Mattmm</a> 11:49, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> one of the only chapters of the Bible that has some notability as such (rather than as a pericope). Could be renamed to Love chapter if focus changed to 12:31b-14:1b or merged/redirected if necessary. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 20:12, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and don't Merge</b> No one cares about the whole First Epistle to the Corinthians. This particular passage is significant in culture (weddings) and literature, most recently with the film adaptation of PKD's <a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Scanner_Darkly_5a9d.html" title="A Scanner Darkly">A Scanner Darkly</a>. -<a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKangaru99_e8a4.html" title="User:Kangaru99">Nick</a> 00:40, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> based on this article passing <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1_Corinthians_13_c39f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/1 Corinthians 13">previous AfD nomination</a>. Certainly the notability and significance of a biblical passage thousands of years old could not have significantly diminished over the last two months. --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatori_Son_533a.html" title="User:Satori Son">Satori Son</a> 16:47, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Weak Redirect/Merge</b> -- definitely notable on its own. I think it might be more encyclopedic to keep the whole epistle together. This also reduces duplicate content and chances of POV forking. I'm almost neutral on this one.--<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 16:45, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> -- appears to be a notable passage, is used in Christian wedding rites. However, the current state of article is a train wreck and very non encyclopedic. A total rewrite would be recommended to remove any <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and anything not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, so if an easier way to do that is with a delete, so be it. My personal rule of thumb is that the article should never be longer than the original subject text. -- <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDolomite_0b0c.html" title="User:MrDolomite">MrDolomite</a> | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDolomite_8f87.html" title="User talk:MrDolomite">Talk</a> 17:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and don't merge</b> -- I think this is notable enough to stand alone. It is a very famous chapter and is read often. Needs to be cleaned up, though. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesussaves_9444.html" title="User:Jesussaves">Jesussaves</a> 22:11, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
