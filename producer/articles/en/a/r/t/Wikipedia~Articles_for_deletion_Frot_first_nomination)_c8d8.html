<li><b>Comment</b> Tribadism seems to be notable, both as a sex position and historically, but tryin to figure out the difference between "frot" and "frottage" is making my brain hurt. There's also a surprising amount of anti-anal-sex POV propagandism in the 'frot' page that should go out if both pages are merged. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 03:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Men can do both frot and anal. Nevertheless the cultural importance of frot (as equivalent to tribadism) emerged as part of a polemic against anal sex. Especially in relationship to the threat of AIDS to gay men. This is simply a historical fact. Describing the polemic neutrally doesnt necessarily reflect the opinion of the Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 19:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/Against delete</b>Term is a neologism, but Wikipedia does not have a policy against neologism, just a bias, since most of them require original research to support. In this case, there are supportable references (even though few), and so being a new term is not a problem. Content is distinct from other articles, including frottage. As for the "POV propagandism", well the term is primarily about non-anal-sex, so what would anyone expect? Should we delete it because it is a type of sexuality we ourselves don't practice? That wouldn't seem right. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 03:28, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/Against merge</b> - Frot refers to male-male genital-genital sex, frottage does not. The term <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frottage.html" title="Frottage">frottage</a> can't be used because it refers to MANY methods of sex, whether heterosexual or homosexual, clothed or naked, genital or non-genital. Frottage doesn't connote male-male genital-genital sex. Only frot specifies it. Frot exactly parallels <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribadism.html" title="Tribadism">tribadism</a>, which is female-female genital-genital sex, and to keep tribadism while deleting frot would be severe discrimination. Frot refers to an extremely notable, primordial method of sex (it even exists among <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonobo.html" title="Bonobo">bonobo</a>), despite the fact that Greek/Latin and thus traditional English lacks a word for it. It is customary in Wikipedia to use whatever term is prevalent for a specific sex position, regardless of whether its origin is slang or the porn industry, because medical jargon is often useless for describing specific positions. In this case, frot is the prevailing term. Genital sex doesn't automatically require penetration, and to imply that frot isn't real genital-genital sex because real sex must include penetration is a male heterosexual bias, and discrimination against other forms of genital sex, including <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribadism.html" title="Tribadism">tribadism</a>. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 18:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I dont think people are questioning the act, nor denying the convenience of it mirroring tribadism. The deletion revolves around whether the term is notable, not the act. No one is arguing whether their should be an article about men rubbing penises, people are arguing whether their should be one called Frot. - <a href="../../../u/n/l/User%7EUnlimitedAccess_461a.html" title="User:UnlimitedAccess">UnlimitedAccess</a> 04:38, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> firstly what you described with the naming conventions isnt the case, compare with <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">Oral sex</a>, I'm sure "blow job" is a lot more common in the vernacular but thats not what we title that article, we use the technical term, also <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> is not listed at "<a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>", <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> is not listed at "jacking off".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But just to humor this train of thought lets look at what its called in pornography, go check out <a href="http://www.cocktocockstories.com" class="external free" title="http://www.cocktocockstories.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cocktocockstories.com</a>, only one instance that I could see of it being called frot, apparently as a present tense verb form of frottage, everywhere else its just called "frottage" (kind of analagous to how straight people call penile-vaginal sex "intercourse") in fact "frot" isn't even in the warning list of things the site contains explicit images of. Go look at "My Waking Dream" (its under construction right now but here's an internet archive <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050204072328/www.keepstill.com/wakingdream/main.html?v=20040822" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050204072328/www.keepstill.com/wakingdream/main.html?v=20040822" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20050204072328/www.keepstill.com/wakingdream/main.html?v=20040822</a>) there's a section for "Dick2Dick" but nothing whatsoever for "frot". I'm pretty sure these sites weren't created with a heterosexual male bias.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore "frot" (<a href="http://www.salon.com/people/col/cintra/1999/05/19/povparty/print.html" class="external free" title="http://www.salon.com/people/col/cintra/1999/05/19/povparty/print.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.salon.com/people/col/cintra/1999/05/19/povparty/print.html</a> , <a href="http://www.upsideclown.com/2002_09_02.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.upsideclown.com/2002_09_02.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.upsideclown.com/2002_09_02.shtml</a> ) and "frotting" (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frotting" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frotting" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frotting</a>) can apparently be used as synonyms for frottage, including heterosexual frottage.

<li><b>Merge</b> Onhm makes a good point. Slang terms typically redirect to articles with technical titles.

<li><b>Comment</b> - No one has to do anything. People are arguing 'Frot' isn't a notable term, whereas people here accept Tribadism is.

<li><b>Keep</b> As per Haldrik. It seems the technical title would be "male-male genital-genital sex", which is too long and which itself seems would be neologism anyway since it seems the cited sources that refer to male-male genital-genital sex use the term "frot". If "frot" were merged to "male-male genital-genital sex", wouldn't tribadism also have to be merged to "female-female genital-genital sex" too? --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYarel_c8a8.html" title="User:Yarel">Yarel</a> 09:25, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>LOL Should the technical title be "Dick2Dick"? The serious sources use "frot". --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYarel_c8a8.html" title="User:Yarel">Yarel</a> 09:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There are no serious sources, there's just that ridiculous website and porn, actually I would say porn is a good deal more serious because it actually caters to peoples desires without all that silly preaching, mentioning the source of this neologism would be one thing, but naming the article based on their term is blatant POV, if "Male-male genital-genital sex" is too long why not just call it "penis-to-penis sex" or "penis-penis sex" (which is already what its been called for some time now on the informal redirect found on Frot and Frottage), thats essentially what the pornographic sites call it except we would be using penis instead of "dick" or "cock". --Onhm 17:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>PS if you're concerned about the charges of vandalism just go and look on the pages history and talk pages, Haldrik considers anything that doesn't reflect his own POV "vandalism" --Onhm 17:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> In fact, Onhm childishly - but systematically - vandalizes any criticism of anal sex, whatsoever. Even historical discussions about the risks of anal sex with regard to AIDS. In fact, the only reason Onhm tries to vandalize the <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frot.html" title="Frot">Frot</a> article now, is because the word "frot" was coined to specify male-male genital-genital sex as a notable way for the gay community to have an alternative to avoid the health risks of anal sex. There is nothing wrong with defending the legitimacy of anal sex. But, it is vandalism to delete notable points of view that critique anal sex. Onhm likes anal sex and is just being childish. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 20:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is impossible to call the technical title, "penis-to-penis sex", because it is a neologism that Onhm just invented now! "Frot" is ONLY technical term that SPECIFIES male-male genital-genital sex. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 20:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>I didn't mean it as a "term" I ment it as a description, some wikipedia articles use descriptions of things, rather than names of things as titles, but if thats a problem we could always merge to frottage, which is what its usually called anyway. Frot is <i>not</i> a technical term, its a neologism used pretty much exlusively by a highly POV webiste and people making reference to that website, the technical term is frottage, even gay porn sites <i>one of which speicalizes in penis to penis sex</i> call it frottage, theres not a more specific technical term, it doesn't exist, and its not prejeduced or discriminatory to refuse to pretend otherwise.</li>

<li>The point is, quite simply, that "frot" <i>is not</i> the term in general use for this type of sexual activity. It's a valid article, because the <i>practice</i> certainly exists, but "frot" is not the correct title for it, because nobody <i>calls it that</i> except for one agenda-driven website. Wikipedia does not exist to promote new terms that people would <i>like</i> to apply to their favourite things; it exists to document the terms that <i>are</i> in general use. This term has <i>no</i> actual currency in normal discussions of sexuality; the article needs to be titled with a term that people <i>actually use</i>. <b>Move</b> to any appropriate alternate title. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:25, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Frottage isn't the technical term. Frottage is an archaic term which has an entirely different meaning. It would be like merging the entry for "sexual intercourse" into one marked "plow", since fuck is the old english word for plow. Similarly, frottage is about rubbing strangers on trains, but frot is personal and purposeful. It would be a mistake to merge or delete this entry.Xsaithx 04:08, 1 November 2006 (UTC)xsaithx</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> in any event "frot" is not a word that is used outside this narrow little community, its not some widely recognized real-life term used by all men who like frottage (which is not an archaic term, I just showed everyone an online porn site that still calls it frottage not "frot") NPOV is about more than opinions, group-specific language is just as much a part of someones POV as their values, if most conventionally reliable sources as well as pornography call men rubbing their penises together "frottage" then thats what wikipedia should call it. Docking, mutual masturbation and intercrural intercourse can involve penis to penis contact as well (the penile bulb or "root" goes back between a the legs along the perineum) so the whole deal with keeping it to preserve "equal time" for different types of genital-genital sex shouldn't be an issue because frottage isn't the only sexual act that may or may not involve genito-genital contact depending on the sex and position of the participantsOnhm 17:18, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> So by your logic we should delete the word <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">klingon</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon</a>, because no one uses the word outside of a narrow little community. Maybe you're taking yourself too seriously here. Your proof that frot should be deleted is a porn site, while there is more than one community action group that is serious about promoting it (and not exploiting it for money) that uses the term "frot". Maybe we should change all words in wikipedia that don't meet the criteria of some pornographic website's lexicon? You complain about group-specific language and then discredit your argument by basing it on the group-specific language of the porn industry. Meanwhile you're ignoring the reality that outside of wikipedia, even if you succeed in your petty little quest to destroy this entry, the term "frot" will still be used as separate and distinct from the term "frottage." The end result of a merge for this term won't be increased accuracy of wikipedia, it will be the increased marginalization of wikipedia as innaccurate, out of date, and ultimately unreliable. Isn't increased reliability of wikipedia something that the community here should be fighting for ABOVE AND BEYOND any other personal problems with a group?Xsaithx 01:15, 1 November 2006 (UTC)xsaithx</li>

<dd>The reliability of Wikipedia is <i>not</i> increased by calling articles with titles that don't exist in the real world. And, for the record, "Klingon" is <i>not</i> a word whose use is restricted to a narrow little community; awareness of the term and what it denotes <i>transcends</i> the community it derives from. <i>Millions</i> of people who have <i>no</i> connection to <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> fandom know what a "Klingon" is, and there isn't any other word for it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Despite the fact that frot has always existed, English didnt have a word for it. Now "frot" is the word that has come to be used for it, and its etymology is notable. Similarly, the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribadism.html" title="Tribadism">Tribadism</a> article talks about the etymology of term "tribadism". Originally, the Greek word had nothing to do with female-female genital-genital sex, but came to mean this only in relatively recent times. Originally the Greek word referred to a woman who used a dildo, which is irrelevant to its meaning today. The etymology of "tribadism" is notable, and must be described. There is a paragraph or so explaining (quite well) the origin and evolution of the term. It is the same with the <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frot.html" title="Frot">Frot</a> article. The etymology is notable. The term didnt emerge in the context of Greek women who wanted to sexually penetrate others, but in the context of American gay men who wanted to avoid anal sex. It's just a description of the origin and evolution of the term. Today, the term "frot" simply means male-male genital-genital sex. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 00:32, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Neither of which actually exists in any offline capacity or has any real world accomplishments or actual membership or anything of that sort, not that it would matter their "selflessness" would be no excuse to adopt their language over actual English terms. The technical English (borrowed from French) term for rubbing bodies together is frottage (even amoung gay men in gay contexts) [<a href="http://www.gay.com/health/sexuality/article.html?sernum=134" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gay.com/health/sexuality/article.html?sernum=134" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], regarless of the fact that for some of us its also genito-genital sex. "Frot" is an neologism specific to a pair of websites (which is also used elsewhere as a direct synonym for frottage as I have already shown), we should not be listing certain types of sex at website specific neologisms when all other forms of sex have the dignity of being listed at their proper names. The difference between "frot" and "Klingon" is that entries like "Klingon" have no pretense of applying to the real world. If you're so concerned with how "noteworthy" these websites are then go then make articles for them instead of translating wikipedia into their cutesy little neologisms.

<li><b>Comment</b> Frot is the only term for male-male genital-genital sex. It has multiple sources. Besides people DO use the term frot. People I know use it. The term frot is not a problem. --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYarel_c8a8.html" title="User:Yarel">Yarel</a> 17:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can you kindly show some of those sources? Because I can't find a single example on Google of the word existing in general use; the only people using it out there on the web are those with a vested interest in <i>promoting</i> the term. Anyway, just on the off chance that my lack of experience with the term was somehow not representative of actual usage, I asked five different friends today what <i>they</i> would call this act. <i>Every single one</i> of them came up with "frottage". I then asked if they would ever abbreviate that to "frot", and every one of them looked at me like I was speaking Klingon. So is frot the term in general use? Is it the <i>only</i> term for this particular sexual act? Clearly not, on either count. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:52, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not independent reliable sources, in all the few cases I've seen of anyone writing the word "frot" anywhere outside that website they are either self consciously adopting the terminology of that webstie because they are commenting on it, or using it as a slang shortening of frottage like in those examples ealier where straight people were saying they liked to frot; when people talk about frottage in the same sort of contexts where people would say <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> rather than fucking. <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a> rather than blow job, and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> rather than jerking off, they call it "frottage", even on the other end of the spectrum in gay porn its called frottage (I think I've already cited both of these). Just like mutual masturbation is still mutual masturbation when the men's penises are touching, intercurural intercourse is still intercrural intercourse when the genitals are touching, just like heterosexual frottage is still frottage when the penis and clitoris are touching. Yes they are all genito-genital sex, thats wonderful, but the term doesn't change. If it had some prior (verifiable) existence as a regional slang term than it might still be notable only as a slang term (like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>), not the proper place to list information on the sex act. Even things like rimming and tit-jobs are listed at <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal-oral_contact.html" title="Anal-oral contact">anal-oral contact</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammary_intercourse.html" title="Mammary intercourse">mammary intercourse</a> respectively, not the slang term and certainly not at internet neologisms.Onhm 20:30, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
