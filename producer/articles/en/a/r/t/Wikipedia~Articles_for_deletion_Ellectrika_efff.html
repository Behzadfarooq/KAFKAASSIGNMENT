<p>NN, vanity posted by third party. Note that while the subject does not want this posted, this vfd is not a response to legal threat.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Utterly bizarre.

<li><b>Delete</b>. - I couldn't care less what anyone thinks, I want this page removed. I may be releasing music and pursing a music career but the people that created this page aren't using it for that purpose, they are simply trying to create a bit of a stir and I don't want a page about me or what others think of me on here because it's disturbing and retarded!! If any of you KNEW the background as to what these people do and what has happened then you'd understand why this is annoying me. <b>REMOVE</b>, <b>DELETE!!!!!!!!!</b> If I see anything else that I consider a defamation of my character or slanderous comments I WILL be taking further action. Now, get a life and go do something constructive with your time other than trying to constantly pull others down!! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ellectricka (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ellectricka_fd47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ellectricka">contribs</a>) , made in series of 4 edits beginning 2005-08-15 21:47:17.</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> you may be missing the point of the phrase 'non-notable' here, Ellectrika. In the context of this discussion it is <b>not</b> intended as a slur, either personal or professional. It is merely an attempt to keep some measure of control over what articles do and do not persist on Wikipedia. For example Martg mentions <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> above. Visit <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">the link</a> and you'll see that this is a set of guidelines (admittedly <i>rough</i> guidelines) as to what counts as "notable" in that context. Please note these are <i>not</i> subjective guidelines, they are merely criteria of how "big" – or "notable – a band or artiste is. No-one in this discussion is "pulling you down" (though there's a good measure of perplexity at what seems to be over-reaction; we don't know, and I at least don't particularly want to know, the background).</dd>
<dd>The people voting in this are in fact the last people you should be telling to 'go do something constructive with their time'. The "something constructive" that's being done is trying to get your problem solved – simply screaming 'remove, delete' won't do that as there's not a lot to stop it being reinstated, perhaps in another form. You might also take the time to read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">Wikipedia:No legal threats</a> to see why legal threats are probably not the best way to start to argue your case. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> 22:35, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How strange. <b>Delete</b> for non-notability (and no other reason) <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> 21:58, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Whatever!! Just <b>Delete</b> it!! Ellectrika 14:15, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I think Ellectrika was referring to the original article and not the vfd thread. The original article by User:Starboi was just a POV attack. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 14:28, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, it was a blatant attack and I know some of the people responsible so I know their motives and they aren't nice!! Just delete the bloody page!! I don't want a page about me and I have every right to request it's removal so just bloody delete it, for Christs sake!! Ellectrika 14:33, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hi there User:Ellectrika. You may be wondering why the page Ellectrika hasn't yet been deleted. When a page in the encyclopedia is listed for deletion, a <i>vote page</i> is listed (for Ellectrika, it's the page you are looking at now), and comments are gathered for a period before voting is closed. That period for general articles in the encyclopedia is 5 days. At the end of 5 days, a sysop closes the vote page, considers the comments, and arrives at a decision as to whether to <i>keep</i> or <i>delete</i>. Since all comments here have been to delete, that will likely be the outcome (unless other editors object, for some reason, in the remaining time — this is unlikely). A small number of articles go through a much faster process of deletion, called <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion</a>. This is reserved for "articles" that are clearly inappropriate, for example, gibberish ("dsbkjdbgkjdngjkdngkdhmnkuijh" and such). Where regular pages are concerned, the 5 day period is intended to provide time for editors to consider the merits of the subject, how well (if at all) the article is written, and whether the article is somehow in contravention of Wikipedia policies. That's what's been happening here. If it will do anything to assuage your anxiety about the page, may I point out that it is, as you know, currently virtually blanked out, and in any case these new, unremarkable pages get an exceptionally low amount of traffic — it is likely that few people have seen it other than the creator, yourself, and the editors on this page. Kind regards—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 15:23:20, 2005-08-16 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li>Interesting point. As JDoorjam asked above, <i>does</i> she (or anyone else) have that 'right' (or a 'right' for the request to be automatically granted, at any rate)? <a href="../../../1/9/2/User%7E192.18.1.9.html" title="User:192.18.1.9">192.18.1.9</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not regarding information that is in the pd, but as soon as information is considered "private" this becomes a sticky issue. Certainly not to be discussed on a vfd page however. <a href="../../../u/s/r/User%7EUsrnme_h8er_fa7c.html" title="User:Usrnme h8er">Usrnme h8er</a> 15:47, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
