<li><i><b>Do Not Delete</b></i> I have contributed extensively to this article and I believe that notability has been established according to Wikipedia's policy. I have included several links to major local publications (Mainly The Savannah Daily News. You will, however, be required to register to read the publications and it is free to do so) and the band's debut album (High Impendence Of The Majesty Of Super Horse, 2005)was voted as one of the best albums of the year according to Georgia Music magazine. The band has been together for over 12 years and is a well known "undreground" indie rock band (The links to The Savannah Daily News will verify my claim).</li>
</ul>
<p>The band has been voted as "The Best Of Savannah" for 2005 and has performed for the St Patrick's Day Parade, which is the second largest in the country.</p>
<p>Below are excerpts from Wickipedia's policy for notability for performing artists:</p>
<p>"<i>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...)."</i> <b>- The article in question meets this criteria since the band has been cited on major publications (see links on article) over 50 times over the course of 12 years.</b></p>
<p><i>"Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability."</i> <b>- Again this requirement has been satisfied. The links on the page will direct readers to various publications reconizing the band as one of the most influential (If not the most influential) indie rock band of Savannah, GA.</b></p>
<p><i>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</i> <b>The band's debut album (High Impendence Of The Majesty Of Superhorse) was released under Blast-O-Disc, which is related to Elevated Basement recording studio. This studio has worked with major regional and national acts such as Greg Allman (Allman Brothers) and The Atlanta Rythm section (Major rock band from the 70's and 80's)</b> I vote for this article to stay. &gt;<a href="../../../m/e/a/User%7EMeanax_a306.html" title="User:Meanax">+</a>&lt;/19 May 2006 (UTC) User = Meanax <a href="../../../m/e/a/User%7EMeanax_a306.html" title="User:Meanax">Meanax</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/e/a/User_talk%7EMeanax_35af.html" title="User talk:Meanax">&amp;Meanax;</a>)</sup> 19:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless Meanax can provide more critical sources. You have four articles about the band, but they're all from the same paper, and I couldn't find anything on the Georgia Music Magazine web site (BTW, said magazine has only been around for a year, which means it probably isn't a highly recognized source) about albums of the year. At this point, the band simply does not have enough notability. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:14, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article is also <i>highly</i> POV, not just about the band but about each individual member. That has to change if this article survives the deletion voting process. It also needs to be wikified ({{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}}). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:17, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Do Not Delete</b></s> I have added more links to news papers from Charleston SC, as well as radio interview from the Georgia Gazette (GPB). Also remember that under Wikipidia requirements for notability, one or more members of the band must be notable. The lead singer Keith Kozel has won best supporting actor for an indie movie and was recognized by the Savannah Morning News. Kozel's GAM (His main band until recently) was voted "The Best Band In GA" by a public poll conducted by Creative Loafing Magazine in 1999 (Link on article's page will direct readers to Creative Loafing's archives. Creative Loafing is a weekly magazine with circulation of over 40,000). Creative Loafing in Savannah has changed its name to Access Savannah.</li>

<p>I have added two additional links to the page, one of which will direct readers to a radio interview broadcasted by the Georgia Plublic Broadcast radio. As of now I have provided articles from 2 major paper publications with circulation of over 40,000 (The Savannah Morning News and The Charleston Gazette), along with a state wide half hour long broadcast. I am claiming notability under "regional" standards and I feel that I have satisfied Wikipidia's requiremnts thus far.</p>
<p>All articles and radio broadcast will reveal that the band has somewhat chosen to remain low key and underground. All articles and broadcast will also reveal that the band has an enourmous, and loyal regional following despite its lack of ovewhelming media exposure.</p>
<p>I invite you all to read the articles and listen to the broadcast and ask you to please allow this article to remain. The information provided seems satisfy the two Wikipedia requirements listed above for regional notability.|+]]&lt;/22 May 2006 (UTC) User = Meanax <a href="../../../m/e/a/User%7EMeanax_a306.html" title="User:Meanax">Meanax</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/e/a/User_talk%7EMeanax_35af.html" title="User talk:Meanax">&amp;Meanax;</a>)</sup> 19:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>DO NOT DELETE&#160;!</b> If all worthiness requirements have been satisfied...why is this article being offered up for deletion? I certainly hope prior justification can be provided before removing.|+]]&lt;/22 May 2006 (UTC) User = Amyjo75231 19:55, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i><b>Keep</b></i> After carefully reviewing this article and the supporting sources it appears that this article deserves to be permanently included on Wikipedia. I am familiar with the region and the publications and given the sheer amount of bands in the Savannah area to be mentioned on its largest publication repeatedly is somewhat unique. Also it is very unusual for GPB (Georgia Public Broadcasting) to grant air time to bands. For them to have been interviewed by GPB and had their show broadcasted is a huge accomplishment not achieved by the vast majority of bands in the region. If notability is all that is in question to keep this artcile I believe that criteria has been clearly established. User = Silvah 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Do not delete. This band is a known entity and is of consequence. Anyone who uses Allmusic.com as a source of credibility has never been listed. 70% of my credits are wrong and 80% of them are not listed at all. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Fibes (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fibes_cf52.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fibes">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Despite attempts to claim notability, this still seems like just your run of the mill local band. Also, if you can't afford your own website, that says something about your band's notability. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 19:10, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: My understanding when I decided to contribute to Wikipedia was that there was an eitiquette in which editors were not supposed to attack or belittle new contributors. This rule appears to not apply to Mr./Mrs. Hetar.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have written this article according to the policy of notability written by the scholars and academics of Wikepedia, not mine. To answer to Mr.Mrs. Hetar's comments (which I find completely innapropriate and bordeline that of someone who is completely closed mind an uninformed)having a web page does not denote "notability". Not by common standars and definitly not by Wikipedia standards either. Had Superhorse had the most glamourous site on the internet and nothing else I am sure that would not be acceptable. I have looked up for Aunt Teresa.com,.net, .org and found nothing no such a domain. According to Hetar's (absurd) remark that implies that Aunt Teresa is a less notable than Jimmy Swagart, who not surprisingly has a domain of his own.</p>
<p>Another comment from M/M Hetar is that he uses the words "seems to me" to discredit my article. Am I trying to satisfy Hetar's or Wikipedia' standards for notability. If it is Wikipedia's I have pasted them on my comment above and presented verifiable documentation to satisfy those standards. If it is Mr/Mrs Hetar' standards that I must satisfy, then I would like a copy of such standards so that I may attempt to satisfy them as well.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the article is not being deleted for lack of notability as required. I sense a strong bias toward a subject that so far all editors seem to have not fully considered all the information presented. It appears from all the votes for deletion that the editors are requiring that notability be proven as one would that of an internationally known band.</p>
<p>Wikipedia's policy on notability has a room for "regional" bands, and this is where I think the direction of this discussion should be focused. For regional standards, media and type of media coverage, Superhorse is without a doubt a "notable" regional band. This fact is not argued by our local radio stations, public radio stations, paper print, internet media, but to somehow it is being contested over here. It is as if all of us who live here and rely on our local media to determine what is is not notable are incapable of telling the difference between the two.</p>
<p>All I ask of all editors is an unbiased discussion based on facts and Wikipedia's policy. Nothing more, nothing less. As of this moment I feel that the article is being deleted just because... Just because no one heard of the band. Just because someone didn't find information about it in some source that he or she considers "the ultimate" determining factor for a band's notability (i.e. Allmusic.com). Just because the band does not have a web page???? Please tell me that this vote/comment will not even be considered! Most bands,epecially regional bands are opting for pages at MySpace.com over their own domains because it allows them to interact with their fans at no cost. This is exactly the case with Superhorse. On the same note, if Mr./Mrs Hetar had taken his/her time to go over the information presented he.she would've noticed that Superhorse indeed has a web page. It just is not called Superhorse.com. Why is it not? Well... Let me see... I guess we all have watched the news lately and we all have heard of a "notable" (And by God I hope you will agree at least with this statement) horse called Superhorse, who has been around since the band has been around. Ahhh... Perhaps that domain name was taken. What do you think? Hetar's remark on web presence is without a doubt the most absurd remark I ever heard in my life, especially coming from someone who is suposedly 100 times more intelligent than I am. Hetar's remarks on my opinion cast a huge dark shadow of doubt on his reasoning, research of the material presented and his/her ability to make an unbiased up or down recommendation.</p>
<p>I personally believe that if this articles survives this discussion that it should be re-written. I agree with one of the editors where the POV language should be removed and the article reformated. But to overlook the facts and facts are: "The band has received media coverage over the years from various sources", and therefore is "notable" by common and Wikipedia's policy on notability is to deliberately delete an article that otherwise should've been included in this encyclopedia.

<dd>Sir, you've already stated your position at least twice before. Saying it again doesn't help your position. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 21:49, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Mr. Zeta, I cannot accept the comment from Mr.Mrs, Hetars. I will look for his or her articles because I refuse to accept "It seems to me", as an argument to discredit my article. I am sorry!</li>
</ul>
<p>I will continue to speak my mind everytime an editor brings a new objection (i.e. Lack of a web page). Had this editor researched prior to nominating this article for deletion he/she would know that the band has one. I only continue to speak because you (The editors) continue to discredit the article on different basis. Thank you for your understanding. I am not doing this for fun or anything, but this feels much like our legal system. Ultimately this article will remain or be deleted based on someone's interpretation of the Wikipedia's policy, not what is clearly written on the policy.</p>
