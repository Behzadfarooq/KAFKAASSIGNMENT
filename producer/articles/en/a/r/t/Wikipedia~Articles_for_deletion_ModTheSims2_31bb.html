<p>I love the site, I visit it often, and I've participated on the forums. However, it's does not meet the notability requirements for wikipedia.</p>
<p>It fails two important guidelines. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> The site was created and heavily edited by the site creator who goes by the nickname Delphi. The site was featured in two mass-media publication, however, the seem part of the excluded content of WEB #1: "Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the Internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of Internet addresses and site or content descriptions in Internet directories or online stores."</p>
<p>The site also has a high Alexa rank. However, web ranking is not a criteria for inclusion in the wikipedia and shouldn't be considered. Also, a detailed search query of google shows that 90,000+ of the unique google hits belong to the page itself. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;hs=YSU&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Modthesims2+-forum+-fourms+-blog+-blogs+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;hs=YSU&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Modthesims2+-forum+-fourms+-blog+-blogs+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. A vanilla search of the site's name reveals that there are only 635 unique web entries.</p>
<p>The article is also somewhat of a link farm that may also be a violation of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.</p>
<p>It's a very good resource and should be referenced in the main Sims2 article.

<li><b>Comment â€”</b> I'm not sure about this one; it doesn't smell like vanity to me, despite getting created/edited by the site creator and even if it was, "vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of assertion of importance is".</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would think that since it has been featured on G4TV's Attack of the Show and in Rolling Stone Magazine it is good enough. Maybe not for you, but it's still a third party reference of notability of the site. And in no place does it say in the policy about how it should be featured by the third party. When said sources recognize it, it is automatically notable. <i>"Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.</i>" Both of those are credible, and are reputable. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 11:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the policy which you try to justify this articles deltion with says "<i>Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guide or a resource for conducting business. For example, an article on a radio station generally shouldn't list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules etc. (although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable).</i>" Which talks about what not to put in said article, this article is just as viable as <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> and <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> to give you a few. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 13:13, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nope. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is the standard. Modthesims2 does not pass it. I think out of the examples you have given, two are most likely notable. (They get multiple, seemingly, non-trivial hits when I do <a href="../../../l/e/x/LexisNexis_2d15.html" title="LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a> searches.) 4chan doesn't, it's pretty much noted on the talk page, and it really should be nominated it for deletion. Modthesims2 gets no LexisNexis hits. Please explain to me how the Rolling Stone is non-trivial. If it were a two-page spread on the site.. I'd give it to you, I'd withdraw the nomination. It's a one sentence line about movie characters that were popular at the time the article was made who happened to make an appearance on the site. How is that notable for a wikipedia article?

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is a general-knowledge encyclopedia. While it does not have the same physical limitations as a printed encyclopedia, it isn't the universal vault of all obscure fan knowledge. While MTS2 is certainly not obscure in the Simming community, I'm not sure it's something of benefit to the general reading public. In addition, when the article was created by the website owner and approx. 25% of the edits were made by him, with another 25% or so being made by editors whose only contributions are in this article (realizing, of course, that some of these are may have been made by people who have since registered), I do wonder about <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. While this is somewhat to be expected of an article of this nature, the only main namespace article linking to this one (other than redirects) is the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sims_2_4964.html" title="The Sims 2">The Sims 2</a> article. As far as the Rolling Stones, etc., reference is concerned, I agree that a single off-handed mention does not constitute notability - it constitutes fortuitous coincidence. Out of curiosity, does anyone know if there was any significant increase in the hit count for MTS2 immediately following this mention? --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraindrain0000_a57c.html" title="User:Braindrain0000">Carl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraindrain0000_b3ff.html" title="User talk:Braindrain0000">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Braindrain0000_7580.html" title="Special:Contributions/Braindrain0000">contribs</a>)</sup> 03:55, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even if it was mentioned in a sentence in Rolling Stones, it is better then most websites featured on Wikipedia. Also, it was linked to from Attack of the Show.

<li>I do refer to the comment above: yes there are a lot of articles that need to be considered for deletion. However, this deletion is about MTS2: not the hundreds of other poorly-sourced, iffy articles on websites which need to be examined. "There are articles with more trivial sources than this one" is not a valid argument for keeping. Given the time and attention of dedicated editors and (hopefully) a new focus on quality over quantity by the wikipedia foundation, I hope they will be evaluated in due time and with due process. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 12:28, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A line must be drawn; when a site has been mentioned in two very reliable sources, it deservs a mention. I myself am an inclusionist (but I am sure you are aware of that fact). If articles are deleted on the grounds that they are "poorly-sourced", "iffy articles" etc. and are just deleted without having the chance to be buildt upon and improved. It's going to be very hard to get anything up on WP. This site is huge, it has been mentioned, and it deserves an article, period. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 12:59, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It <i>should</i> be "hard" to "get stuff up" on wikipedia (i.e. there should be standards); especially when it's a fansite. Collocating and merging such things will not harm wikipedia. If the site's included in a link in the main Sims 2 article, there would be nothing lost. The problem is that you a mistaking two mentions of a URL in the mass media as "sources". Have you read the sentence in Rolling Stone that you're calling a source? It's not even about the site; it's about Brokeback Mountain. The TV "source" is equally trivial. Read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> which states the inclusion guidelines for media sources. You're also mistaken in your assertation that just because a "site is huge" that it deserves an article. A site's traffic does not matter. That's not mentioned anywhere in any inclusion guideline. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 18:32, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A single sentance in the magazine is concidered a trivial source. The article must be a full length feature on just the site, so the Rollingstone article has been voided as a source. What is next? One mention in passing (which since I have the show tivoed, I can tell you it was about the same coverage the Rollingstone article had) on a TV show. Not Multiple sources. One very shakey one and one that doesn't qualify per wikipedia's own policy. It fails a major wikipedia pillar...<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.
