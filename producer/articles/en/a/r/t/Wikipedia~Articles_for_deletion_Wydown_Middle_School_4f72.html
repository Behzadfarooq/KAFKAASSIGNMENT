<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. Personally, I am more swayed by the delete opinions than the keeps; there are many award categories out there for schools to win, and the little notability it has would be better served in the school district article. However, by a simple count, the delete and keep counts are almost the same, and there are some valid points on the keep side. Having watched the "school debate", I feel that schools may be at the front line of incrementalist reform on Wikipedia... If said articles can be well-maintained and verifiable, I say, go for it. (That is a very big if, though.) This should be revisited in the future as the status of the school changes (which it probably will.) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 03:28, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. First of all, there is <b>absolutely no policy</b> that says that schools are inherently notable. Saying it repeatedly does not make it any more true than me saying I'm a millionaire until the bank decides to credit my account accordingly. Until there is any such policy on the issue, each school article ought to be judged on its own merits.
