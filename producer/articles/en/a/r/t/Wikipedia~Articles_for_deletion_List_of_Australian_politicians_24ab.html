<dd>That was me removing a red link to List of members of State and Territory parliaments that was created a month ago by moving one of the incomplete and unmaintained sublists out of this page. That article was deleted under the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} process as <i>Incomplete list of past and present members of eight different parliaments, 15 different houses, over 150 years for some of them. Better covered by categories like <a href="../../../m/e/m/Category%7EMembers_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly_31ed.html" title="Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly">Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly</a> and complete lists like <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly%2C_2005-2009_8b2e.html" title="Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 2005-2009">Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 2005-2009</a>. These appear to exist for each state.</i> It had 32 names on it. The reason it was split out a month ago was in response to {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} on this article - the only response was to split it into three incomplete lists and remove the template. It was given a month to get cleaned up. In the preceding 2½ years I count less than 5 constructive edits (all small) that were not disambiguating names already there. Over that period there were a number of elections, including at least 3 states and a federal one. That looks unmaintained to me. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 09:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Huh? There are about 400 stubs on Australian politicians; there are potentially thousands of individuals who have been politicians at the federal, state, and local levels in Australia. How do you propose that one could make a useful list that incorporates all those people.

<li>Huh? I can accept all keep arguments... except that one. The reason I did nominate it was since I saw it getting mentioned somewhere as going up for deletion, while it wasn't. So I finished the process. Now, though, I can't find that... personally I don't really care whether this remains or not.

The other edits split out List of former members of the Australian House of Representatives (50 names) and List of members of of State and Territory parliaments (32 names).

<li><b>Keep</b> for the reasons listed at the list of former politicians debate. These debates have got to stop; people should realise the potential of articles and do some work on them, rather than just deleting them because they can't be bothered maintaining them any more. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 00:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. List of notable people with potential to be useful.

<ul>
<li>If this article is kept or recreated, it should be made a list of complete lists for each of the 16 houses of state territory or federal parliament. Each of those should contain more than just names (e.g. dates, electorates, ministerial posts). I don't know if there's a guideline for whether they should be sorted alphabetically or by election date. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 09:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further comment</b> Since it looks likely thst this page might be kept, I have replaced the link to the recently deleted articles with a complete list of links to the lists of current members of each parliament. The page is still odd now as it has links to 15 lists of current members, and 15 links to people who were members of colonial parliaments over 100 years ago. Others are welcome to improve it by deleting my addition if it helps the project. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:33, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
