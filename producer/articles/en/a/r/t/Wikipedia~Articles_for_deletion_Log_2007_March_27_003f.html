<li><b>Merge</b> Sumarize, bring <i>some</i> of the verifiable material into an article that can provide context and counterpoints. If, ultimately, it's necessary to create a separate article about Gandhi's views on race, then spin it off into a more appropriately titled article such as "Gandhi's views on race." Be sure the context includes when and under what circumstances the statements were made, whether Gandhi's views changed through his life, and digest whatever published analysis and interpretation may exist, rather than providing bare context-free quotes selected to support a view of Gandhi as a racist. This <i>can</i> be improved.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 09:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC) P.S., the comment on "integrity" above is inappropriate. It's fair to assume we all have integrity, but there is a disagreement on whether this article meets Wikipedia policy and guidelines.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 09:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The statements are not context free. Gandhi's views - if they changed later- must only be known to him because he did not publicly distance himself from his views. Every date has been given along with a proper citation from The Collected Works of Gandhi. The only reason this is becoming an issue is because Gandhi is the world's holy cow... so much for objectivity and balance.</p>
<p>That said I am open to this article being redirected to "Gandhi's views on Race". <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeabing-Leigh_3d57.html" title="User:Teabing-Leigh">Teabing-Leigh</a> 09:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Also... on second thought .... the more I read such pages where certain ethnic and national groups gang up to cover up facts of history, I begin to question whether Wikipedia is all I thought it was... instead of being a bastion of all points of view coming together to create objective truth... it is more like George Orwell's "1984" with its newspeak and editing and rewriting and ofcourse DELETING ... no wonder racists and casteists become egalitarian mahatmas only 60 years after their death... <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeabing-Leigh_3d57.html" title="User:Teabing-Leigh">Teabing-Leigh</a> 09:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are pushing POV through exclusion of certain contextual facts. For example, 'Kaffir' was not the offensive term it is now in Ghandis time, which changes the context in which you claim he used the word. If your article was properly researched and sourced, this would have been readily apparant. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 14:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is just not true. First of all the word <b>Kaffir is NOT the issue here,</b> his view that black people were savages and subhuman that is the issue. If you feel that "Kaffir" was not an offensive term then please provide evidence. However the issue here is NOT about the term kaffir which in any case in the modern terminology means non-Muslim and nothing else and is not applicable to the usage of the word Kaffir then. Are you saying that believing black people were subhuman was not offensive then? You may argue that and then in that case produce evidence for it. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeabing-Leigh_3d57.html" title="User:Teabing-Leigh">Teabing-Leigh</a> 14:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Kinslayer: What PART of the word KAFFIR not being the issue did you not understand. <b>The issue is Gandhi's alleged estimate of blackpeople as subhuman.</b> As for consensus... there was a time when world over there was a consensus on Earth being flat... so what is your point?

The one reference of the Guardian is the closest thing that comes to actually <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributing</a> this article, but a single example of one group claiming Gandhi was a racist does not adequately source the article as a whole. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually I just looked it over before I made the previous comment. The comment still stands. You have 1 reliable secondary source of someone calling Gandhi a racist and then go into a discussion of things he said that were racist. Break that down into points and you get "This group said Gandhi was racist, look at all the things he said that were racist, ergo, here is Gandhi's racism for you to see". We <i>cannot</i> make that kind of leap of logic on Wikipedia articles. It is STILL original research. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> Gandhi's views on race are surely notable; the Guardian is a highly respected newspaper; the book cited is published by Prometheus Books which seems to be a respected publisher (doesn't mean the book is "right" but it's not a vanity publisher); I'm not sure if a speech in the House of Representatives is considered inherently notable but could be considered so.

<dd><b>Comment</b> as Mwelch mentions above, the creator has recently created dozens of articles, all of which appear from the tone to be cut-and-pasted from local newspapers, and most of which are egregious failures of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, eg the owner of a local lumber merchant. <font face="Trebuchet MS">- <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIridescenti_7b38.html" title="User talk:Iridescenti"><small><font color="chocolate"><i>(talk to me!)</i></font></small></a></font> 19:15, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that egregious is a bit of a strong term, and BIO is just a guideline, not firm policy. I don't think that this copyvio is likely to get us into trouble if we work to fix it soon. Has anyone contacted the writer to let him know about the WP guidelines and to help develop the article. As MacGyver mentions above, there might be some notability here. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 19:38, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the writer, <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Hathorn_ca3c.html" title="User:Billy Hathorn">Billy Hathorn</a>, has been contacted about notability issues, both on his talk page and in the deletion debates of the many articles he's had deleted. (Although he hasn't here, he frequently participates in those debates to defend his subject's notability, so he's definitely been advised of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> numerous times.) He often doesn't reply to such advice, though when he does, he's civil and respectful. In the end though, he just doesn't seem much concerned about <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability standards. (But then, the same can be said of many editors who self-identify as "inclusionists", so perhaps that's not such a big deal, even though the writer has not claimed that specific self-identification.) I'd speculate that he is content to continue creating biographical articles as he sees fit, and to just leave it up to the community to delete those that we see fit.</dd>
<dd>This is not the only article that the writer has created as pretty much a cut and paste from someone's newspaper obituary. I will say that I don't know if anyone's specifically mentioned the copyright violation angle of that to him, though. I definitely recall it being mentioned, once again, in the deletion debates of his articles, but that would be a good thing to bring up directly to him also.</dd>
<dd>Other problems with his work include frequent original research and dubious "references" to argue notability. For original research, he will include significant information and even quotations into his articles that he then sources in the "References" section to "e-mail exchange with Billy Hathorn" or "conversation between [Subject's name]'s wife and Billy Hathorn" or some such. I've deleted some of the worst examples of this in articles like <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_C._Strickland_65a8.html" title="Roy C. Strickland">Roy C. Strickland</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malouf_Abraham%2C_Jr._f1b1.html" title="Malouf Abraham, Jr.">Malouf Abraham, Jr.</a>, though there are others, and since he doesn't use in-line citations, I'm sure I didn't even get all of the OR even in those two articles — just the most obvious of it. To his credit, he hasn't fought me on it by trying to add the info back. For arguing notability, he will often add references that are not, in fact, references. If he reads in a subject's obituary, that the subject was, say, a member of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Computing_Machinery_25f4.html" title="Association of Computing Machinery">ACM</a> and <a href="../../../i/e/e/IEEE_472a.html" title="IEEE">IEEE</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html" title="PETA">PETA</a>, then he will list as his "references", a web link to the subject's obituary and web links to the ACM, IEEE and PETA web sites, and then argue that the subject was notable because his article has four different references listed to him.</dd>
<dd>So given the writer's history here, I'd be willing to wager that there isn't any "development" of the article that can really be done with actual <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>-acceptable sources. No problem if others wish to spend more time pursuing the subject's notability, though. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 21:53, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reading WP:BIO, no, we can't. A person's blog posts are not enough for an article: the article utterly fails the primary criterion, "A person is notable if he or she has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent, and independent of the subject." There are no secondary sources for him, only his comics (at best). --<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwern_64b9.html" title="User talk:Gwern">Gwern</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwern_077f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwern">(contribs)</a> 23:18 <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">27 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT)

<dd>P.S. let's just pin this down succinctly in one post. 1) Your objection to reliable sources: Poe is a reliable source about himself, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It is <i>ideal</i> to have secondary sources as well, but it is not <i>necessary</i>. (Even then, he <i>has</i> been interviewed a few times, so additional sources exist somewhere to make the article better) 2) Notability: his notability is established by his two webcomics, both of which are notable, and in particular one of which has won two <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_888a.html" title="Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards</a>.

<dd>If there exist independent sources from <i>reliable sources</i>, then add them to the article. Put up or shut up - lack of sources <i>is</i> a valid reason to delete an article. As for WP:BIO, I don't know why you think WCCA is is enough anyway: he's received the same barely notable award 3 times. This speaks more to the insularity of WCCA coverage and the webcomic authors who vote in it than to any impact on webcomics or notability. And he doesn't satisfy the primary criterion nor does he satisfy any of the "creative professionals" section (although perhaps calling him a creative professional is a bit generous, as he can't even make a living off <i>Errant Story</i>). --<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwern_64b9.html" title="User talk:Gwern">Gwern</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwern_077f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwern">(contribs)</a> 02:18 <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_28.html" title="March 28">28 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT)

<dd>It's contempt to point out that Poe can't make a living off his stuff (according to his blog, in which he mentioned back when he quit his job to work on <i>Errant Story</i> that he hoped his savings would take him to the point where ES could support him, and a more recent blog post in which he mentions that ES income is not proving to be sufficient - yes, I've been reading his stuff for a long time now.)? I don't believe it is.

<dd>Er... no. How on earth are you leaping to the conclusion that just because the WCCA was found to be somewhat notable, that comics winning any WCCA ever are automatically notable, and that even further, any author of those comics is notable as well? Notability is not some crazy <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transitive.html" title="Transitive">transitive</a> property where anything even remotely connected with some barely notable thing is itself notable. --<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwern_64b9.html" title="User talk:Gwern">Gwern</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwern_077f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwern">(contribs)</a> 02:18 <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_28.html" title="March 28">28 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT)

<dd>Not that it'll do any good arguing with you, but what the hell: "somewhat notable" is an understatement. Read the AfD; it is clearly established the WCCA is the <i>most</i> notable webcomics award out there. I can't think of any other webcomics awards featured in both the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Show_45ce.html" title="Attack of the Show">Attack of the Show</a></i>; can you? In this instance a WCCA win becomes somewhat "transitive", as you put it: winning multiple awards asserts notability of the comic, which in turn asserts notability to the author via <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s "significant critical attention" wording. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 02:45, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Not notable, though the Louisiana H.S. HOF makes it close. The author has a habit of creating articles about lots of "local legends." <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 03:22, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to be clear: he didn't make a HOF that represents the whole state of Louisiana. He attended a 1,000-student college named "Louisiana College". And he made <i>that school's</i> sports HOF. My high school was bigger than that, so I hope we're not saying everybody in their sports HOF (sadly, not including me) is near notable! &#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 03:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Notability rules: Athletes: 1)Competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming and tennis 2)Competitors who have played or competed at the highest level in amateur sports. 3)Competitors in college sports in the United States. It says nothing about the size of the college. So a college hall of fame does suffice. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Hathorn_ca3c.html" title="User:Billy Hathorn">Billy Hathorn</a> 23:12, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'd respectfully disagree. The notability guidelines you quote are intended to be (as the name indicates) guidelines to help one determine who is <i>likely</i> to have "a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them". As a general guideline, yes, there is a good deal of public interest and information about American college sports athletes. In the <i>specific</i> instance of athletes from Louisiana College in the 1950's, however, with all due respect to what I'm sure is a fine institution, no, I don't think there's much public interest or info about their athletes from that time. I could be wrong, though. If I am, feel free to cite the independent secondary sources which confirm this great interest. Currently, the article has none. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 23:47, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Billy, you have raised an interesting technical point. I don't think the intent was to literally include all possible colleges, and we'll have to find a more exact way to say so. The item is parallel to "fully professional league" and to "highest level"; the obvious meaning is major college sports--I think it would mean NCAA Division I, and Louisiana College is in division III. For High school coaches, I don't know what would be sufficient--maybe president of the state association? But I agree with MWelch-- any possible notability would come from that, not the college.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But in any case , the only RS you have is the College Hall of Fame record-- The others are a letter to you from his widow and his son, and a general reference to roots.com, from which it is possible to confirm that he is in their database--but what information they may have, I don't know for you didn't say. It would be justified with such dubious sourcing to ask you to document every fact in the article, for if it is kept, everything unsourced should be removed. And also everything unimportant. Not all parts of his life will be equally noteworthy.</dd>

<p>Unfortunately this article seems to be a pretty unsalvageable amalgam of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and the author's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> on what is and isn't "<a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth_subculture.html" title="Goth subculture">goth</a>", with no evidence that any of the named bands have ever been defined as or aspired to be "goth". It's borderline insulting to musicians and young people who don't meet the undefined "goth criteria" as judged by "most elder goths", and is full of vague statements and weasel words like "Some would say...", "it is widely believed" and "may have". This sort of musical genre definition is often rife with NPOV problems on Wikipedia, more so with goth music and culture.

<p>This is mostly a list of sketches featuring minstrels in British TV comedy shows, or actors who have worn convincing make-up to play black characters (in a respectful way). If this list was what the title implied, and detailed contemporary minstrel performers or those who use blackface, then it might cover a notable topic, but even then it would make more sense as a section of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">blackface</a>.

<p>An editor suggested I take this to AfD, so I am doing so. Without the irrelevant details about current faculty, this "article" consists of a one-line description. Without sources or claims to notability it appears to be unable to be expanded beyond this.

<p>An indiscriminate mix of "Official films of the Olympic Games" (which are notable) along with just about any film that features the Olympics or mentions the word "olympic", such as <i>The Year of the Sex Olympics</i>, <i>The M*A*S*H Olympics</i>, Hanna-Barbera's <i>Animalympics</i>, <i>Pink Panther in the Olym-pinks</i>, <i>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century Olympiad</i>. Also features the usual <i>Simpsons</i>/<i>Futurama</i> references, even though those aren't films. I did attempt to start to improve it, because I think there's a good list somewhere in all the clutter, but the article's creator doesn't appear to want any changes made. Without any improvements, it's just too indiscriminate. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroxley_5f28.html" title="User:Croxley">Croxley</a> 03:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as an indiscriminate list and directory with no clear criteria for inclusion. The list encompasses live-action films, animated films, live-action TV episodes and animated series, dealing with actual Olympics, fictional Olympics, things called "Olympics" which are not Olympics and anything that has "-lympics" in its name regardless of whether there is any actual relationship between the Olympics and the list item. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:37, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The rest of the page could conceivably be put into category namespace, as Category:Olympic films (per <a href="../../../o/l/y/Category%7EOlympic_video_games_560e.html" title="Category:Olympic video games">Category:Olympic video games</a>), although a clear separation between documentaries and fictional or fictionalized storylines would be nice. --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 08:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Clean-up</b> It seems like you're having a content dispute with the author's creator, but like <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_films_featuring_United_States_Marines_23b0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of films featuring United States Marines">The article about the Marines</a>, this subject is still able to be covered, so deletion is not the solution. Go to Dispute resolution instead. Talk to the user a bit more, try to persuade them. Using an AfD like this though? It's a bad idea.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I originally considered nominating this list last week, before I even made an edit to the article. Just because an editor reverted one small edit is not a reason for nominating, I think my other AFDs have demonstrated I understand perfectly what AFDs are for. If someone else had nominated this article, I would still vote for deletion. I believe it's little more than an Olympics in popular culture with a misleading title. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroxley_5f28.html" title="User:Croxley">Croxley</a> 21:51, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do not normally keep tabs on people, I honestly don't know whether or not you've nominated anything before at all. I can't recall your name ever coming to my attention. So I am considering this issue solely on your nomination here. The article is about a reasonably encyclopedic subject, both in the case of the individual films of the games, and an overall summary. Now certainly including every single little television episode or movie that features the Olympics in some way is probably not appropriate, and I'm undecided yet as to films like Cool Runnings and the like, but whatever the decision is, that's a content issue, not one as to the subject. Oh, and BTW, AfD is not a vote. You are taking a position, I have a position, others have their positions, but this isn't a vote. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Correct, this is not a "vote", but I was using the term to refer to my "recommendation". Admin sometimes use the word when closing AFDs as well. But you're quite right to point it out in case anyone else might think this is a ballot. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroxley_5f28.html" title="User:Croxley">Croxley</a> 06:10, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Using the word vote is sloppy, whether it's a user or an admin, sometimes that is excusable, but if nobody ever says "Hey, remember, this isn't a vote!" then people may be mislead. If you see any admins regularly using vote to describe their closings, I suggest advising them to avoid that language. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:53, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suppose the deletion of this "...in popular culture" article will raise a few eyebrows as this is among the most popular films of its time. However, let's look at this article and ponder: does it actually have any value? Is it anything else than an incomplete, unreferenced list of trivial information which in no way participates in an encyclopedic understanding of its subject. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 03:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This entire article could be summed up with a line or two, a paragraph at the outside ("The character of E.T., along with some of the characters' lines from the movie, make numerous minor appearances in fictional works"), <s>and a <i><b>incredibly limited</b></i> selection of "references" that are more important than ~10 second appearances or use of 4-or-less word lines from the movie (the use of ET as part of a road safety campaign <i>may</i> be one of these that make the cut)</s> could possible be <b>merged back</b> into the movie. In my personal opinion, the fact that things from the movie appear elsewhere is not necessary for an in-depth "spot the cliché" competition to be held here... anything more than acknowledging that such appearances exist would be sufficient (although I am open to the idea of expansion if some externaly verified, published, scholarly material on the subject can be found). -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 06:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The primary issue is not whether the article is promotional. That can be solved separately by just deleting the link and the reference to the blog. Instead I nominated this article for deletion because it does not appear to meet the requirements to be in an English language encyclopedia. The article states that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skapsis&amp;oldid=118235267#Other" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skapsis&amp;oldid=118235267#Other" rel="nofollow">all the possible sources</a> are in foreign languages (overlooking the fact that this blog is not in English either). Skapsis articles don't appear on either the <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skapsis" class="external text" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skapsis" rel="nofollow">Portuguese</a> or <a href="http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/Σκάψις" class="external text" title="http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/Σκάψις" rel="nofollow">Greek</a> Wikipedias. There's just one physical reference cited in the article and that's a book in Italian. If there are thousands of academics in English speaking countries studying and writing about ancient Greece, why haven't they written about the term? If they haven't seen fit to discuss it, then is this term notable? "Skapsis" is <a href="http://www.kypros.org/cgi-bin/lexicon/" class="external text" title="http://www.kypros.org/cgi-bin/lexicon/" rel="nofollow">not in the online ancient Greek lexicon</a> that I consulted. Most of the great ancient Greek texts are available on-line translated in English and if this really was a common concept in ancient Greece, then the article's creator should be able to cite the locations in these online texts where the idea is discussed -- both for us and for the readers.

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems pretty clear to me that the article was created purely to promote a blog. The connection between the Greek farming term and education appears to be pure original research.

<dd>Please try and be not so limited. Read what I have advised you to and you will see this is not a promoting article. That is all that I strugle against.</dd>
<dd>Have you seen the blog? You should, so you can be sure that none of the contraindications apply. I've read the links, and kepted them for me, so I can investigate them further, but I haven't found any real problem in the article. I agree that it may seem as an advertizing, but is not, and if there where to be more in the net about this word it would be there. I have searched. And I imagine that you have searched to without any luck. You think that the only occurrence of this word in the net, which is in no way any of the unadvised entries, sould be taken of?Sarasoar 01:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>But I can tell you more. I have just done this article because a lot of people complaint that they had no way to know what skapsis is in the maner that I did in the article. The blog is a philosophical and poeticaly artistic way of aproching the same subject. I would neve explain the meaning of skapsis there. You may consider this blog the exact happening os skapsis, is the propoer action I have described in the article taking place. Is the best example for the article, and the article is an instrument for those that what to know more about the word. To see an advertizing action is to see ambliopicaly, is compleatly equivocal. There is no motive. Tel me a reason for advertizing? If you woul know the content os the blog you would see tha this is the most outrageuos thing to say.Sarasoar 02:02, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Are you familiar with Gilles Deleuze? His book What is Phylosophy?, with his cowriter Félix Guattari. The last post of the blog, in which the article is mentioned, posts the end of the introduction that is a severe critic on marketing and universal capitalism, or professional comercial formation. This is our doom. Skapsis is all against the ideias that the article have been acused. And the article came out because in the making of the blog there was nothing about the subject. But you know this allready. Please read the introduction to this book, you will see the nonsense of the acusation. And it's very bad that someone may mix philosophy with marketing, but this is possible because marketing have tryed to be criator of concepts. So now all creation of concepts must confused with marketing or advertizing...?</dd>
<dd>I new that some blog readers might find the article to be an over flow of information that would diminish the poetical dimension of Skapsis, so I have done this last post exaclty to give the tools to understand waht realy is the reason behind the occurrence of the article. My doing of the artical is the first step of the concept age, the encyclopedia. So you probably won't find any artical to be most apropriate to be in an encyclopedia than this one about skapsis. Skapsis is almost the same as the action of encyclopeding, and the mention of the blog is essential to give a dimention to it, it's to bad you can't read Portuguese.</dd>
<dd>All this was very sucsseful: The article is the first age of the concept: the encyclopedia, the blog is the second age of the concept: the pedagogy, and the atacks the article has recived show the presence of the fear for something that is very bad, which is the third age (and fake) of the conept: marketing. This last way of the concept is all that I want to see away from me or from the blog, the most as possible. That is why I have erased immidiatly the acusation from the artical itself.&#160;:If I would be doing what as been injustly said it would be the same as destroying the pupose of the blog, which is much more important than the article. The seconde age of concept, pedagogy, is the most importante of them all.</dd>
<dd>Please read the introduction to book that is referenced above. Only then you will see the nonsense of acusing this article to be advertizing.Sarasoar 02:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sometimes occurres that a fear for something to come arround brings the fealing for that. Only you, that are policiating the Wikipedia, would see advertizing or in any way a promoting action facking to be an article. But this is much more than an article, this is the product of the encyclopedia it self looking into the pedagogy being born. Encyclopedia has a bit dificulty in understanding pedagogy, so it tries to explain what is inexplainable. Al exlanation creates the ilusion of understanding, but the only understanding possible comes with pedagogy, the living of the concept. If you read about you don't know, you just think you do; you only know in your one experience and only if you are well advised, which is the function of pedagogy, to guide through the processe of empirical knowledge.</dd>
<dd>If something was not fully explained please ask for more. If this was a bore the fault is yours, you must go into philosophy so to understand the ofense of this acusation. It would even be a reason for processing the acusator. It not only is nonsense but more gravely is difamation.<i>"89.155.26.189 11:09, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd>ElKevbo, if you realy what to see references that prove all the article says just go and confirm it with the Franco Montinari Greek Vocabolary, the only reference I know to provide this information. I have said this before, but you seam to ignore what I say. The contection bettween agriculture and education is contemporary to Ancient Greece. I realy don't understando wy you act like this if you dindn´t even made an efort to understand what I say. <b>There is no source for skapsis in the internet</b>, the blog is the only source. Can you understand this? And can you understand that this article would never work as a promotion for the blog? Ask a portuguese reader to tell you all about it, and read the introduction to <i>Waht is Philosophy?</i> of Gilles Deleuze, which is the post that redirects here. I you are capable of understanding philosophy you will see that your worries are pointing to the wrong direction. This is becaming extreemly ofensive!89.155.26.189 11:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Is it possible for you to get out of the virtual world and veryfy a more that reliable sorce as the vocabolary I've mentioned? And that would involve providing multiple, reliable sources that meet the non-negotiable requirements of WP:V and WP:NOR. This Vocabolary is more that enough. I can't understant wy you steel complain? If every time that a subject is not verifyable in the net would be deleted thaere wuold be no Wikipedia for starting.

Or you know about it or you don't, and if you know you must show from where, which is what I did in the first place. Vulgar dictionaries may not copmly to the requirments, but this kind of vocabolary dose. I'v used it in major academic works, and it is beeing used all over the academic woeld.

<dd>Any way, this continuos nonsense is descrediting wiki and because of that I to move the article for deletion, and if possible, all delition of any of my editing in this place.

<li><b>Keep</b> I really don't see why this article should be deleted. I know at least a dozen people that know what a Rudy Cosby is. I don't know who started it, but I think it makes for a funny story and a good evening. I have been to a bar in Winston-Salem, NC (6th and Vine Wine Bar) that had a Rudy Cosby as a drink special. Maybe it's an obscure / regional thing, but that doesn't mean it should be deleted. I thought the whole point of wikipedia was to expand the communities base of knowledge. P.S. - It's actually delicious. ramsta3 18:30, 27 March 2007 (EST)

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe that this article should remain posted. Although the drink may make some feel "ill" or say "yuck", it is no different from drinks with other names that are somewhat disturbing: blow job shots, sex on the beach, sloe comfortable screw, hairy virgin, moosemilk, one balled dictator, hairy navel, etc. It is a good drink and deserves a place with all the other cocktails of its kind.

<p>Original prod reason: Not every episode of every show needs an article on Wikipedia. This is one such example; this episode didn't do anything notable for television, for the series, or for the characters in the series.</p>
<p>{{prod}} removed by <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">User:Neier</a> with the comment "remove prod from a single article within a larger series of articles".</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Episode articles for very notable series are encyclopedic. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> is right in a way; it seems pointless to AfD a single episode article when there are another 49 for this series. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 08:18, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

We can't; it's not a requirement to submit AfDs in a batch (in fact, they group AfDs are rarely successful for anyone involved).

<li>What I've <i>absurdly</i> assumed is that the deletion of one article from a series is not non-controversial, and should be discussed first. Clearly, from the comments below, it is not a non-controversial deletion. As for the ability to nominate multiple articles at once, that is also not without precedent; but, it is also irrelevant to whether the deletion of this article is merited or not. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have trouble believing that all episodes of any TV program are inherenly notable - I can see that the "Who Shot JR?" episode of Dallas, or the final episode of M*A*S*H* etc. would be, but not run-of -the-mill episodes. However, I accept that I am against the consensus in this. For this one, however, it needs at least a rename from "SATC episode" (I had to look it up) to "Sex and the City episode". And, opening up another can of worms, is "Sex and the City" really THAT notable?- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 11:29, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> lots of precedent exists for episodes of notable TV series, and <i>Sex and the City</i> is extremely notable, influential, and high-rated. Deprodding was correct, as deletion would have resulted in a "hole" in an otherwise-complete series of articles. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:36, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This AfD is about this episode, not the series -- I'm not sure why you're making remarks about the series. Assuming that the precedent is correct is fallacy. This article establishes no level of influence for this episode within any circle of influence -- even limited to the characters on the show. What would that "hole" leave? There's really zero information here, and apparently very little to say about this mundane episode. While high-ratings are nice for the producers and advertisers, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">popularity does not confer notability</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 13:51, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, this is a highly notable TV series, and this may be a major episode in the series, but most of the information is covered at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sex_and_the_City_episodes_86fb.html#Season_2:_June_1999_-_October_1999" title="List of Sex and the City episodes">List of Sex and the City episodes#Season 2: June 1999 - October 1999</a> - all except for the quote. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 15:48, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think having individual episode pages for every episode of a notable series is appropriate, and is a case where keeping the fact that <a href="../../../p/a/p/WP%7EPAPER_01fc.html" title="WP:PAPER">Wikipedia is not paper</a> in mind is vital. The simplest way to have reasonable coverage of a show's plot is to have an article for each episode -- an attempt to consolidate all episodes for a series into a single article is likely to result in a large, unwieldy article that makes it difficult to find desired information. Having a single article also opens the door for all sorts of arguments about what is sufficiently important to include in the article, and only having articles for "important" episodes will lead similarly to constant arguments as to what constitutes an important episode. Separate articles for every episode ensure that there's a specific place for any information about the plot of the show, allow someone typing in an episode title to go directly to the information they're looking for, and provide a way to navigate through the history of a show. Yes, this may result in the occasional permanently stub-sized article about an unexciting episode, but not having every article would leave a disconcerting gap for anyone trying to read through the story of a show, and undoubtedly result in repeated re-creation of the missing article. We're certainly always going to have at least a redirect for any episode, so why not, since space is not a concern, improve the usability and informativeness of Wikipedia by having a short article to host basic episode-specific and navigation information (previous/next episodes, guest stars/writer/director) instead of a redirect that provides nothing? <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 16:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b>. How did you arrive at the conclusion that an article per episode is the simplest approach? It sounds to me that it's far more tedious and complicated than having a single article that explains everything you need in one spot, and allows convenient editing without sequence boxes, info boxes, and replicated headers, intros, and references. Meanwhile, let's stipulate you're correct. The problem still remains that this episode hasn't demonstrated any influence on the show's story line. Or are you prepared to explain (specifically and with references!) how Samantha's size queenism influences the outcome of the season finale? -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 02:49, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, having all the information in one page would be simpler in the sense that it would eliminate all the duplication of the boxes/headers/intros of having a page per episode. The reason that I came to the conclusion that separate pages was overall a simpler solution, though, is that I think the overhead of separate pages is worth it to avoid both the unwieldy size of a combined page and the inevitable edit wars that would occur over such a page. Separate articles leave plenty of room for each episode to have a reasonable amount of coverage without making it hard to find the information you're looking for or inspiring arguments about which episode is worthy of a longer description in a long, crowded page. I can see that for some lesser-known/shorter series, where there's not that much information, a single page (or pages by season) could work. For an extremely popular series like this, though, there will invariably be many episodes that people think are worthy of their own pages, and having only some episodes leads to the problems I mentioned before: subjective arguments about which episodes are sufficiently important for pages and a confusing style for readers, who would have to switch back and forth between hunting through a long page and reading individual pages to get all the information about a show. I'm not actually attempting to provide any rationale for this particular episode being special in any way, and that's part of my point, which is that even if some episodes are less than thrilling, it's to the benefit of both readers and editors to have pages for all episodes. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 18:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strongly disagree</b> - each subject of an article should be notable. If one or more episodes of any series don't meet the criteria, it/they should not have their own article. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 18:46, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> SATC had a much bigger audience than <i>Star Trek</i>, and imagine the uproar if we started deleting "Trek" episodes.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The reason the Trekkies would get mad about their articles being deleted is that they've actually done the work to show why the episodes are meaningful. The ST:OS episodes I spot-checked were all articles with good analysis and references. The article that I've nominated has only three sentences, one of which is a quote from the show. For something so notable, it's quite amazing that nobody, over the last 8 years (nearly) has found the time to write up a paragraph or two about it. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 02:41, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and merge the content to the appropriate article about SATC. There is no question of SATC's notability; however, this particular episode does not demonstrate any notability on its own. I would change my mind about this if it could be shown that this particular episode created memes or references that became cultural icons, but I don't see any veriable sources in the article to illustrate this. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 18:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - You cannot vote "Keep" on your own articles. Conflict of interest aside, you seem to be confusing the TWiT podcast with the article on someone who has merely appeared on TWiT. Furthermore, the podcast was released on Sunday and it is disingenuous of you to suggest otherwise. TikiBar TV has its own page already.

<li>Actually, you <i>can</i> vote "keep" on your own articles, and people often do. There's certainly no need to be rude about it.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article has been on my radar for some time. In addition to the article format, it does in fact appear to be a non-notable comic only published by a genre vanity press. I'm not throughly familiar with the genre though so if some realiable sources emerge from other editors that can <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> I could be swayed.

Some reliable secondary sources on the subject could change my vote as well, printed material tends to get a little leeway per <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> but it needs to satisfy criteria. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:39, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Probably due to the large internet presence.

Right now the article fails the fundemental <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribution policy</a> and seems to be a amateur comic published by an amateur vanity press (the APA). Still, it makes three claims of notability: It's vast list of contributors, it's impact on the genre and its uninterrupted 24 year run (a long run for <i>any</i> comic). If <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> can be found to support these claims then I would say it be kept on the grounds that it is a notable comic <i>within</i> the furry community even if not the mainstream. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 13:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- I personally think that Jim Jones, L. Ron Hubbard, and Alistair Crowley were all whack jobs, but that doesn't mean they aren't notable. Also, unlike the first two, the CoS is not a cult and does not function like one. Furthermore, the CoS does not give out its actual membership numbers so there's no saying that its a tiny cult. And finally, yes, if you could get 10,000 people to join your group, you'd be worth noting.</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The author provided by e-mail scans of covers of three Devanagari books, one article in a newspaper (in Devanagari) about the guy and two ISBNs of his books. The author claims that the publishers of the books are well known in India and not vanities. Since I do not Devanagari and pretty ignorant about India's publishers I cannot independently verify the provided info. I would rather see the information added to the articles and verified by some Devanagari-speaking wikipedian, but I am withdrawing my Delete voice.

The rest of the text talks about the function (many students and professors were present, professors/principal expressed their views on the book etc.) I've some knowledge of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_literature.html" title="Marathi literature">Marathi literature</a>, and I've not heard of Sharad Raghav Rane before.

<p>There seems to have been a malformed and aborted AfD on this previously <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Religious_democracy_4793.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Religious democracy">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Religious democracy</a>, and an old mediation cabal case <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2007-01-11_Islamic_democracy_cf6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2007-01-11 Islamic democracy">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2007-01-11 Islamic democracy</a>.</p>
<p>This article is essentially an essay - one could start with the phrase "religious democracy" and go off in any number of directions as an essayist. In this case three of the four sources for the first two sections seem to indicate the author is trying to discuss or generalize some sort of Iranian context of religioius democracy (although this is not mentioned in the text). The existing <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_democracy.html" title="Islamic democracy">Islamic democracy</a> article has an "Iran" section which would seem the natural home if this is the case. One could point out a number of opinions, unsourced assertions, mangled writing, etc. - the article seems to have originated as a redirect to Khatami-ism, then to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_democracy_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Religious democracy (disambiguation)">Religious democracy (disambiguation)</a>, with the existing text being the remnant of a larger insertion by <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarhoudk_598d.html" title="User:Farhoudk">User:Farhoudk</a>. The AfD and mediation would seem to suggest this is some sort of POV fork, but frankly the whole history is so convoluted it is hard to tell.</p>
<p>The "American" section seems to have been bolted on later, begins with an odd and certainly untrue assertion ("term 'American Religious Democracy' first used by Bruce Ledewitz"; Google search showing many other uses <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22religious+democracy%22+american+-ledewitz&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22religious+democracy%22+american+-ledewitz&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and proceeds to copyvio the blurb for the book (<a href="http://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336/0275994600" class="external autonumber" title="http://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336/0275994600" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, published 2007). <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 08:27, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - There are a couple of problems with this. The first is whether there is some sort of existing core usage of the phrase "religious democracy" that an article can be built around, as opposed to a number of varying usages of what is going to be a likely phrase for those writing about the combination of "religion" and "democracy". As a parallel example, the phrase "economic democracy" is the title of a book by <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_credit.html" title="Social credit">Social credit</a> theorist <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._H._Douglas_6665.html" title="C. H. Douglas">C. H. Douglas</a>, a fairly common term in 19th century leftist/Marxist writings, a market socialism theory of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Schweickart_3627.html" title="David Schweickart">David Schweickart</a>, a somewhat crankish usage by <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._W._Smith_544e.html" title="J. W. Smith">J. W. Smith</a>, etc. None of these would fit together in anything other than the most general umbrella article or disambiguation page, certainly not one that began "Economic democracy <i>is</i>". I suspect "religious democracy" is something similar - the copyvio paste job and "first used by Bruce Ledewitz" howler certainly gives one no confidence that the article's proponent is reporting and existing a discrete concept and not some particular synthesis of their own.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is another one of these "I want to comment on government so I'll invent a new term" articles. Democracy isn't a word like "nice" that can be applied to whatever you want it to mean, it is a very specific term deriving from the Greek demokratia (people-power). It literally means ordinary people sitting in government. The article is not about democracy (either in the strict or "nice governemtn" sense) and its relationship to religion, it is not about democracy in a religious state (which might both be worthy of inclusion) nor is it about a specific term in frequent use. It therefore is simply original research and should be deleted. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 23:24, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Good references, legitimate subject. As a term may not be scattered all over New York Times and Fox News, but still exists and is used in academic circles.

<p>This subject is not-notable. A <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jack_Schaap_3fb7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jack Schaap">previous AfD</a> on the article (then under the title <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Schaap_ae27.html" title="Jack Schaap">Jack Schaap</a> reached no consensus - but no-one was strongly arguing for notability. After <a href="../../../o/t/r/WP%7EOTRS_ffb6.html" title="WP:OTRS">WP:OTRS</a> complaints from the subject, stating the article was unfair and requesting deletion, two OTRS ops deleted it as an A7. However, it has now been recreated, so I'm bringing it here for community permission to delete.</p>
<p>Let me be clear the <b>primary reason</b> for requesting deletion is the non(or marginal) notability of the subject - the <b>contributing factor</b> is the OTRS request.

<li><b>delete</b> The only item of notability is the confessions, and that is not sourced well enough for BLP,and is furthermore only tangentially related to him. For a man of religion to persuade a sinner to confess is--I would assume--not notable. Otherwise he is no more notable than all the other ministers with DDs from the same unaccredited school. Attending an unaccredited religious college is not exactly notable.

<li>Having said that, the "list of skits" might have been completely made up, as it didn't have anything to do with the description at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Robot_Chicken_episodes_bfaa.html" title="List of Robot Chicken episodes">List of Robot Chicken episodes</a>.

<li>I see you've cleaned it up, SpuriousQ. Thanks for the effort. Now it's a question of whether this particular episode is notable enough for inclusion, and I am leaning towards "no". --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 16:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Right. I tend to think that episodes of notable shows are notable, but I also tend to think it hardly matters if this little stub stays or goes. Normally I would prefer that someone knowledgeable to start off such an article, but now that it's here, I say <b>Keep</b> and hope it will eventually grow in the organic wiki-way. If anyone's interested in expanding it, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Robot_Chicken_episodes_bfaa.html" title="List of Robot Chicken episodes">List of Robot Chicken episodes</a> has a link to an official site supposedly with episode summaries and probably credits, but that site pissed me off too much with impossible navigation that I could no longer continue. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESpuriousQ_b285.html" title="User talk:SpuriousQ">talk</a>) 20:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The sole text of the article is <i>"Terbium(III) oxide (Tb2O3) is an inorganic chemical compound"</i>, and a template giving such things as density and melting point. It has had an "explain importance" tag since last June. Since we generally delete articles like 574839457 (number), I'm not at all convinced that we should have articles on every single chemical compound either considering there's technically an infinite amount of them; <a href="../../../i/n/f/WP%7EINF_7259.html" title="WP:INF">Wikipedia is not infinite</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 09:21, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, This compound is used in light emitters, as in e.g. Tb:YAG (see <a href="../../../y/t/t/Yttrium_aluminium_garnet.html" title="Yttrium aluminium garnet">yttrium aluminium garnet</a>. Furthermore it is used in magneto-optical recording films. As an oxide of a metal, it is a probable starting point for chemical synthesis of terbium compounds (which often start either from the oxide or from the chloride). As such, notable enough, but unfortunately the document does not state that yet. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 13:32, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've also found some articles in the scientific literature about terbium oxide nanoparticles and nanotubes, which seem to be of current interest, as well as some mention here and there about uses for various materials and catalysts. There are also several suppliers selling it, which also suggests that it may be useful for something, unlike the number 574839457.&#160;:-) The subject is notable enough IMO, it's just that the article is not there yet.

The topic of "breaking the fourth wall" is encyclopaedic, and discussed at <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>. Undoubtedly that topic is well served by including some examples. But... Is this list, which is made up of notable examples of drmatic irony intermingled with things that some editor thinks are significant examples of breaking the fourth wall, but in many cases lack a source to support the latter let alone the former, the way to achive that? At the last AfD A Man In Black suggested merging the truly notable examples (maybe those that are cited in standard texts as notable examples) into <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>; this would get rid of the unreferenced and in some cases blatantly promotional and/or original research, which would be fine, and that is an editorial decision. However, this is a biggish decision (the list has been around for a while) so I bring it here for more input. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:38, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as an indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture every instance of a character's breaking the fourth wall or every instance that in the unsourced POV/OR opinion of a random editor appears to be breaking the fourth wall with no regard to the importance or unimportance of the breakage. Trivia magnet. <b>Oppose</b> merging any of the content into <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> as it will invite editors to post their own pet examples, leading to another mass of trivia which will throw that article completely out of balance.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Okay, I can see the point of some of the keep&#160;!votes in the prior AfD, in saying that having <i>some</i> examples of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> being broken is appropriate to the subject. However I feel that adequate examples are given over the course of that article, and creating an indiscriminate list of every time it happens is going way overboard. No need to keep, and no need to merge it back in to the parent article and just clutter it up. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:46, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia has recently started some kind of adversion to popular culture lists. I agree with the deletion of List of signature phrases and List of sets of unrelated songs with identical titles as their contents were, in fact, completely trivial and of no actual use.

The article has been edited some 1470 times since then, which works out to over three changes a day. This article is a fancruft magnet, and indeed in the last RfD one of the participants indicated that as part of its intent. It's all <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> anyway, as evidenced by the total lack of any citations <i>stating</i> that what goes on in any of these works does in fact break the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>. It's just a lot of editors, on their own authority, saying that what goes on in such and such a show/film/game/whatever fits the definition. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 19:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't understand what you mean. It should be obvious that a character in fiction admitting he/she is in fiction constitutes breaking the fourth wall. Therefore, it is the same as citing that the act breaks the fourth wall. It does not cite the act actually happened, but for that, we would need to be able to cite every act in fiction, which would require us to reference the actual works, which are under copyright, and often very carefully guarded. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 20:00, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, the article <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> <i>itself</i> lacks any citations, so a reasonable person (or a wikipedia attribution stickler) could object that it cannot be used as a basis for "obvious" identification of examples. I personally think the application of the term to video games is questionable, since by their nature they require interaction with the "audience". One might also ask whether interaction with the audience as if they were part of the fiction qualifies. The point is not that we can't say what happens in the film/etc., but that we can't be sure that a theater professional/critic would so identify it. And if it <i>is</i> so obvious, then it's hard to see why we should need what is turning into an exhaustive list. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 21:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In video games, there is a distinction between the game play and the game's plot. Of course in <i>Pac-Man</i> there is no plot to speak of, so therefore no fourth wall. But the situation is different in more complex games. The best examples are adventure games. What you are doing is moving a mouse cursor around and making an on-screen sprite travel to where you clicked. What you are pretending to do is saving a princess from an evil dragon, going undercover to foil a terrorist organisation's plot, or captaining a starship in an interstellar war. A notice popping up saying "Please insert disk 2" is not breaking the fourth wall. The beautiful princess asking "Weren't you the one who saved me in the last game? You looked much more pixellated then." is. In contrast to the good old days, when a 20-year-old could write a well-selling platformer in his bedroom in a week, nowadays when games have enough scriptwriting and real-life acting to be small movies, the element of the plot is even more important. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 17:54, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, but cleanup and prune</b> the list. I've already suggested guidelines on the Talk pages for determining <i>what</i> should be listed (agreeing that the fourth wall is a very common device and that alone is <i>not</i> discriminating enough for a good list article).

I'm for pruning out all trivial examples from the list to leave just a manageable sum of <i>good</i> entries demonstrating <i>specific</i> instances of breaking the fourth wall, and if we can merely restrict the list to that (citing where possible) and monitor the itemcreep, then we should be able to <b>merge</b> the sublists back to the main list, and that is enough. --<i><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStratadrake_113f.html" title="User:Stratadrake">Stratadrake</a> 02:44, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>

<p>Nominated for process - this was previously listed for speedy deletion under db-bio. I have untagged it for speedy as this is clearly inappropriate in this case, since the article clearly <i>asserts</i> notability as both a singer, writer and politician. The article was also tagged as unreferenced, which seems a little unfair as there were quite a number of references - just not correctly added. I've tidied up the "references" section (slightly) as the same time to make it clearer.</p>
<p>There does seem to be confusion over the spelling of his name, with four different spellings used in the article alone - I recognise that this is due to transliteration from a non-Roman alphabet, but if the&#160;!vote results in keep a number of redirects will need to be set up. I've not yet done this as it will just mean more work for the closing admin if there's a Delete result.</p>

<p>Mr Kinslayer whats that- some sort of Orwellian newspeak from 1984? The whole masquerade seems increasingly like a scene out of 1984 and "Ingsoc". 202.163.67.241 13:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

All I see is a certain kind of "contributor" has ganged up on this article, even though the article DOES NOT push a POV ... simply highlights an allegation- sourced and historically verified- against a figure in human history who is no doubt an icon. Icons need to be investigated. If people think this is NOT sufficiently balanced, what is stopping them from contributing and changing it or its different version i.e. Gandhi's views on race. I agree that the name Gandhi's racism is not balanced and am open to name changes but there is absolutely no need to delete an article which quotes very valid sources like COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI. On other articles, we've seen one sided newspaper editorials being quoted as "sources". My fervent appeal to you is do the right thing. Don't delete it and prove that this Wikipedia thing is some sort of Orwellian experiment akin to 1984. Let the facts come out.

<b>Comment</b> Some of the language is mildly POV tainted, but that's easily fixed. The biggest problem is that it is original research. It cites text of Ghandi and makes arguements based on this primary source. That's OR, even if it accurately reflects the primary source. I also think that it is in some ways well done, interesting and deserving of encyclopedic treatment. It includes some "Further Reading" articles and sources. Can these be used as sources? Can the contributors remove the carefully referenced primary sources and tie the argument to the scholarly or journalistic secondary sources? Make the Collected Works "Further Reading." If so this article has merit.

<li><b>Partial merge</b>. The fact of the matter (as has been documented well on <i>one</i> side in this article) is that Ghandi spoke/wrote inconsistently with regard to his views of black African people. At times, his references were complimentary and as brethren in a struggle, and at other times, as this article documents, his references were decidedly <i>not</i> so. Currently, the <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghandi.html" title="Ghandi">Ghandi</a> article itself barely touches this. It mentions that some have seen his use of "kaffir" as a sign of racism, but then explains that it's possible he used the word in its non-racist connotation. But there is more to the issue (both in arguing for racism and in arguing aginst it) than with which connatation he used the word "kaffir". Certainly this article has unacceptable problems with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:AWW</a>. But given the sourcing, if the entirety of the issue were given a fuller treatment than currently found in the Ghandi article, it seems as though this article here has some of the basic raw material that would go in <i>one</i> side of that treatment. Of course, the other side and its correpsonding quotes from Ghandi would need to be present, also. The Ghandi article is already fairly long, so in fact, that might even be an argument to <b>keep</b> this as a separate article under its current title, though with <b><i>substantial</i> revision</b> to make it balanced, of course.<a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 02:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>MWelch, I agree with most of what you say. However, I wish to point out that the term Kaffir was not even the issue. It was a generic term for black people. It is Gandhi's view that Kaffirs were off inferior genetic stock that is at issue here. 202.163.67.241 05:31, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that is my point: that <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghandi.html" title="Ghandi">main article about Ghandi</a> barely mentions this issue, and to the extent it does mention it, it <i>does</i> treat it as though the word "kaffir" is the only issue. That is why I feel the coverage of this issue in <i>that</i> article is inadequate — because there is much more to this issue than worrying about just the use of that word. So I'd hope there would be some way to use what's in <i>this</i> article to treat the issue more substantively, rather than having to just throw the whole thing out. I agree that the this article as it stands is badly flawed, and I'd agree that throwing it out would be better than letting remain as is. But I'd like to think there could be a third alternative better than either of those options. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 07:31, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Dear Mwelch, as per your excellent suggestions, I have made substantial changes to this article. Please review and advise.... <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeabing-Leigh_3d57.html" title="User:Teabing-Leigh">Teabing-Leigh</a> 14:12, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. First of all, thank you for being receptive to the criticism about the article. Under the principle of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, it certainly seems to me that you are reading what others have to say and making an honest attempt at improvement. Even though the creation of the article under this title has been criticized in the above discussion as an attempt to "head off" the other deletion, it's at least worthy of note that you appear to have made that move in direct response to the specific suggestion offered in the other debate that you do exactly that. So please know that your efforts to bring things into line are appreciated.</dd>
<dd>With regard to the article as it stands however, the single greatest problem is a woeful lack of balance. Right now it's basically a collection of quotations that support the idea that Ghandi was racist. Even with the excellent sources, simply stringing together a list of such quotes violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in that it's still pushing a particular point of view. If you review sections such as "Undue weight", "Fairness of tone" and "Balancing differing views" in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, you may begin to get a better sense of the fact that something can be 100% and indisputably factual, yet <i>still</i> be very much in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</dd>
<dd>As I noted above, there are also <i>other</i> quotes from Ghandi that in which he is quite complimentary of black Africans. One quote, in particular (and I'm afraid I don't recall off the top of my headwhere the specific reference can be found) that comes to mind is where he said of black Africans something like "You call them noble savages. Noble they are, but savages they are not." That's definitely <i>not</i> an exact quote, as I'm operating strictly from memory here, but it is an accurate paraphrase. And my point is that <i>any article trying to delve into this issue <b>must</b> include that kind of material also.</i> Just as thoroughly, meticulously and accurately researched as is your current material. There is just no way around that. There are some other points of conention in the article as it stands right now, also, but this is the primary one that (in my opinion) would have to be addressed, and addressed well, before it becomes worthwhile to start going into the specifics of the others. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 21:17, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> Dear Mwelch, Please advise me as to where I can find a citation for the said quote.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see you found it yourself. Once again, I thank you for another show of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>. You do seem to be genuinely trying. What I'd advise you to do now is take advantage of the fact that there's no time deadline on this. Don't worry too much about trying to save the article from deletion right now. Wikipedia has had inadequate coverage of this issue for this long; it's not going to be a disaster for it to go another week or two weeks, another month or two months. In anticipation of the fact that this AFD debate may not turn out in your favor, perhaps you might want to copy the page into your own user space and make it a work in progress. Then you can have the time to continue to work on it to round it into shape. Find other sources like the one you just sought out that give the view more balance. And just as importantly, let the reputable and scholarly sources you find (on both sides) provide the analysis. That's what other editors are referring to when they correctly point out that the article currently has original research problems. You have excellent sourcing on the quotes themselves, and that is good. But <i><b>you</b></i> are basically the one providing whatever analysis there is of those quotes . . . and that's not really acceptable. You need to let your reputable, published sources do that for you (again remembering to always remain mindful of the "undue weight" and "fairness of tone" issues discussed in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>). For ideas on how to write more in that style, you might want to look at Wikipedia's featured article list and see if you can find one about an inherently controversial topic. If it has attained featured article status, then you know other editors have approved of the way the both sides (or the multiple sides) of the issue are presented and balanced. Look to get your article written in a similar style. Be in no hurry. Really take the time necessary to get it right. And then, once you've gotten it that way, you can look to re-introduce the topic to Wikipedia with a <i>much</i> better article. We'll all still be here. 8-) <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 08:16, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear mwelch, as with your other suggestions, I have taken note of these ones as well. Having looked at various featured articles and other content, I am frankly stumped. Many of them are much more POV than this article in my view. Furthermore, nothing in the article is my own analysis. Several books by very respectable publishers have come out on this issue and I have regurgitated their point of view. As the article stands now, I don't see any POV especially after the incorporation of the counterview. About the debate, I didn't know this is a vote... in which we might as well fold this up and stop wasting our time... I mean when there was a consensus on the planet that the earth is flat... what could anyone have done? <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeabing-Leigh_3d57.html" title="User:Teabing-Leigh">Teabing-Leigh</a> 15:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is confusing. "Admins have <b>removed notable information???</b>" To what purpose? Upon perusing the history log, fluff was removed from the article, NOT notable content. As for <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, how does that relate to this article? The company apparently has a rather interesting technology known as <b>Hypercable</b>; I suspect including <a href="http://www.mds.fr/products_all/hyc_intro.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mds.fr/products_all/hyc_intro.htm" rel="nofollow">material</a> on this alone would suffice for notability. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarktica_9e48.html" title="User:Aarktica">Aarktica</a> 14:00, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do not agree. This company helped to found an industry not only with Equipment but with legal challenges and then by being prohibited from US sales and imports by a US Federal Court. Why is that FLUFF? Without the "fluff," this "company," now a shell, is not notable. Your link is to marketing material, not a report from a customer or press. Are you familiar with this technology? As well, the inventor of the "technology" left the company due to the "fluff." If the technology is Notable, why is the exit of the inventor, not notable? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardOfWor_fd3d.html" title="User:WizardOfWor">WizardOfWor</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/z/User_talk%7EWizardOfWor_e90c.html" title="User talk:WizardOfWor">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WizardOfWor_8da7.html" title="Special:Contributions/WizardOfWor">contribs</a>) 2007-03-27 15:19:15 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>This is mainly a dictionary definition, I think. It's hard to tell because I'm not quite sure what it's saying. AFAIK, it's not an official legal phrase. Google shows only about 83 results for the phrase. If the article is about the victim getting some kind of compensation then I think it should be <b>delete</b>d, renamed, and rewritten in a more systematic way.

<li><b>Delete</b>. We could possibly recreate a more comprehensible version and maybe under a different name. I'm not exactly sure what the article is saying. Victim's compensation exists, usually through government subsidization, and several articles exist on wikipedia about specific agencies for compensation, but victim retribution? Wouldn't that also cover punishments such as jail and community service (if it is the proper name for it)? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 13:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> So, what's wrong with just listing everyone who has appeared on the cover? "Rolling Stone" seems to have some particular notability, which explains why out of all the magazines who have ever ranked songs or albums, this is the publication with actual Wikipedia articles for these lists. (See: <a href="../../../5/0/0/500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time_682c.html" title="500 Greatest Songs of All Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a> and <a href="../../../5/0/0/500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time_ec42.html" title="500 Greatest Albums of All Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>.) So it is obviously a distinct magazine, and so deserves more recognition on the site. I think listing those who have appeared on the cover is a good accomplice to the actual <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a> article, or maybe instead of deleting this article, merge them together. <a href="../../../2/p/a/User%7E2Pac_fb58.html" title="User:2Pac">2Pac</a> 14:07, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>All that can be inferred from the presence of articles on the two record lists you mention is that someone wrote them. It does not mean that similar record lists compiled by other publications are not equally notable, just that no one has yet written articles on them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Certain magazines like Rolling Stone, Life, or Playboy are iconic and well-noted for who has bene depicted on their covers over the years.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is a major accomplishment to "get your picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone." The cover is perhaps the most famous part about the magazine, and it is appropriate to list those who have accomplished this feat. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 16:26, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a notable accomplishment (immortalized in song, no less) and deserving of a list. And, yes, I do support similar articles for Life, Time, Playboy and Newsweek should such articles appear. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:12, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - with all due respect, you all have it backwards. People do not become notable because they are on the cover of Rolling Stone. People go on the cover of Rolling Stone because they are notable. I checked more or less at random 25 articles linked to the list. Not one of them mentioned the appearance of the subject on the cover of Rolling Stone. If this is truly a notable career achievement one would think that the articles would mention it, but they don't. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:25, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - Unverifiable, non notable, original research Tnomad 13:39, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>More specifically icon-based gaming is not recnogised cateogry of gaming in any magazine, journal, book, site of gaming I've ever come acorss. It is merely a part of the GUI design of the overall product. Icons are used in almost all games and software and I don't see any verifiable information in the article to justify them being classed as their own notable genre of gaming deserving of a wikipedia article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've never heard of these people, but having read the article and done some research I've found it quite interesting and notable whether it meets guidelines or not. This is a strange case and I'm not sure how applicable <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is, flexibility may be preferable. The band seem to be more of a protest organisation than a musical group. Anyway, here are various sources I have dug up:

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see that the nomination has been withdrawn, so I guess this is moot, but one glance at the history would have shown that I had largely created this article. As an established editor, I would certainly have appreciated if, before formally nominating it for deletion, someone had contacted me and said that they felt that my citations did not sufficiently establish notability. I could have done the legwork that Zleitzen just did. (For what it's worth, I felt it was already clearly above the threshold, based on touring internationally and based on their political activities.) Even if you had not noticed me as an author: nominating a longstanding article for deletion without so much as a question on the talk page first is rather drastic. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - listing people by surgical procedures they have undergone is generally a bad idea. People in general do not gain notability by having had a particular surgery.

<li><b>Very strong delete</b> - List of <i>what???</i> I mean, really, this is taking the idea of "loosely related topics" to an extreme. How about List of politicians who have recieved flu shots.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this article as a supplement to the main <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microfracture_surgery.html" title="Microfracture surgery">microfracture surgery</a> article because this is a very high-profile surgery in the sports world. The surgery is a recent development that is often referred to as "experimental" or "high-risk" in the media, which leads some to question its effectiveness. I believe the list has value because:
<ul>
<li>it provides an easy way to see what athletes in which sports have had the surgery</li>
<li>it provides links to their individual articles so in most cases a reader can see how (or if) their athletic career was affected by the surgery</li>
<li>the article is not original research and satisifies <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>; every single item on the page is cited with a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> from a variety of media outlets - a comparison to flu shots or any other trivial medical procedure is invalid</li>
<li>the list contains information directly relevant to the main article but is too long to be included there</li>
<li>it serves two of the "main purposes" outlined in <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> - it is grouped by theme, and can also be use for navigation for someone researching this topic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Given the extensive sports media coverage of this specific surgery and its effects, I simply don't see what policy or guideline the list fails to satisfy. Don't forget <a href="../../../p/a/p/WP%7EPAPER_01fc.html" title="WP:PAPER">WP:PAPER</a>. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Smooth_ae06.html" title="User:Big Smooth">Big</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Smooth_1480.html" title="User talk:Big Smooth">Smooth</a></i> 16:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One other point: I feel this list is more than a directory because it is organized by sport. When a high-profile athlete undergoes this surgery, I believe readers would look for information on the experience of other athletes in the same sport. For instance, if Kobe Bryant had microfracture surgery, the list would inform many interested readers of other basketball players who have had the surgery and direct them to their article to learn more about their recovery. The same could be said for David Beckham and soccer, or Peyton Manning and football. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Smooth_ae06.html" title="User:Big Smooth">Big</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Smooth_1480.html" title="User talk:Big Smooth">Smooth</a></i> 17:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You're right, Wikipedia is not paper - but it is also not a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">directory</a>. If any of the examples in your list are somehow particularly important cases to the development of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microfracture_surgery.html" title="Microfracture surgery">microfracture surgery</a> then they might warrant a mention there. Also if the surgery had a particularly strong impact on a player's career then it would warrant mention on said athlete's entry. In spite of assertions that the surgery is "experimental" or in some way controversial (which is close to POV pushing) it is a fairly common procedure, as evidenced by the length of your list. It may not be a minor, trivial procedure like a flu shot, but it's also not a defining characteristic linking these people. It's still a loose association. You make a great argument that the information is <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">useful</a> but usefulness is not a reason for inclusion. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:26, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Points well taken, although I'd still argue the link between these people is more than tenuous - it could be argued that it does become a defining characteristic of the player given how often this surgery is mentioned in news stories and broadcasts. As for the "experimental" assertion, that's not just me, that's major media outlets: see <a href="http://robots.cnnsi.com/2003/football/nfl/10/12/closerlook.pantherscolts/" class="external autonumber" title="http://robots.cnnsi.com/2003/football/nfl/10/12/closerlook.pantherscolts/" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> for an example of it being called "controversial" although this article <a href="http://www.nba.com/sonics/news/stoudemire070108.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nba.com/sonics/news/stoudemire070108.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> specifically points out that with recent successes the "controversy" has all but disappeared. I will agree that the surgery seems to be becoming increasingly common which will decrease the value of this list in the future; if this is a reason for deletion then I can understand that, although I still feel it is valid for inclusion now. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Smooth_ae06.html" title="User:Big Smooth">Big</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Smooth_1480.html" title="User talk:Big Smooth">Smooth</a></i> 17:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As a case in point, consider that the articles of the 18 NBA athletes listed as having undergone the surgery, only 5 mention the microfracture surgery, and only 2 of those mention the impact it may have had on their recovery and career. Please don't get me wrong - the work you put in to making sure the article is properly sourced is fantastic. It's just that given the paucity of information regarding the surgery on the player articles, it doesn't seem to be that important an aspect in their careers, and doesn't seem to make for a good candidate for a common connection in a list. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:58, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I realize that this material does not appear to be something you would find in an encyclopedia. However, the information that was posted in this article is of a great deal of interest to the members of and newcomers to Gamemecca. Most members know little to nothing about the origin of the website and what has happened since it was created, therefore this page was going to serve as an indispensable tool to bolster the site's history. Please do not delete this thread and undo the large edit that took out 1/2 the page I spent a great deal of time on. Caged 15:44, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The purpose of <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamemecca.html" title="Gamemecca">Gamemecca</a> is not to inform Gamemeccans about it; if you want to do that, I suggest you create your own wiki or make an 'about us' page or something. <a href="../../../v/e/i/User%7EVeinor_0082.html" title="User:Veinor">Veinor</a> <a href="../../../v/e/i/User_talk%7EVeinor_8b70.html" title="User talk:Veinor"><sup>(talk to me)</sup></a> 15:46, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is indeed true; the SklogWiki was started on the 15 of February this year. I have not spent a lot of time <i>promoting</i> it as yet for the following reason. The domain *.sklogwiki.org has been purchased, but since SklogWiki is hosted in a national laboratory, so meetings had to be held to see whether an <i>external</i> page could be served up from an <i>internal</i> host. Today that go-ahead was given, and hopefully within the next 72 hours SklogWiki can be found via www.sklogwiki.org. Once this is so I shall start the "promotion" via the large number of scientific mailing lists that are either open-acces or that I have access to. --161.111.20.5 17:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Border_history_of_Romania_8dc3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Border history of Romania">first nomination for deletion</a> resulted in no consensus more than half a year ago. Many users voted "keep" in the hope that the article would shortly be improved. I still believe this is not possible, since whatever encyclopedic content could be included in this article belongs rather to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Romania_ed89.html" title="History of Romania">History of Romania</a> article. This standpoint is now more or less proven by the facts that (1) there have been 4 edits to this article since the previous AfD, none of which was in any way substantial, and (2) the only reference to this article (from the article space) remains a single link in the "See also" section of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Romania_ed89.html" title="History of Romania">History of Romania</a> article.</p>
<p>Apart from being practically useless (the images can be used later even if the article gets deleted now), this article also runs a mild risk of becoming a POV fork at some time, since it allows presenting historical states without providing enough context on what they do or do not have in common with modern states, unlike other articles containing sufficient amounts of prose (such as the well-written <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Romania_ed89.html" title="History of Romania">History of Romania</a> series). <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">K</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">issL</a> 15:50, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> In the middle ages, the East-Roman Empire was called Romania, thus, the title is not hisorically correct. If the title was eg. Historical states on the terriory of present-day Romania, there would be no problem with it. But if these maps were included in Category:Maps of the history of Romania, there would be no need for this article at all --<a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKIDB_32a1.html" title="User:KIDB">KIDB</a> 10:55, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Very simply, this article contains information that is more easily presented visually than in text. This is another example. I did not check each map, but it seems to me there are few if any fair use images there; that is not a reason not to have a gallery of these maps. Perhaps a <b>move</b> to something more precisely descriptive of the contents, like Gallery of historical maps of Romania, might be in order. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 12:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: As said above in various ways, one of the problems is that a state called Romania has only existed since the 19th century, not the 1st century BC. What exactly was going on during those two millennia is not straightforward enough to be able to be conveyed by just a series of maps. (Otherwise, why don't we present the histories of all countries like that?) <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">K</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">issL</a> 15:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The captions in the article, while they surely could be expanded, made it reasonably clear that the various states in the region were not all called Romania. "Romania" and "Romanian" are one of those ambiguous terms that can mean both a citizen of a state of Romania, and a speaker of a Balkan Romance language. We don't present the history of some other countries like that because no one has written those articles yet. A category would be a poor substitute for this page; shifting borders would be harder to track. (FWIW, countries with less complicated histories can present similar data differently; look at <a href="../../../u/s/a/Image%7EUSA_Territorial_Growth_small.gif_1e3d.html" title="Image:USA Territorial Growth small.gif">Image:USA Territorial Growth small.gif</a>. If this has something to do with Balkan ethnic politics, please say so. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indirectly, it does have somewhat to do with ethnic politics – most ethnic groups over here are trying to prove in various ways that "they were first" in the neighbourhood where they currently are and even its surroundings. In this sense, the situation is not analogous to the US, where a consensus exists on historiography (unless I'm badly mistaken). However, if we were talking about an article titled "Border history of the US" containing just the maps in <a href="../../../u/s/a/Image%7EUSA_Territorial_Growth_small.gif_1e3d.html" title="Image:USA Territorial Growth small.gif">Image:USA Territorial Growth small.gif</a> with some captions, my opinion would still be that it is not (and has no hope of becoming) encyclopedic. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">K</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">issL</a> 16:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, its just maps and maps. Well, my opinion on this article being kept has changed. Since nothing has been done since June 2006, this article does not deserve to be kept.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This list was removed from the company article since many editors wanted to have a list of all hotels and not just the few notable ones. Since that would have been excessive for the article, it is better to have that information in its own article. If this article is deleted, please make it clear if you support a full list of hotels in the parent article so that there is support for the constant reverting needed to maintain that article if you do not. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 17:56, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>But I don't support a full list of hotels in the parent article, either. Deciding which, if any, pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and belong in the parent article is an issue for the editors there and not for AfD, as it constitutes a content dispute. However there is no reason to place a full list of hotels, either there or here in its own article, either way is still a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">directory</a> which Wikipedia is not. <b>Delete</b> this list. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:36, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If any specific hotels are notable enough per Wikipedia policies/guidelines as a separate article, then I think that's a good enough qualification for a "Notable Hilton Hotels" on the main article. A listing of the rest of them is not especially useful since it's much more efficient to provide a link to Hilton Hotel's own list, which they manage/update to an extent that probably can't be matched here. -<a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a> (<a href="../../../c/q/u/User_talk%7ECquan_6cf6.html" title="User talk:Cquan">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_Desk_4424.html" title="User:Cquan/Desk">AMA Desk</a>) 20:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as there are "over 500" hotels in the chain.

<p><a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> has long had a standard prohibiting seperate articles for covers of pre-existing songs.

<p>To have any content at all, this list would have to rely on editors' personal observations and conclusions on characters in works of fiction. As "common sense" as it would be to declare a character a self-harmer, this list does not belong on Wikipedia, also because the characters by themselves are generally not notable enough to warrant their own articles (as many of these characters have not been analyzed or featured by themselves in the media as standalone subjects). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 17:38, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

This is the definition that the list is based on. --<a href="../../../o/g/o/User%7EOGoncho_d155.html" title="User:OGoncho">OGoncho</a> 00:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And it's excessively broad. How much deliberate injury is necessary to qualify? For instance, why is Harry Potter on the list? <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 00:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose because of a punishment in which he is forced to write lines while his hand is cut with each stroke. I would not think that qualifies, as he does it as more of a "FU, government," kind of thing.

<li><b>Keep</b> Important topic, with many articles from reliable sources as evidenced by the works in the list. Does not seem triggery. There is no element of personal observations or original research in the selection, since the book reviews will describe explicitly that the works properly included in the list are about self-harm. Not all the works are fiction; some are important nonfiction works about dealing with the problem. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 05:41, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Importance" doesn't have anything to do with WP notability; plus, there is only one source listed, which is a collaborative project, and therefore not reliable for our usage. In addition, this list is very poorly defined, because we do not know whether items included should be characters who habitually hurt themselves with intent to harm, characters who habitually put themselves into dangerous situations, characters who accidently harm themselves, or characters who at one point harmed themselves. In addition, you can't just assume that the same observation which would warrant inclusion into this list (that a character has commited self-harm) has been made by a non-trivial paper or review. And even still, if some definition of this list can be aggreed upon, it will still be highly debatable whether or not that definition should be used over another. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 21:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To have any content at all, this list would have to rely on editors' personal observations and interpretations of creative works. As "common sense" as it may seem to declare a work to contain reference to or be centered around Self Injury, this list does not belong on Wikipedia; also note that -many of the works themselves do not WP notabilty guidelines, and -the entire music section is a laundry list of songs and lyrics in which editors have personally observed reference to self injury. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 17:56, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Self-harm is a major problem in some cultures and has numerous sources to attest to its importance. "self harm" gets over 1.1 million Google hits.

<li>"Self-harm in popular culture" as itself is probably a very notable subject. However, this article is nothing but a sprawling list made of personal sightings. In addition, "self harm" is by itself may be a notable subject, but that says nothing about this list and it's own standing. And if a work is non-fiction, by definition, it should not be kept on here, because it's not in the category defined by the title. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 21:25, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I agree it is completely out of hand, but a hard pruning of it then merging back into the main article might be the be the best solution, restricting to referenced examples only, e.g. with the songs it has been explicitly stated it was about self injury in an an interview.

<p>Topic is non-notable, unpublished story; see article talk page <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominus_070e.html" title="User:Dominus">Dominus</a> 18:18, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Here's my summary from the talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are no Google hits for "Oliva's eye", for the name of the story "A story of a black rainbow", or for the author's name "Taft O. Miller" or "Taft Miller". There are no Wikipedia articles that link to this one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article claims that the story was "published in January, 2007", but it doesn't say where it was published.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that the subject is entirely non-notable.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Today, an anonymous user removed the PROD warning from the article, adding the following message to the talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a real short story, although not sold in any bookstores, it has been written. Please do not delete it, I have made them remove any silly comments from their homepage. Although the short story is real, it is not on google because it wasn't submitted to google partly because I do not have a homepage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Taft O. Miller</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe that this supports my suggestion that the article is about a non-notable, unpublished work. -- <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominus_070e.html" title="User:Dominus">Dominus</a> 18:26, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>On google I founded that there a short story called a story of a black rainbow but was not written by Taft Miller or had to do anything with oliva's eye.</p>

<p>Alright, let's settle this.</p>
<p><br />
This is NOT a major book, it is a short story written in a short amount of time. It was not made to be published by any bookstore, it didn't win any prizes. It was just a book about a VERY disturbing thing that happened between two of my friends, so I wrote a story about it. I just thought I would make a Wikipedia page about it, my friend choose the page name</p>
<p><br />
About the google thing. Not everyone is on google! I already told you this book isn't published! Please get off the google thing!</p>
<p><br />
If you want to delete it, thats fine. Even though it would be nice to leave it, I know wikipedia doesn't love average people, it only likes <i>celebrities</i> and <i>famous people</i>, because no matter how little people look at the page, it has to be deleted to save the 1 KB of space of wikipedia's precious space, even though the page IS a encyclopedia entry, it isn't <i>important</i> enough.</p>
<p><br />
So whats the point of creating new pages if they are always deleted?</p>
<p><br />

<dl>
<dd>New pages aren't always deleted. If they were, English Wikipedia wouldn't have over a million articles. The concern is that items must meet notability standards as outlined in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">This notability policy</a> and must have enough information that it can be verified as outlined in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">this verification policy</a>. If something doesn't meet those base requirements, it's not considered notable enough to be included on Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you want to host the story (or information about the story somewhere), try any of the hundreds of free webspaces out there. There's even free wiki-hosting sites if you'd like to allow your friends to edit the article as well. Wikipedia, however, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not for things made in school one day</a>.

<p>The story <i>A Story of a Black Rainbow</i> sound's a lot like the story <i>A tale of a Gray Rainbow</i> I dont know if it was puplished or not but it was told by Paul Miller who traveled to a few schools in North Carolina telling the story to 1st and 2nd graders. There was no such thing as Oliva's eye however there was jane's eye which was used to discripe something of great beurity.</p>
<p>ps. Sorry for the spelling I guess I should of stayed awake in 1-3 grade.</p>

<p>No reason; was added to AfD by Majorclanger but this subpage was not created and the article itself was not tagged. 1,640 Google hits, including a CNN article <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/25/dynamite.plane/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/25/dynamite.plane/index.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>.

<p>Hmmm... didn't think I actually submitted to AfD, but obviously I did. My main issue with this is that it's not an encyclopedic article at all, just a copy and paste or slight rewrite of a news article - it has next to no information about this guy apart from the single event.

<dd>No, it's allowed. If an article has been submitted to AfD but it turns out to actually be a candidate for speedy deletion, the appropriate speedy tag should be added to the article (besides the AfD tag), and if the article is speedied, that will cut the AfD discussion short. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Frankly, I find the mention of their 1923 basketball title a promising sign.. I do not particularly like to eliminate stub articles on schools,or on anything else, because people may well finish them. it's articles people have worked on and found nothing to say that I find more problematic.

<li><b>Comment</b> Tractor is definitely real and almost certainly notable, but the bulk of the article is a copyvio from <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:64j20rnac48j~T1" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:64j20rnac48j~T1" rel="nofollow">Allmusic Guide</a> (one of the more common sources for music-related copyvios). There's been a bunch of editing since the original copyvio was posted, so I'm not sure if the result is salvageable or not.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. According to IMDb and the film's official website the film has been shot and edited and is currently being scored. The film also has a consistent rating of around 20,000 or higher on the IMDb film meter indicating a high level of popular interest. Numerous press/media websites and TV series are covering the production of the film; e.g. <a href="http://www.sidewalkstv.com/specialfeatures/movies/yesterdaywasalie.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sidewalkstv.com/specialfeatures/movies/yesterdaywasalie.html" rel="nofollow">SidewalksTV</a>], a nationally-syndicated television program (note that this website even has a link to the Wiki entry on <i>Yesterday Was a Lie</i>). The premise of deletion is therefore invalid. Sorrywrongnumber 20:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>P.S.: I have added several press/media links to the main page, including a link to the <a href="http://www.wireimage.com/GalleryListing.asp?navtyp=gls====213188&amp;VwMd=i" class="external text" title="http://www.wireimage.com/GalleryListing.asp?navtyp=gls====213188&amp;VwMd=i" rel="nofollow">WireImage</a> page covering the film's wrap party, further illustrating that Guy's basis of deletion (that the film hasn't shot) is incorrect.

<dd><b>Delete</b>. This article is just self-promotion for a non-notable non-profit org, and it may even qualify as a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html" title="Vanity page">vanity page</a>. Many of the references are just vapor sources that don't support what the author(s) claim they do. For example, in support of the claim that the Freechild Project is "internationally recognized," the author(s) cite an article in the <i>Australasian Journal of American Studies</i>. Even if being mentioned in an obscure social-science journal published outside of America qualified as "international recognition" (IMHO, it doesn't), if you actually look at the source, the Freechild Project <i>isn't even mentioned in the body of the article</i>. Instead, a review of <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Gitlin_2612.html" title="Todd Gitlin">Todd Gitlin</a>'s book that the journal article's author found on the Freechild Project website is listed in the bibliography. In addition, the article lists as "accolades" several awards of questionable importance, such as a "cool site" award. Most of the Google hits for the site are for automated rip-off sites like Answers.com, or links from sites within the special-interest community that the Freechild Project is part of. Wikipedia is not meant to be an exhaustive guide to everything in existence, and this organization does not merit a WP article. - <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaraoke_ad01.html" title="User:Skaraoke">Skaraoke</a> 07:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another example of <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. Its ironic that <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaraoke_ad01.html" title="User:Skaraoke">Skaraoke</a> asks for notability, then complains when the google hits, citations, and "special interest community that the Freechild Project is part of" does not meet his liking. I'm also not sure that any of the <b>17</b> citations on the article are so-called "vapor citations"; that much said, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> does not mention "vapor citations", and no other page on WP mentions "vapor citations". "Vapor citation" actually comes up 3 times on google. There are no exceptional claims in the article, particularly regarding The Freechild Project's international relevance (with multiple citations); neither is there original research or unsourced comments. As the article illustrates, this program is notable and merits a WP article. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 16:59, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The term "vapor source" refers to a citation that "evaporates" once you examine it more closely (<i>i.e.</i> it doesn't actually say what the author was citing it to support, or it doesn't exist at all). Regardless of how many other people use this term, it is an accurate description of the citations that I mentioned above. Citations that can be described that way don't belong on WP, and articles that rely on citations like that don't belong on WP. - <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaraoke_ad01.html" title="User:Skaraoke">Skaraoke</a> 18:42, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Saying this article <i>relies</i> on "vapor sources" implies that is all there is in the article and that the merit of the article is reliant upon those sources. You explained one specific citation of concern; since then point I have added several other citations that strengthen the claim made in the article. There are <b>16</b> other citations in the article; you have yet to mention any other.

<p>As the article states before this quote, "cultural critic Henry Giroux" is on the Freechild Project's advisory board. Of course he's going to say the FP is "especially relevant." C'mon, who do you think you're fooling with this one? - 171.66.185.219 01:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a comic book available nationwide, from a reasonably major independent comic book publisher. Could use improvement, but I don't see that it should be deleted. I'll add it to the Wikiproject comics noticeboard in case somebody who knows more about it can contribute more. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems to meet the qualifications for notability, and I've read some of the comics myself. Could use some sourcing, but I don't imagine they'd be too hard to find.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't even know where to begin, and I apologize for this entry being long, though it is a complicated issue. For starters, both <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_3.html" title="Fan 3">Fan 3</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shut_Up_Stella_b537.html" title="Shut Up Stella">Shut Up Stella</a> fulfill <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Instead of getting into the nitty gritty of each section of WP:MUSIC, let me just say this: Fan 3 is signed to <a href="../../../g/e/f/Geffen.html" title="Geffen">Geffen</a> (see both allmusic.com and <a href="http://www.geffen.com/artist/default.aspx/aid/406" class="external text" title="http://www.geffen.com/artist/default.aspx/aid/406" rel="nofollow">Geffen's webiste</a>). Shut up Stella is signed to <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_Records_6e4e.html" title="Epic Records">Epic Records</a> (see more info <a href="http://www.epicrecords.com/artists.html?letter=s" class="external text" title="http://www.epicrecords.com/artists.html?letter=s" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and thus both artists are Notable and deserve to be on Wikipedia. Now comes the hard part: much of both Fan 3 and Shut up Stella's articles were written by a known vandal and sockpuppet, who goes by <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan3_a4d4.html" title="User:Fan3">Fan3</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_tha_Ripper_fb25.html" title="User:Jack tha Ripper">Jack tha Ripper</a>, JO Simpson, among a variety of other names. I, <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> have been on his track and have been blocking him systematically once he returns and vandalizes some more. Because of this, much of the information on both Fan 3 and Shut up Stella's articles is incorrect. This includes the albums released by both artists (Fan 3 only has one album, <i>Digits</i>, which isn't even mentioned on her main article, for example). And thus, I conclude with this: We should <b>keep</b> both <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_3.html" title="Fan 3">Fan 3</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shut_Up_Stella_b537.html" title="Shut Up Stella">Shut Up Stella</a>'s main pages, but should <b>delete</b> the albums and singles, as they were all (I believe) written by the vandal/sockpuppet, and are probably mostly innacurate. I will make it my personal pet project to massively clean-up, copy-edit and fact-check both Fan 3 and Shut up Stella, and add album pages and singles, etc. accordingly. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 04:48, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I found this through a related <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> discussion. I know nothing about the performer in this article aside from what is written in the article itself. However, the article does clearly indicate that this person has produced music that is notable enough that it is included in TV and movie soundtracks. This appears to meet Wikipedia's notability criteria. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 09:02, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
