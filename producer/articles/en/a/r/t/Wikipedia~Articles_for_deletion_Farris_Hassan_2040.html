<li><s><b>Keep</b> Definitely keep! Who has the balls to go to iraq just for a school essay? I think this boy deserves great respect. I also appreciate the fact that he had the desire to get Information first hand and not from some manipulating media in the USA. Manu from Germany.</s></li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> - Personal judgments about the boy or his actions are irrelevant. It's verifiable, substantially covered news, and entirely the sort of thing that someone might look for in Wikipedia sometime in the future.</s></li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b> - One major item I can't believe everyone is missing. Go back and view the video where his Mom is interviewed and the background video shows the mom in his room. In the background on a dresser, you will see an American Flag AND a Confederate Flag. With the folklore status this kid is getting, isn't anyone going to inquire as to why he would have this kind of offensive material in his room? I cannot believe no one has picked up on this? Am I missing something? This is a big deal. I don't think he deserves any credit. Brad in Seattle.</s>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a fellow 16 year old journalist, I believe that Mr. Hassan was stupid, but if the local 11pm newscast, CNN and Wikinews are covering and not to mention the fact that he was somehow able to enter a country which is currently engaged and war and not only survive with the way he acted, then he is damn well sure, notable. --<a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaint-Paddy_d585.html" title="User:Saint-Paddy">Saint-Paddy</a> 04:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notable and unique enough to warrant inclusion, though I must say I'm rather disappointed by the amount of people who think young Mr. Hassan is "brave" or a "hero". The people who are aware of the risks and go anyway (soldiers, aid workers, journalists, medics, etc.) ARE brave. Farris Hassan is just an irresponsibly naïve child.--<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicardoC_3810.html" title="User:RicardoC">RicardoC</a> 22:03, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> - this entry had good and thorough information. Sure, Farris was quite naive to go to iraq in the way he did, but he's an idealist and that could take him into doing some good work in his lifetime. of course, I would be grounding him for the rest of his high school career if I were his parents, but regardless! Keep this entry.</s></li>
<li><s>DELETE - the bulk of this article is an essay written by Hassan that is pretty emotive and pointless. The story can be found on WikiNews. It is not a historically significant event.</s></li>
<li>Strong <b>keep</b>, per all the arguments in the keep votes above. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 06:29, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a memorable news item (seriously, his name one of the few I can recall that doesn't belong to a US Senator) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamantlyMike_c18e.html" title="User:AdamantlyMike">AdamantlyMike</a> 07:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I agree with <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> that at best this should be merged with his school article. Just because this is on the front page doesn't mean it's notable enougg for a permanent article in an encyclopedia. On the fornt page of the 12/31/05 <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Wash Post</a> is an article advising people not to use the "Just 2 beers, officer" line, and the evening news is riddled with stuff we wouldn't even dream of putting in the encyclopedia. Furthermore, giving this kid notoreity is only going to encourage other teens to do the same, and although he was brave, this behavior should not be encouraged, hence the current US State departent policy of advising civilians to not go to Iraq. To date, 40 civies have been kidnapped, 10 were killed and 15 are unaccounted for. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaggorama_a518.html" title="User:Shaggorama">Shaggorama</a> 10:00, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> - While I agree that Hassan's decision to go to Iraq was probably not the brightest, I believe he deserves his own article to show the world his inspiring story: how much the plight of the Iraqi people mean to him. In the face of the American "shock and awe" approach to foreign policy, we the American people need to show resolve to help. This story is such an example and has inspired me, a teen who has led a life similar to Hassan's. I haven't been able to find a blog on the subject: someone should really stop his parents from punishing him. Maybe his decision was risky and immature, but very commendable in its daring.</s></li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> - If Wikipedia thinks an article about Cardassian military ranks is worthy of an entry, than this <b>certainly</b> is.</s></li>

<li><s>KEEP- Even my 88 year old mother wants to meet this kid. If she's noticed, he's notable. The article doesn't seem to meet any of the deletion criteria as far asI can tell. Seattilina.</s></li>
<li><s>DELETE - Plain garbage, propaganda, too many holes. Too much innuendo, half-truths, outright lies. It diminishes the quality and reputation of Wikipedia.</s></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> On one hand, this is an important story and has been for a week, and it would be an essential part of making Wikipedia a "time capsule" of our era's news/culture - part of the reason the Internet is so useful. It's a tale of the manifestation of the confusion created by government, media, and history, and how one student chooses to deal with it. On the other hand, the article is about a minor (privacy/legal issues - that's the one potential flaw I see), is subject to change very quickly, and needs edits. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDotcom703489_e89f.html" title="User:Dotcom703489">Dotcom703489</a> 07:32, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
