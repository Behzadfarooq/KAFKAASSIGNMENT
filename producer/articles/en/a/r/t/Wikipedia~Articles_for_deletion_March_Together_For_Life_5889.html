<li><b>Keep</b>. While Fan-1967's right that it's not quite the same league as the Flying Spaghetti Monster, those figures need updating, the blog's over 100,000 hits in a single day. That said, I concur with Vought and 24.193.226.19. It's a very humorous cautionary tale -- and comment -- about information getting ahead of the facts on the Internet. We've got a confluence of satire, Internet rumor, lack of sourcing, rapid passing of the URL around the world, a soupcon of righteous zeal and the all-too-human fallacy of not knowing when to say "whoops, my bad." I think we can spare a page for this one.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Slpva (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slpva_b8b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slpva">contribs</a>).</small><small>(This is user's first edit.)</small></li>

<li>Keep, Keep, KEEP. This is culturally important. Acts of stupidity should be given the same exposure as acts of great intellect, etc. It has happened, it is a factual event and should be documented as such. It is an incredible example of both stupidity but also the power of the internet.

<li>Keep. Unless there is a specific, valid reason to delete it, I think it should stay. I've seen many entries that might be considered "not important" by some people. It's all subjective.

<li><b>Keep It</b>, and add to other Internet phenomena. It is note worthy for several of the reasons noted above and meets the four criteria for worthyness. I don't see what "funny", or "nobody will care" have to do with it, those are just subjective takes on importance which all content is subject too. Who will care the Earth even existed in 10 Billion Years? Hard to say actually, which is why deleting should be a last resort. onNYTurf 16:27, 12 July 2006 (EST)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: It is mean and cowardly to ridicule a person for a harmless mistake, especially a sincere person, whether or not one agrees with that person's opinions. Besides, it isn't notable.<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_L._Peterson_830c.html" title="User:Richard L. Peterson">Rich</a> 07:56, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is definitely notable for several reasons. 1) It is a great example of the peculiar power of blogs to spread information to a large number of people, 2) more generally, it is an example of how the internet has changed what information gets made public and how that information is dispersed, 3)it is a prime example of the importance of checking sources before making information and opinions public, 4) it is topical to the nature and reliability of information found on the internet, 5) it is an example of how controversial and divisive issues such as abortion are in this society (esp. the U.S.) . Comparing this to the Great Spaghetti Monster, if you look on the original keep/delete comments on that article, much the same argument of notability was discussed there as well. In additional, this topic keeps going thanks to articles such as the one found in <i>Salon</i>. I don't understand why people should be so inflexible about what should be considered "notable" in Wikipedia. This is <i>not</i> a traditional print encyclopedia with typical entries.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is definitely notable for several reasons. 1) It is a great example of the peculiar power of blogs to spread information to a large number of people, 2) more generally, it is an example of how the internet has changed what information gets made public and how that information is dispersed, 3)it is a prime example of the importance of checking sources before making information and opinions public, 4) it is topical to the nature and reliability of information found on the internet, 5) it is an example of how controversial and divisive issues such as abortion are in this society (esp. the U.S.) . Comparing this to the Great Spaghetti Monster, if you look on the original keep/delete comments on that article, much the same argument of notability was discussed there as well. In additional, this topic keeps going thanks to articles such as the one found in <i>Salon</i>.
