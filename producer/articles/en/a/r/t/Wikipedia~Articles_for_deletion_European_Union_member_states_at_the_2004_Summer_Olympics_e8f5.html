<p>I have already added "member states" to the title. The EU did not compete at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and this is only such article for an entity which did not compete. The only reason to create this was to support the idea that it should do so, which is a propaganda aim which cannot be made neutral through the phrasing of the article. For non-propaganda purposes this article is of no more relevance than Countries beginning with the letter G at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and much less relevance than Europe at the 2004 Summer Olympics or Africa at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Before voting, please consider whether you would support such articles for NAFTA, ASEAN, or such entities in your part of the world. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../o/s/o/User%7EOsomec_c7d4.html" title="User:Osomec">Osomec</a> 19:05, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The simple listing of member states is not particularly useful and redundant with (presumably) many other articles. The interpretation required to reach the first bullet point of conclusions is fairly minimal, but relies on assumptions like each athlete still training in the same way, still being funded etc etc. The second bullet is pure speculation. Thus, all the non-repetitive material in the article is original research, and should go per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:05, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - For no more reason than I think it's quite interesting. Comparing it to a fictional article entitled Countries beginning with the letter G at the 2004 Summer Olympics is silly, IMO. if the Countries beginning with the letter G had a parliament and were politically related, I could see your point. Particularly if the head of the CBWTLG alliance made comments to do with a united team. I also don't believe the page supports the EU should enter a single team - I don't believe they should. And I, personally, would support a similar page to do with Africa at the Olympics. 2004 Summer Olympics medals count by International Organization states that as a united force the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Union_91e5.html" title="African Union">African Union</a> won 8 medals, and I believe an article about the African nations at the Olympics could expand that information. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 22:48, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It's also worth noting that this is the 3rd VFD for this very page, previous discussions are at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_European_Union_Olympic_medals_count_for_2004_3563.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/European Union Olympic medals count for 2004">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/European_Union_Olympic_medals_count_for_2004</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_European_Union_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_35b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/European Union at the 2004 Summer Olympics">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/European_Union_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics</a> when keep was decided one time, and the proper process wasn't followed the other.

<dd>Like I said above it relys on assumptions for a start, so doesn't have such a strong basis in fact as it might appear. The second bullet point is entirely speculative — there's no evidenciary justification, other than intuition, for its contents. We are presented with someone's reasoning, and that doesn't clear the factual threshold, or the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> threshold. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 14:33, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rename and develop</b>. The proposal by Romano Prodi was real. The controversy in (mainly UK) papers at the time was real. The medal counts are real. This subject deserves an article - but perhaps with a different title. How about something like "EU and the Olympics" or "Proposals for an EU Olympics team".
