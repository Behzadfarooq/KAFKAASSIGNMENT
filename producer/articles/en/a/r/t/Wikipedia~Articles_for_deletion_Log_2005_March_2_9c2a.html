<li>The history of this page shows a troubled past. It was contributed on 15 Feb as a full-blown article. Within minutes, it was tagged as a copyvio. Eight minutes later, the anon who started the article overwrote the copyvio tag with the two links. It sat that way until this VfD discussion was opened. I can find no evidence that the original copyvio allegation was ever resolved. Looking at the original text, it appears that an encyclopedic article could be written someday. For now, however, I think the only possible answer is to <b>return this to the copyvio process</b>. I am restoring the copyvio notice. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:20, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As it stands, it's a reasonable stub on a topic of Filipino history. It still needs work, but it appears as if Jondel has reasonably fixed it.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 9 clear "delete" votes, 2 "merge and redirect", 5 "redirect w/o merge" and no "keep as is" votes. (And a few comments that were too ambiguous to call.) Since the clear majority does not support the retention of the content, I am going to delete this. Per David's suggestion, I am then going to create it as a redirect to discourage recreation of the forked article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 05:20, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Because that isn't really a deletion. It is a terminology thing, to vote to <i>delete</i> something usually means that you want to rid Wikipedia of the text entirely, under any name. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a></li>

<p>I am 130.132, and I was not the creator of the page. I was, however, the one who originally proposed that it be deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- The deletion log shows that this article was deleted by an admin at 22:21 and the current version was created at 22:25. Apparently 130.132 had the edit screen open and was tagging it for deletion when it was deleted. When he clicked "save" that basically recreated the article. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 07:35, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 5 "delete" votes and 3 "keep but cleanup" votes. While that is a clear majority to delete, it fails to reach the overwhelming concensus necessary to delete. The decision defaults to "keep" for now. However, if the article is not substantially improved in a reasonable amount of time, it may be appropriate to renominate this article. If such a renomination is created, it should link to this discussion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 05:34, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

The result of the debate was about evenly split between transwiki and delete. However, as Uncle G points out, it's already in Wiktionary.

<li>Yes, and I'm sure that most or all of those examples would not be encyclopedic. For instance, see the Laundry List of dog names. An article shouldn't be both in Wikipedia and Wiktionary, because they are two widely differing projects (read the inclusion criteria for both, you'll see why duplication is not good). This is a dicdef at best, and sounds rather neologistic to me.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a stub, but stubs are not automatically deletion candidates. Many other cities have a list of mayors article; often this has a "List of Mayors of X" title when there is nothing special to say, but "Mayor of X" articles also exist when some information about the office itself and its changing nature in history might need to be mentioned, which seems to be the case here. The current population of Galway is certainly quite small, but the city does have a historical significance considerably greater than its current small population would indicate. The article on the city itself is moderately large, and a mayor or list of mayors article is certainly warranted. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:22, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jeremy has to be responsible for gaining atleast half of Rammstein's Fans worldwide!!! Not to mention introducing every Rammstein fan to other amazing German bands such as Megaherz, Eisbrecher, OOMPH!, Stahlhammer, Herzer, In Extremo, Subway To Sally... just to name a few</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jeremy could easily be considered the seventh member of Rammstein. How many people who run fansites get asked to run the official website of the band they've dedicated a good majority of their time to and actually mean it? That in itself is completely extraordinary and definitely deems Wikipedia status. He's even thanked on the "Thank You/Credits" section of Rammstein's latest album "Reise, Reise" for Christ's sake.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I hope I'm not bursting anybody's bubble here, but while both of those are pretty cool in their own way, neither of them is all <i>that</i> unusual. I've seen many large fansites become official or semi-official after getting recognised by the band or artist. And I know that if I was a big Rammstein fan, getting thanked in their liner notes would make me very, very, very happy... but would I expect myself to be listed in an encyclopedia because of it? Of course not! <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:42, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>One more vote for the page: Jeremy is essentially a celebrity within the Rammstein community, and has managed to branch out and create official websites for other German bands. He is more than a one hit wonder, and has gained the respect of a large number of German bands, as well as avid fans of German music. He offers people avenues to explore a culture of music that might otherwise go unknown to them. And one more tidbit, the guy has at least 2 songs written about him, so he must have something going on, to warrent such attention.

<li>You seem to be one of those who judge people by their post counts. Just because it's their first post, it doesn't mean they're braindead and just because it's their 10000th post, it doesn't mean they're credible either. In any case, you've seen the precedents which have been set by the above two Webmasters. It also takes a lot of time and effort to run not one, not two, but three band sites all filled with content and information which fans would otherwise not get from anywhere else. He may not play the instruments of Rammstein but he is an important part of the crew.

<li>Actually, pointing out unsigned/anon/new-user votes is common practice here on VfD. When admins close the VfD debates, such votes are generally not counted. I call your attention to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators</a>, which clearly states: <i>administrators can disregard votes and comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such "bad faith" votes include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article.</i> Basically, not only is this a bad idea because the votes won't count, it also tends to annoy legitimate voters and admins. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:32, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What the heck, I'll be nice and answer your question too: Both Knowles and Kyanka are notable for things other than being a webmaster. Knowles' "Ain't It Cool News" was also a TV series, he's guest-hosted on Siskel &amp; Ebert more than once, he's producing a movie, and he's appeared in several major motion pictures. We get plenty of webmaster articles on Wikipedia, and they're always deleted by voting unless the subject is also notable for something else. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:45, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Delete this article since the "legitimates" FEEL that these votes don't mean anything and they were made in so-called "bad faith" and by "sock puppets". Ok, I'll try to make you happy: all of this discussion is really pointless just for a few kilobytes of server space. It's really pointless. Go feel like you've done your "wikiduty" and go ahead and delete this. Yeah, when newbies post favourable opinions, you finally count it as being on "your side".</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. With over 21,000 google hits, Keith Wigdor does seen to have some notariety. Additionally, the article and its associated talk page serve a useful purpose in keeping much of the continual juvenile petty bickering between Wigdor's admirers and detractors contained away from other articles. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 19:54, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I've noted the large numbers of hits myself. However, I've struggled to find anything significant among them, that doesn't seem to be authored by Wigdor himself. (Often accompanied by abusive comments from others; similar pattern as here, really. Indeed, very likely the <i>same</i> others (or other) as here.) If the views of the admirers and detractors could be distilled down into something semi-encyclopaedic-looking, the article could be significantly improved. If there's no real art-crit of him, though, it does raise valid notability questions. If there is, can someone please cite it, with a view to inclusion in the article? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 20:13, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Keith Wigdor is notable enough to be appointed by <b>Terrance Lindall, the executive director of The Williamsburg Art and Historical Society</b> (art mecca in Brooklyn, New York City) and legendary artist and illustrator of countless magazine and book covers, as <b>LEAD JUDGE</b> for <b>the 2nd Surrealist Film Festival held at the WAH</b>. Since it is a FACT that the WAH Center, (a HIGHLY RESPECTED Art Institution) invited Keith Wigdor to come on down and judge a Surrealist Film Festival indicates that Wigdor certainly is NOTABLE! Also, the Founding Member of THE WEST COAST SURREALIST GROUP, Gregg Simpson, exhibited in Wigdor's virtual online event, SURREALISM 2003. Also, Wigdor was featured in CHURN ART MAGAZINE, in the same issue as the legendary H.R.GIGER and other heavies in the arts. The best selling Science Fiction Author, Greg Bear knows of Keith Wigdor, when Wigdor illustrated the winter 2001 issue of The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Greg has a copy of that magazine and another famous author, Paul Levinson has one of Wigdor's art prints hanging in his office. Also, Wigdor was just interviewed by the webzine, LATCHKEY, which is now online.24.168.67.238 20:29, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b></strike> <b>Delete</b>. I haven't attempted to determine the notability of the subject, but after taking a look at the Talk and History pages, the VfD nominator (Bleedy) has been involved in a lengthy edit war with various users from 24.168.*, who are likely to be the same person. It looks to me like a case of "I can't have it <i>my</i> way, so I'm taking my ball and going home," but it's hard to say.

<li><b>Delete</b> I was going to refrain from voting, as I've been trying to be as even-handed as possible in the edit war between the two parties, but the antics of the Wigdorites are getting too much. I've asked repeatedly for evidence of notability of the subject, and in response I've been told that 'notability isn't policy', to 'go away' and stop 'stalking' the various incarnations of 24.168.*.*, and much other repetitious, lengthy, ALL CAPS bluster; pretty much anything but a useful response. (And besides that of <i>being</i> 24.168.*.* by Bleedy, go figger.) If he's notable, it should be possible to cite legitimate art criticism of his work, not just personal testimony from a bunch of anons and single-figures-edits new users about why <i>they</i> consider him notable. I'll change my vote if someone does so, even at this late stage. Gmonkai, you may yell "fascism", but it's the policy. (From <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators</a>: <i>"For example, administrators can disregard votes and comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such "bad faith" votes include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article."</i>) If you want to change the policy, you could start by showing some interest in any aspect of wikipedia aside from the fate of this one miserable little article. If you can think of a good reason why accounts, created by all appearances to help stack a vote, should be given the same status as wikipedians of some demonstrated standing, then by all means go argue that in the appropriate place (which is <i>not</i> this deletion vote). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 23:04, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Note some comments withdrawn here...but Alai,given positions you have taken in the past-the posturing of an "evenhandedness" strikes me as a bit staged,as I feel your position was fairly entrenched previous to this edit war...But the motivations for your position I have become convinced have to do with established conventions of the site...and I herein offer apologies for any personal aspersions...When friends and acquaintances of mine who wished to express opinions here and were not allowed admission to editing were suggested to be vandals,site violators,et al....this was a bit much for me...they are both intelligent and informed on the topic...and as they are barred by some convention,in my opinion the site denies itself a very healthy influx to it's roster...I do understand the reasons as explained,because yes-they would enter and vote on this as a first issue-that doesn't mean that a fair percentage wouldn't stay and perhaps offer many good contributions...but again,as in person,I thankyou for suggestions made on my talk sheet..I believe they delineate lines of action that work within this system that could be more affective to this cause...I believe that some of the published reviews and criticques may exist,and that constructive energy should be applied to corrollating and presenting them...but I also believe an influx of respectable working artisans knowledgeable regarding this artist's work would have done this site and edit war no harm,and further I believe their views would likewise have been relevant to the issue of "notability",in the least they would have proven this artist to be well past "emerging"...I do not know who or what has been blocking their entrance,but I do feel rather certain that it has not been you,Alai.gmonkai.

But before the edit war, I had no position at all, much less an entrenched one, as I'd not even heard of Keith Wigdor. (See the article talk page for the spookily mundane history of all this.) If the cavalry has arrived to save and improve the Wigdor article, but just too late, as I commented to you elsewhere, perhaps an article about the subject can be created with (much!) better documentation as to his notability at a later date. (I have no idea how much later would be a decent interval, and before anyone jumps down my throat, I am absolutely <i><b>not</b></i> suggesting recreation of the <i>same</i> content, at this or any other time.) I hope your friends are able to resolve their technical/blocking issue (and I sincerely hope it was the latter). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 21:27, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

Unless for some reason you believe he was congratulating me for the vote I hadn't made yet, in a deletion vote that hadn't started yet: look at the date of the edit, Mar 1. If you're referring to something else, you've lost me entirely. And I haven't a) been presented with any of the information I requested -- doesn't even have to be objective, just "quotable" -- or b) 'found all manner of reasons' for anything of the sort.

<li>And on your last point (edit conflict, didn't reply to it in the original), the only issue is the notability of the Keith Wigdor article. If anyone has any information on that, it ought to be forwarded with all expeditiousness. I have no knowledge of anyone being barred admission -- contact an admin, or a developer. I don't see how that's material to this VfD, however. If the problem is simply some urgently information, can't it be forwarded via someone else? What I'm seeing, though, is lots of complaints about process, and nothing substantiative to the matter at hand. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 10:18, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

I would like to thank this person, "Infrogmation" for creating this article, but I really do not want any article in an encyclopedia, though it was very kind of you to consider an article on me, but my main concern is surrealism and photomontage, not encyclopedias. Read one of my past statements from the website Art Renegades from three years ago (it is still online). I do thank both Infrogmation and EL_C for their interest in my art but I do not want the article online after this harrassment. I would also like to thank the Wikipedia Encyclopedia for considering any article on me, (I am flattered) but I must decline. Congratulations on the success of your website and please stop the person (or persons) from using your website to harrass me.

<li>As mentioned above, it needs serious work to get rid of the POV proselytising, and a new title (perhaps Aid to Bible Understanding (Jehovah's Witnesses) but there is no reason not to have an article on the defunct publication, as long as it is a proper <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">encyclopaedia</a> article. <b>Abstain</b> for now. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 17:26, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<ul>
<li>If retitled and NPOV, it could be kept. However, the retitling is extremely important, as we get a fair number of new users who look for and write articles with titles like this, and the title could be confused as a Wikipedia how-to. Both are dangerous. Under this title, there is absolutely no way it should be kept. NPOV is hard. Cleanup probably won't do the trick, and the original author has a dog in the hunt. I have to say delete, in its present form, but I would be in favor of keeping a retitled and neutral version. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 05:05, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Should <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler_Has_Only_Got_One_Ball_6c48.html" title="Hitler Has Only Got One Ball">Hitler Has Only Got One Ball</a> be retitled lest people think Wikipedia expresses that Hitler had only one ball? Should <a href="../../../h/o/w/How_to_Dismantle_an_Atomic_Bomb_376e.html" title="How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb">How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</a> be postfixed "(album)"? Literal titles are not POV. If it's named <i>Aid to Bible Understanding</i> or <i>1001 Reasons Why Wikipedia Sucks</i> or for all I care <i>Why I'm Right and You're All Wrong</i>, and it's the only major thing having that title, then that's the title the article should have. Of course, the article <i>must</i> establish in the first sentence what it's about, but pre-emptive title fiddling to "remove the POV" is silly, especially if the intent is, in essence, to <i>prevent people from finding it too easily</i>. And we're talking NPOV?&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>Put up glaring notices on the talk page, educate newbies, etc., but don't go issuing decrees like "no way it should be kept under this title", especially if <i>that is the title</i>. If you disagree, get support for changing the naming policies—this is the sort of thing that applies to many articles, I'd wager. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.119.11.html" title="User:82.92.119.11">82.92.119.11</a> 10:04, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, those titles should be changed, user 82.92.119.11. If we take care of ambiguity up front, we don't have to cure it later. Since we already have things like <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver_%28album%29.html" title="Revolver (album)">Revolver (album)</a>, I think we absolutely <i>should</i> use "(album)" after music albums. The same goes for films, etc. Create redirects at the naive form, but keep the names clear in meaning and coverage. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:09, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

My reaction was a knee-jerk response to your heavy-handed throwing around of phrases like "NPOV" and "absolutely no way". Re-reading, I see your concern was that the title encouraged POV edits, not that it was itself POV, so most of my reply was beside the mark.

<dd>The current title would still be a redirect (or a disambiguation in case there are more than one publications with this name) to the more accurately titled page. We do it all the time.

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to claims of vote-stacking, their are large amounts of people who beleive well-written articles for schools are inherently notable. Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group. Speaking for myself, I evaluated the article and voted to keep it out of sincere belief that it deserved to be kept and not out of any votestacking motivation. I have faith that the majority of the other voters did as well.

<li>I see all of the same copy&amp;paste block votes above as on the other high schools' articles. I cannot help but be suspicious of them, given that those voters all voted the same as they voted above ("real place", "notable", "interesting stub", and so forth) at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Maha_Jana_High_School_44ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Maha Jana High School">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Maha Jana High School</a> for a school that doesn't actually exist. So instead I'm voting after <i>actually reading the article</i>. ☺ Wood Green School is one of 34 secondary schools <i>under the aegis of Oxfordshire Education Authority alone</i>. It has all of the standard trappings of state schools: PTAs, 6th forms, newsletters, school trips, and so forth. And there is <i>nothing</i> to mark it out from the crowd of 34, let alone from out of the vastly larger crowds of all secondary schools in the United Kingdom, or all secondary schools in the world. It's worth noting that schools are, after all, <i>intended</i> to be uniform. Reasonably uniform provision of public education at this level is indeed public policy in many countries. There is nothing of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">importance</a> to say about such schools and their articles (with any <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">academic boosterism</a> neutered) are thus tantamount to directory entries. Indeed, this article has almost nothing more to say about Wood Green School than its listing in the Oxfordshire Education Authority schools' directory has to say. And that <i>is</i> a directory. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:32, 2005 Mar 9 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Although I was made aware of this by User:GRider I don't believe this invalidates my vote. My personal opinion is that all secondary schools are worthy of being on Wikipedia and I will vote on all relavent pages when however I am made aware of this. If the purpose of VfD is to determine what the community feels about an article then it is best that it involves as many people who feel concerned as possible.</li>

<dd>With regard to the above comment schools are never going to achieve uniformity whether it is intended to or not.

<dd><a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a directory</a> refers to business listings and is a directive against using Wikipedia to advertise.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though his notoriety seems to be based entirely on the Mumia case. However, this article desperately needs some NPOV-ing. If you are asking about my bar in this case, I believe that he is notable not as a state judge but as the subject of many news stories and intensive international debate, and due to the fact that "encyclopedic" biographical facts about this individual may be deemed to be important to a better understanding of the arguments on both sides of the (unquestionably notable) case in which he was involved. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperzonk_e38e.html" title="User:Hyperzonk">HyperZonk</a><sup><a href="../../../h/y/p/User_talk%7EHyperzonk_d4a7.html" title="User talk:Hyperzonk">talk</a></sup> 17:46, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Borderline <b>keep</b></s>. UCLA is a well-known institution, and probably has a population (and a budget) larger than many of the cities in Wikipedia. A university chancellor, as nominal head of the institution, is probably notable by association for <i>major</i> universities. Chancellors also are often chosen because they have notable accomplishments and achievements already, though this article certainly doesn't suggest what those might be. (Whether or not other reference works choose to cover a topic should have only limited bearing on Wikipedia's decisions.
