<li><b>Comment</b> I created this article because I feel that it is an important concept that needs to be included on Wikipedia. Much of the widespread controversy in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> revolves around certain nations denying <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s right to exist, and that exact phrase is indeed very widely used, as <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> will demonstrate. I certainly do not deny that my article needs some work and improvement, but that is what the collaborative <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> process is for. I don't know what was there before when it was deleted last time, or how bad it was, but I deliberately tried to include arguments for both sides and include sources, because of the rules specified on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. If the article is badly flawed in some way, please let me know and I will try to fix it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> 04:02, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Delete</b> - No hope of there ever being a NPOV article. "Right to exist" is merely a simplification of the Zionism issue and wikipedia doesnt need to have articles on simplifications.

<li>Wikipedia cannot take a POV on articles (see <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>), but we can point out that claims denying the right to exist (such as the French ambassador's claims, and the Iranian Prime Minister's recent statements about wiping Israel off the map) have met with widespread international outrage. Of course, all this must be cited. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> 17:14, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A shitload of Google hits, and this is always a flashpoint in I/P negotiations.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article documents a key point in the issues around Zionism and modern anti-semitism. The article is at great risk of becoming a home to slanted, POV coverage, but the risk goes with the territory and has the potential to help divide up better this difficult-to-get-right topic. I think that the key issue in this AfD should be whether the article is intrinsically POV or not.--- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 19:19, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Even if the phrase was not in common usage, the concept is obviously of great weight, so the question would be "should this be renamed" rather than "should it be deleted." <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 20:40, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - although I would like to note that this can also be a <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> to refer to life in general. i.e. this should probably be renamed to Right to exist (Israel). <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 00:10, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Is "right to exist" really the best name for the article? Unless the mention of the phrase "right to exist" is always a reference to this thing, wouldn't it be better merged with Israel or Zionism? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 01:46, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Always? No, I've heard it used about South Africa. But by an overwhelming majority, I think it is used about Israel, and if any other possible applications are considered encyclopediac, then we can always add a disambig comment in the lead section. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 03:52, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We have other articles on political buzzwords and the context they are used in.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Why does Wikipedia reward rogue admins with "courtesy" instead of penalty? This article was speedy deleted by a rogue admin. Then it was listed here as a "courtesy" to the rogue admin. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 10:42, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Re-created articles that are substantially the same as deleted ones are speedily deletable. And <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> are against policy. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Prove it.</b> The author says he has no idea what was there before. He's not an admin, so he doesn't have access to the deleted version. It is vanishly unlikely that he managed to independenty create a deleted article. If your interpretation of the rules is that any article on a similar topic can be speedy deleted, then you are, as I said, a rogue admin - one who willfully abuses his authority. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 14:08, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think you're confused. Snowspinner undeleted the *current* version, not the AFD'd version. (Unless I missed it - please provide a link if so).

<li>Not for me. Those two cites show merely that the phrase is in use in something approximating this context. They do not sufficiently substantiate the contents of the article. They do not document <i>who</i> holds the arguments for and against or provide evidence that all the described elements of the beliefs are held. Tony's cite (below) may be more reliable but he only cites it as evidence of the title.

<li>Thanks for improving the introduction. If we have instead direct references where politician so-and-so used the phrase to support such-and-such an action it will be a good article.

<li><b>Delete</b>, past AFD appears quite valid. It was also pointed out in the first one that the concept within (<i>concept</i>, not <i>content</i>, mind) could be said elsewhere.

<li>AFDs apply to articles, not concepts. I never even saw the infamous previous version; it antedates my time on Wikipedia. I don't take these debates personally, but I'm curious why so many people are saying "refer to previous AFD" when that was for a completely different article, even if it was under the same title. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> 07:37, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Several participants asked why we need a new AfD. The DRV discussion is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=31374944#Right_to_exist" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=31374944#Right_to_exist" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There was a majority of particpipants in that DRV discussion who thought that the article this AfD treats, which is a new article broadly taking the shape of the old article, was sufficiently different from the article previously deleted that the new article could not be speedied and so needed a new AfD. The main argument for the article's difference is that the new article has credible sources that the old article lacked. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 15:50, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The issue with the old article was with the <i>topic</i>, which was deemed un-encyclopedic. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:59, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> because of the dissonance between the title and the content. What is the use? The reasons why Israel was established are discussed elsewhere, as where its struggles since.

<li><b>Comment</b> If as some claim the information exists elsewhere, then that is an argument for keeping and turning into a redirect.

I say the right to exist is much broader than Israel and the Middle East, it is about the right to eat, its about the right not to blown by up terrorists (Israel may be included in the article), school kids or grownups with guns, or be depressed by a totalitarian government. The right to exist belongs to everyone, let’s not tie it exclusively to Israel!
