<li><b>Hey Abbott!!!!</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Begining in 1967, 156 4 minute cartoons were produced with the help of Bud Abbott lending his voice. Almost everyone of them featured Lou Costello's character(voice by Stan Irwin) running for his life shouting "Hey Abbott!!!". They were produced by Hanna-Barbera Studios, RKO-Jomar Productions and distributed by: Gold Key Entertainment, King World Productions.</dd>
<dd>That information is well documented here <a href="http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon_information/28850-Kooks_and_Spooks.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon_information/28850-Kooks_and_Spooks.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and other places. And the line "I've been a bad boy Abbott" appeared in most of the radio, film and cartoon versions of thier comedy as well.</dd>
<dd>Further if you do a google on "I'm a bad boy Abbott" you'll get a dozen hits stating that was one of their trademark lines in radio, tv and in the cartoons.</dd>
<dd>So why this got flagged for deletion and cited as nonsense is beyond me. It is clearly one of thier lines. Maybe Feydey just doesn't like the story.</dd>

<li><strike>The nomination is for the nn made-up term Babbat. It has nothing to do with the notoriety of Costello's catchphrase which is already documented elsewhere. <b>Delete</b>.</strike>. Changing my vote to <b>transwiki</b> to Wikidictionary as the article appears to have been revised so it's not suggesting the phrase "babbat" (<i>not</i> "Hey Abbott" which is not being debated here) was coined by A&amp;C since that form was never used in any of the A&amp;C movies and was bastardized by other parties to become "babbat". Still not worthy of a Wikiarticle, but probably would fit into Wikidictionary though there should still be some sources cited that this is an actual expression and not something just made up. I could create a term like "mickfiddling", come up with a definition and post it too. There are plenty of printed sources to back up the existence of Valspeak and its associated terms. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:48, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> So let me get this straight. First the item is nominated for deletion because someone thinks the catchphrase is bogus. Then it’s acknowledged the catchphrase is legit but the content is nonsense because it doesn't pertain to Abbott and Costello. The entry does not have anything to do with Abbott and Costello other than to explain where the origins of Babbat came from. In the United States our language evolves pretty quickly and is littered with slang which often is very regional. For example; <a href="../../../f/o/_/Fo_shizzle.html" title="Fo shizzle">Fo shizzle</a> my <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizzle.html" title="Nizzle">nizzle</a> is non-English nonsense (why the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">hell</a> didnt that nominated for delete?). But if you are a teacher in Orange County California and tell your students they can’t use that in scrabble and that sideways N’s can’t be used as Z’s you'll be declared a racist and fired for being culturally insensitive. See <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebonics.html" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a> or <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_Vernacular_English_5350.html" title="African American Vernacular English">African American Vernacular English</a>. Because you have not heard <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babbat.html" title="Babbat">Babbat</a> used does not mean it is nonsense and not being used by people somewhere. I found an entry for <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_Girl_4b86.html" title="Valley Girl">Valley Girl</a> here at Wikipedia that describes nonsense terms like "Grody to the max", "Fer sure", "Gag me with a spoon" and what the origins of those words were. Now I'm sure if you surveyed a broad section of society no doubt they would think this was non-sense and just all around poor English. But if you asked the girl working at the Hot Dog On A Stick stand at the Valley Mall in <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encino.html" title="Encino">Encino</a> I'm sure she would tell you that it was very relevant to her and that it is just how she and her friends talk. Either way you argue it the fact is that it worked its way in to our culture and our language as evidenced by its entry here at Wikipedia and countless other sources. So let’s just call this what this is. An argument about cultural relevance which really has no place here. Cultural relevance crosses generational, geographical and racial boarders so much these days that what is relevant to one may be irrelevant and nonsense to another. We barely speak the same language from one coast to another anymore. Like it or not in certain circles <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babbat.html" title="Babbat">Babbat</a> is weaving its way in to conversation. If you hung out in brew pubs in Oregon or a DEFCON convention in Las Vegas you'd probably hear it so often that you’d ask “What the &amp;*^% does <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babbat.html" title="Babbat">Babbat</a> mean?” and is why I wrote that entry for <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babbat.html" title="Babbat">Babbat</a>. I was asked what it meant so many times that it was suggested I add it in Wikipedia. Which I might add was my first visit and only entry here. I actually took the time to read the manual, sign up for an account and post the thing. And I got to say I'm thoroughly unimpressed. I could care less if the entry stays or not. But as a community I think you guys got a lot of growing up to do if you're going to have a truly content rich site and not run people off who genuinely just want to contribute something. I can't even believe I'm having this discussion. The fact that Wikipedia gets caught in my spell checker and doesn’t appear anywhere in Webster’s is proof enough that you can make up anything you want, give it a meaning and it will catch on somewhere with some people. Catch a clue guys. I think <b>Catch a Clue</b> will be my next entry. MudPuppy610 10:28, 30 September 2005 (PST)</li>
<li>I have changed the page so that it is consistent with other entries on this site. MudPuppy610 11:42, 30 September 2005 (PST)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> Why not? Jake has a good point - I think this is a very valid entry. Believe it or not, I know some of these guys from DEFCON. I used to think there were four or five people who called themselves Babbat. The article set me straight. Thank you! I vote to keep the entry and allow it to be expanded. The person asking for deletion should move on to another victim entry. I'm really surprised that this is even an issue. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Alaninportland (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alaninportland_a9bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alaninportland">contribs</a>) , at 20:08, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The subject of the article is a dictionary entry of what is claimed to be an English word. <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> a dictionary, however, and therefore should not accept dictionary entries of any kind, even of established words with widespread usage—Wiktionary is the correct wiki project for such entries. However, this word cannot be entered there either, for it is a protologism. Therefore it is not a candidate for a transwiki. I note in passing that the entry also fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:Verifiability</a> and has elements that run afoul of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.
