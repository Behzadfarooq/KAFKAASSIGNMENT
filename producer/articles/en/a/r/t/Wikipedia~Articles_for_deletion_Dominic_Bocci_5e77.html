<p>Most articles/biographies on people have looked like resumes. What is the difference between someone's resume and a biography? A 'resume,' by definition, is simply a summary of facts, which I hardly find different than an encyclopedia article. If Bachrach44's intention is to imply that the author of the article is using wikipedia for the sole purpose of applying for a job, then it would appear that the article is a resume. However, the details included are not thorough enough to be used as a resume.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zoomer99 (<a href="../../../z/o/o/User_talk%7EZoomer99_e9a6.html" title="User talk:Zoomer99">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zoomer99_140d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zoomer99">contribs</a>).</small> 16:05, 28 April 2006</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have expressed interest in learning more about the present/past Presidential Interns at AUC. My interests are fueled by the desire to know what the past/present year's fellows have done professionally and academically, both in their past and at their time at the American University in Cairo. Whether the user created a page about himself or not, such information provides further important and detailed insight to those that work as Presidential interns and at the American University in Cairo. {{--Zoomer99 16:25, 28 April 2006 (UTC)unsigned|217.52.14.105}}</p>

<p>While it is a good suggestion to merge the information, maybe it would be a better idea to create a sub-article for the Program. The people picked for the program are the leaders of their fields in Middle Eastern Studies from the recent college-graduate pool of students. If 'merging' means to include the specific interns biographies into the AUC site, the AUC site is not developed enough to include that information as of yet. I still think that separate articles are necessary for the interns.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zoomer99 (<a href="../../../z/o/o/User_talk%7EZoomer99_e9a6.html" title="User talk:Zoomer99">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zoomer99_140d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zoomer99">contribs</a>).</small> 16:42, 28 April 2006</p>

<li>I don't, not remotely close; how exactly do "Presidential interns" at a university qualify under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, especially since their mentors may well not qualify under the Professor Test? <b>Strong Delete</b> under <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:56, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe it is an oversight to assume that the intern's supervisors 'may not' qualify under the Professor test.

Just because the interns or their supervisors may not qualify in your personal standards (RGTraynor), that does not mean that they do not warrant their own articles. Within the AUC community the interns' supervisors act at the highest level of University adminitration and the interns are under the ultimate supervision of the Office of the University President and the president himself. AUC, a major international institution, has significant importance within the Middle East. The sub-articles and articles' lack of development (both of AUC, the administration, the interns' supervisiors, and the actual interns) will be attended to. The interns are published authors, as well as award recipents (all of which is verifiable). Only time is needed to develop the articles.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zoomer99 (<a href="../../../z/o/o/User_talk%7EZoomer99_e9a6.html" title="User talk:Zoomer99">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zoomer99_140d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zoomer99">contribs</a>).</small> 17:24, 28 April 2006</p>

</ul>
<p>My argument is simply that the intern's supervisors are noteable within their cultural context (e.g. Egypt and the greater Middle East). The interns might merit their own article by the virtue of a 'notable award,' but i can see how at that point it is better to be merged with the American University in Cairo article. However, I still maintain that the interns by virtue of receiving a 'notable award' are validated. however, that's a subjective point.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dominicbocci (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dominicbocci_e4d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dominicbocci">contribs</a>).</small> 18:22, 28 April 2006</p>

<p>I think what the editor is attempting to do is fine. it "should be" the situation where the supervisors' profiles are being created as we speak. however, time is the main constraint here. i believe the editor is suggesting that for AUC, the Presidential Internship program is the 'notable award' (as far as AUC is concerned). So, the question becomes how 'notable' does the award need to be? Just because someone knows the difference between a Rhodes scholarship and a Fulbright, doesn't mean that either is more 'notable' than the other. I say, give the 'wiki'-writers time to develop the AUC site. Hopefully, what we're posting is being helpful and will greatly inform the writers' skill when writing these articles. as far as the last comment about the supervisors' notarity...after reviewing many professors 'biographies,' the articles do not adequately (as per wikipedia's requirement) really pass the Professor Test. So, give the writer's time...i'm sure it will all work out.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zoomer99 (<a href="../../../z/o/o/User_talk%7EZoomer99_e9a6.html" title="User talk:Zoomer99">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zoomer99_140d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zoomer99">contribs</a>).</small></p>
