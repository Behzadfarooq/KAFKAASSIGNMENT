<li>That’s not true. We are living amidst a new phenomenon. Up until now for example, the presenter of a CBS or any other notable TV show would be recognised as notable. YouTube is a new phenomenon, in that it is a media body in its seemingly trivial role as a video sharing site.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Under WP:BIO, William merits inclusion based on the criterion: "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". William is both an editor and an author of his own work. William's work has received hundreds of thousands of views by an international audience and has been independently commented upon and rated by that international audience. William's work may not feature in national galleries or on television, but this does not mean one can discriminate against the value of William's work, for on the basis of popularity alone, William's work is a notable achievement (and continues to become ever more notable). Moreover, if other YouTube celebrities are admissible into this encyclopedia, then so too should William be (you only have to look at William's subscription levels on YouTube as proof of his place amongst other YouTube celebrity peers). YouTube is an artistic phenomenon of our time that allows artists and others a vehicle to connect with the world, and in the case of some, YouTube delivers fame and notoriety, which cannot be dismissed as insignificant. --DavidRWilson 23:42, 4 November 2006 (UTC) <small>— DavidRWilson (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidRWilson_b329.html" title="User talk:DavidRWilson">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DavidRWilson_7538.html" title="Special:Contributions/DavidRWilson">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>
<ul>
<li>Are you kidding? Views and comments on Youtube do not count as "independent reviews"; that passage refers to actual written reviews. The other "Youtube celebrities" with articles at least have something resembling <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourcing</a> to back them up, though even those articles aren't without their controversy either. But without any chance of being <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, there's no way this article can stay here. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 23:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I see no value in being overly rigid about what constitutes notable. If it's something people are interested in knowing more about, it's worth having an article about. Why should the fact that his fame comes through YouTube make a difference? <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 00:50, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is, there has been no demonstration that this guy has any sort of "fame" <i>outside of</i> Youtube. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 23:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Suppose he doesn't. Why does that matter? If enough people see him on YouTube, and want to see a page on him, there should be a page for them to see. (Unless what you're worried about is verifiability, but what's written here is basically verifiable.)<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 03:09, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If he has no "fame" outside of Youtube, then there's no reason to have an article about him, no matter how many people watch his videos. The idea that "people on Youtube want to have an article about him" doesn't make him notable by Wikipedia standards. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 03:44, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand what you mean, "People <i>on YouTube</i>". The point is that <i>people</i> want to have an article on him; how is it possibly relevant whether they know him from YouTube or anywhere else? Where do the "Wikipedia standards" say anything about YouTube? 50,000 people watching his videos is 50,000 people. If you had decided that 50,000 was not enough exposure to be famous, I would understand your position, if disagree with it. But when you say that 50,000 is not enough because those are "people on YouTube", I don't understand your logic. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 04:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Views on Youtube do not equal notability. There have been numerous battles already involving the notability of other supposed "Youtube celebrities", and I generally support deletion of all of them, but some of those at least have some semblance of coverage in outside sources. This has <i>nothing</i> besides "people watching his videos want to write an article on him", which is completely irrelevant. Without outside sources, there can't even be a dispute; this should be deleted. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 05:23, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I came on Wikipedia today to see an article about William Sledd, and I got one. I was really surprised to see it was up for deletion. Some may see what he does as being useless and not notable.But before you delete this article, take into account how many people he makes happy. Whenever I'm sad or need really good fashion advice I look to William, he always seems to make my day. If that isn't notable, then I don't know what is.--Tezzy149 19:05, 5 November 2006 (UTC) –<small>User's tenth edit.</small>
<ul>
<li>Then you may need to read some of the policies and guidelines, like <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. There have been lot of battles over "Youtube celebrity" articles; the others that have been fought over at least had some kind of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> to back up the article. This one doesn't have anything that even attempts to back up the claims to this guy's supposed notability. It has to go. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 23:20, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have to go. The "guy's supposed notability" is evidenced from the number of comments and subscribers he has. If his youtube stats aren't enough, then look at the comments themselves.--<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArislan_a9db.html" title="User:Arislan">Arislan</a> 09:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not the Youtube directory. Notability isn't based on how many subscribers someone has there, or number of views of their videos, or anything like that that is only tied to the Youtube community. There has to be claim to some semblence of notability to the outside world, or there isn't even a valid argument for keeping this around. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 11:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In what way is the "YouTube community" not part of the "outside world"? They don't live on the same planet or something? This distinction you're trying to make doesn't make sense. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 19:43, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In general, in order for something to be notable it needs to be noticed by someone outside the community. For examples of how this works, you may want to see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:26, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"A large fan base" is one of the criteria listed in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. As for the person's "community", you're using a very broad definition of the word. I don't see how the so-labeled "community" of people who watch YouTube differs from the "communities" of people who watch CBS, or read the New York Times. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 23:48, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's listed under the section for <i>"Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions."</i> Youtube videos aren't covered under any of those. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 00:00, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a very dogmatic way to read what is, after all, a guideline. The whole point of guidelines is that it's impossible to cover every single contingency—they're simply guides to policy. A YouTube personality with a large fanbase is completely analogous to an actor with a fanbase (IMHO, of course). A fanbase is a fanbase. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 00:33, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not "dogmatic", that's what the guideline actually <i>says.</i> You can't compare actors who are known by millions around the world through movies, television, news coverage, etc. to Random Youtube Guy who no one else knows about and hasn't been covered by any outside sources. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 00:51, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure that's what it says; when that sentence was written, I doubt YouTube celebrities were even envisioned. My point stands: a guideline is meant as a general outline of policy, to be applied to specific cases through judgment. To say, "This is what is written—anything else is proscribed", is to be very dogmatic. That said, in your last comment, you did mention a solid distinction between actors and YouTube celebrities: millions versus tens of thousands. In my view 50,000 (viewers, smaller fanbase of course) <i>is</i> sufficient to be called notable, but that's an area of opinion where you're free to disagree, obviously. What I don't understand is the knee-jerk branding of "YouTube celebrities" as by definition non-notable. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 03:34, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Once again, the key is having significant recognition from outside sources, not a high hit count on Youtube. From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: <i>"If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it."</i> <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 10:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I hate to bring lonelygirl15 into this, but her reason for having a Wikipedia page is because she is a fake YouTuber. If a fake YouTuber gets a Wikipedia page, then why shouldn't a real one? They both used the same medium to become famous, it just so happens William Sledd is actually William Sledd. If it comes to this article being deleted, all I ask is that there is a possibility for this page to be recreated in the future. He has talent, maybe he'll have his own talk show. It's also very possible he won't get famous outside of YouTube, but you never know.--Tezzy149 22:33, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a vast oversimplification. Lonelygirl15's "fakeness" generated a lot of attention from outside sources, Sledd has not. If he does do something significant in the future, then there can be an article then. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 23:30, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>William may not be the focus of this article, but that is not the point. The point is, that a reliable third party source has testified to William's popularity on YouTube. This is independent verification of his YouTube celebrity. If the test of inclusion on this encyclopedia in William's case is popularity plus independent verification of that popularty, which combined constitutes "notable", then William has met that test. There is no need for this article to write extensively on William, all that is required is verification. --DavidRWilson 22:36, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is entirely wrong. The article you posted simply includes his name in a rather large list of high-rated users, at the end of a story that covers YouTube in general and doesn't mention him at all. This is not verification of any supposed "celebrity"; it's a trivial mention, and can't be used as a source.

<dd>The problem now is that this article will temp be deleted only to be reposted as soon as some media outlets document his rise to fame. I therefore suggest to prolong the deletion discussion.

<dd>If there isn't anything "documenting his rise to fame" <i>now</i>, then there can't be an article <i>now</i>. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 01:00, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now hold on a minute. I've been following the thread closely here. I'm the guy that started of this trend by creating the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renetto.html" title="Renetto">renetto</a> article. As I understand from what you have written above, the veracity of his notability is disputed since there is a lack of third party (media) coverage, of his fame. What is <i>not</i> in question is his fame, there is certainly no need for documentation of that point. On the other hand, he is rising to fame on only on YouTube and similar vlogging sites, which arguably is not a comparison to an independent media body yet. But yet again, the fact has it that he is in class of his own, in that he is the fastest rising subscribed member since <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geriatric1927.html" title="Geriatric1927">Geriatric1927</a> whose article here is well written and received a high visitor count. So he is famous now, but we are trying to establish how and why. Dont confuse your own points as put above by yourself in discrediting his notability. Yes we are waiting for sources outside of YouTube to write it up so we can attach them as sources at the end of this article, but no, there is no need to delete him speedily just because we cant wait a few days or a week. The bottom line is, YouTube is unique phenomenon in that it is a media body in itself, that Google have now bought that out is making this hard to see, since its going to be a monopoly, but if there would be a few popular vlogging sites, it would be more clear to us how their users are both independently and by being featured (as in media bodies) becoming notable. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChavatshimshon_82c9.html" title="User:Chavatshimshon">Chavatshimshon</a> 01:48, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>His "fame" is exactly what is in question; a high hit count can not solely determine fame or notability, as this is <i>not</i> the Youtube directory. You clearly need to get more acquainted with WP policies; once again, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V"><i>"If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it."</i></a> Without any reliable sources to verify this guy's supposed notability or any of the information in this article <i>at this moment</i>, there can not be an article about him <i>at this moment.</i> That is not in question by anyone who knows the policies. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 02:03, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>His fame according to standards for a wikipedia article is being questioned, not his fame as a celeb. He has accumulated 1000 new subscriptions in less than one week. People are coming here, reading the article, leaving and wikipedia lives on. Quite clearly this is not a cheap add and the article is a service. Agreed that there must be a source to link to the article with in the week. Until then what we have here is a bunch of new wiki editors, a new generation, bringing YouTube with them, and they are most welcome. I'm one of them. The guidelines on Internet memes will slowly evolve with our influx. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChavatshimshon_82c9.html" title="User:Chavatshimshon">Chavatshimshon</a> 02:17, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Wikipedia policies are not going to be changed because of people who want to write worthless articles on non-notable subjects. If your arguments have no basis in policy, then you have no real argument for keeping this article here. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 02:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe you're misinterpreting the word "third-party", WarpstarRider. Third-party sources are sources other than the editor himself. In this context, YouTube.com itself is surely a third-party source: the issue is verifiability, and statements which can be verified from youtube.com are verifiable. The statements in this article fall into that category. Some of them (i.e. information about hit count on a specific date) may no longer be verifiable; but when written were verifiable; those are debatable, but I think that if something is included legitimately, it should be valid, even if the source is no longer available. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 20:42, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For the thousandth time, no, YouTube stats <b>do not count</b>. The big box at the top of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> clarifies what that passage means: "<i>Articles should contain only material that has been <b>published by reliable sources.</b></i>" YouTube stats are <b>not</b> <i>reliable, published</i> sources. An entire article can not be included simply on the basis of a hit count; there have to be <b>reliable sources</b> verifying any claims of notability and any other information in the article. Until that exists, there <i>can not</i> be an article. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 22:08, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On the contrary, YouTube is a primary source. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> talks about information from blogs on YouTube—that's not at all the same as the statistics that YouTube itself publishes about the views, subscribers, etc. of its videos. It's ridiculous to think that YouTube, the primary source for this information, is unreliable about it, but if a newspaper would republish <i>the same information</i>, it would become reliable. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 05:44, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're still not getting it. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> again where it specifically says that <i>reliable, third-party, published sources</i> are absolutely required for an article's existence. Anything can be a primary source about itself; the very idea of verifiability is that there must be outside sources backing them up. The existence of enough such sources is what establishes a subject as notable. Now stop waving around the guy's YouTube stats, because that's not what we're looking for here. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 06:04, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
