<li><b>Keep</b> (author's comment) Perhaps this subject would sit easier in the Music and the Arts families. The problem here is that it was the assassination of Lincoln by the famous actor in his own right, John Wilkes Booth who saw himself as a combatant a few days after the close of the Civil War that effected the nation, AND the life of an emerging theatre tradition in America, which was put right by the assassin's brother, equally famous actor Edwin Booth with his actors club in New York. Members of this family were imprisoned at the time, and remained "infamous" for years. Individual family members could be in categories as diverse as "famous assassins" (John Wilkes), or "famous theatre dynasties" (Junius Brutus, Edwin), but that would be a black mark against one or the other. This article is my humble attempt to pull it together showing the dynamics and interactions between ALL the members of this family. And their much neglected historic family home Tudor Hall has just opened as a museum near Baltimore, which I've visited, where I'm sure they're trying to do the same thing. I'm the first to admit that the article needs to be fleshed out with references and external links, just a beginning, I was hoping that others might get involved.

<li><b>Keep</b> but only if cleaned up to focus on the notable members. A <i>brief</i> background is permissible but the point of the page should not be obscure silversmiths and they certainly should not be redlinked. As it is this is a rambling narrative that might go well in a family history but fails the encyclopedic test. Given that there are at least four notable members of this family, I think a genealogical page is appropriate instead of maintaining all these connections on the individual articles.

<li>There, you see, I did not know that Blair is married to the daughter of a Booth descendant. And there's no way I could know, without a notable "family page", which holds all the keys to such links. Also, to continue this discussion, there are similarities to a still living family which I happen to know a bit about, the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redgrave_family.html" title="Redgrave family">Redgrave family</a> and they rate their own page.

<li>Thank you. I have already tried to clean it up a bit. I've deleted reference to the family pre Junius as not necessary. This family is not generational like the Redgraves, so does not qualify as a dynasty, and therefore a genealogical layout doesn't help. It is, simply, the story of a remarkable and tragical theatre family, its members giving people lots to think about, and explore further. JohnClarknew 00:15, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've cleaned up the article, stripping out all of the extraneous information such as the siblings who died young. Some of this information could be merged into the Junius article, but most of it is of no value in an encyclopedia. The article now wikilinks the important members and shows how the brothers and in-laws are related. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:47, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete/Merge</b> some info with Wilkes/Junius articles.

I think I'm mostly in agreement with Bwithh's comment above: there aren't enough sources and citations to show that more than a couple of members of the family are notable. There's a reasonable chance those sources might exist, but as the article stands right now it's just a geneological listing of the questionably notable family of a definitely notable person, which as the original prod stated is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">not</a> what Wikipedia is for.

<li>John Wilkes and Edwin are both major notable persons.

It could use some more citations I think, maybe a link about the family in general (For an idea of what I mean, I like the second paragraph of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/archive/foth/booth.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nps.gov/archive/foth/booth.htm" rel="nofollow">this National Park Service page</a>), but I'm much more convinced this article is encyclopedic, or at least very close to it now. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowlynk_6f44.html" title="User:Shadowlynk">Shadowlynk</a> 10:09, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do think an encyclopedia should be factually correct. John Wilkes was not in the play. Also, the family was treated as an entity, and was punished, not just the notables. I don't think it was a tree at all. Any other voices out there? Join in. Two generations don't make a tree. Maybe a bush. JohnClarknew 17:07, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So he was not, JohnClarknew. He had access because he knew the owner of the theatre. Sorry about that! But as noted above Wikipedia is not a genealogy site, and I don't see justification for adding non-notable family members to this article. The <i>children</i> of Junius is something that belongs in that man's article. This is also not an article about the assassination, and insofar as any non-notable members were punished, that may fit better in the John Wilkes Booth article. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Our 5 days will soon be up. I want mainly to defend the title of the page, to retain "Booth family". There are some families, very few in fact, whose collective deeds are so unique and notable, that one wants to know more as an aid in understanding them. That's where genealogy becomes important. When investigating the conditions prevailing in the development of this family at different stages, the inclusion of dates becomes almost a <i>sine qua non</i>. For example, the guilt he must have felt abandoning his only son and his wife, what was the date? Later, he brought his father over to live with them, his father had abandoned his wife too. One of his daughters stayed home, a spinster, to take care of her mother. Then there were the deaths of 4 of his small children to smallpox and a local epidemic of cholera, could that have contributed to his alcoholism and dementia? He was a political radical, did his son John Wilkes feel compelled somehow to continue his father's radicalism after his father died, and murder our most famous President, let's see, that was thirteen years later? And what was the time frame after that when his brother was able to reverse society's condemnation of the family name and the profession of acting with his Players club? If there's precedent you want, there are other families which haven't given rise to these challenges; for example, if, as Dhartung says, Wikipedia is not a genealogy site, why then the genealogically presented <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bach_family.html" title="Bach family">Bach family</a>? He says Wikipedia is not for non-notables, then why was Irish immigrant not notable founder P.J. Kennedy important to the development of the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_family.html" title="Kennedy family">Kennedy family</a>? And why was the messy <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrymore_family.html" title="Barrymore family">Barrymore family</a> site not deleted? Others to compare might be <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Midgley_Family_e5b7.html" title="The Midgley Family">The Midgley Family</a> (who?), <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockefeller_family.html" title="Rockefeller family">Rockefeller family</a> (scores of non notables listed), <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godrej_family.html" title="Godrej family">Godrej family</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/p/Dupont_family.html" title="Dupont family">Dupont family</a> (fronted by <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Samuel_du_Pont_de_Nemours_3eb7.html" title="Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours">Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours</a>), and <a href="../../../j/a/u/Jauch_family.html" title="Jauch family">Jauch family</a>. So, again, I urge the retention of <u>at least</u> the title of the subject <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_family.html" title="Booth family">Booth family</a>. Dhartung has rewritten the page and deleted what he doesn't like, and he has a right to do this. But notice he has already come up with more links to the family name, WHICH IS WORKING BACKWARDS! If we can't lead off with the family name, we will have to provide more tidbits of information on each individual member's page, and leave it to the reader to connect the dots. Wikipedia is superior to other encyclopedias precisely because it is prepared to occasionally be a little provocative with unexpected accurate information in worthy situations, thus going a little further in aiding the student or researcher or writer in gaining a better understanding of the motivations of the members' actions. I can think of no other family with such built-in raging conflicts, finally resting in peace into eternity in a family gravesite, all of which makes them a very exciting subject. Please, let them be, don't cause them more rejection. JohnClarknew 06:42, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> JohnClarknew, you have to understand what Wikipedia is and is not. We are an encyclopedia. We are not a genealogical site, nor a place for family histories, nor of emotive narratives about children who died of cholera. What you seem to want is a psychological portrait of the family, which is fine in an article or a biography. It isn't appropriate here. Please also note that impassioned speeches are not what is needed in an Articles for Deletion debate; instead, you should be able to point to Wikipedia policy and how it is or is not satisfied. I'm glad you are excited by the subject, but you have to understand that what you write must fit here. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 01:55, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Dhartung, having studied again several articles on what Wikipedia is and is not, I fail to conclude that it is "not a genealogical site" or "a place for family histories". To proclaim "We are an encyclopedia" states the obvious, and is not enlightening. I believe that, judging from what I read, Wikipedia policy is not fixed, and there are no absolutes, but it is designed to bring information to many levels of its readership in the best and clearest way, and I believe that to give the Booths an article entitled <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_Family_2603.html" title="Booth Family">Booth Family</a>, unquestionably a noteworthy family, will serve as a SUMMARIZING ARTICLE which best leads the reader to whichever sections they wish to study further. You do not address the question why <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Midgley_Family_e5b7.html" title="The Midgley Family">The Midgley Family</a> belongs and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_Family_2603.html" title="Booth Family">Booth Family</a> does not, suggesting you have a double standard. This is a debate over whether to keep the article <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_Family_2603.html" title="Booth Family">Booth Family</a>. You have already rewritten the article (with an error which I had to correct) into the content which you feel is more appropriate. Now you've changed your mind, you want to delete the article altogether. I think you are wrong. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_Family_2603.html" title="Booth Family">Booth Family</a> should exist as an entry page, and does conform to the site's standards.

<li><b>Reply</b> JohnClarknew, you seem to be under the belief that I have argued for deletion of the article. I have not. I argued that it should be kept but rewritten under Wikipedia policy. It's hard to argue with someone who appears not to be reading what you say.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As I have stated above, we have developed guidelines (which are strong recommendations) and policies (which are firm rules). In AFD discussions arguing by example is counterproductive, because no other article is really under discussion. The question at hand is whether the existing article conforms to policy and reasonably fits within guidelines. Other articles that you cite could well be themeselves violations of either and their existence is not an argument that our policies are inconsistent. Please don't accuse me of having a double standard, especially since you have me on the wrong side of the fence. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:43, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK. 'Nuff said. Do we have a consensus? Who decides? JohnClarknew 02:31, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Usually admins close AfDs after a week. Normal users can occasionally close them when it's pretty much open-and-shut keep, but we had enough discussion and changed minds going here I don't think that applies. I'd still say it's likely a keep consensus, so we might as well just treat it as such and let the admins handle all the rubber stamping when they catch up the backlog. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowlynk_6f44.html" title="User:Shadowlynk">Shadowlynk</a> 08:48, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
