<li>Friends of mine do observe this 'holiday' in one way or the other, me too (yes, I am a coder). This is no new idea, it's been around for a while. Or do you think "what I can't find with google does not exist"?

<li>Please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to prove your assertion that this idea is not new.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Unfortunately, unless the person who told you is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> then the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> policy means that the article should be deleted. Google is not the only means of finding reliable sources, but in this case it should provide a fairly good guideline. If the holiday was celebrated by a recently discovered tribe with no written language then maybe we expect to find a lack of references on the web, but that's not the case with a coders' holiday. I assume the correct title should be "Programmers' Day" anyway, or is it for a specific but nameless programmer? <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 11:45, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, but it's not about whether the <i>idea</i> exists. Neither that link nor the one that's been added acknowledge it as anything more than a semi-joke proposed holiday.

<li>I don't see why. <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_Administrator_Appreciation_Day_4cb5.html" title="System Administrator Appreciation Day">SAAD</a> is a semi-joke as are most of the things related to geek culture. I agree that calling it <i>holiday</i> is a bit too much, but a little of reediting the article should solve the problem. -- mina86, 217.96.228.130 19:14, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've given an URL to a Polish article which clearly states that 13/09/2006 is the Programmers' Day. I assume that company such as IDG is a reliable source. At this point I don't really know what else you expect. It's obvious Programmers' Day is not an official holiday, however, the fact that it was mentioned on a website of a respectable magazine and the fact article on Polish Wikipedia was created on 25/07/2003 proves that it's not new idea shared among small group of people and as such should be mentioned on Wikipedia. The thing that astonishes me the most is that you want to delete Programmers' Day but want to keep SAAD whereas both <i>holidays</i> are a semi-joke and unofficial. -- mina86, 217.96.228.130 14:47, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only person to actually mention SAAD at all is you. This discussion is about Programmer's day, not about some other article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:22, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've just noticed that the article was deleted 2 years ago and reading the previous discussion shows another valid points: Why do you want do delete Programmers' Day but keep <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi_Day_e0fe.html" title="Pi Day">Pi Day</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_Day_b39a.html" title="Mole Day">Mole Day</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_root_day.html" title="Square root day">Square root day</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Towel_Day_e8ce.html" title="Towel Day">Towel Day</a>, and mentioned previously <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_Administrator_Appreciation_Day_4cb5.html" title="System Administrator Appreciation Day">SAAD</a>.

<ul>
<li>Please don't create straw men, or use the fallacious "If article X then article Y." argument. The article that you cite reports that 1 person is campaining to have this day made an official holiday. Where are all of the <i>other</i> people documenting this purported holiday? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:22, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All I'm saying is that I don't understand what's the big difference between Programmers' Day and the other days which make the former nominated for deletion. The article I cite also reports that "<i>Many programmers considered this day</i> [256th day of the year] <i>the informal professional holiday.</i>" And finally, the <i>other</i> people documenting this holiday are the editors of PC World. -- mina86, 217.96.228.130 13:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DON'T Delete</b>. Please dont delete this. I'm very proud of that holiday and I find that only a small part of the programmers know about it. We sould preserver it and keep it spreading.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Firstly, it hasn't got to be "a day off", it's more like April Fool's Day (that also to <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">Sjc</a>). MacGyver: Common sense doesn't help in any case (ref to your google evidence). BTW when I googled for "Programmer's Day" I found alot of hits that were referring to the article's topic - of course in between babble about "a programmer's day looks like..". On the other hand, deleting does not stop me from 'celebrating' that day. And the lack of 'written' documents about it that don't just cite wikipedia (or rather the tiny fractions of google hits that don't!), doesn't make it easy to come up with evidence. <a href="../../../b/u/l/User%7EBullhaddha_d015.html" title="User:Bullhaddha">tim</a>

<li><b>Keep</b> per significant PC World mention; PC World is definitely a reliable source, making this notable. Saying that something should be deleted just because new users want it kept is a silly reason to delete something, and I presume that the closing admin will disregard those opinions. Also, the nominator said that there were "ridiculously few" google hits, without giving a link. Upon further investigation, there are actually <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Programmer%27s+Day%22+-Wikipedia+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Programmer%27s+Day%22+-Wikipedia+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">15,000</a>. Not quite ridiculously few. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 04:16, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just a few days ago, there were barely any hits at all. It's gotten many mentions in the last few days only because a few popular blogs have linked to the Wikipedia article. I suppose we could rewrite the article to state the "Programmer's Day is a fictitious holiday invented in a Wikipedia article that was mentioned in many blogs in 2006", but covering such temporary internet fads doesn't make sense. Let's recreate the page if people still "celebrate" the holiday three years from now. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrik_8a6d.html" title="User:Fredrik">Fredrik Johansson</a> 12:58, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>This 'holiday' is definitely older than from this year. I remember greeting cards for this occasion available on yahoo some 5 years ago. Yes, that's not a reliable source, and I have better things to do than looking for one. At least your 'made-up' above was too quick a shot - at least it wasn't made up on wikipedia. I already gave my opinion/vote as "tim", so... <a href="../../../b/u/l/User%7EBullhaddha_d015.html" title="User:Bullhaddha">Bullhaddha</a> 20:30, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>To the contrary, there were absolutely no mentions to Wikipedia in any of those pages. Note the "-wikipedia" in the search term. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 16:11, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What about days like that: the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day_476c.html" title="Talk Like a Pirate Day">Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day</a>. As I understand, we only need somebody claiming having invented Programmer's Day, and it'll be valid.
