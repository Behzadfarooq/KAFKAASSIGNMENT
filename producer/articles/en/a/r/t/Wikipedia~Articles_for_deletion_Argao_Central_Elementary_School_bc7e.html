<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, practically all schools are notable because by their very nature, they have a reason for existing that differentiates them from other schools, hence they have notability for filling that niche.

<li><b>Comment</b> To your first sentence- absolutely not. The claim that "practically all schools are notable because by their very nature, they have a reason for existing that differentiates them from other schools, hence they have notability for filling that niche" is simply a long drawn out way of asserting that all schools are notable. The "niche" that these schools fill is no different than the different niches that corner stores and individual firehouses fulfill. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:06, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think individual firehouses <i>should</i> be automatically notable, actually. All towns are notable, and firehouses and schools are integrally connected to their town's governments in a way that banks and stores obviously aren't. But even without petitioning for a blanket notability for schools, it's still true that most schools can make a claim of notability, except maybe brand new schools that haven't existed long enough yet to generate verifiable sources for itself. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 03:20, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think we all agree that all schools, firehouses and corner stores are "notable", but this particular school is apparently one of just seven schools participating in a Unesco pilot program on health issues in a third world nation - what could be more significant than that? The fact that a supreme court chief justice started his journey here is just icing on the cake. In short, qualifies for inclusion (and we do not decide on the basis of google hits). --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:25, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe what Edgecution means is that this school is not notable since schools are not inherently notable and he finds the only notability claim in this case, the presence of a single notable alumnus, does not persuade him to consider the school to be notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:07, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't have a clue what you mean by the "only notability claim" nor could I define "notability claim". However, to set the record straight, this 80-year old school is part of a pilot Unesco program and has educated, among others, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. That is what we are here to discuss, not philosophical blah blah about firehouses, corner stores or other inherently unrelated issues such as opinions on the inherent worth of this or that. Apparently the inherent sarcasm in the first part of my initial comment was not evident; I hope it is now. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:37, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The problem with his argument though is that he says all schools are notable. That is not true and has never been agreed here at WP.

<li><b>Delete</b> Per the argument (noted above by <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgecution_0280.html" title="User:Edgecution">Edgecution</a>) that schools are in and of themselves inherently unnotable and don't warrant encyclopedic treatment.

<dd>But it IS Wikipedia policy that all towns are notable, even if they're the tiniest spot-in-the-road village. Therefore, it stands to reason that any given town's municipal functions are notable: public schools, courthouses, government buildings, firehouses, etc. This would not include banks, hospitals, stores, businesses, etc. which are <i>not</i> municipal functions. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 14:35, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Either the FRESH program can be covered in the UNESCO article, or if it is sufficently notable itself, the FRESH program might justify its own article, in which case such an article would belong in <a href="../../../u/n/e/Category%7EUNESCO_77d2.html" title="Category:UNESCO">Category:UNESCO</a> or possibly also <a href="../../../w/o/r/Category%7EWorld_Health_Organization_647e.html" title="Category:World Health Organization">Category:World Health Organization</a>.

<li>That is one way of looking at it. The other is that the school's participation in the program should be covered in an article on the school. As far as I'm concerned, that participation along with the other factors goes a long way to justifying this article's inclusion at wikipedia, which has everything to do with this AfD discussion. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:34, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To illustrate my point more concisely, consider any university of considerable age such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a>- it is one of the most notable schools still in existence, but the notability is a virtue imbued by the many great people that have done work there, and its many and broad contributions to culture, society, and academic life. That it is the oldest university still around is incidental to its notability; that is to say that it's a neat fact but it is only trappings and not to do with substance at all; that is how I justify saying that the age of a school can only ever be incidental to its notability. To stress, old schools very often are notable, but that is only by way of their achievements and staff's characteristics. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 15:58, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
