<p>[[Warehorne is a scattered community situated on the Hamstreet to Tenterden road (B2067) around seven miles southwest of Ashford. The Royal Military Canal passes through the parish.</p>
<p>One part of Warehorne is located near the village green. The Woolpack Inn and St Matthew's Church are linked by a tunnel built by smugglers.</p>
<p>Another part of the village is known as the Leacon. This is sited at the crossroads on the B2067 and contains the former schoolhouse and now abandoned cricket field.</p>
<p>A thrid part of Warehorne contains the World's Wonder pub and borders on the village of Kenardington.</p>
<p>Finally, part of the larger village of Hamstreet falls within Warehorne's parish boundaries, enabling the village to have sufficient population to retain its own parish council. The Saxon Shore Way links Warehorne with Hamstreet where the nearest shops and railway station can be found.]]</p>

<p>Orlestone is the name of the parish that contains the majority of Hamstreet village, 6 miles south of Ashford.</p>
<p>Orlestone itself is a small hamlet with just a handful of houses and the parish church of St Mary's. Much of the population moved to Hamstreet (originally known as Ham) when the Ashford to Hastings railway opened in 1853.</p>
<p>Today, the name Orlestone lives on in the Orlestone Forest (a large area of public woodland), and a number of buildings like Orlestone Grange and Orlestone Riding Centre (near Shadoxhurst).]]</p>

<p>âââSouthwarkâââ was one of the first districts in the county of Philadelphia. It had a very close relationship to the Swedish settlements of Wicaco and Moyamensing. The name was adopted from the name of a borough in the county of Surrey, England, immediately opposite the city of London. It was also a nod to the districts relationship to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The northeast boundary started at South Street and the Delaware River to South and proceeded to Passyunk Road. Passyunk was the western boundary and traveled south to Moyamensing Road; along Moyamensing and Keelerâs Lane to Greenwich Road and then back to the Delaware River. --South Philly</p>

Raised in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1684.html" title="1684">1684</a> as a combined infantry battalion for the German state of <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesse-Kassel_03b4.html" title="Hesse-Kassel">Hesse-Kassel</a>, the FÃ¼silier-Regiment von Knyphausen served in the Hessian army for 122 years and was one of the last regiments to be disbanded in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1806.html" title="1806">1806</a>.</p>
<p>The regiment was renamed several times, as follows:</p>
<p><b>1684</b> - Combined Regiment of Foot <b>1760</b> - FÃ¼silier-Regiment von Gilsa <b>1765</b> - FÃ¼silier-Regiment von Knyphausen <b>1784</b> - FÃ¼silier-Regiment von Donop <b>1789</b> - 2nd Btl.

<p>In August 1776, according to a treaty signed between <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_II_cbf3.html" title="Friedrich II">Friedrich II</a>, Langrave of Hesse-Kassel and King George III of England, the Regiment von Knyphausen, along with another 14 <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> regiments and 4 <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenadier.html" title="Grenadier">grenadier</a> battalions, arrived in New York City to fight the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> army under <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>.</p>
<p>During the war, the regiment gained honor at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Long_Island_0662.html" title="Battle of Long Island">Battle of Long Island</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_White_Plains_0c5c.html" title="Battle of White Plains">Battle of White Plains</a> and <a href="../../../f/t/2E/Ft._Washington_120f.html" title="Ft.

It served out the rest of the war garrisoning New York and Quebec City and returned to Europe in 1783.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>, it remained in Germany and fought during the first battles of the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>.

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><br />
Terrorist Financing is a topic that shot into the limelight after the tragic events of September 11 2001. The US passed the USA PATRIOT Act to ensure that both combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) and anti-money laundering (AML) was given adequate focus by US financial institutions. The act also had extra-jurisdictional impact and non-US banks having correspondent banking accounts or doing business with US banks had to upgrade their AML/CFT processes.</p>
<p><br />
Initially the focus of enforcement efforts for CFT purposes were on charities, unregistered money services businesses(MSBs) (so called underground banking or âHawalasâ), and registered MSBs that were unregulated for CFT. The FATF (working with the US) brought in 9 special recommendations for CFT which were recommended standards applicable to all FATF members who were expected to upgrade their laws, regulations and enforcement efforts including through Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) and cross-border sharing of information for CFT purposes. The FATF black-list (the NCCT list) mechanism was used to coerce countries to bring about change.</p>
<p><br />
US efforts have brought about a huge change to global CFT regulations and have ushered in a new era of information sharing. Saudi Arabian charities, which were prime sponsors of terrorist groups around the world, are now under much tighter controls albeit there is still a lot to do in the Middle East and South Asia. Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda are on the run albeit they are also innovating â in making/moving monies and in hiring of their key operatives - the new terrorist is a western educated middle class technology savvy person and the source for getting information on a do-it-yourself bomb is the internet.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering" rel="nofollow"><b>Money Laundering</b></a></p>
<p><br />
While the monies required for a terrorist act may be small (eg USD 5,000) the process of advocacy, training and sustaining sleeper operations (over years) is an expensive one that requires huge amounts of money. Since it is becoming more difficult for terrorists to raise monies from charities, terrorists are evolving and have moved into the money laundering space. Terrorists are now working with drug traffickers and criminals to make and launder the proceeds of crime like fraud, prostitution, intellectual property theft - this is now routine for them. Terrorists use low value but high volume fraud activity to fund their operations. Paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland are using legitimate businesses such as hotels, pubs and taxi operators to launder money and fund political activities. Even beyond Ireland, terrorists are buying out front-end businesses especially cash-intensive businesses including in some cases money services businesses to move monies. Bulk cash smuggling and placement through cash-intensive businesses is one typology. They are now also moving monies through the new online payment systems. They also use trade linked schemes to launder monies. Nonetheless, the older systems have not given way. Terrorists also continue to move monies through MSBs/ Hawalas, and through international ATM transactions. Charities also continue to be used in countries where controls are not so stringent.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Suspicious Activity</b></p>
<p><br />
Operation Green Quest is the US multi-agency task force set up in October 2001 to combat terrorist financing and had developed a checklist of suspicious activities. The following patterns of activity indicate collection and movement of funds that could be associated with terrorist financing:</p>
<p><br />
1) Account transactions that are inconsistent with past deposits or withdrawals such as cash, cheques, wires, etc. 2) Transactions involving a high volume of incoming or outgoing wire transfers, with no logical or apparent purpose that come from, go to, or transit through locations of concern, that is sanctioned countries, non-cooperative nations and sympathiser nations. 3) Unexplainable clearing or negotiation of third party cheques and their deposits in foreign bank accounts. 4) Structuring at multiple branches or the same branch with multiple activities. 5) Corporate layering, transfers between bank accounts of related entities or charities for no apparent reasons. 6) Wire transfers by charitable organisations to companies located in countries known to be bank or tax havens. 7) Lack of apparent fund raising activity, for example a lack of small cheques or typical donations associated with charitable bank deposits. 8) Using multiple accounts to collect funds that are then transferred to the same foreign beneficiaries 9) Transactions with no logical economic purpose, that is, no link between the activity of the organisation and other parties involved in the transaction. 10) Overlapping corporate officers, bank signatories, or other identifiable similarities associated with addresses, references and financial activities. 11) Cash debiting schemes in which deposits in the US correlate directly with ATM withdrawals in countries of concern. Reverse transactions of this nature are also suspicious. 12) Issuing cheques, money orders or other financial instruments, often numbered sequentially, to the same person or business, or to a person or business whose name is spelled similarly.</p>
<p><br />
It would be difficult to determine by the activity alone whether the particular act was related to terrorism or to organised crime. For this reason, these activities must be examined in context with other factors in order to determine a terrorist financing connection. Simple transactions can be found to be suspect and money laundering derived from terrorism will typically involve instances in which simple operations had been performed (retail foreign exchange operations, international transfer of funds) revealing links with other countries including FATF blacklisted countries. Some of the customers may have police records, particularly for trafficking in narcotics and weapons and may be linked with foreign terrorist groups. The funds may have moved through a state sponsor of terrorism or a country where there is a terrorism problem. A charity may be a link in the transaction.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Bank Processes</b></p>
<p><br />
In addition to normal AML controls, banks must focus on the CFT angle with renewed vigor and knowledge derived from the extensive databank of case studies now available. Banks must focus on not just name matching with sanctions databases but also with other know your customer (KYC) high-risk databases of good third party vendors. They must use technologies like link analysis to establish second and third level links that identify transactions as potentially suspicious from a CFT perspective. Focus on preventing identity theft is an integral part of any CFT program. Detection rules designed to capture the suspicious activity list given above, should be evaluated. Any bank that is used for terrorist financing will suffer tremendous reputational damage and also a real business impact in terms of share price and expensive fines.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Future</b></p>
<p><br />
Looking into the near future, if terrorist groups are replaced by smaller, decentralized groups, the premise that terrorists need a financial support network may become outdated. Moreover, some terrorist operations do not rely on outside sources of money and may now be self-funding, either through legitimate employment or low-level criminal activity, for example, the 7/7 London terrorists. Some experts argue that for anti-terrorism, disruption may be more effective than the CFT approach. If terrorists for example, just carry USD 10,000 in cash and donât route it through the banking system, the CFT approach would not be effective.</p>

<p>Megapith = giant ape anthropos = man Megapithicanthrope is the name given to the fictious race of the Dragonball universe called "saiyan/saiyajin" All saiyans (notnecessarily pure blooded) have an ability to transform into giant ape like animal called "Oozaru". To do this a saiyan needs to absorb, through his eyes, 17,000,000 zeno units of Bruits Rays [found only in sunlight reflected by a moon]. By doing so a saiyan becomes 10x powerful. Saiyans in Oozaru form can also shoot an energy beam from their mouth which they are seen extensively doing while destroying planet plant.</p>
<p>Theories of possible evolution: The megapithicanthropes have evolved this ability probably through persistant Atavism. Apart from this, the tail and sharp canines of the megapithicanthropes suggest an primate line of evolution. Apart from this Saiyan can interbreed with humans to produce fertile offspring - stunningly parrallel evolution. The possible explanation for transformation is that mutant saiyans with Atavistic patterns evolved transformation still incomplete. [which is painful to the saiyan community] This theory of incomplete evolution is based on following obsertvations: 1- Saiyans cannot control themselves fully in the Oozaru state [except vegeta] 2- Saiyans donot have any control over the transformation cycle - indicating its primitiveness. 3- Transformation is emotionally controlled (inspite of highly evolved brain) indicating that the brain evolved first and then the evolution of transformation cycle took place .This is a solid proof of mutant-atavistic evolution - sudden outburst of genes in the past generations. 4- Apart from this a painful tail (when touched) indicates that the megapithicanthropes are still in the middle of a rapid transition of one life cycle to the other.</p>
<p>The lifecycle seems to be lunar like many animals on earth.</p>

<p>Rachel Carter was born Rachel Lee Brewer in Searcy, AR in the mid 1970s. She began her theatrical career at Harding Academy in Searcy and continued it at Harding University. Her early career was marked by dramatic success and multiple acting awards. After getting her BA from Harding University, she formed the Persnickety Players Drama Ministry--a small touring troupe focused on sacred drama--with Scot Hale in Oklahoma City. Her graduate degrees from Oklahoma City University (MA) and the University of Oklahoma (MFA) focused on acting and directing respectively. She has directed dozens of plays and even written a few. Notably, Carter directed the play "On the Verge of The Geography of Yearning," which was named one of the Top Five dramatic events of 2003 by the Oklahoma Gazette.

<p>A conditioned response is a reaction to a stimulus which has been adapted into a behaviour. For example, a person experiencing chemotherapy may eventually, through classical conditioning, feel nausea before any chemotherapy drugs have been administered. This may be tiggered by just seeing a syringe or other stimuli relating to the therapy.</p>

<p>World Currency Unit</p>
<p><br />
The World Currency Unit is an indexed unit of account that stands for a unit of stable global purchasing power. Proposed by Ho(2000), it was first intended to be the basis for denominating global bonds, a debt instrument that is issued globally and subscribable by people around the world. Since each unit by design represents a stable unit of purchasing power, the stipulated interest rate on WCU-denominated bonds represents a real interest rate. In principle, the common denomination of bonds using the WCU will produce more efficient capital markets, as savers and borrowers converge in their understanding of what each basis point of interest means. Irving Fisher in his 1911 book The Purchasing Power of Money had advised that to serve as a unit of account, a trusted medium of exchange, and a reliable store of value the purchasing power of money should be stable. Unfortunately, substances that exist by the bounty of nature, such as gold or silver, cannot have such property since their values fluctuate with changing supply and demand. To be meaningful in terms of stable global purchasing power, a WCU will have to represent a basket of global output. By definition, the WCU represents the sum of the gross domestic products of key market economies in the world, namely the US, the Euro zone and UK, Japan, Canada, and Australia. Addition of these GDPs, each in a separate currency, is done by converting all GDPs into US dollar values in the base year. The sum of these GDPs are then scaled down to equal $100 in the base year. The scaling factor then becomes part of the definition of the WCU, as it defines the size of the GDP basket. The nominal value of this unit will rise with inflation in each economy. Moreover, the nominal value of this unit will rise if the base currency appreciates against the US dollar. Savers who purchase such bonds not only enjoy protection against inflation, but the benefit of diversification of exchange risks.</p>

<p>4. Research Contract with Princeton University</p>
<p>Mr. McDaniel advised of the placing of a $ 50,000 research contract with Princeton University for the investigation of the transport and reaction phenomena in light elements under the direction of Dr. Lyman Spitzer. It was pointed out that the work to be done was in the area in which physicist Ronald Richter, working in the Argentine, had claimed success. In this connection and in answer to a question by Mr. Dean, Mr. McDaniel said that as yet it had not been possible to arrange for a visit by an AEC representative to the Argentine to discuss Dr. Richter's findings. Mr. Smyth said he understood that Mr. Colby was due soon to return from aboard where he had seen Dr. Bakker who had recently returned from the Argentine. Mr. Dean said he felt the Commission should renew attempts to secure further information on Ritcher's work should Mr. Colby's report so indicate. At this point Mr. McDaniel left the meeting.</p>

<p>Oracles and Soothsayers are much like our modern day fortune tellers. Soothsayers were often sought to for advice and were also brought along on military expeditions for guidance. They would inspect the insides of animals sacrificed for signs from the deites. Soothsayers also used signs of the world to tell the future, commonly using birds. When Greeks visited the Oracles in shrines and holy places, they would talk to a priest who would speak with the Oracle, then send the message to the enquirer. Though advice from Oracles was often misunderstood, for example; there once was a man who asked the Oracle of the future. The Oracle told him that a great kingdom would soon be conquered, so the man declared battle on the Persians. Little did he know upon going to battle, that it would soon be his own kingdom to fall.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy X is probably one of the most life consuming RPG's ever created, on the first playing it takes about 78hours too complete it including the mini missions and the vast exploring of some of the most graphically beatiful landscapes ever seen. The graphics on the characters occasionally stick are made up by the mind blowing FMVS and as i said the details on the landscapes.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Story <i>Italic text</i> spoilers!</p>
<p>Final Fantasy X is based around a young male called Tidus (Tea-dus) being transported from his dream world into a world called Spira.</p>

<p>LIGA is a process that was developed in the early 1980's by W. Ehrfeld at the West German IMT in Karlsruhe. It is an acronym standing for the stages [informative image] in the overall process: LIthogafie Galvanoformung Abformung. LIGA was one of the first major techniques to allow high aspect ratio structures (in other words, very skinny and tall) with lateral dimensions below one micron in size (~100's of nm) to be manufactured on-demand in a research environment (you still need a synchrotron radiation source, however).</p>
<p>But in a loose sense, LIGA is a deep X-ray + electrochemistry version of the late 18th century process of lithography (writing in stone), in which a thin coating of wax, grease, or ink on stone or metal is scribed with a pick, and the unprotected areas are etched with acid. When the wax is removed by heating, you are left with a patterned piece of material, suitable as a work of art, or as a replica master stamp that can be used to print almost unlimited negative duplicates of the original hand-sketched pattern. While photolithography has been used extensively in integrated circuit manufacture for almost 50 years, nanostructured stamp lithography techniques to pattern silicon and other device-relevant materials have recently been improved enough to offer a realistic alternative to purely radiation-based patterning and formation methods.</p>
<p>Whereas LIGA greatly assisted research in micromachining and MEMS, leading elements of nanotechnology will likely take advantage of the various new forms of nano-contact printing.</p>

<p>Although the A2070 carries on beyond to Kennington where it meets the <a href="../../../a/2/8/A28.html" title="A28">A28</a>, this last two miles is non-primary and non-trunk.</p>

<p>The Church Missionary Society (CMS), as a boarding school for boys, founded the CMS Grammar School, Lagos, the oldest secondary grammar school in Nigeria, on 6th June 1859.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first Anglican Missionaries, who had arrived in Lagos, from Sierra Leone, in 1842, and had established the Yoruba Mission, soon realized the need for a good secondary school for their missionary work in Lagos. It was these missionaries of the Yoruba Mission that founded the School, the primary aim of which was to offer boys the opportunity of having secondary school education, which was not then available in Lagos. Some local merchants and traders also contributed funds towards the founding of the school. The CMS Grammar School in Freetown, Sierra Leone, had been founded a few years earlier.</p>
<p>The School started with only six pupils, all boarders, in a small, single storey building, the 'Cotton House' at Broad Street, the present site of Hallmark Bank (UTC) Building. For decades after it was "founded, it was the only secondary grammar school that offered boys training as future leaders of Nigeria. Until recently, most of the Anglican Clergy in Nigeria were products of the CMS Grammar School, as were the early administration. Though a Mission school, it does not discriminate in its admissions, with boys from different religious background being offered admission into the school through an entrance examination.</p>
<p>Later, after a British colony was established in Lagos in 1861, the British colonial authorities recruited most of their local clerical and technical staff from the School. Among these were Dr. Henry Carr, the first African Inspector of Education and, later, Administrator General of Lagos Colony, and Herbert Macaulay, who later trained as Surveyor.</p>
<p>From its inception, the School's motto has been 'Nisi Dominus Frustra', extracted from Psalm 127, meaning 'Without God we labour in Vain', which enshrined the faith of the founding fathers, and the tradition of the School.</p>
<p>The first Principal of the School, often referred to as its Founder, was the Reverend Thomas Babington Macaulay, the father of the great Nigerian Nationalist, Herbert Heelas Macaulay. As a young lad, he had been taken from Fourah Bay College, Freetown, Sierra Leone, and sent to England for training as an Anglican Priest at the CMS Training College, at Islington and, later, at King's College, University of London, from where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Arts. On completing his training in London, he was sent to Lagos in 1852 as an Anglican Missionary from where he was posted to the Anglican Training Institute at Ikija, Abeokuta. There his superintendent, the Reverend Henry Townsend noted that his considerable talents could be put to better use as a schoolmaster. After six frustrating years at Ikija, he found his way back to Lagos and took the lead in plans for the founding of the School. It was he who laid the early traditions of the School, having been its Principal from 1859 until his death in 1879, a total of twenty years. He developed the CMS Grammar School into a famous school, and was reputed to be a stern disciplinarian determined to instill moral discipline in the boys under his charge.</p>
<p>From the start he made it his priority to assist the boys in the development of their character and to prepare them for public service. This has remained the tradition of the School.</p>
<p>Later, the School moved down the road from its 'Cotton House' site at Broad Street, to more spacious accommodation, at the junction of Broad Street and Odunlami Street, now the premises of the Lagos Central Library, and NITEL. It was on the new site that the first school Science laboratory was built in 1929, together with the Assembly Hall, the Principal's Lodge, and a dining room for the boarders.</p>
<p>The school has been fortunate in having a success of dedicated and diligent Principals who have continued to maintain its excellent academic traditions and moral discipline. Among these were the Reverend (later Bishop) Isaac Oluwole, the third Principal, who headed the school from 1881-1893. This grandson, the Very ReverendT. A. J Oluwole, an old boy, retired recently as the Provost of the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos, with which the School has always had strong connections. His predecessor as acting Principal, from 1879 to 1881, was Archdeacon Henry Johnson, in 1896, the Reverend Joseph Suberu Fanimokun took over the School as Principal until 1914, in which year Nigeria became a British Protectorate after its amalgamation. In 1909, fifty years after the founding of the School, the first state secondary school, King's College, the colonial administrator established Lagos, with most of its foundation students drawn from the CMS Grammar School. The Reverend Canon (later Professor) E.J. Evans, a Scientist and well known author of science books for secondary schools, who introduced the teaching of Science in the School, succeeded Reverend Fanimokun as Principal in 1951. It was he who in 1919 composed the music of the School song, which was later harmonized by Fela Sowande, an old boy of the school. On leaving the school, Mr. E. J. Evans later became a Professor at the University of London. In 1929, the Reverend F. Watherton took over as Principal.</p>
<p>During his tenure, some students in the School were successfully presented in 1931 for the new Senior Cambridge Certificate Examinations. The following year the Revd Watherton left the School following his appointment as Principal of the new Igbobi College, jointly founded by the Anglican and Methodist Missions. The CMS Grammar School again provided Igbobi with some of its foundation students.</p>
<p>The mild mannered Ven. (Dr.) J. Olumide Lucas succeeded Reverend Watherton as acting Principal. Ven. J. Olumide Lucas, a great scholar, author, music composer, and theologian, left the School in 1935 on being appointed the Vicar of St. Paul's Church, Breadfruit. The boarding house has recently been named after him in recognition of his contribution to the School. He had been preceded by three expatriates, and was succeeded by another, The Reverend C.G. Thorne who spent a year only as Principal of the School.</p>
<p>Mr. L.J. Lewis, a Zoologist, and Senior Science Master from St. Andrews College, Oyo, succeeded Reverend Thorne in 1936 as Principal. Mr. Lewis, popularly known by the boys as 'Jeki' maintained strict discipline in the School and won the respect of parents and the public. He did not hesitate in flogging errand boys. When a few boys from wealthy families became unruly he expelled them from the School. It was he who introduced the preparatory class in the School by which boys drawn mainly from CMS Girls School were admitted and prepared for the entrance examination to the School. He left in 1944, and subsequently became a Professor at the Institute of Education in the University of London.</p>
<p>Such was his commitment to the development of education in Africa that he ended his academic career in the 1980s as the vice chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe. During his tenure as Principal, the teaching of Science in the School flourished so much that Science Tutors from other schools came to the CMS Grammar School for further training, and to use its excellent Science Laboratories. Some students came to the School for the preliminary science course, preparatory to entering the Yaba Higher College for the Diploma course in Science. He was ably assisted in the teaching of Science by Mr. C. O. Taiwo (later Professor) and Mr. C. A. Fawole, both of whom had read science at Yaba Higher College.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>During the World War II in 1942, those reading Science were evacuated from Yaba Higher College to the CMS Grammar School to complete their diploma course. Mr. Lewis was the last of the great expatriate principals of the School, all of who left an indelible mark on it.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Reverend (later Bishop) S. O. Odutola succeeded Mr. L.J Lewis in 1944, as acting Principal. It was he who expanded the Science laboratories in the School. He was replaced, as Principal, by Reverend (later Bishop) Seth I. Kale, who left in 1949 for St. Andrews College, Oyo, which had been founded in 1896 by the Anglican Mission as a Teacher training college. Under Reverend Kale the teaching of Science in the school continued to flourish with the recruitment of more science teachers and the expansion of Science laboratories in the school. Kale House, one of the houses to which boys in the School are distributed, has been named after him.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In 1950 the Reverend Canon (later Archdeacon) B.A. Adelaja, an old boy of the School himself, took over as Principal of the School. He remained Principal for twenty years. When he left in 1970 he had equaled the feat achieved by the first Principal of the School, the Reverend Thomas Babington Macaulay, who also served for twenty years. It was during the long tenure of Reverend Canon Adelaja as Principal that the school, after years of careful preparation, moved in 1958 to its present site at Bariga, then virtually a virgin land on the outskirts of Lagos. The school later became the anchor for the economic development of that region of Lagos.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Understandably, many Old Grammarians, who remained sentimentally attached to the old site at Odunlami, privately expressed their reservations about the School moving to Bariga. In retrospect, the decision to move the School to Bariga was wise and justified, as the old site in Central Lagos had become too small and cramped for the School, which needed new facilities. Oga built new athletic facilities and created a campus setting for CMS. A four story building, the Science Block, was devoted to science alone (biology, chemistry and physics on each floor). Dormitory and classroom facilities were expanded and new staff quarters were constructed for teachers. All of these were accomplished at the new site during the tenure of Reverend Canon Adelaja. CMS Grammar Scool made significant strides in sports during the tenure of Canon Adelaja. Known affectionately as 'Oga' by the boys, Reverend Canon Adelaja will always be remembered for his outstanding contribution to the fame and physical development of the School, during his tenure as Principal. It is in recognition of this that the School Hall was posthumously named after him.</p>
<p>Happily, Mr. (later Chief) I. A. Olowu, who had taught in the School for many years and served for a while as Vice Principal under Canon Adelaja, returned as its Principal who loved the School and the-boys. In his 80's now, he has continued, almost without fail, to attend the annual Founders' Day Service at the Cathedral. He was a great tutor of Latin and Geography who did not brook any intellectual indolence from the students. He also took a keen interest in the career and progress of the boys after they had left the School. It was during his tenure that the School excelled in sports, winning may national and international laurels.</p>
<p>Many of the tutors of the School will always be remembered with affection by old boys for their immense contribution to the progress and fame of the School. These include Mr. (later Professor) E.O. Taiwo who joined the School in 1939 as Senior Science Master and later, Master of the Boarding House. It was from the School that he won a government scholarship in 1944 to study Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In his excellent book 'Seventy years in the Nigerian Education System' he says he had happy reminiscences of the School of whose remarkable achievements he is immensely proud. Professor C. O. Taiwo was honoured by OGS in December 2003, with the award of Honorary Member of the Old Grammarians' Society.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Others were Reverend S.R.S. Nicholas, who came from Adisadel College, Cape Coast, Ghana, and who succeeded Mr. T aiwo as Master of B.oarding House, Mr. A.O. Ogedengbe, D.O. Fagunwa (the Yoruba Author), J .A.O Odebiyi (later Minister in the Old Western Region and Senator), 5.0. Olagbaju (Tutor in Music, and Organist for decades at St. Paul's Church, Breadfruit) Pa J. A. Adeniji (People' Warden at the Cathedral), who taught two generations of Grammarians, Pa. Ogunba, the great Geometry Tutor, and Pa Adeyemi, who did not spare the rod on unruly boys. Regrettably, in 1979 the Lagos State Government, pleading public interest, took over the school, like all other private secondary schools in Lagos. Predictably, under government control, the School was badly neglected, and its high academic standards fell. The School's boarding house was abandoned; its staff quarters acquired by the government, and new state schools were built on its grounds. Student enrolment in the' school increased significantly. But owing to lack of funds the Lagos State Government was not able to maintain the excellent facilities in the School.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Principals brought in by the Government to run the School were really not committed to the school. They were also constrained by lack of funds. The Laboratory Block of the School In 2001, under pressure from old boys of the School, and the OGS, it was returned to its owners, the Anglican Diocese, but without any financial compensation whatever. The agitation for the return of the School to the Anglican Diocese was led by Mr. Akintola Williams, Chief F.R.A Williams, SAN, Otunba T.O.S. Benson SAN, Maj. General Henry Adefope, Chief G.O.K. Ajayi SAN, and Ambassador Oladapo Fafowora, among others.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gradually, the facilities in the School are being rehabilitated with the financial support of the old boys. It has now been fenced off completely. Instead of the five or six streams imposed on the School by the government, it now runs two streams.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Restoring the School to its Old Glory has been a Herculean task. But it is a task that the OGS is determined to complete.</p>
<p><br />
Since 1859, when the School was founded, it has made an outstanding contribution to the development of secondary school education in Nigeria. It has certainly fulfilled the dreams of its founders by producing some of Nigeria's great leaders in all walks of life. This is a legacy of which Old Grammarians will always be proud. It is all owed to its Founder and First Principal, The Reverend Thomas Babington Macaulay. The following poem written by Mr. Akintola Williams in 1938 as a fitting tribute to Reverend T. B. Macaulay won him the Eric Moore Prize for English, and appeared in "The Grammarian" Magazine of that year.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reverend Macaulay thou that foundest Nigeria's high school of fame unbounded In thy grace a paradise thou foundest For true heavenly calling thou has heeded Thy institution has been flourishing Thy name perpetuated the walls within. Loyal citizens has it created And many to Christ has it converted.</p>

<p>Ravensteinâs Laws of Migration: 1. The majority of migrants move a short distance. 2. Each current of migration produces a countercurrent of lesser strength. 3. Migrants going a long distance usually go to a major city. 4. Females are more migratory than males over short distances but more males are involved in international migration. 5. Most migrants are adults. 6. Large towns grow more by migration than by natural increase. 7. The major migratory flows are from rural to urban areas.</p>
