<p>I recommend that this page be deleted and the material, minus the silly, unsubstantiated "starvation" rumors, merged back into <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garfield.html" title="Garfield">Garfield</a>. These strips do not merit a standalone page, and the rumors and "theories" which, for all we know, originated on Wikipedia, need to be purged. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderbunny_ebbf.html" title="User:Thunderbunny">Thunderbunny</a> 00:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep: Although the starvation rumors are unsubstanciated and seem to have already been removed, the story deserves its own entry because of the controversy it has caused among fans. I would go as far as to say that the entry should contain a reference to the starvation theory but mention what the author has said about it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.7.143.249 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.7.143.249_296e.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.7.143.249">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>I disagree with the request to delete this page. There is nothing 'silly' about the 'starvation theories' as they are just that; theories. Never once is it stated that any one of those theories are fact, and I like the idea of having alternative viewpoints available to read. Babywiththepower 00:05, 9 August 2006 (CST)

<li>I frankly have to wholly agree with Thunderbunny for the reasons he has stated, and would also like to vote for delete/merge. It was perfectly fine in the Garfield article. 24.9.10.235 05:24, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I vote against deletion - either keep the page or merge the content back into the original Garfield article. The dead/starvation theories arise quite convincingly from the Halloween strips themselves. The similarity to the animated short ""Feline Fantasies" is also provocative and Jim Davis' comments about the strips provide an interesting insight that would be lost with deletion. Keep the page.

<li>"Do Not Delete". There are a number of fan sites that have posted the comics in question discuss some of the theories mentioned in the article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is nothing but original research and unreliable sources. Of the five references, three are primary sources (the actual strips) and two are blogs (which are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>). Are we to take a blog author's word that someone else met Jim Davis and Jim Davis laughed about this? There's no reason to doubt it, but that doesn't make the material suitable for Wikipedia, either.

<li>"Delete" For what it's worth, I'm the one who posted the Jim Davis quote on BoingBoing. Though you have nobody's word but my own, if you click on my link in the posting, you'll be directed to my listing on creativehotlist. There, you can see my resume and some of my licensed work. Though this is hardly rock-solid verification, it does give you some reason to believe that I at least work at Hallmark (in the license design department) and there is a possibility that I went to Muncie and met with Jim... which is quite true. He said what he said and I repeated it as accurately as I could. Of course the theories are more fun, so continue to believe what you like. Cabooglio 20:43, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

The interest in this odd, yet interesting, subsection of Garfield has become larger and larger--arguably after the creation of the garfieldisdead.ytmnd.com/ Garfield Is Dead page.

For my two cents, there might be an entire article on just Garfield criticism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the "home" entry is very complete and well-written; I think merging would detract from its comprehensiveness and clarity. <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorjus_74e2.html" title="User:Gorjus">Gorjus</a> 20:26, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This storyline seems to have proven semi-notability, and as Jim Davis has already refuted the theories, the article can have an accurate and resolved viewpoint. The lack of Google Hits on "Garfield Halloween Strips" is not meaningful, as I have seen these strips referred to under many names, none being "Garfield Halloween Strips", which simply constitutes a rename of the article. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomnason1010_616f.html" title="User:Tomnason1010">Tom</a> 20:37, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Notability is not the issue here. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> are. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 23:09, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
