<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-29_133b.html" title="Edit section: Fall to Grace">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fall to Grace</span></h2>
<p><b>Fall to Grace</b>, a metalcore band, located in the heart of America, reaches out to todays youth with angst ridden thrashing and soul southing melodies. The band formed in 2005, striking onto the local scene with a bang. Formed by Casey McLain and Dan Albrechtsen (guitarists), after a breif stint with other bands. The two eventually found a drummer in Trevor Kinkade, and they became Fall to Grace. After trying with many other members they settled on the current line up of Casey McLain (guitar), Dan Albrechtsen (guitar), Trevor Kinkade (drums), Josiah Ury (keyboard), Nick Brown (bass), and Kole Young (vocals).</p>
<p><br />
The heart of fall to grace has been around for a few years, and it only came about after the demise of the two short-lived local bands Aftermath and Wastegate. The two guitarist from each band had started a friendship and began studying theory and writting music together. In an attempt to put together a band Casey had turned to his younger cousin Trevor and asked him to experiment with him and Dan. After a few trial practices it was decided that these three would be the ones to bring foward the unstoppable force known as Fall to Grace. A bass player was all they needed to complete their musical emsemble, they found talent in a Jazz student attending SWCC, but with the complication in transfers he was unable to play with the boys. In a very desperate attempt to complete the sound the asked a hopefull guitar player that had previously played withTrevor to trade in his six-string machine for the smooth bass, this was Nick. Now they needed a singer to bring a voice to fall to grace. They brought in Nick's cousin, Braydon Potter, to singer and they played a successful show in Winterset, IA at the legion hall. The differences in musical direction had forced the band to make Braydon leave and in replaceing him they found an old friend with a metal soul to bring a face and voice to fall to grace, Kole young. His determination gave them recordings to post on the popular website myspace.com and with this came a gig on a highly respected show in the Midwest scene, Cornstock, in Carbon, IA. That night they played with the likes of 8Foundead, Index Case, and Venaculas. Shortly after Kole's religious beleifs drove him away to college to practice his studies. Currently without a singer Fall to Grace is still rocking balls in Creston, IA.</p>

Named after American philosopher <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Royce_b2c3.html" title="Josiah Royce">Josiah Royce</a>, the building contains a concert hall, classrooms, offices, and meeting rooms.

<p>Eric (Rick) Heller (b. 1946) is a full professor of chemistry and of physics at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>. Heller is also known for producing digital art based on the results of his numerical simulations.</p>
<p>Heller is known primarily for his work in the 1970's and 1980's on time dependent quantum mechanics. In particular, Heller pioneered a time-dependent <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavepacket.html" title="Wavepacket">wavepacket</a> picture of quantum mechanics, which allowed the excited-state dynamics of large quantum mechanical systems to be understood without calculating eigenstates. Heller's most widely applied method is one called "frozen Gaussians," a method of wavepacket propagation. Heller's work laid the foundations for a theoretical understanding of <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femtochemistry.html" title="Femtochemistry">femtochemistry</a>.</p>
<p>In physics, Heller is known for his work on <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_chaos.html" title="Quantum chaos">quantum chaos</a>, particularly on scar theory. Heller's work in the last ten years has focused on the study of two dimensional electron gases, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mirage.html" title="Quantum mirage">quantum mirages</a> in quantum corrals, scattering theory, as well as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freak_waves.html" title="Freak waves">freak waves</a> in the ocean. Many of these studies make use of the time-dependent quantum mechanics ideas from his earlier work.</p>
<p>Heller is a member of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Academy_of_Quantum_Molecular_Science_1dca.html" title="International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science">International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science</a>, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academy_of_Sciences_baad.html" title="National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>, and a number of other scientific societies.

<p>Born in Polan on Sept 18th 1981, Mateusz Lewczuk spent the first seven years of his life in Warsaw. He then moved with his family to Canada where he resided in Campbell River for the duration of his addolesence. His post secondary education began at north island collage, and after completing the first year of his undergraduate degree he moved on to complete his bachelors of science at the University of Victoria(UVic). Soon after he applied and was accepted to the masters program in high energy particle physics at UVic. Since then he has presented his ongoing work to his collaborators and scientists outside of his collaboration. He is currently set to defend his thesis on high multiplicty tau decays which will be the most accurate measurement of this decay to date. Barring any major disasters during his defense, Mateusz will go on to do his PhD, possibly in the study of CP violating three pion tau decays.</p>
<p>Mateusz Lewczuk is an avid supporter of himself and thinks all are better of for knowing about him.</p>

<p>Hoki Ryu is a style of iaijutsu common to Kyushu specifically Kumamoto &amp; Fukuoka. Unlike many of its counterparts, Hoki Ryu's waza are few in nature. A primary characteristic of Hoki Ryu is the use of a stabbing motion into an oppenent's lower abdomen area. This is usually done with a kiai.</p>

<p>Jon Paul Steuer had his first speaking role as Alexander son of Worf on Star Trek: The Next Generation when he was six years old. He had a few other bit parts here and there before getting his first big role as Quentin Kelly on Grace Under Fire. He also had a small role in Little Giants. In Grace Under Fire's last season, he lost his job to one of his Little Giants costars, Sam Horrigan when, in an attempt to improve sagging ratings, the writers tried making Quinton a more athletic ladies' man type of character and Steuer was considered too small to convincingly play this role. Since giving up acting, Jon Paul (who now goes by Jonny P) has become the lead singer for the metal-punk band the Soda Pop Kids. They recently released their first album which was somewhat successful. He wears wild cloths, tons of makeup, and is dating my friend Lina.</p>
