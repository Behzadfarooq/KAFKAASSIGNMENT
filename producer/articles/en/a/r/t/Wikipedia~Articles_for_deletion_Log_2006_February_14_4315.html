<p>As discussed in here, "laypeople" is fuzzy and useless, and "born-again" is either useless, or includes only those Christians who we can verify actually <i>said</i> "I am born-again" — leaving us with a very small or empty list. But is it even worth making this distinction?</p>
<p>I have been trying to get the list merged, but since we can't agree on where to merge it to, we should simply delete it.

<p><b>Delete</b> (I agreed with delete, "support" might look confusing here) "Born-again" is kind of becoming a catch phrase term that's perhaps not very meaningful and difficult to pin down. The Barna Poll people do try by defining born-agains as "people who said they have made a personal commitment to Jesus Christ that is still important in their life today and who also indicated they believe that when they die they will go to Heaven because they had confessed their sins and had accepted Jesus Christ as their savior."<a href="http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&amp;BarnaUpdateID=105" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&amp;BarnaUpdateID=105" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> It'd be difficult to verify who believes all those things and also that definition is kind of vague. Plus this term can be contentious because of confusion.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:34, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just adding a thought. When I go to wikipedia, I am looking for an overview first (what the *#$&amp; is this term?) then I can always delve deeper using the extra links. A list of people who have actually referred to themselves as "born again" is simply useless - EVEN to born-again Christians since no one can really know if they ARE born-again or just claiming to be. I'd just like a list of Christians first (by some guideline... protestant?) then leave the subtleties for further study. This whole argument has devolved into "he's not REALLY a TRUE CHRISTIAN (tm)". I'd ask "Who is?" Using "born-again" as a category is just biased. Alice Cooper is a self-professed Christian at age 58 and has said as much in 2006 on his radio show which airs all over the place. Easily verifiable and yet.... did he say "I am a BORN-AGAIN (tm) Christian"? No. Yet, if asked, he'd say he gave his life to Jesus, repented, baptised, etc.</p>
<p>An encyclopedia cannot (and should not) hold Ph.D.-level data. It is for the LAY PEOPLE to get a basic grip on a term. If they need more, there's a lifetime of study available on the web now. Just my 2 cents. Tim Simmons 2006/02/13</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I find problematic the notion that we should delete all Ph.D.-level data in favor of lay people.

<dd>Again, be that as it may, why not just include it in a section on Matt Millen? In its current state, people who want to read about Matt Millen must read his bio and then go to "Fire Millen" to get the whole story. Wouldn't it be more efficient to simply merge the two?

<dd>I'm not sure it's even of current significance... Since they hired Marinelli as Head Coach and he brought in Mike Martz as the offensive coordinator you don't hear anything in Detroit about firing Millen, even on sport talk radio stations. Lions fans are a fickle bunch. If the Lions make the playoff's this year people will be calling for a statue of Millen to be erected. If they go less than 8-8, they will be dusting off their "Fire Millen" signs again.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:08, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you, but until they get that 9-7 record to take the pressure off of Millen, there will be a movement against him.

<p>An obscure band that is tired of today's bands that strive for fame and hype (article's own words). So why should they be here?

(But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.)" is a notability criterion. They haven't had a theme song, but I'd say they're hovering just on the edge of notability. <b>Weak delete</b>. <font face="georgia"><a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnurks_9a10.html" title="User:Snurks">Snurks</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/n/u/User_talk%7ESnurks_2400.html" title="User talk:Snurks">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snurks_439e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snurks">C</a></sup></small></font> 08:48, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

I agree with Snurks that this is a tough call.

<li>67.165.85.111 is c-67-165-85-111.hsd1.pa.comcast.net in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, likely to be his home connection</li>
<li>66.101.59.248 is 66-101-59-248-static.dsl.oplink.net in Houston Texas (The Optimal Link<a href="http://www.oplnk.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oplnk.net/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>), and is the server that hosts his web site<a href="http://www.whois.sc/mudolc.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whois.sc/mudolc.org" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> (and needless to say, can be used as proxy).</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is problematic because of the following reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Original research. Few Google hits. This criterion is only known at the <a href="http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Election-methods_mailing_list" class="external text" title="http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Election-methods_mailing_list" rel="nofollow">Election Methods mailing list</a>.</li>
<li>Obviously, the only thing the author of this article wants to say is that, when <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimax_Condorcet_a6ae.html" title="Minimax Condorcet">MinMax</a>(pairwise opposition) is being used, then ranking an additional candidate sometimes helps but never hurts an already ranked candidate. But to say this, there is no need to invent a new criterion. You could simply say that <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimax_Condorcet_a6ae.html" title="Minimax Condorcet">MinMax</a>(pairwise opposition) satisfies <i>later-no-harm</i> and violates <i>later-no-help</i>.</li>
<li>The article is POV. The author of this article uses this criterion to argue against "Condorcet methods where the strength of pairwise defeats are assessed by the votes for the winning side". He mentions <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimax_Condorcet_a6ae.html" title="Minimax Condorcet">MinMax</a>(pairwise opposition) as an example. But <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimax_Condorcet_a6ae.html" title="Minimax Condorcet">MinMax</a>(pairwise opposition) isn't a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_method.html" title="Condorcet method">Condorcet method</a> in the proper sense because it doesn't satisfy the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_criterion.html" title="Condorcet criterion">Condorcet criterion</a>. When I asked the author for a concrete example of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_method.html" title="Condorcet method">Condorcet method</a> that violates the <i>sincere expectation criterion</i>, he was unable to give such an example.</li>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Regardless of whether one believes in whether the criterion causes a differentiation between methods using margins and winning votes (see Talk:sincere expectation criterion for that discussion), this <i>was</i> the original intention. The discussion arguing the merits of both method types figures prominently at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_method.html" title="Condorcet method">Condorcet method</a> article, under the section <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_method.html#Defeat_strength" title="Condorcet method">Defeat strength</a>, so it's in the interest of NPOV to give and expand on the counter argument against those criteria in favor of winning votes, especially since Mike Ossipoff single-handedly created a whole bunch of them and these also have been given Wikipedia articles.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that the criterion has only been mentioned on the election methods mailing list doesn't itself make it original research, but is rather a testament of the esoteric nature of the discussion. Given this, it was introduced more than 7 years ago and has since then been regularly referred to and even been generalized by others, so it can be considered to be standing the test of time. Still, if one is interested in a source besides the mailing list, see <a href="http://condorcet.org/rp/inc.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://condorcet.org/rp/inc.shtml" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, where Blake Cretney gives a future-to-be informal description of the criterion:
<dl>
<dd>[...]<i>winning-votes only works by making it bad strategy to leave candidates unranked at the end of the ballot. It has no special insight into the true preferences of voters. In effect, it simply reduces the value of all incomplete ballots, in that they would on average be much better at achieving the voter's goal if completed, randomly if necessary.</i></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But Blake Cretney's quotation can be summarized as follows: "<a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimax_Condorcet_a6ae.html" title="Minimax Condorcet">MinMax</a>(pairwise opposition) satisfies <i>later-no-harm</i> and violates <i>later-no-help</i>. Therefore, when <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimax_Condorcet_a6ae.html" title="Minimax Condorcet">MinMax</a>(pairwise opposition) is being used, then it makes sense to give different rankings to the least preferred candidates even when you are indifferent between them." Blake Cretney's criticism doesn't require the introduction of a new criterion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkusSchulze_4a8a.html" title="User:MarkusSchulze">Markus Schulze</a> 18:36, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>From the context of the 1998 discussion between Blake Cretney and Mike Ossipoff one can deduce that the discussion was between margins and (what is now called) winning votes, since Ossipoff was first of all promoting a Condorcet method. It's true that in above linked article Blakey Cretney's phrasing has mistakenly been too strong, such that he's claiming later-no-harm plus the violation of later-no-help ("<i>In fact, in winning-votes it is never justifiable, even for strategic reasons, to leave candidates unranked, as long as your goal is to elect the best possible candidate from your perspective.</i>"), but the sincere expectation criterion is a different criterion, as it makes a zero-info strategy claim based on expected utility. -- <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDissident_e7c0.html" title="User:Dissident">Dissident</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDissident_8a12.html" title="User talk:Dissident">Talk</a>) 21:36, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Similarly, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant-runoff_voting.html" title="Instant-runoff voting">IRV</a> supporters usually argue that, when a Condorcet method is being used, then the probability that an additional ranking hurts an already ranked candidate is higher than the probability that an additional ranking helps an already ranked candidate and that, therefore, the voters will use bullet voting. It makes a big difference whether someone makes a prediction about how the voters will vote under a concrete election method or whether someone proves that a concrete election method violates a given criterion. What you call <i>sincere expectation criterion</i> is not more than a hypothesis about how the voters will vote under a certain family of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_method.html" title="Condorcet method">Condorcet methods</a>. However, it is not a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Voting_system_criterion.html" title="Voting system criterion">criterion</a> in the proper sense because without additional presumptions it is not possible, just by looking at the underlying algorithm, to say whether a given election method satisfies it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkusSchulze_4a8a.html" title="User:MarkusSchulze">Markus Schulze</a> 15:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the benefit of those not party to this particular in-joke, can you please explain why the line "The A4018 is an British A-road which runs from Bristol city centre to Cribbs Causeway via places such as Westbury-on-Trym." on a page by itself is something we cannot do without? I'd be all for keeping this as a separate article if the road actually had some shred of importance attached to it, however, it doesn't even have that (to which I can personally attest, having travelled down it several times).

<dd>I believe the lifts in my high-rise office building have at least a shred of importance to the thousands of people who also work there. Not only do they number more than the residents of Westbury-on-Trym (which, BTW, is hyphenated), the lifts probably carry more people than the A4018. Since we do not, and clearly should not, have an article for Ty Glas Towers lift no. 6, by logical deduction there's <i>less</i> reason to keep this as a separate article. Merge/redirect into a series of articles a la <a href="http://uk-roads.co.uk/roadlists/r10/" class="external text" title="http://uk-roads.co.uk/roadlists/r10/" rel="nofollow">Roads By Ten</a> might seem sensible, but keeping separate articles is going to lead to a serious case of stubitis - lots of stubs but no actual content. Similarly, if the best reason you can come up with for keeping it is effectively "Well, why not?", then keeping <i>as is</i> most definitely <i>cannot</i> be the answer.

<dd><a href="../../../m/u/_/Mu.html" title="Mu">Mu</a>. It's difficult to compare, due to te fact that in the UK we number roads by classification (M &gt; A1 &gt; A2 &gt; B, Ax &gt; Axx/Axxx &gt; Axxxx) whereas in the US there are three parallel systems. There are the national networks, the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_highway_3f4b.html" title="US highway">US highways</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_highway.html" title="Interstate highway">Interstate highways</a> (confusingly, neither <i>has</i> to cross a state boundary), of which you can't have one of each of the same number in the same state (<a href="../../../i/-/5/I-5.html" title="I-5">I-5</a> runs along the west coast, <a href="../../../u/s/-/US-5_c81a.html" title="US-5">US-5</a> is in New England). Then there are the state networks, some of which skip the numbers of any nationals in there (e.g. there is no CA-5, as California defines route 5 in its system to be I-5). Then some states delegate county routes, which may in some cases duplicate both national and state numbers. I think there is some effort to get down to major county roads in California, being so large and having such an extensive road network, but some of these may be more important than state-level roads in other states (maybe they have fewer roads in the state, maybe the state doesn't delegate to counties, or whatever). Being "a numbered road serving X, Y and Z" isn't much. ISTR one case surviving on merit of it being the shortest <i>signed</i> numbered route in the state (some are unsigned - think C-roads). Note that "worthy of record"&#160;!= "worthy of own article". "worthy of record" &lt; "worthy of section" &lt; "worthy of article". I figure the best we could do for this would be something akin to the List of B-roads floating around, i.e. "A4018: Bristol - Westbury-on-Trym - Catbrain - Cribbs Causeway - M5". One sentence on route and name of interesting place does not make an article, and I fear there is nothing more to know about this. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User:82.15.28.195">82.15.28.195</a> (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User talk:82.15.28.195">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.15.28.195_2384.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.15.28.195">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>The less-informed might wish to know that A-roads are like second-class degrees. They are not a single class, but two subclasses. In much the same way that you can't hold a 2:1 and a 2:2 on par (this being the effective boundary between a "good" degree and an "average" one), you have primary and secondary As. Primary As are typically worth writing about. Primary As into four digits typically have good reason for being so. Secondary As in two or three digits may sometimes be former primaries that have been de-trunked.

<dd>Meanwhile, the more-informed will be aware that there was debate here recently about whether <i>B</i>-roads should have articles - and that debate ended in an approximate stalemate.

<p><b>Speedy delete</b>. I'm in a revert war with the author over the speedy tag on these pages, and can't figure out any better course of action than to list this on AfD in search of community consensus.</p>
<p>Robert Meyer Burnett was previously speedy-tagged as copy-vio and deleted, but the author reposted it and now removes the {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}} tag.

<li>Kinu I am not a part of the mod I am just a fan of Deus Ex; I don't have any say about what they put on their website. It doesn't make sense to say that it is not notable simply because it hasn't been released. There are hundreds of articles with the "This article or section contains information about a computer or video game in production." tag in them which goes to show that even unreleased material with a significant enough following is noteworthy.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayson_Virissimo_02c4.html" title="User:Jayson Virissimo">Jayson Virissimo</a> 17:54, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>As far as I can make out, this is not an actual video game company, but a name for programmer/game designer Aytaç Aksu, whose main output seems to have been the production of a number of platform games featuring <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_series_07bb.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog series">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> characters (most likely in violation of <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a> copyright) using the <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klik_%26_Play_82e2.html" title="Klik &amp; Play">Klik &amp; Play</a> game programming tool.

<dd>Apologies for not stating it clearly enough. No, copyright violation of Sega trademarks is definitely <i>not</i> a reason for deletion. As I say at the end, I was requesting a debate on whether fan-developed games and their programmers are notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia, I do not think they are, but others may differ. See the policy for software notability at <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, which should make it pretty clear. By the way, you haven't exactly clearly stated your own reasoning for <i>keeping</i> the article - I'm quite happy to be convinced otherwise. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 23:12, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> (There are many omissions, so much so that it is difficult to argue that it is an accurate history, rather a skewed history that seems to spend a lot of space offering a history that approximates what many Australian UFO researchers know but with some aspects few of us are familar with. The owner of the Wikipedia "Australian Ufology" entry is censoring efforts to correct and edit this skewed and incomplete history so it would be appropriate to highlight the questionable nature of the document and its owner attempt to white out a lot of history and contributions, seemingly in an effort to create a <b>biased and some what flawed history of Australian Ufology</b>.)</p>

This site is a misrepresentation of the true History of Australian Ufology and should be deleted. User: VUFORS and User: Auforn4u continually disrupt &amp; delete all and every additional information posted to this page. They omit and disregarded the efforts of many Australian ufologists and have kept reverting and posting their own version of Australian Ufology History. User: VUFORS and User: Auforn4u are trying to create a biased and distorted version of Australian UFO History and do so with the blessing of you Wiki voters.

<li><b>Comment</b> This might be one for <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. The talk page on Australian Ufology redirects to the main contributor's talk page. It is a fairly poor quality article though I could see scope for an article of this sort. On the other hand, there are no other examples of localised <a href="../../../u/f/o/Ufology.html" title="Ufology">Ufology</a>.

The anonymous user is me Diane Harrrison and I <b>do not</b> hold a biasted vendette against VUFORS it is actually the other way around and I had no idea you couldn't nominate a talk page for deletion, but he should be deleted as VUFORS continually breaks Wiki policy. These guys VUFORS &amp; AUFO4u continually delete anything and everything I've posted and other AUFORN UFO researchers have posted to this page. I've been continually deleted from the Australian Administration segment along with Bill Chalker &amp; Robert Frola who have been contributing since the 70s &amp; 80s and the excuse VUFORS gives, <i>we are not pre 1981</i>. If this is the case ACERN and many others listed are neither pre 1981. Do you see any reference which states you have to be pre 81 <i>no</i> does it stat this on this on the page no. So ask yourself who really is trying to post a biased side of history. Go back to the history of this page and you find I am correct. VUFORS like you is an additionalists, but VUFORS continually breaks Wiki policy with the blessing of you guys. You have people posting comments about our Australian UFO history that have no idea of our UFO History, yet some of you vote to keep a biased version of it. <i>Diane Harrison</i>.</li>

<li>I disagree with Vufors's redirection of the talk page to his own user talk page, but while the redirect is in place, the user talk page can't be nominated for deletion, as user talk pages in general can't. Regardless of Vufors's conduct, the anonymous user acted wrong in inserting his "delete VUFORS" comment to entirely unrelated AfD discussions, even after I warned him. Nominating <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Ufology_fa9a.html" title="Australian Ufology">Australian Ufology</a> for deletion is all OK. Nominating people's user or user talk pages is not. Vufors should be contacted about the redirection, and if he continues to ignore any discussion, there probably should be an RfC discussion. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 16:03, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Don't Delete</b>. Stumptown (as it's called) is a point of pride for many Portlanders (of which I am one). It's a bit tricky to say why without breaking neutrality. Some factors that contribute to Stumptown's local reputation are the quality of its coffee, the manner in which they purchase and roast their coffee (fair trade, organic, and otherwise), the local celebrity of many of their workers (Stumptown put out a record called "Worker's Comp", featuring musicians that are also employees), and the cultural events (music and art) that they host at their cafes. They are a Portland success story, thriving even as the region faced economic depression. I'm not now, nor ever have I been, affiliated with Stumptown except as a patron. I set up the entry for <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stumptown_Coffee_Roasters_6e50.html" title="Stumptown Coffee Roasters">Stumptown Coffee Roasters</a> as a disambig. of the term <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stumptown.html" title="Stumptown">Stumptown</a>.

Obviously some people will disagree with this statement, but in general many people believe this to be the case. If you look on <a href="http://cityguide.aol.com/detroit/bestburgers/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cityguide.aol.com/detroit/bestburgers/" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, Miller's took 1st place. GQ listed Miller's at #8 on their list of "places you have to eat a hamburger before you die". Local newpapers, magazines, etc. have all consistantly ranked Miller's #1 in the area. There is adequate evidence to make a case for notability if someone wanted to write an article about this business and support it's notability. This is the kind of information I'm looking for about Stumptown. Newspaper articles, media, press, etc.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>OED: Not only would you want to add those facts (looks like you have), but you'd want to cite the reputable sources they came from. You're an editor compiling other people's published facts and opinions; you're not to insert any facts and opinions of your own. If Stumptown coffee has enough local notability that the local paper has written articles about them, and you can cite such articles, that makes this article a keeper. <font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 21:46, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Don't Delete</b> I have lived in Portland for most of my life and Stumptown has become very well-regarded and well-known name around Portland. They are held in extreme high esteem for good business practice, excellent coffee, and supporting the community in a variety of ways. These are exceptionally good folks that are held up as a model as what a successful, locally owned socially conscious business can be. --C0r 10:09, 16 February 2006</p>
<p><b>Weak Keep</b> When I went to college at Southern Oregon, a buddy of mine from portland had some Stumptown beans shipped down once a month. It was quite a devotion to a paticular coffee.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I (disclosure: a Portlander) believe Stumptown Coffee Roasters to be <i>significant</i> and <i>unique</i> enough to qualify being kept, despite its commercial nature. In particular, I think the following reasons describe their signficance:
<ul>
<li>The large number of small, independent coffee roasters in Portland which now exist can be traced back to the success of Stumptown Roasters. Prior to their existence, there were no small, in-cafe roasteries, let alone ones which use small batch, European antique roasters. Now I can name three such cafes within 2 miles of my house, for example.</li>
<li>Stumptown Roasters helped raise the bar for both coffee quality (as grown, roasted and served) and, perhaps more importantly, for treatment of workers. Stumptown not only pays top dollar to workers, but they get many benefits (health and dental), numerous vacation days, get long periods off for such activities as touring with bands, etc. Many cafes have (had to) follow suit. In return they demand quality and expertise from their barristas, thus furthering the quality of the coffee drinks made.</li>
<li>To say the owner and coffee-selector of Stumptown Coffee Roasters is choosy is an understatement. He gives a huge amount of time to making sure both the coffee beans are good and the people who grow them are treated right. He often pays <i>well above</i> the "Fair Trade" standard price of coffee, and very frequently visits the farms the coffee comes from in South America, Africa, and else where. He has set the highest price ever paid per pound for coffee because he thought the farm's work was worth it and deserved it. It is another example of Stumptown raising the bar in the industry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand the desire to see the proof of these things. I will try to do my best to add sources to what has already been put in this article. I simply believe the impact of Stumptown Roasters is far beyond "quality of coffee" (re: good hamburgers). The impact and following of Stumptown is near cultish at this point (for better or worse; an entirely different discussion there). Now I shall attempt to verify some of this info via sources on the web. Thanks for hearing me out. <a href="../../../m/u/m/User%7EMumonkan_0fd2.html" title="User:Mumonkan">Jon Lon Sito</a> 07:48, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>ok, i added a whole bunch of references. (sorry the oregonian one had to be to a google cache, but that article has a substantial amount of reference material and is the biggest newspaper in the state.) the article reads pretty crummy right now, but i hope this reflects the impact stumptown has had on portland. <a href="../../../m/u/m/User%7EMumonkan_0fd2.html" title="User:Mumonkan">Jon Lon Sito</a> 09:35, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am a Las Vegas, Nevada native and a graduate of UNLV. I am certain that I have heard the word being used around UNLV's campus to describe exactly what the article says, "a circle with a line through it." I can't say whether it is appropriate as a Wikipedia article. However, if as the article says, it was created in 2005, the use of the word has spread very quickly. Perhaps students at Ave Maria School of Law are claiming to have invented a word that has existed for some time. Or perhaps, the idea needed a word to describe it and people have caught on quickly. Either way, the words approptiatness on Wikipedia aside, the words legitimacy should not be discarded for lack of common use. By the way, if a word such as "Dirty Sanchez" has a place on Wikipedia, why shouldn't Scamdoo?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.68.html" title="User:205.188.116.68">205.188.116.68</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.188.116.68.html" title="User talk:205.188.116.68">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.188.116.68_e063.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.188.116.68">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - Ambiguous use of the term emo, follows no definitive guidelines for classification of this music genre, many definitions exist and are not agreed upon regarding the word "emo"- this article does not specify which definition of emo it is referring to; there are better lists that exist on Wikipedia that are more clear as to their content and better represent the genre Yakwhacker 18:44, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>After reading Chris's post below, I've reconsidered. I'm not sure <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_emo_bands.html" title="List of emo bands">List of emo bands</a> is the best place for a merge anyway given the layout of that page. Of course any emo list is going to be a constant edit war by the nature of the label. <b>Abstain</b> for now and strongly endorse using categories instead of more arbitrary lists.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:27, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - We should be using categories for this. Additionally, this nomination is disingenuous, given that Yakwhacker created <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_emo_bands.html" title="List of emo bands">List of emo bands</a> this month, while this article has existed for six months. He should have edited this article and/or moved it.

<li>A reference to "the Old Four sports tournament" on one of the competing universities' web pages doesn't constitute verification of the fact that there's a sports tournament called Old Four that includes the university whose web page says it's competing in the Old Four?

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I'm concerned that it is not encyclopedic, in the sense that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias generally assert notability of their subject in the introduction. I finished the entire article and was left uncertain why the article author felt I, or anyone, might spend time reading about this topic. I could be convinced otherwise with a stronger assertion of notability, but at the moment I am inclined to believe that the subject is inherently unencyclopedic due to its lack of notability.

<li><b>Slight Merge and Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_Cork_4052.html" title="University College Cork">University College Cork</a> or, preferably, a new article with a name like 'University College Cork student groups.' There's no reason to have a separate page for every student group of every University. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 00:22, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have added a quick proposal for a rewrite in the article discussion page. I have removed some of what I considered to be non-encyclopedic information, and added some factual information that was provided in this discussion. I have absolutely no knowledge of the subject matter, so I'm sure there are technical errors, but hopefully it provides a basis for cleaning and keeping the article if the claims for notability can be verified (e.g. largest gaming convention in the Republic of Ireland). If these claims cannot be properly verified, I will lean towards <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">grunt</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 03:37, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Would it be acceptable to write a new article, one that would show that the society is of note? Or would it be more adviseable to add UCC societie's as an extension and have WARPS under that? 14:42 February 15 2006 (GMT) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by QuicksilverK (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_QuicksilverK_5e25.html" title="Special:Contributions/QuicksilverK">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Add'l Comment</b> I have moved my proposed rewrite into the article itself (I guess that means I re-wrote it, huh?). I have also added the {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}} template to draw attention to my concern of verifiable sources. It seems as if the group may have a degree of notability, but as I stated above, I would want verifiable sources of these claims added to the article in order to keep it. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">grunt</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 16:32, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can't find any evidence that this party existed, aside from a now defunct website. The party itself is also dead, but did not get any mentions on Google News for its demise or for any other reason. It gets 76 unique Google results, a lot of them are website directories. They describe it a little, but there is no mention of how many members it has, how long it has existed, what impact it has had or anything else useful about the party, except that it is against equality. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 20:38, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The trick for these topics is coming up with a name that is both descriptive and universally used. Basically, this is a general term that is similar in meaning to some other topics, so it's easy to talk about this without actually calling it "time and methods engineering". But if you were to say to someone in IE, "I'm doing some time and methods engineering", they'd have a good idea of what you're talking about. I can't say exactly where I've heard it before, but here are some examples of where it is used: Maynard is a major player in IE (see <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maynard_Operation_Sequence_Technique_f0e9.html" title="Maynard Operation Sequence Technique">MOST</a>), and they offer a course in "Intensified Time Study and Methods Engineering" (<a href="http://www.mrcohio.com/Intensified.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mrcohio.com/Intensified.htm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>). <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_76d5.html" title="University of Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a> and other universities offer courses in "Methods engineering" (IE 470; <a href="http://www.uwm.edu/CEAS/assets/syllabi/ie470.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uwm.edu/CEAS/assets/syllabi/ie470.pdf" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> - pdf). Another course syllabus refers to "Methods-time analysis, or methods engineering" (<a href="http://www.aviation.uiuc.edu/institute/acadProg/epjp/MTA.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aviation.uiuc.edu/institute/acadProg/epjp/MTA.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>). It may be better to not have this article and instead have a methods engineering article and a work measurement article, but because the areas are related, and because it's not that big of a difference from what we have now, I don't see any reason to make that switch, especially for an article this short. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 12:24, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The criteria from WP:Music you refer to is "Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country[1], reported in notable and verifiable sources". Can you cite the sources which reported on this tour? This tour isn't mentioned in the article. I went back through the history and could only find a passing reference to it.

The test may not even apply in this case, as the band <i>do</i> have an official page on their own URL (although at this point, my browser's drawing a blank on it - "Safari can’t open the page “<a href="http://www.northofok.com/”" class="external free" title="http://www.northofok.com/”" rel="nofollow">http://www.northofok.com/”</a> because it can’t find the server “www.northofok.com”. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 21:21, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

One reference to show existence: *<a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~sivann/xgrk/U0370.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~sivann/xgrk/U0370.pdf" rel="nofollow">Greek and Coptic Range: 0370–03FF</a>, from the Software Engineering Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens. (pdf file) As far as existence - seals it for me that a Greek university includes sho in their list of letters. A quick google search on &lt;sho Greek letter&gt; indicates that there are references to the Bactrian language usage; I'd like to see a language expert (the article creator) add appropriate references. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 00:27, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
