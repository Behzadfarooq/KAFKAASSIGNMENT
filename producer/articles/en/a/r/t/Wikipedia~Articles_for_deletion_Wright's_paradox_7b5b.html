<li>A mathematical paradox which happen to be labeled as Wright's paradox. No matter from where a paradox is extrapolated, be it a joke, a race by a tortoise and Achilles or some guy from Crete; a paradox is a paradox. I am well aware of the "No original research" rule, and this one is not. (If it was, I'd not be able to resist naming it after myself) Though I can not verify or give a link to a author or another place that it was published as this paradox was 'picked up' circulating around the campus. A search in Internet does not give even a close result neither to the type of the paradox or to its name. It certainly is an original work but not of the author of the article. Hopefully someone will come forward after seeing it published and claim authorship or a info will emerge latter here or somewhere else. Because the authorship can not be verified it would be bad to delete it from wikipedia just for that reason, as the paradox itself is a solid one and a very fine sample of the nature of geometric progression. Paradoxes don't come by very often and should not be 'killed' so fast when they do. --Otritos 21:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Because the authorship can not be verified it would be bad to delete it from wikipedia</i> — On the contrary, deleting <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a> information is good for Wikipedia, and is one of our strongest reasons for deletion. You have just made an excellent case for the deletion of this article. If you want to make a case for keeping, find and cite some sources. Nothing else will do. We <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Notes" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">insist upon sources</a>, here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:30, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is the reason behind the unverifiable information being deleted in wikipedia?--Otritos 21:48, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Our <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_Pillars_90a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Five Pillars">fundamental goal</a> of creating an encyclopaedia where everything is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> by editors and readers. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:09, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Then Uncle G, how did <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bible_5d21.html" title="The Bible">The Bible</a> ended up not being deleted? Ok, I know this is not exactly a proper example but my point is this article simply can not be verified for time being, it is unverifiable. Even though as a piece of information it is self evident, it is not something you can sit over and wonder if it's true or not. It is a mathematical demonstration. Just because the author is not known and there is a possibility that he will probably not be known, what is the next step according the wikipedia rules? To delete it? That is, as I said a paradox is a rare phenomenon and to think that one of the few paradoxes of this century does not get to find a place on the wikipedia because no one claims an authorship and a source can not be found Isn't this self defying for the purpose of wikipedia? The only thing that will help the cause for wikipedia with this case is to leave it there as it is and if a verifiable info emerges, good! If not, what is the reason and point of deleting it? I'd like to stress on this again, the article by itself is a unique entry of a paradox. And I am sorry I can't verify or state a source but this does not contradict the core idea behind verification i.e, validity and value as knowledge. It is simply sad to think something as rare as a paradox will have in its early history the fate of not finding a place in the corpus of wikipedia because physically it was not possible to track down an author or source. The best thing to do I think will be to give the article a chance and let it live for at least a month and if no verification can be obtained during that time then do whatever you think is proper.--Otritos 23:14, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> It certainly isn't. Its just a mildly interesting mathmatical oddity that sounds impressive until the math behind it is explained. More importantly, its connection to Wright is completely unsourced. My father taught me this exact same concept when I was young, but we don't call it Doug's Paradox, do we? - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 03:32, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll do my best to provide a verification. To the users who for some reason imagine the paradox described in the article is not a paradox I just want to say - you guys have a very powerful tool and a huge database right under your fingers. Please use it! Seriously people, do your research before you post a stupid comment on something you don't quite understand. Damn, I can't believe you are voting for deleting the article while you don't even have a clue what paradox is. It is a classical paradox derived from an exponential function describing linear function. Many of the present and Greek paradoxes are based on that. --Otritos 02:01, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
