<p>Bri's Own World is, in short, the best website on the internet. Manned by webmistress Bri and her two friends Vannah and Rachel, all freshmans in high school, it's pretty impressive. Especially since they're all fourteen. The website combines the creativity and, well, randomness of all three girls, all with their own strong opinions and sassy attitudes. They have opinion peices, poetry, short fantasy and fiction stories, songs, pictures, a forum, and even a guestbook! The most incredible thing about it is that it is all original, totally clean, and interesting for all ages, though it's mainly targeted for pre-teens to young adults. All in all, the moral is this... "Geez O Pete! Leave comments, sign the questbook, subscribe to the newsletter, and enjoy!"</p>

<p>MIA was built in 1964. It was the first amphitheatre ever built in the United States of the World. It was built first in New England and was later moved to Memphis, TN. The Island itself was formed by a volcanic eruption in 1952. This eruption also formed Graceland, the famous house of Elvis Presley and Willie Herenton.</p>

<p>A phrase commonly used to describe the odds of winning the <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lottery.html" title="Lottery">lottery</a> is, "you have a better chance of getting struck by lighting."</p>
<p><b>Is this true?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The odds of winning the jackpot in the <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lotto_6_49_7f51.html" title="Lotto 6/49">Lotto 6/49</a> are 1 in 13,983,816. The odds of getting struck by lighting are about 1 in 2,000,000. Therefore, the statement is mathematically true.</p>
<p><br />
<b>So why is the lottery so popular in the world of gambling?</b> Quick, easy, and cheap. No skill necessary. Whereas <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackjack.html" title="Blackjack">blackjack</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Poker">poker</a> require knowledge of the game, patience, and good math.</p>

<p>Sonny Pike at age 13 supposedly was the most dazzling young football talent the U.K had produced since George Best. He was the subject of a British series on child prodigies.</p>
<p>He is currently training for a Scottish FA coaching certificate, and as part of this, he coaches two primary school teams in the area. Although he doesn't support a local team, he goes to matches regularly, purely for his love of the game. Sonny says that he's much happier away from professional football. The pressure placed on him by his club, agents, sponsors and, to a lesser extent, the media made him suffer a nervous breakdown in October 2000, whilst still part of the Ajax youth squad.</p>

<p>"I think the entire music industry is in a seven year slump. Nothing is happening, no one is taking chances. But it doesn’t really bother me because there is so much good music out there if you look for it. It’s really up to the listeners to change things. If there’s any true statement it’s this: 'Repetition is the death of art.'" ~Mark Martucci +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Mark Martucci is a songwriter from New Jersey. I actually discovered his music by accident. I was on another musician's message board and randomly came across a link to his website. With the internet now a breeding ground for young musicians, it is pretty overwhelming at times. With Mark Martucci, I got lucky. He is talented and full of promise.</p>
<p>Martucci's music is diverse and charming. If you want a sad song, Mark can provide it. How about a little ambience? Done. In search of catchy tracks with originality? Yup, he can do that too. Who is this guy? Keep reading... +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Hugh: I know that you currently live in New Jersey. Were you born there? Was Garden State an accurate portrayal of your home? I think it would have been better with some fresh Martucci jams.</p>
<p>Mark: Well first off, you should know that I'm a huge film buff. I would say that my love of music and film are about on the same level. I try to give my music a kind of narrative and presence of a film, the characters and moods. Strangely enough, i haven't seen Garden State as of yet. I hear it's a great film, but not the best representation of NJ.</p>
<p>I live in the nature-ish area of NJ, so it's not the stinkhole that most people make it out to be. I always need access to nature or I go a little crazy. I lived in Philly for a few years while I was attending the University of the Arts for Multimedia. Cities can get really depressing and on top of it I was going through some tough personal times. But living in this kind of gray microcosm led to the biggest musical inspiration of my life that I continue to draw from even to this day.</p>
<p>As for soundtracks, that is something that would be perfect for me. I work fast and with theory. I recently made a soundtrack for a friend's film. It’s a very black &amp; white album, spectrum wise. Half of it is very melodic and beautiful. The other half is atonal and dissonant, almost unlistenable. But that’s the design of the project. Actually, I’m also the character in the film. I’m jumping into a lake this Saturday to do some underwater photography. The film will be available on my website when it’s finished.</p>
<p>H: When did you start making music on your own? Prior to that, were you a member of any bands?</p>
<p>M: I probably picked up a guitar when I was about 13. I was writing songs before I knew how to play. I still don’t know how to play, so not much has changed. I had a few early bands with names like Willis, Mom’s Plate, and The Phantom Of The Paradise. It was this kind of power pop thing with a moog. We still really didn’t fit in with whatever the local music was…mostly loud, fast, hormone driven music.</p>
<p>I’ve been solo since the high school days, but every once in a while I do projects with friends. Like The Great Britians with Justin Rauschkolb, and most currently a project with Brian Mietz. An interesting thing about that project is that we’ve never been in the same room at any point doing those songs. We just exchange files online, and go back and forth with it. You can hear all these songs on the site.</p>
<p>H: You do a fantastic cover of "Waltz #1," so you are obviously an avid Elliott Smith fan. What other artists are you a big follower of?</p>
<p>M: I’m not really a fan of any new music. There are a few projects I follow like Jim O’Rourke, Wilco, The Frames, Flaming Lips, Elliott and so on. I mostly listen to music from about 40 years ago like Nick Drake, Beach Boys, Beatles, Zombies, The Move, The Bonzo Dog Band, Bob Dylan…back when music was good.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the entire music industry is in a seven year slump. Nothing is happening, no one is taking chances. But it doesn’t really bother me because there is soo much good music out there if you look for it. It’s really up to the listeners to change things. If there’s any true statement it’s this: 'Repetition is the death of art.'</p>
<p>H: It seems that every week or so you post a new song on your online journal where people can discover and comment on your music. I admire your support of sharing free tunes. You seem to be quite a prolific songwriter. What does your recording environment consist of?</p>
<p>M: I’m all for sharing music online. Most bands that think this make most of their money off touring and not from music sales, but for me, I don’t make money from either. I just like people to hear what I’m doing, so they can see a kind of process and can grow along with me. Maybe I could put out a more dissonant experimental record, and people would be right there on the same level and accept, maybe even embrace it. I would love to broaden people’s outlook on music as an artform, not entertainment.</p>
<p>By entertainment, I mean big budget, explosion, aggressive, in your face music that people who don’t really care about music buy. That’s really what it comes down to. Some people actually don’t like music, but everyone needs to own cds. So, what will they buy? Whatever’s easiest to like and what’s designed to make you tap your foot. You can hear the worst song ever on the radio and still drum on the steering wheel. That’s just pop music design at it’s finest, but it works, so why bother to change it? Thus, the slump wins again.</p>
<p>I guess I’m prolific because I need to be to stay interested and excited in what I do. If I was doing the same thing all the time it wouldn’t evolve. It would just be the same thing over and over. I have all these other side projects to inspire my main stuff. Before The Pillows, there wasn’t much ambience in my music. It’s just a string of fountains pouring into the same pool. Plus, it’s just fun to do stuff like The Haunted Houses and The Fellows Employment Agency.</p>
<p>My entire studio consists of a mic, a four channel mixing board, and a computer. Most people think that you need to record in a studio to make a decent product, but I think it has more to do with a knowledge of tone and a decent technique. I’ve been doing this for so long that I understand all my instruments and how to combine them. Layering is also key. Most of my songs range from 80 to 120 tracks. Most of it is subtle stuff, but it needs to be there nonetheless. It really is the little things that you can’t hear, but enrich the product.</p>
<p>H: One of your aliases, The Pillows, consists of your more ambient material, while your self-titled outlet seeks a happy medium between gentle, acoustic numbers and widespread experimentation. Does the nature of your songs depend on what mood you are in? How would you describe your songwriting process?</p>
<p>M: Well, mood is key when I’m writing sad songs. I really need to be upset to write something like that, but most of the time it’s a feeling, an urge to just go downstairs and mess around until I have something. My actual process is always changing. I used to sit down with a guitar and really map everything out, but lately I just set-up the keyboard, hit record, and just play…and build and build. It all just kind of happens. You have a beginning, when it comes to a chord change, it just happens naturally. It’s kind of hard to explain. It’s just all so spontaneous.</p>
<p>H: I know that you have been writing a new album. When are you hoping to have it out by? Will listeners familiar with your work recognize some of the tracks or will the album consist mainly of unreleased material?</p>
<p>M: I’m actually making two totally different albums at once now. One is a rock opera that some people are familiar with. There are songs online from it like “The Flight” and “The Dream.” That has turned into a full album that I’m working on. It’s all related and has a kind of sad, but uplifting sound to it.</p>
<p>The other album is more of a random mix of old and new songs. Some songs have been released before like “Glass” and “Before You Go To Sleep,” but they have very different sounds. "Glass" is coming out beautifully. I’ve been incorporating classical samples that I’ve been making from records and cds. This record will have a more natural overall feel, while the rock opera is more synthesized.</p>
<p>H: You have this awesome cover of Brian Wilson's "Vegatables." Have you heard Wilson's new recording of SMiLE? I'm really impressed with how good it is. It has barely left my CD player since its release.</p>
<p>I’m a huge fan of SMiLE. I was actually in England when he performed it for the first time. That whole experience was just surreal. I haven’t heard the new one yet, but it’s in the mail. I don’t see how it can ever compare to the original recordings that I love so much, but it will be great to hear it.</p>
<p>Brian Wilson is someone I can really understand. Everyone calls him a genius, but I think he was just a guy with an ear for sounds. He was a pioneer in his field, and he comes off as a sweet childlike guy that I hope to meet one day. I would love to make a crazy sound album with him. I think he could do with some young blood in the studio. I think we would go nuts together. I can dream…</p>
<p>H: One of your other loves is film. You have worked on several short films. Do you have any aspirations in acting, or is working behind the scenes more up your alley? What are a few of your favorite films and directors?</p>
<p>M: I love to make documentaries because they are so fun and easy to make. You can make one about anything. I’m currently editing one together about a local donut shop. I’m always thinking of plots and possible short films. I’ll be acting in the film I mentioned earlier, so we’ll se how that goes. I think it would be fun to act in an actual film. Maybe one day that will be an actuality.</p>
<p>I would really like to make a short film with some famous actors. Just take them out of context and maybe shoot it digital. There has been a lot of that going on in popular movies, with big name actors doing small indie films. I think it’s great. That’s something I would love to be a part of.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say what my favorite films are. Anything by David Lynch. He can do no wrong in my eyes. When a film can surprise me, then it’s worth my time. Woody [Allen] is great too, but then again, you can’t beat a good Arnold movie. Kindergarten Cop is beyond classic for me.</p>
<p>H: Anything you'd like to add?</p>
<p>M: Thanks for giving me a chance to flesh out some ideas. Some of these things have been in the back of my mind, but they aren’t truly actualized until they are put down on paper.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to vote. Let’s end this madness.</p>

<p>Arturo Belleza Rotor (born June 7, 1907, died April 9, 1988): Filipino medical doctor, civil servant, musician, writer.</p>
<p>Arturo B. Rotor was born in the Philippines, and attended the University of the Philippines. He graduated simultaneously from the Conservatory of Music and the College of Medicine. He trained further at Johns Hopkins University's medical school, publishing a paper on a rare form of hyperbilirubinaemia now known as "Rotor's syndrome". During World War II, Rotor served as Executive Secretary of the Philippine Commonwealth government-in-exile under Manuel L. Quezon, the Philippine President in exile. In the immediate post-WWII period, he was appointed Secretary of the Department of Health and Welfare. Later, Rotor was director of the University of the Philippines' Postgraduate School of Medicine and was a practising physician through the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Rotor was an internationally respected writer of fiction and non-fiction in English. He is widely considered among the best Filipino short story writers of the twentieth century. He was a charter member of the Philippine Book Guild; its initial publication (1937) was Rotor's "The Wound And The Scar", despite his protests that someone else should have been selected. In 1966, the Philippine government recognized his literary accomplishments by awarding him the Republic Cultural Heritage Award. Arturo B. Rotor's best-known literary works are: The Wound and the Scar (1937), Confidentially, Doctor (1965), Selected Stories from the Wound and the Scar (1973), and The Men Who Play God (1983)</p>
<p>Rotor was also a highly accomplished musician and published music critic. He was an orchid fancier and breeder, a long-time member of the Philippine Orchid Society, and is the namesake of a Vanda orchid species (Vanda merillii var. rotorii).</p>
<p>Rotor died in 1988, survived by his wife Emma Unson, who taught college mathematics and physics. They had no children.</p>
<p>Arturo B. Rotor shared an interest in orchids with his younger brother, Dr. Gavino B. Rotor, Jr. Gavino Rotor took this interest even farther, receiving his Ph.D. from Cornell University on orchid biology and becoming an authority on orchid propagation. The orchid species Rotorara is named after Gavino.</p>

<p>mayamalavagowla is the 15th melakartha ragam with the notes S R1 G3 M P D1 N3 S.It is like the Bhairav of the Hindusthani music.Maya denoting the number 15.The raga is auspiciously sung at dawn thereby creating a soothing effect.</p>
<p>Since the the times of Bharata , it is the ragam for rookies lessons, since svaRas with dual svarastAhnams are absent, and between two notes of each pairs, there is only a semitone difference. A meLam with symmetrical tetrachords, differentiated by an interval of a major tone.</p>

<p>Jim Bernhard of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Chairman and CEO of the Shaw Group, 4171 Essen Ln. ,Baton Rouge, LA 70809.</p>
<p>The Shaw Group Inc. was formed in 1987 and has annual revenues in excess of US$ 500 million.</p>
<p>His business sense has been proven in his foresight in realizing that the United States is quickly reaching an electric power shortage and by his plan to become a "vertical supplier" in the construction of new power generation plants.</p>
<p>Mr. Bernhard in the year 2001 out maneuvered in US Bankruptcy Court, several other potential purchasing parties, to gain ownership of Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corporation. Stone &amp; Webster's attraction to this savvy businessman was Stone &amp; Webster's long history of engineering power generation facilities, most important of these to Mr. Bernhard; nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>Jim Bernhard has exhibited his business perception realizing the coming electricity shortage in The United States due to increased power demand and aging power generating plants. His acquisition of a preeminent engineering company which has designed the bulk of US plants is seen by many to be nothing short of genius.</p>
<p>Mr. Bernhard in fact, gave a superbly straight forward testimony before the US Senate on The United State's future needs for power and the importance of addressing this future need by starting the construction of new nuclear power plants soon to avoid the impact of the inevitable electricity "crunch"; and no doubt to make himself an even wealthier and more powerful man.</p>
<p>Mr. Bernhard is also quickly becoming powerful political force in the State of Louisiana. He has tested the political waters in Louisiana by conducting an exploratory campaign as Democratic candidate for the US Senate and was one of the two key members of now, Louisiana Governor Blanco's "transition team" into the Governor's Office. He was also a one-time Chairman of the Louisiana state Democratic Party.</p>
<p>After the hurricanes in Louisiana last year, the Shaw Group received a large share of the reconstruction contracts issued by FEMA.</p>

<p>In 1985 the U.S. Supreme Court Ruled that Long Island is not really an Island. The courts opinion was that Long Island is simply an extension of the mainland.</p>
<p>This decision came in the RHODE ISLAND AND NEW YORK BOUNDARY CASE, (469 U.S. 504 (1985)). The federal government and states couldn’t agree who controlled the Long Island and Block Island sounds. The states wanted control to regulate shipping and commerce on the sounds. The Key to the case was if Long Island was really an Island. If it was simply an extension of the mainland as the states argued, then under law the sounds are inland bays controlled by the states. If it was truly an island then they would be considered open waters under federal control.</p>
<p>In the end the court ruled in favor of the states. The Court came to this decision by determining that the East River, which separates Long Island from the mainland, was too shallow for safe ship passage until humans widened it. Therefore Long Island is not a Natural Island. Also, Long Island and the adjacent shore also share a common geological history. These are the reasons the court ruled that long island is just an extension of the mainland.</p>

<p>Verbatim's CD-Rewriteable (CD-RW) and DVD-Rewriteable (DVD-RW) uses a Super Eutectic Recording Layer (SERL). With conventional rewriteable media, the recording layer deteriorates with every rewrite and would result decrease in quality. With Verbatim rewriteable media however, the recording layer is returned to perfect condition on every erasure, leaving a flawless disk for the next recording. SERL also enables this media to enjoy excellent archival stability and high-speed recording. This means users can enjoy perfect, high-speed data storage every time.</p>

<p><br />
Economy and Science:</p>
<p>Before the beginning of discussion, let us go to the role of science in the development of man’s dreams.</p>
<p>Science is defined as the branch of knowledge involving systemized observation, experiment, and induction: know so gained; pursuit or principles of this; skilful technique. Since they dawn of humankind man has constantly used science to make things luxurious for him. Today science is crossing the frontiers of the impossible.</p>
<p>Today new technologies are coming through which man is satisfying himself .Science can help boost up a country’s economy. Consider Japan for example, even though it had little scientific background in the past now it has become a competent nation where it excels is technology , technology that satisfies consumer’s demand. By selling it to other countries, it earns profit. Science helps in developing a country’s economy in this way that if one country has an abundance of technological goods for example china it can export it to a country like Pakistan at cheaper rates it can help digitize Pakistan.</p>
<p>Now how does science play a role in developing the economy of nations? Well it is known that man has a multiplicity of wants, his needs are unlimited he is always on the look for something which satisfies his needs, for example when mankind progressed in the 18the century industrial revolution , he needed more work hours so as to overcome the hindrance of dark , candles were already in use so were gas lamps, but not reliable and didn’t have the required luminosity ,so the bulb was invented and satisfied his wants. Now to sell the bulb for the satisfaction of others has now become a matter of profitability just one invention has become job source of many. Science and economy are interlinked .To see how Science and Economy are interlinked let us see another example. The value of clean air:</p>
<p>Air is free in the sense that we do not ay to breathe it. However, the absence of a market for air may help explain why the air quality in some cities has been deteriorating for decades. To encourage cleaner air, the Congress of U.S.A passed the CLEAN AIR ACT in 1963 and has since amended it a number of times. In 1970, for example, automobiles emission controls were tightened .Were these controls worth it. Were the benefits of cleaning up the air sufficient to outweigh the costs imposed directly on car producers and indirectly on buyers?</p>
<p>To answer this question the congress asked the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate emissions controls in a cost benefit study .Using empirically determined estimates of the demand for clean air , the benefits portion of the study determined that how much people value clean air .Although there is no actual market for clean air , people do pay more for houses where the air is clean than for comparable houses in areas with dirtier air. This information was used to estimate the demand for c lean air. The effects of different variables were studied and taken into o account statistically. The study determined a demand curve in which the shaded triangle gives consumer supplies generated when air pollution is reduced by 5 parts per 100 million of nitrogen oxide at a cost of $1000 per part reduced .the surplus is created because more consumers are willing to pay more than $1000 for each unit reduction of nitrogen oxide. Therefore, you see that what effect technology and science can have over economy. The Explosive Growth in Computer Demand:</p>
<p>When the first computers were launched in the early 50’s they were too expensive , only used by military or financial institutions , but gradually they became inexpensive and also small fast and interactive , thus helping every field that we human know of. Thus, their demand increases, now when their demand increases now more companies are formed and an n industry is set up thus providing jobs to millions those who earn help stabilize a country’s economy. Conclusion:</p>
<p>Thus economy and science are interlinked change in one can effect another. These are some of the examples which I have briefly described the subject remains vast.</p>

<p>Harry Potter met Ginny Weasley on his second year in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry although they get a glimpse of each other in Harry's first year.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Ginny has had a crush on Harry on ever since she saw him on the Hogwarts express. Ginny's attraction to Harry had been expressed at Tom Riddle's hypnotizing diary. As Riddle says in the book, " How she wished the great Harry Potter would ever like her".</p>
<p>It came on Harry's third year when he fell in love with a Raveclaw fourth year known as Cho Chang. This resulted to Ginny's failure of attracting Harry that Hermione advised her to move on and date other boys, which she did after the Yule Ball when she met Michael Corner. She and Michael dated for the whole year but broke up after the last Quidditch game.</p>
<p>On Harry's sixth year did he only realized that he had feelings for Ginny but Ginny had a new boyfriend, Dean Tomas. Harry tried everything to get Ginny but Harry's fear of the breaking of his friendship with Ron has been stopping him to do this attempt. Harry had his chance when Ginny broke up with Dean one night but he was still afraid to ruin his friendship with Ron.</p>
<p>But after one Quidditch game wherein Harry was suspended, Harry entered their common room to find that Ginny had won the game. it resulted to both of their first kiss with each other.</p>
<p>Bothe of them loved each other very much but after Dumbledore's death Harry was forced to break up with her because of his fear that Voldemort might use her against him. Ginny admitted that even though she dated both Michael and Dean, she never stopped admiring Harry</p>
<p>They promised each other that once all is over they'll get back but will they?</p>

<p>Technasia is a collaboration between Amil Khan, label manager (born 1972), raised and based in Hong Kong, and Charles Siegling, musician and DJ (born 1974), raised and based in Paris. After meeting in Hong Kong some years back, they felt it was time to put South East Asia on the world map in terms of the production of electronic dance music. They have been exposed to a variety of electronic music from abroad and are influenced in their works by early electronic sounds from the likes of Yellow Magic Orchestra, Coil, Xymox, and Depeche Mode...</p>
<p>Technasia have built their notoriety with acclaimed tracks such as "Descent", "Future Mix" and "Hydra" and more recently "Force", "Evergreen" and "Final Quadrant". They are strongly supported by a wide variety of top international DJs/producers including Laurent Garnier, Dave Clarke, Jeff Mills, Derrick May, Carl Cox and Sven Vath to name a few.</p>
<p>In 2001, Technasia released their first album "Future Mix" in Europe featuring their popular Technasia singles, as well as new and previously unreleased tracks. The album topped the Japanese national charts (#26) the year before for its Asian release in July 2000. It won Technasia three award trophies at the 2001 Edition of Berlin's Musik and Machine Awards&#160;: Best Album ("Future Mix"), Best Single ("Force") and Best Newcomer. The album acts as a tribute to the pioneering Chinese radio show with the same name and based on the same concept and features excerpts and jingles from the actual radio show itself! This radio show, presented by Charles Siegling and a local Chinese radio DJ, Michael Nee, was broadcasted from 1998 to 2001 to the entire South East China province of Guangdong (Hong Kong, Canton, Shenzhen, Foshan…) covering a population of 60 million people.</p>
<p>Since 1999, Technasia has diversified its activities by launching two new record labels. The first one, Sino, is dedicated to welcoming fellow artists such as Kelli Hand, Renato Cohen, John Thomas, DJ Skull, Steve Rachmad (aka Sterac), Joris Voorn and John Tejada... The second one, Star Tracks, is Charles Siegling's solo DJ club tools label, available worldwide since December 2000.</p>
<p>In 2001, Technasia toured as a Live set which took them to leading events and clubs worldwide. Charles Siegling also started several DJ residencies in popular electronic music clubs such as Fuse in Brussels and Nitsa in Barcelona. Technasia was invited to launch a new series of mix CDs, titled "Plus" (carrying the same name as the popular events in China and Japan), with the first one being Charles Siegling's mix, recorded live at Club Orange in Beijing in April 2001 and introducing to the world his frenetic three decks DJ technique (released in February 2002). Amil Khan’s “Plus” mix CD followed in October 2002.</p>
<p>In October 2002, Technasia progressed forward with a new project, “Recreations”, a collaborative musical journey of their past renowned productions conceived alongside Claude Young (USA), Funk D’Void (Scotland), Renato Cohen (Brazil), John Tejada (USA). In order to promote their hit single "Nebula" (March 2003), Technasia started a 60-date/5-month world live tour, visiting most popular clubs and festivals.</p>
<p>The live tour was followed by a Technasia Charles Siegling 40-date world DJ tour from September 2003 to January 2004 for the launch of his new mix CD "Fuse Presents Technasia". This third volume of the renowned Brussels' Fuse Club mix CD series (after Dave Clarke and DJ Hell's CDs) was released in October 2003. It features a 1-hour energetic 38-track mix and several Technasia unreleased and bonus tracks. The mix shows Charles Siegling's unique ability to mix, tweak, scratch and shuffle a wide variety of music styles- from Old-Skool House to Techno and Detroit Electro. The mix CD comes with the worldwide acclaimed "Fusin" anthem, available on both CD and 12". 2003 also brought another Technasia Techno classic with one of their "rare-but-unique" Technasia remixes for Dave Clarke's single "Way Of Life", released in October 2003.</p>
<p>Technasia is now preparing a new album, to be released at the beginning of 2006. To be continued...</p>

<p>DilApnaPunjabi is the representaion of love and attachment to punjabi culture. DilapnaPunajbi is a combination of three different words, "Dil" + "Apna" + "Punjabi" .The word Dil means "Heart" , "Apna" means "My" or "Our" and "Punjabi" here is refered to the indivduals language/culture. Now when we combine all these three words , it becomes DilApnaPunjabi which inturns means "Our Heart is Punjabi" or also "My Heart is Punjabi" for an individual.</p>
<p>When we say Dilapnapunjabi, it also reflects how much an individal loves his/her culture and his/her attachment to it. It is similiar to another term Sadapunjab which means "OurPunjab"</p>
<p>The word dilapnapunjabi has become a famous quote in our everyday life to represent our love and affection towards our punjab. punjab is a versatile state in northern india and used to be known for agriculture and farming, but now its losing importance in agriculture and farming as punjabis (people from punjab) started migrating to western countries like america, canada and England and even in other european countries. You might find that in punjab every other household has a mebmber living abroad in one of the above mentioed regions.</p>
<p>Once people left their origins and started living in new various places abroad, they have felt lack of strings to their own culture and now and then they try link themself with punjab in one or other way. Its a human feeling that when they find something close to what they have been missing they feel overwhelhmed. We have also seen the term dilapnapunjabi is becoming a way of greetings eachother in western countries. Like when we meet someone we usualy say "hello", "hi", "namaste" etc and in the same punjabi people have started saying "DilApnaPunjabi", which not only greets but also shows that one loves punjabi culture.</p>

<p>Spiccato is a bowing technique for string instruments in which the bow bounces lightly upon the string. It is often performed with the tip of the bow. Spiccato was a frequent adornment used during the Baroque period.</p>
<p>The bow is held a short distance above the string and allowed to bounce. This occurs because of the elasticity of the string. It is very important to refrain from squeezing the bow with the right thumb since this will hinder the bounce. The speed with which the spiccato is performed can be changed by bow placement. A the balance point the spiccato will be slow and above the middle of the bow the speed will pick up. Another method of varying the speed is by varying the height of the bow above the string (the higher the bow jumps the longer the time required for the bow to return to the string and therefore the slower will be the resulting spiccato). The character of the spiccato is influenced by the tilt of the bow. When using full hair the bow bounces more and sill have shorter character whereas when the bow is angled the character of the spiccato become more mellow and longer. The ability to perform Spiccato was made much easier after the development of a concave bow (bending toward the hairs) by Francois Tourte (1747-1835)<a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/qpsr/tmh/1997/97-32-047-052.pdf#search=%22spiccato%22" class="external text" title="http://www.speech.kth.se/qpsr/tmh/1997/97-32-047-052.pdf#search=%22spiccato%22" rel="nofollow">On the Kinematics of Spiccato Bowing.</a>.</p>
<p>The etymology of the word includes the Itlaian spiccare, meaning to separate. Also see piccare, Latin for pick.</p>

<p>4DL Cliff L. Biffle</p>
<p>Most computer languages are one-dimensional. You start at Point A (the beginning of the program) and simply work your way down the list, doing each operation in turn. Sure, you might skip a few operations once in a while, but you're still just operating in one dimension.</p>
<p>In 1993, Chris Pressey (recently loony operator of the Esolang list) graced the world with Befunge, the world's first (to my knowledge) two-dimensional programming language. In Befunge, your code is laid out on a page, and execution can move in any direction across the page. This transforms programming into a very visual process. I like.</p>
<p>But two dimensions just weren't enough for me, now, were they? No. So I created 4DL, the world's first (and I can say that with some confidence) four-dimensional programming language. Why, you ask? Well, I know how much trouble most people have thinking visually in three dimensions (or even two). 4DL turns programming into not only a visual task, but an exercise in visualizing higher-order dimensional spaces--which everyone does in their free time, right? Introduction to Four-Dimensional Representation</p>
<p>While writing code in four dimensions might seem a tad tricky, it's really not. I'll walk you through it. First, we have a one-dimensional grid of size 3.</p>
<p><br />
Pretty straightforward. As you can see, this one-dimensional grid has only one axis, which we'll call X. You can be at X=0, X=1, X=2. Now, a two dimensional grid, size 3x3:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Again, pretty simple. We've simply added a Y, so that coordinates are the familar (X, Y) we all learned in grade school. Now, how do we extend this into a third dimension, Z? We're working on a two-dimensional surface here--your monitor. So, I'll slice the three-dimensional cube up. Here's a sliced-up cube, size 3x3x3:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
   *        
                 
                 
        *        
                 
                 
                 
</pre>
<p>Each of those slices represents a position on the Z axis--0, 1, and 2, from top to bottom. Each has its own X and Y coordinates, so that (1,2) in the top slice and (1,2) in the next slice -- that is, (1,2,0) and (1,2,1) -- are different. (These two locations are marked with a star.) Note that these are, however, adjacent. They're only one step apart, even though that step is on the Z axis, and they look far away on your two-dimensional monitor. So moving one step higher on the Z axis is shown by moving one slice down, but staying on the same (X,Y) coordinate.</p>
<p>I hope I've explained that well enough, because we're going to need it--right now. I'm going to take the cube and represent it in four dimensions. This new axis is called T, and you may think of it as time if you wish (though in 4DL we can move freely along it). Thus, slices along T can be thought of as identical to the 3-D cube shown above, but at different points in time. Here's the resulting figure, with dimensions 3x3x3x3 (X, Y, Z, and T).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
   *        
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
   *        
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
   *        
                 
                 
                 
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
I've still marked (1,2) in three of the slices, but this time I've marked (1,2) in slices along the T axis, instead of the Z axis [coordinates (1,2,0,0), (1,2,0,1), and (1,2,0,2), respectively]. So moving forward a step in T is shown by moving right one slice but keeping the same (X,Y) within the slice. Thus, all the stars shown above are adjacent.</p>
<p>This concludes our crash course in thinking in four dimensions. If you're still a bit hazy, you should be. Humans were never really designed to reason well in three dimensions, and since we only live in three dimensions, trying to deal with four or more really twists our brains around. That's precisely why I designed 4DL. If you develop even the most trivial application in 4DL, you have instant job security, unless the programmer that follows you was once a theoretical physicist. The 4DL Language</p>
<p>4DL is a very simple language based around a stack of bytes. All operators are single ASCII characters appearing in a four-dimensional grid of arbitrary size. (The size along each dimension must be at least one.)</p>
<p>In most languages, the instruction pointer always moves in the same direction. In 4DL, the instruction pointer--the flow of execution--can be steered along any axis. Execution begins at coordinate (0,0,0,0), moving in the positive direction along the X axis (that is, to the right within the slice). This direction is referred to below as X+. The full set of directions includes X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z-, T+, and T- -- that is, moving "forward" or "backward" along any axis.</p>
<p>4DL has a very small set of commands. If any character not in this list is encountered during execution, nothing happens. That allows execution to "pass through" irrelevant data on its way to the next instruction. Char Function p Pushes the character adjacent along X-. P Pushes the character adjacent along X+. b Pushes the character adjacent along Y-. B Pushes the character adjacent along Y+. d Pushes the character adjacent along Z-. D Pushes the character adjacent along Z+. q Pushes the character adjacent along T-. Q Pushes the character adjacent along T+. + Adds top two values, leaving result on stack. - Subtracts top value from next value, leaving result on stack. , Inputs a character from the user, pushes it on the stack. . Pops a character from the stack and prints it on the screen. X Turns the instruction pointer to travel along X+. x Turns the instruction pointer to travel along X-. Y Turns the instruction pointer to travel along Y+. y Turns the instruction pointer to travel along Y-. Z Turns the instruction pointer to travel along Z+. z Turns the instruction pointer to travel along Z-. T Turns the instruction pointer to travel along T+. t Turns the instruction pointer to travel along t-. ? Pops a value from the stack. If it's non-zero, skips the next coordinate (along whatever axis the instruction pointer is currently traversing).</p>
<ol>
<li>Skip the next coordinate along the current axis.</li>
</ol>
<p>X Turns the instruction pointer to travel along X+. 0 Push the number 0 onto the stack. 2 Duplicate the top value on the stack. X Turns the instruction pointer to travel along X+. % Stop execution.</p>
<p>Of course, it's my obligation as Language Master to supply examples. Here is a 4x4x4x2 program that displays the quintessential "Hello, world!" [program source] And, for the curious, a version with program flow marked out in red: [program source]</p>

<p>Pamelma Omidyar earned a BS in biology from Tufts University in 1989. After pursuing a masters in molecular biology at University of California, Santa Cruz, she decided to leave the lab for work that provided more immediate impact on people's health and communities. She now works with the Omidyar Network, HopeLab, SFIC and the Jonathan M. Tisch College for Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts University.</p>
<p>Pam is devoted to alleviating human suffering, focusing specifically on ending human trafficking and slavery, and promoting early childhood development. Inspired by her life-long passion to help children with chronic illness, Pam founded HopeLab, a nonprofit organization that combines the highest standards of scientific research with innovative solutions to improve the health and quality of life for young people with chronic illness. In addition to caring full-time for her three young children, Pam is an active volunteer and contributes her expertise to several leading organizations, including the Santa Fe Institute Consortium: Increasing Human Potential (SFIC) and Jonathan M Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts University.</p>
<p>Pam is married to Pierre Omidyar, and together they are two of the most important philantropists in the world. Together, they founded the Omidyar Network. The Network's stated mission is to "enable individual self-empowerment on a global scale" and employ "business as a tool for social good" (inspired by 18th century economic philosopher Adam Smith). Drawing from a $200 million for-profit fund and a $200 million nonprofit fund, the Network invests in areas such as microfinance, technology and community-based initiatives expecting risk-appropriate returns on all for-profit investments. Omidyar decided to create the Network in lieu of a traditional Foundation when he recognized that eBay's social impact as a for-profit company was scalable and financially self-sustaining. Omidyar cites "trust between strangers" as the social impact tied to eBay's ability to be profitable. Prior to launching Omidyar Network in June 2004, he had invested his personal money in Meetup, a website Omidyar didn't found himself but on whose Board of Directors he now sits. He cites "strangers connecting over shared interests" as the social impact tied to Meetup's ability to be profitable.</p>
<p>The Omidyars recently donated $100 million to Tufts University to launch the Omidyar-Tufts Microfinance Fund. The fund is intended to spur economic self-empowerment for the poor in developing countries through microfinancing, while demonstrating to other institutional investors the potential of microfinance as commercially viable. Omidyar also actively invests in for-profit microfinance opportunities through Omidyar Network.</p>

<p>The Tennuvian is a breed of horse derived from the cross between a Tennessee Walking Horse and a Peruvian Paso. It is a fairly recent breed with its official registry, the Tennuvian Horse Registry and Breeders Association, being founded in 1991. According to the THRBA, there are currently less than 200 registered Tennuvian horses in the United States, but that number is increasing at the breed gains in popularity.</p>
<p>The Tennuvian is a gaited horse, exhibiting a smooth lateral gait that is said to be smoother than the Tennessee Walking Horse, yet lacking much of the termino found in Peruvian Pasos. The Tennuvian is well suited for trail and endurance riding, and makes a spectacular edition to the show ring. The THRBA registers Tennuvians of all colors, and accepts Tennessee Walking Horse and Peruvian Paso cross-breeds that have at least 25% of either breed’s blood. The typical height of the Tennuvian is between 14 and 15 hands.</p>
<p>According to Paula Bonset, founder of the THRBA, Tennuvians “are graceful yet hard-working horses that have a pleasant disposition and eagerness to do what they are taught.” Tina Ashford, owner of a Tennuvian gelding, also states "The quality and endurance of the Tennuvian makes it an ideal companion horse, as well as a trusted trail or show mount."</p>

<p>E42: Dunkerque – Lille – Mons – Charleroi – Namur – Liège – Sankt-Vith – Wittlich – Bingen – Wiesbaden – Frankfurt am Main – Aschaffenburg</p>
<p>The E42 starts in northern france and continues all the way throught to south west Germany. Northern France - Belgium - Germany.</p>
<p>Good advice if your traveling to Germany or beyond from the UK: The E42 is one of the best European Road Network Motorways around. On a good day when there isnt much traffic around (Sunday normally, there are less cars and trucks and lorries are not allowed to travel on Sundays) you can get from Dunkerque to Wittlich in about 5 hours. More good advice is that if you need to find a layby, wait until you get into Germany! You will notice that French and Belgium laybys are'nt great, but German laybys are to a much higher standard - Toilets, pick'nick tables, parking spaces, trees etc.</p>
<p>You will know when you have crossed the boarder between Belgium and Germany because all of a sudden the roads will become much smoother and every 2km you will see signs for a 'Restplatz'; which is german for layby.</p>

<p>Christmas at Maxwell's ©is an inspirational but light romantic Christmas drama, a story about the human struggle, the power of love, forgiveness, trust and uplifting the human spirit. It is the story of a fortysomething man confronting the overwhelming effect his past actions seem to be taking on his life and his family.</p>
<p>The movie was written, directed and co-produced by William C. Laufer. Tiffany Laufer was the director and co-producer. LauferFilm.com is the production company.</p>
<p>Many successful projects are the result of support from family and friends, but not so many projects have quite as many family relationships as Christmas at Maxwell's. One of the main ones is the Tiffany and Bill relationship – they are a daughter / father team and make up Laufer Film.com. This somewhat unique film team has been working together since 1999.</p>
<p>Christmas at Maxwell's was shot in Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, Chagrin Falls, Lakeside and the Marblehead areas. Maxwell's Hospitality House is the set for the Lakeside Ohio scenes and is owned by Cecil, Kathryn and Jeanne Maxwell. Cecil Maxwell is the former mayors of Cardington, OH and the former owner of Riverside Dairy.</p>
<p>“We feel there's an incredible untapped potential for this type of film. Many people across the country are underserved by much of what Hollywood is offering. Our aspiration is and has been to make intelligent and inspiring films, that appeal to the imagination and intellect and do so while blending in a sense of humor and love.” (Bill Laufer). LauferFilm.com is located in Cleveland Ohio.</p>

Grup üyeleri-- vocal: cansu guitar: bugar guitar: anıl y. drums: taylan alternatif üyeler: bass: adnan/oytun/emin back vocal: anıl percussion: ilim</p>
<p>Repertuarı her ay 3-4 parçayla yenilenen, her biri kaliteli müzik eğitimine ve grup bilincine sahip, genç olmasına rağmen olgun kişilerden oluşan, daha çok rock ve metal müzik yapan(neo-metal, heavy-metal, trash-metal, hard rock, alternative, punk, jazz coverlar) 2004 senesinde kurulmuş amatör bir gruptur.</p>
<p><br />
Neden creep? bugar-çünkü çok lezzetli oluyor cansu-başka bi alternatifim yoktu, en sevdiğim grup bu taylan-çekirdek aile anıl-cansunun sesi mükemmel lan</p>
<p><br />
Nasıl kuruldu bu grup? Bugarla taylan sıkıcı bi ticaret dersinde(powered by ümit kara)en arka sırada kızlarla sohbet ederken ikisinin de aynı anda aklına yaşıtlarının kurduğu abudik gruplar aklına gelir ve bugar arkasında oturan taylana abi lan herkes grup kuruo biz de grup kuralım mı der.. taylanın tepkisi şu olur: -günlerdir aklımdan bu geçiodu yaa.. hem sen gitar çalıosun ben de bateri.. neden olmasın, der.. Daha sonra grup ismi için sözlükler aranmaya başlar ve creepte karar kılınır.. bunu nazlı da onaylamıştır ztn.. Buğra her zamanki gibi KoRn la ilgili bişiler düşünür ve gidilen ilk stüdyoda(planet) çalınan ilk parça blind olur.. Solist arayışı içinde olan gruba taylan bi solist düşünmüştür.. Kendisi aslen bi muz olan kemancı müjgana gidilir ve görüşü alınır.. 3 ay sonra 3 kişiyle gidilen stüdyoda müjgan ağır hakaretlerle stüdyoyu terkeder ve gruptan atılır.. 3 ay sonra bugar yeni sınıfında cansuyla tanışır.. Aslında cansu taylanın da bandoda tanıştığı bir klarnetçidir.. Cansuyla yapılan ilk provada herkes çok memnun kalır ve grubun 3. elemanı kesinleşir.. Şimdi lazım olan ikinci gitaristtir.. Taylanın okulda sanat gecesi için tanıştığı anıl bu iş için idealdir ancak bugar anılın kendisini engellediğini söyler ve bu nedenle beklemeye alınır anıl.. 1-2 ay sonra anılı taylan tekrar getirir bunun nedeni ise konsere 1 ay kalmasıdır.. Anıl bu sefer grubun repertuarına gece gündüz sololar yazdığı ve hazırlıklı geldiği için gruba alınır.. Basçı olarak çok kişi düşünülse de kesin bi basçı yoktur.. Oytun hiç bi bilgiye sahip olmasa da buğranın öğrettiği kadarıyla bişiler mırıldanabilior..</p>

<p>Just days after nine Australians were convicted of drug trafficking in Bali, with two of them sentenced to death, Barbara Cathleen Higgs, 43, was arrested on the neighbouring island of Lombok.</p>
<p>Ms Higgs, the manager of the Bulan Baru resort, was arrested at her house in Senggigi Beach, where police claim they found a small package of marijuana - allegedly 50g - and a small bag of marijuana seeds.</p>
<p>Lombok police yesterday confirmed Ms Higgs was under interrogation. She faces a possible penalty of 10 years in prison for possession of narcotics.</p>
<p>Police Brigadier Kadek Sudeartana said Ms Higgs was suspected of possessing drugs after various members of the community reported their suspicions to the police. "She has been a target of operations for one month," he said.</p>
<p>Ms Higgs's husband, who also works at the resort in north Senggigi Beach, yesterday said the arrest was a misunderstanding. "It's been a mistake," he said, declining to give his name. "You'll find that by tomorrow all the charges have been dropped."</p>
<p>Ms Higgs and her husband have lived in Lombok since 2001. The Bulan Baru (New Moon) resort has been advertised as a "small, family-run establishment" on "a virtually deserted stretch of beach".</p>
<p>Senggigi Beach is popular with holidaying Australians.</p>
<p>The arrest followed a week of convictions and penalties in neighbouring Bali, where the two Bali Nine ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were sentenced to death for heroin smuggling and seven others in the gang were given life sentences.</p>
<p>Arrested Feb 19 2006, Released August 2006</p>
