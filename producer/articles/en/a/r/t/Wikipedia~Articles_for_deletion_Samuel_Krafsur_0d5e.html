<li>I can't speak for everyone, but I certainly don't blame family members for things done by someone else (someone who's now dead, in fact). So Ellitot Krafsur bears no responsibility for Samuel Krafsur's actions, morally (and certainly not legally). However, trying to white-wash history is a separate and distinct act, one which may merit condemnation. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:59, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>He worked for a few years as a journalist for TASS, the Russian news agency. Hardly surprising that the KGB was interested in him. This does not make him a spy as the author anonymously claims. Ed6061 14:51, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Krafsur was never convicted nor charged with espionage. The biographer is clearly on a mission. Here he applies highly severe judgment based on a few interpretatively disputatious intercepts. He ignores the legitimacy of being a TASS employee in wartime when the USSR was an ally. He persists in anonymity. His subject has been dead for twenty two years. The biography will cause further harm to the Krafsur name simply by association, as has indeed happened.Ekrafsur 15:07, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Incorrect. A URL refers to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Krafsur_6923.html" title="Samuel Krafsur">Samuel Krafsur</a> as "KGB Agent" but the referenced document only suggests that he might be a source for other contacts. Furthermore the only issue at dispute is whether Krafsur was a "spy". The idea of his being an actual "KGB Agent" is totally farfetched. It seems likely that the URL heading is in fact a mistake, unless of course someone can point to a specific document that show otherwise. Jdivine 06:44, 2 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The URL you refer to starts with "<a href="http://www.nsa.gov/venona/" class="external free" title="http://www.nsa.gov/venona/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsa.gov/venona/</a>" in other words, the <i>web page</i> at that URL (i.e. not the image of the old message, but the HTML file listing all those images) <i>is</i> a US Government document, one associated with the NSA archives, which does indeed refer to "KGB Agent Samuel Krafsur". It might be incorrect, but it <i>is</i> a <i>fact</i> that a formal US government document refers to him that way, and it's entirely appropriate to include that fact in an article about him. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:50, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I do not agree that an HTML index page, in all probability assembled by an intern, would be categorized as a "formal US government document".

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article as written is indeed pejorative. For crying out loud, under Extenal Links we have "Spying on America." The Venona documents listed do discuss IDE but make no indication that the information gathered from him was covertly obtained. Indeed, as a journalist he would likely run across interesting tidbits of information from time to time. And as an employee of the TASS news agency Krafsur would have undoubtedly spoken from time to time with various Soviet government functionaries, some of whom were likely covert KGB. This does not make him a "spy." And frankly, if you caveat and footnote this article enough to make it "fair," it becomes clear that Krafsur is not a figure with enough historical importance to warrant his own biography. Also I note in the talk page for this topic and in their biographies that Nobs and Dwain appear to be on a bizarre quest to rehabilitate the image of Joe McCarthy. This would tend to lend a slant to their "POV" on topics such as these. Jdivine 07:36, 2 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If he was just "a journalist", why does an intelligence officer of the NKGB say (in the message of 17 May 1944) "we propose to use him", when he was <i>already</i> a TASS employee at that point?

<li>All terms are imprecise. I'm not knowledgable in the field, but perhaps you are. Could you suggest a better term and replace the phrase "Spying on America" with something more appropriate? Jdivine 04:03, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The page referenced reads "... we propose to use an employee of the Editorial Office ... for cultivating newspapermen's circles ..." This "cultivation" seems something a mere journalist or an employee of the TASS news agency would not normally be "used" for. The statement is somewhat ambigous, but seems to be a suggestion that names of potential "sources" might be gleaned from this man. Jdivine 04:03, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>While I agree that visibility to Google can vary from subject to subject and should not be used in borderline cases, a subject with no google hits at all (or, as in this case, only hits from Wikipedia and Wikipedia mirrors) is simply not notable. The extra Yahoo hits you referred to, note, seem to be because Yahoo is poorer at recognizing Wikipedia mirrors; flipping quickly through them, it seems that everything there is just the same few Wikipedia pages repeated over and over from different mirrors. That is a bad thing; when the Google search results on a subject turn up nothing but Wikipedia entries, it's a safe bet that someone is trying to use Wikipedia to push a non-notable subject into notability.

<dd>Krafsur is a direct pipleine into the White House; see discussion at <a href="../../../s/a/m/Talk%7ESamuel_Krafsur_b26d.html#1433.2C_1435" title="Talk:Samuel Krafsur">Talk:Samuel_Krafsur#1433.2C_1435</a>, and other notable comments regarding his value to KGB on that Talk page. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 02:37, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't doubt the value of your research into the Venona decrypts; but I'm still not comfortable with the idea of using Wikipedia for information that has not yet become generally accepted. I think it would be better if you published your conclusions with regard to his importance elsewhere first, outside of an encyclopedia; if he's as important as you concluded in those links, it will not take long for your conclusions to become widely-known enough to use as the basis for a Wikipedia article on him. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 04:40, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But it's not the research of people here who brought him to public attention; his name originally came up in books by specialists in this area. (E.g. he's in the ComIntern archives book too, as well as the Venona books by West and Klehr/whatshisname). The work by people here is more in the nature of <i>verifying</i> the statements in those books. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 17:25, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Users: Ed6061, Lauralh8, Ekrafsur, and Jdivine could all be the same person. All their edits it appears have to do with Samuel Krafsur. They all suggest that the article is biased against him and they all give the same message. They give off the appearance of sockpuppets and ostensibly are even if they are a couple of people from the same family. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPitchka_b625.html" title="User:Pitchka">Dwain</a> 18:01, September 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li>COMMENT by E.S.Krafsur 9/8/05: To address 'Dwain's' suggestion that those who have voted 'delete' are the same person, I can testify that they are not because one is my son, Edwin (ed6061); he and I have signed off with our given names or initials. We don't write anonymously.</li>
