<p>Two prime examples of vanity articles that do not really establish notability (although both have done this and that during their lifetime, there's nothing really particularly encyclopedia-worthy).

<li>Sydney Hicks appears largely unverifiable. Bruce Hicks has refs. Keep Bruce for now - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 14:31, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>About Bruce Hicks: If this wasn't written by a family member I'll eat my hat. I see lots of quite minor accomplishments, while the presentation is just oozing with praise. He's been on some committees, worked behind the scenes in politics, got a few awards (none of which have articles; man, there are alot of awards in the world), and then we have his family background. I'm calling this vanity, or at least family-vanity. And <i>"Bruce Hicks" Canada</i>, got me about 500 google hits, which isn't tons, and not all of them are him. eading the article, you'd think this guy basically saved the world from all that is evil, but I'm pretty confident he didn't. The Sidney Hicks article is much worse. <b>Delete</b>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:25, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is why I hate it when two (or more) related articles are VfDed together. <b>Keep and Cleanup</b> Bruce Hicks. It looks like a lot of his accomplishments are pretty much resume-stuffer material that doesn't really mean a whole lot to most people (Look, ma, I made the Order of St. Stanislas!). But I think that a lot of medium-sized accomplishments can pile up and amount to the same thing as a big accomplishment. The guy does have a charitable org and award named after him, and that fact alone might lead some people to look him up. However, the article does need a fair bit of cleanup, NPOVing and trivia-removal. As for Sidney, I sadly must vote <b>delete</b> as 99% of the article seems to be about her family, not her. In this case, removing the irrelevant info would leave us with a 3 or 4-word stub, and it's better just to wipe the whole slate clean. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:16, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not convinced even Bruce's bigger accomplishments are really worth much, even when added together. The article says his greatest accomplishment is being responsible for proposing that the motto of the Order of Canada is placed on the Canadian Coat of Arms, and a small note on the article on the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_Arms_of_Canada_ca4e.html" title="Coat of Arms of Canada">Coat of Arms of Canada</a> is more than enough for that. He started his own foundation and named it after himself, which tons of well-to-do people do; the number of "Ernest W. Flagglebert Foundations" or whatever is pretty large, and we're not talking the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_D._And_Catherine_T._MacArthur_Foundation_127f.html" title="John D. And Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation">John D. And Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation</a> here. Googling the "Bruce M. Hicks Public Service Award" got me a whopping 13 google hits (at least one from his own site) which hardly supports the assertion that it's awarded at most independent schools in Canada (assuming there are more than 12 of them). The article so inflates everything he does I'd really like to take the standard approach to vanity, deleting this, then if he is notable maybe someone who doesn't just want to pour accolades over the guy can write a new article. My guess is anyone not related to him isn't going to. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:07, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> both. Concur with R. fiend. Please note that all this user's posts so far are related to the Hicks/Gidney/Gedney family. One of those is Coat_of_Arms_of_Sidney_Hicks: 90% of the content is an exact copy of the Sidney Hicks page; the heading that reads "Family History" (in both pages) may be also found in Gidney_Family_of_Nova_Scotia under "Brief Family History". Page Bartholomew_Gedney, also created by the user, is up for copyvio. Sorry to add more problems to a nomination that is already double, but I wasn't really sure what to do: shouldn't we consider dealing with these pages in a block, like <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Maltese_nobility_401f.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Maltese nobility">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Maltese nobility</a>? <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 04:26, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There may be something notable lost in this mess, but sifting through it like we're panning for gold won't be the way to do it.
