<li><b>Delete</b>. Probably vanity from the number concerned, I think it just wants to show off by being in an encyclopedia despite its lack of achievements.

<dd>It's no <a href="../../../0/_/_/0.html" title="0">0</a>, that's all I'm saying. Does 2145 have a user page yet? We could leave a friendly reminder not to create vanity pages. Should someone else have enough material for an article, we will of course judge that on its own merits, and put in the link to Category:Wikipedians with article. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 01:28, 2004 Dec 28 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Not encyclopedic because it provides no useful information to anyone old enough to read the article. If I had seen it before the VfD listing I would have speedy-deleted it as a "very short article with little or no context." If anyone ever has anything meaningful to say about the number they can create a new article under this heading without prejudice. This is not a helpful start on an article about 2145, nor does it point out an important topic that we need an article on. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:00, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b>. There does appear to be several figures form antiquity named Jamshid, and the article does hint at this. The problem is that the article, as it stands, is very poorly written. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 01:14, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can vouch for the existance of Ronald J. Young, musician. His webpage can be found here: <a href="http://roninator.no-ip.org/music/" class="external free" title="http://roninator.no-ip.org/music/" rel="nofollow">http://roninator.no-ip.org/music/</a> . My description of the manner of his death was vulgar and slanderous, but I thought it a fitting tribute to him. I have since changed it. 209.170.140.178
<ul>
<li>Note, this comment was left by the anon creator of the article, 209.170.140.178. The link provides no evidence for anyone named Ronald J. Young. However, if the site does belong to RJY, one look at the song titles tells you everything you need to know about the article. The article was created to malign someone named "Ronald J. Young". 209.170.140.178 claims that describing his death as "found dead in his bedroom, smothered by a pile of soiled male undergarments" is a <i>tribute</i>. Further, the article claims that RJY partipated in the "sexual assault of a young boy." --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 01:32, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry if you find the titles of his songs to be offensive, but it's indisputable that they exist. I've spent the day digging through my MP3 collection and have located a few of them. He did not keep his early work online, because he was embarassed of it, for obvious reasons. If you'd like me to post songs online so you can listen to them, I'd be happy to. And the details of his life are not pretty, but unfortunately they're true. 209.170.140.178

<li>I never said I found anything offensive. The "indisputable evidence" that you have provided seems to depict RJY in the exact opposite light as you have attempted to portray him.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've removed some material from the article which could conceivably be libellous, slanderous, or defamatory if a) the article is a hoax, and b) there is a real Ronald J.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Looks like vanity. The only reference I could find on Google supports my theory - a guestbook entry <a href="http://www.newbohemian.com/guestbook.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newbohemian.com/guestbook.shtml" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> by a Ronald J. Young from Four Oaks, who says "I am considering becoming a travelling gypsy when I get out of high school. At the moment I make free music with my one man band". <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 17:14, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm the author of the article. I confess that the famous Ronald J. is not deceased - I made that part up because I thought it added a nice sense of closure to the piece. I assumed that my article would probably be deleted promptly on the grounds that RJY is not well-known outside of a very small circle of friends and admirers, but I never imagined that the actual content would be disputed. Personally I found it quite comical that I was arguing the existence of a person I know well, and of events that I lived through. Everything in the article (aside from his death) is true or a slight exaggeration of what really happened. Certainly his large body of work does exist, and I encourage anyone who is interested to sample it. However, Ronald himself has asked that the article be deleted, and I defer to his wishes on the matter. 209.170.140.97</li>
<li>OK, I'm a little confused about process here, but it <b>seems</b> on the face of it that both the author and the subject of the article—regardless of whether they are the same person or not—want it deleted, as do I and as do most of the contributors to this discussion, so I'm speedying it. I think this should be agreeable to everyone, and I think it's within the spirit of the defined process. If anyone wants it restored, just let me know. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:59, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> inappropriate use of user space. There is precedence for VfD handling inappropriate user pages, and deleting the same after reaching VfD consensus. This is a case of an inappropriate user subpage. Many users track another's alleged misdeeds on a subpage they have created for that purpose. I, myself, have such a page that I don't advertise. This is <b>NOT</b> the same. This is a record of an official complaint that was never certified, and was therefore deleted. The reason that policy calls for deletion of uncertified RfCs is twofold -- to reduce frivolous RfCs and to wipe the slate clean in the case of uncertified complaints. Allowing retention of a copy, as is the case here, defeats both of those goals. This was an official complaint made in an official forum. It was never certified and thus should not remain in any format, in any space. This is a case of a user attempting to use their user space to circumvent established Wikipedia policy. Users should be permitted to do just about anything with their user space <i>except</i> circumvent Wikipedia policy. Clear delete. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 09:08, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>If the issue here is that the RfC was not certified, then perhaps it should be resubmitted. I don't see any description at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> of what constitutes "certification", but if it's just verifying that two users attempted to resolve the issue, I could have done this, fulfilling the requirement, as I put considerable effort into this conflict — except that I didn't even hear about the RfC until after it had closed. (I saw no explanation on W:RfC, either, of how RfCs are supposed to be advertised — rather essential for something with only a 48-hour window.) I can also assure you that this was not a frivolous request. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 10:03, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To certify an RfC, at least two people need to show that they tried to resolve the same dispute with the subject of the RfC and have failed to resolve it. Each person who has been involved must certify by signing in the area "Users certifying the basis for this dispute." As a good rule of thumb, an RfC should not be submitted unless two people have spoken and agreed beforehand to certify it. That one step of preparation would prevent an uncertified RfC. This one, however, was never certified. Whether or not another RfC is initiated is irrelevant to whether or not keeping a copy of an uncertified RfC is circumventing established policy. I was not trying to imply that this RfC was frivolous, merely pointing out a very good reason why the policy is written as it is. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 11:07, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>I must apologize.

<dd>Jeff, I think we're interpreting RFC policy differently.

<dd>Sheesh, I've made yet another mistake! When I posted my first comment under this vote, the policy under "General user conduct" read "please wait until <i>at least two people</i> have contacted the user on their talk page, or the talk pages involved in the dispute". So I correct my correction. Sometimes I'm a bit too anxious to assume blame for confusion, and when I re-read the policy, I must missed the second clause. I notice that it <i>now</i> reads "<i>at least two people</i> must have contacted the user on their talk page, or the talk pages involved in the dispute", but article talk pages still seem acceptable. By these criteria, I could have certified the RfC, had I only known about it. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 00:37, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As SWAdair says there are precedents for VfD being used to discuss personal sub-pages, this seems to me to be the right place for this discussion. It seems important to me that this is deleted. It is a copy of a page that was deleted because of a sensible policy aimed at removing accusations that have been shown to be unsupported by the community. To allow this page to remain is undermining that policy by giving a back-door route for making permanent a complaint that should (when not supported) be only temporary. If you want a copy for your own records, then make one off-line -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 21:34, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Actually, the policy is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_bb98.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment">currently under discussion</a>, and the accusation are not necessarily unsupported by the community; rather, no one at the time was able to honestly certify that they had also attempted to resolve the issues with jguk, and that those efforts had been unsuccessful. (There is a current entry at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html#General_convention_and_policy_issues" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">RfC</a> about the issues, for example.) - Amgine 05:13, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't buy the permanence argument. Everything ever said on Wikipedia is recorded for all time in some history page, some database, even after deletion. The purpose of deletion is not to <i>destroy</i> content deemed unworthy, but to <i>hide</i> it from the masses who we serve, for their benefit. If you're claiming it's easier for readers to find on an active page, that is true — but they won't type the page name in the box and it won't come up on the default search, and most importantly, a page outside the encyclopedia proper cannot reflect poorly on the encyclopedia itself. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 08:18, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. In addition to circumventing the deletion policy for uncertified RFC's, this also violates the policy concerning personal attacks on other Wikipedia members.

<li>Material that has been preserved in BJAODN has been kept in a space that anyone may view. The original has been deleted, but no one has objected to it being copied to another space.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is indeed a loophole in the policy and almost certainly not what was intended by those who wrote the policy.

The memory will remain, however fogged, and at some time it may be felt necessary to attempt to correct memory on such a matter, to indicate by showing the actual text of a uncertified RfC that it was indeed a frivolous request ... or that it was a serious request, which perhaps garnered supporters, but not anyone who could certify at that time. Also, deleting this particular RfC copy would not be a precedent for copies of other RfC's, any more than deleting one article on a relatively unnotable school means that every article of that kind <i>must</i> be deleted.

<p>I found it worthwhile reviewing <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a> to examine just what is and isn't appropriate for a user subpage. I found what I consider the following relevant elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>ALLOW: <i>"to do" information, reminders, works in progress, archives of user talk</i>
<ul>
<li>The subpage can be argued to be fulfulling one or more of these, though it's debatable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AVOID: (basically, anything not related to Wikipedia)
<ul>
<li>Clearly this is <i>not</i> a problem, as the subpage is quite Wikipedia-related.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>The Wikipedia community is fairly tolerant and offers fairly wide latitude in applying these guidelines to regular participants. Particularly, community-building activities that are not strictly "on topic," may be allowed, especially when initiated by committed Wikipedians with good edit histories.</i>
<ul>
<li>Experience-wise, Amgine is 8+ Wikipedia months old, with nearly 800 major edits, most of which are in Talk pages and Wiki meta-namespaces. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a>, who filed this VfD, has many thousands of major edits under his/her belt after only 6 months. His/her edits also appear to be mostly in Talk pages and Wiki meta-namespaces, plus Templates. Both sound rather committed, although more to meta-issues than to main-namespace articles. (I could be reading the histories incorrectly, though.) For what it's worth, the RfC author, <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a>, and its subject, <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a>, are both relative newbies (3+ months) and have both put substantial effort into their causes.
<ul>
<li>Quite a large proportion of Netoholic's edits are reverts. <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVacuum_abf8.html" title="User:Vacuum">Vacuum</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vacuum_f424.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vacuum">c</a>

<li>That's nothing to be scoffed at, quite a few RC patrollers have reverts making up a large slice of their edits. It may not be the most glamorous or intellectual of tasks, but we perform a useful and necessary function on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 16:42, 2004 Dec 28 (UTC)

<li>Yes, normally, but many of Netoholic's reverts are made just because he disagrees with the content of the page, without discussing it on the talk page.</li>

<li><i>As a tradition, Wikipedia offers wide latitude to users to manage their user space as they see fit. However, pages in user space still do belong to the community...</i>
<ul>
<li>Squarely down the middle! Freedom for user, but community right to delete.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Community policies, including Wikipedia: No personal attacks, apply to your user space just as they do elsewhere.</i>
<ul>
<li>The subpage is a copy of a well-documented complaint of a user apparently violating Wikipedia practices, but it can also be seen as a personal attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>In some cases, material that does not somehow further the goals of the project may be removed...</i>
<ul>
<li>If the RfC was removed due to Wikipedia policy, a user subpage copy can be seen as interfering with the goals (as would be true of any copy of policy- or consensus-deleted material).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>If the community lets you know that they'd rather you deleted some or other content from your user space, you should probably do so, at least for now - such content is only permitted with the consent of the community. After you've been here for a year or so, and written lots of great articles, the community may be more inclined to let you get away with it...</i>
<ul>
<li>(See above discussion of users' experience.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>... Alternatively, you could move the content to another site, and link to it.</i>
<ul>
<li>An offline or extra-Wikipedia copy would serve work-in-progress or archive purposes without creating controversy. Having it available on Wikipedia suggests a desire to make it available for community discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>In excessive cases, your user subpage may be deleted... please respect our judgement about what is and is not appropriate.</i>
<ul>
<li>Is this an "excessive" case? Perhaps not, as long as it's not used to subvert Wikipedia processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Ultimately, I fear we have an ideological war going on here about Wikipedia style practices that jguk wants to change and Maurreen wants to keep roughly the same, and in which many others are lining up to aid in the battle. <i>(Disclosure: I have participated extensively in this battle, usually on Maurreen's side, although I've found jguk occasionally brings up good points. My own bias is against frequent changes to Wiki style practices, using personal opinions rather than professional citations to justify them.)</i> I don't know what Amgine's purpose is for retaining a copy of this RfC. However, I am sure that, regardless of the decision made here, the many participants of the ongoing controversies mentioned in the RfC will continue to play <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whac-A-Mole_e6f3.html" title="Whac-A-Mole">Whac-A-Mole</a> with each other in every forum open to them. I don't think it will stop until some Wikipedia elders weigh in on the multiplicity of topics that are under discussion and that have been subject to frequent revision. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 07:03, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I submitted the RFC, so I might be biased. I can see how this is a gray area. But:</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it can be argued that the page is inconsistent with the spirit of deleting expired RFCs, the page does not actually violate the policy.</li>
<li>At <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_bb98.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment">Wikipedia Talk:Requests for comment</a>, most people are supporting changing the current policy, so that expired RFCs would be kept.</li>
<li>I don't see how the page is a personal attack. I disagree that it is interfering with anything.</li>
<li>Apparently <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> didn't bring up his concern to Amgine until the VFD was submitted. I think the reverse order would have been better.
<ul>
<li>The reason being that Netoholic was eager to get my RfC on him deleted, so for consistency he started revert warring on Amgine's page as well as mine. <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVacuum_abf8.html" title="User:Vacuum">Vacuum</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vacuum_f424.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vacuum">c</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's possible to compromise on this by removing any links to the page. Then Amgine will have the information handy, but it won't be obvious to anyone.</li>
<li>I will invite <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this VFD is not in his interests.
<ol>
<li>Although he has objected to the page, I believe he didn't pursue his disagreement very far.</li>
<li>From some comments he has made, my understanding is that he would prefer to at least let the RFC die – that is, not to bring any more attention to it. This VFD has the opposite effect.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I don't wish to discuss my disagreement with jguk here, but I do agree with <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>, that more community input could be helpful. If you're interested, please see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28jguk%27s_changes%29_bfcd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (jguk's changes)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (jguk's changes)</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 12:23, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">This VFD is counterproductive</span></h4>
<p>At <a href="../../../v/a/c/User_talk%7EVacuum_8255.html" title="User talk:Vacuum">User talk:Vacuum</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> said that to delete <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVacuum_Netoholic_RfC_115e.html" title="User:Vacuum/Netoholic RfC">User:Vacuum/Netoholic RfC</a>, he would have to advertise it. Netoholic said he is backed into a corner.</p>
<p>He has chosen not to put that page on VFD. He is apparently getting out of the corner by listing <a href="../../../a/m/g/User%7EAmgine_Maureen%27s_RfC_c0b2.html" title="User:Amgine/Maureen's RfC">User:Amgine/Maureen's RfC</a> instead.</p>
<p>Netoholic said at the top of this page that allowing Amgine to keep User:Amgine/Maureen's RfC weakens protections of the RFC process.</p>
<p>But how is this VFD, and the fact that it has been publicized on at least two other pages, protecting anyone? None of this was needed to settle his disagreement.</p>
<p>If anyone doesn't want such information kept, the issue could have been handled in the abstract on a relevant policy page, instead of bringing more attention to the RFC.</p>
<p>If the purpose of this VFD is to protect the other party in my RFC, this VFD page should be suspended or blanked, and further publicity of it should be deleted from other community pages. (Because it was my RFC, I shouldn't do either of those myself.)</p>
<p>And then anyone can either put <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVacuum_Netoholic_RfC_115e.html" title="User:Vacuum/Netoholic RfC">User:Vacuum/Netoholic RfC</a> up for VFD or start a discussion of the issue in abstract terms at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_bb98.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment">Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment</a>.</p>

<p>I disagree. This has been hashed and re-hashed on the RfC talk page and I think it's appropriate to bring it to a vote now. It was still selfish and unfair of him to put jguk in this position, but putting my RfC up for deletion is his most likely next move. 17:04, Dec 30, 2004 (UTC), updated 16:29, Dec 31, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Or, if he's really sneaky, once the precedent has been established he will incite some other editor to put it up through e-mail or use a sock puppet.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is a so-called "Hereditary Tradition" within modern religious Witchcraft that claims to be older than Wicca, although this is unlikely. However, due to the nature of its claims (that it is a secret tradition handed down within a family) it cannot be either proven or disproven until those supposed secrets are made public. Within modern Pagan discourse this is the first time that I have come across the term "hereditarian belief" and would therefore suggest that this entry is deleted in favour of one on the Hereditary Tradition, which at least does have the merit of being the topic of some discussion within the Pagan community.</li>

<p>Article written by a POV pusher, from what I can tell from the contribs. Notability is iffy at best. Comments?

<li>Horrible article, but I do think there is some notability. I've NPOV-cleaned the article which doesn't leave much, but I suggest we leave that as a stub. Making it a redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Skeptical_Environmentalist_a57c.html" title="The Skeptical Environmentalist">The Skeptical Environmentalist</a> would be acceptable though. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 08:12, 2004 Dec 28 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's impossible to redirect it to The Skeptical Environmentalist because DCSD is not <i>only</i> about this event. On the other hand, this event is important for DCSD so it must be included. I also think that this event has shown that DCSD <i>is</i> analogous to the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a> - because its goal has been proved to be to prosecute the scientists who publish politically inconvenient results - and if the article were objective, this would be mentioned.

<li><b>There is no Vfd policy at all</b>! Nothing is set up in stone there, consensus has not been defined neither a method to extract decisions from a poll. And this 5 days period lag time that does not take into account how many participated in the poll is a total nonscence! Please put in a poll the definition of Vfd consensus, put in a poll what the Vfd decision method should be, then I will stop proposing my own policy. Thank you.

<li>So your "policy" requires you to vote on how to vote on every vote?

<li>I agree with you, this is not the proper forum. But I also agree with Iasson (to a degree); VfD is consistently inconsistent. We keep microscopically granular details about Star Trek, Pokemon and other sci-fi and anime related <i>fictional</i> material yet when it comes to <i>real-world things</i> such as educational institutions, famous public roads, etc, there is a distinct shift in the votes and how that vote is handled. This goes to show you that there is an inherent bias here on Wikipedia as a whole by the voters.

<li>I want to negocate with you guys. I am not asking you to follow my complicated policy that applies to every single Vfd poll separately. I am just asking you to vote on just three polls in order to define <b>accurately</b> the Vfd policy for ALL vfd polls. <b>Poll 1</b>: How many votes and in what time period a Vfd poll should take in order to be legitimate one?" <b>Poll 2</b>: "What rule are you going to use in order to extract a decision from a legitimate Vfd poll?" <b>Poll 3</b>:" How long the decision taken from a legitimate Vfd poll should be valid?". Simple questions, that require simple answers. <b>If you cannot answer them, you have not Vfd policy at all</b>. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 02:16, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just redid the section in <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingle_Bells_7395.html" title="Jingle Bells">Jingle Bells</a>. Since we're also debating whether individual Ashlee Simpson songs can have their own articles, I would suggest that "Jingle bells/Batman smells" is a universally-known song, while Ashlee Simpson is merely a currently-promoted celebrity. But what's going to happen is that people will say that Ashlee Simpson is "important," while the Batman-smells thing is just some song that everyone sings. Interesting re: tacit assumptions.

<li>Comment: This <i>move</i> seems to actually be a cut-and-paste copy. Before deleting the source of this copy, GFDL compliance requires preserving the history in some way. Some ways this can be done are to copy the relevant history to the talk page of the article receiving the information, to make the source article a redirect to the target (ie not delete it at all), or to move the source article to a better name and redirect. There are some other possibilities too. No vote for the moment and probably not until this is resolved. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 15:42, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've put a mention of originator and date into the article history during a small edit. The actual material used is so limited (one factual answer to one question from the FAQ) and even rewritten that it could come under fair use, even in more restrictive jurisdiction, but in general I agree that credit where credit is due is a good idea. This seems the best way since it can't be edited out of existence (like a talk page).

<p><s>Well I can confirm that its a true character from the New Frontier series of books, but then I'm an unregistered user and you've no reason to believe me, but you might want to check out this page on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671042408/103-8114724-6335051?v=glance" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671042408/103-8114724-6335051?v=glance" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671042408/103-8114724-6335051?v=glance</a> and read the summary. The fact that the character appears on the cover of said book would also suggest he's more than non-notable. It worries me that someone can just write 'Patent nonsense' when it's clear that they've not done any research to support they're arguement whatsover, and egotistically assuming that just because they've never heard of a character then that character can't possibly exist. A simple search of the name on Google will throw up references to the book series, a check for the books on Amazon prooves thier existance.

The common English ethnic slur "goomba" should be in Wiktionary as a word fully as offensive as "wop" or "guinnea" for Italian-derived Americans. However, the derivation from Italian would only exist in the etymology section.

<li>No vote. I assure you that if you force the pages to unify, you will revive a huge and bloody edit war. <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loop_quantum_gravity.html" title="Loop quantum gravity">Loop quantum gravity</a> is a highly speculative approach to theoretical physics. Its proponents are very rare between serious professional theoretical physicists, but there are loads of <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crackpot.html" title="Crackpot">crackpots</a> who support this kind of thinking and who have a lot of time to participate in edit wars. LQG is something like <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> or I don't know what's the right comparison. It is virtually impossible to reach any consensus. This huge gap in their approaches was the reason why the sides silently agreed to separate the pages to the main <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loop_quantum_gravity.html" title="Loop quantum gravity">loop quantum gravity</a> page that is mostly edited by the advocates of this theory - and it is completely clear that it always will - and this LQG page is allowed to be twisted in their direction. And on the other hand, the non-LQG physicists can have a separate wikipage that discusses LQG from a neutral point of view. This peace treaty, also supported by the rather long text in the LQG page, was violated by one of the LQG-ers who also wanted to twist the "problems with LQG" page. To avoid the extra wars, it became his personal page. I apologize to Phils, but you will never get a better free text about these issues than problems with loop quantum gravity. --<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumidek_c9b2.html" title="User:Lumidek">Lumidek</a> 20:17, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Lumidek, your accusations and smearings of me everywhere, calling me a vandal, dumb, ignorant of physics, crackpot, etc. are unfounded and inaccurate. Also, you keep presenting yourself as presenting the "correct" version of things, even on highly controversial issues and many of your objections are more rhetoric than content and presuppose a lot of things like the correctness of string theory. Also, your arguments based upon perturbation theory, the S-matrix, nonpredictivity, dualities, etc. do not follow. People seem to give more respect to your "objections" because you are a professor, but... It wasn't my intention to turn your original very POV objections page (which you seem to suggest here is NPOV) into a personal page of mine, but to balance it and reply to some of the objections. Besides, it seems it's you, not me, who is treating objections and problems as personal pages. Also, the comparison of LQG to crakpots and creationism is unfair. Objections to LQG are welcome as long as it's based upon reasonable logical content and not rhetoric and unsound content, like your objections page. I was trying to improve the objections page, in fact. Also, I was not aware of any peace treaty before I started my edits. The only primary contributor to LQG, Miguel, gave up on arguing with you, which isn't exactly a treaty. (The other readers may check the respective talk pages for themselves) Besides, if your objections are sound, it should be possible for you to clarify your objections in the face of replies.

<li>If Lumidek is indeed a recognized authority, then Wikipedia should be able to figure out how to resolve the dispute so that he "wins", assuming nobody else who is party to the dispute is an authority, too. The mechanism for that is not to fork the article so that Lumidek gets to have his say in a forked article, while know-nothings and cranks (if that is what they are) control the main article. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:34, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Objections contain "replies" of a fan of loop quantum gravity. The quality of these "replies" is poor and a certain Wikiuser kept on adding them. So the final decision was to create two articles - one "Objections..." includes the silly "replies", while the "Problems" contains the proper optimized text only that only contains the objections=problems, and not stuff that obviously does not belong to the page. --<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumidek_c9b2.html" title="User:Lumidek">Lumidek</a> 20:07, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is clear concensus that this is not an encyclopedia article.</li>
<li>While the general opinion seems to favor <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a> to Wiktionary, my understanding of their rules suggests that they only want words in use in English.
<ul>
<li>No evidence was presented that this word is actively used in English.</li>
<li>I can find no evidence of significant usage myself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do remember enough German to agree with <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> that this is an incomplete definition regardless.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I believe this will be rejected by Wiktionary, I can not in good conscience transwiki it to them. That leaves me with Delete.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to contest this decision, it would probably be easiest to do so by recreating the content directly in Wiktionary. The content read "Bildung is a German word meaning education/upbringing." <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:15, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<a name="Bildung" id="Bildung"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Bildung</span></h3>
<p>Great, yes, it may mean that. But this is a dictdef, if I ever saw one. <b>Move</b> to Wicktionary. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">Talk</a> 22:19, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>and therefore should be {{Move to Wiktionary}} and NOT "Votes for deletion". <a href="../../../k/n/a/User%7EKnaggs_2e16.html" title="User:Knaggs">Jeff Knaggs</a> 22:39, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Indeed so. I've added the tag, the vfd one is still there though. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:44, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Indeed no. Please don't lecture. Things come here for deliberations about whether they should go to Wikipedia or not. The problem with an automatic and preemptive transwiki tag is that Wikipedia does not have a VfD. The people who work there don't necessarily enjoy inaccurate, sloppy, and hasty definitions shoved over there. So, does <i>Bildung</i> of <i>bildungsroman</i> (which is what this seems to be) need to go over like this? I say delete and let Wiktionary develop its own. Well formed, precise definitions should be transwikied. Let's care more about them than we appear to about Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:58, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>OK if I have to make a guess about what wiktionary wants, I'll go with "If you are creating a new page, be sure it is allowed under the criteria for inclusion <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>." It satisfies criterion #1, in widespread use (over 18 million hits). Also "It is appreciated if your new page conforms to the style of Wiktionary.", so including the MtW tag will enable people familiar with that style to find and format it. Vote remains move to wiktionary. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>FWIW, I was referring to Jeff Knaggs's comment. Folks should, of course, vote "keep" or "transwiki," if that is their judgment, but I have never responded well to people who use VfD to attack the article nominators. If the nominator is wrong, the vote will make it clear, and there's no reason to be personal about it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:20, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, and no hard feelings to an admin who declares it a <b>Speedy</b>.
