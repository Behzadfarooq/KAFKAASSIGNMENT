<li><b>Weak keep</b> quoting from BIO: "just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted".

<li>No, the point is that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is written as a guideline for inclusion.

<li><b>Keep</b> He's an internet phenomenon like the "Star Wars Kid" (who has a looooong wiki page). Interesting enough to keep and add more information. He already has fans you know...(Mikadoo 03:07, 15 August 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>... for now. Too new, it may be just his "15 minutes".

<li><b>Delete</b> recentism - this guy just happens to be the current fad and was reported in the UK press (notably the London Metro) but it's not a notable phenomenon and is only here because it's currently going on. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 10:32, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If you are notable even for 15 minutes you have been or are notable. It's like saying Elvis was notable once but not anymore! I say keep the wiki and if he really does lose popularity over the next few months then delete then. It should not be the other way around - there are way too many geeky idiots with too many self interests who should let authors (like the one who wrote this) get on with it and not serve as just a 'notable' nuisance. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Str8hing (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Str8hing_e427.html" title="Special:Contributions/Str8hing">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Featured on GMTV (UK breakfast TV programme) morning of 15th August. Also, can youtube stats count as a 'reliable' source. Over 1 million views of his videos is pretty large, is it not?

<li><b>Keep</b> Can't see any real reason to delete. Has received a lot of media coverage. These people saying 'will he be remembered in 50 years' and 'recentism' to you I say so what? I find it notable based on it being reported in dozens of papers, on dozens of tv stations and radio stations. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 15:32, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I think something needs to mentioned here. Even if an article in a major newspaper is just a repeat of a Reuters article says something... it should count for something. Why? Because it means a major newspaper decided to use it, meaning the editors of a major paper thought it was somewhat important. I can understand not wanting to count small-town news paper repeats, but if the ohter major outlets carry it, then it is something more. Dave 16:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sure, youtube does not count as "well-known films or television productions" (which is the rest of that quote), but I'd say that it is verifiable that geriatric1927 has a large fan base and cult following. (His subscriber list and massive number of responses demonstrate that. He is one of the most-subscribed-to users on the site.) –<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyluciano_4d5d.html" title="User:Andyluciano">Andyluciano</a> 17:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In any case, he has become a phenomenon, a poster of how the internet is connecting all walks of people, and his stories are truly touching, even more so, the way he is taken back by being so well recognized (as the bloke is 79, lost his wife years ago).

<li><b>Comment</b>. Agree with previous comment. I think this guy is a noteable, not as a celebrity but as an event in Internet evolution, showing how effective these tools are for reaching out to large audiences, and as a first to span the age gap and gain wide acceptance just by talking about life.

<li>It's just a question of covering notable and verifiable information.

<li><b>KEEP</b>with half a million hits on youtube, he is notable and many people like me, might hear about him from the news and would want to know about him in more detail and quickly from wikipedia. Since I found many interesting information on "Salam Pax" in wikipedia, I've felt that the main advantage to wikipedia is that it is up to date and doesn't only cover TV celebrities. And since one criteria for notable personalities contains "large fan base" for TV personalities, I don't understand how TV personalities would be more important than You tube personalities. And finally even if he does die away, his importance will always be in his age.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>if he doesn't meet the requirements for an autobiography, I think the 'geriatric1927' phenomenon itself should be recorded in wikipedia somewhere, whether as a full article or as a prt of another.

<li><b>KEEP</b> I don't understand Brian's insistence of verifiable and more media mention of geriatric1927 considering Emmalina was a Keep with less media coverage, fewer viewers and did nothing notable. This man is the most subscribed to user on YouTube, has had International media coverage and most important - he's captured a worldwide audience that spans four generations, that alone is quite notable and an amazing accomplishment. He won't soon be forgotten. If he is, then take the page down then, like Emmalina's should be considering she's no longer on YouTube and never accomplished anything noteworthy.
