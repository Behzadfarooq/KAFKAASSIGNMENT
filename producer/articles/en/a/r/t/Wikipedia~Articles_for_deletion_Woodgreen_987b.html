<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to claims of vote-stacking, their are large amounts of people who beleive well-written articles for schools are inherently notable. Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group. Speaking for myself, I evaluated the article and voted to keep it out of sincere belief that it deserved to be kept and not out of any votestacking motivation. I have faith that the majority of the other voters did as well. Thank you for your time. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 03:54, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I see all of the same copy&amp;paste block votes above as on the other high schools' articles. I cannot help but be suspicious of them, given that those voters all voted the same as they voted above ("real place", "notable", "interesting stub", and so forth) at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Maha_Jana_High_School_44ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Maha Jana High School">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Maha Jana High School</a> for a school that doesn't actually exist. So instead I'm voting after <i>actually reading the article</i>. ☺ Wood Green School is one of 34 secondary schools <i>under the aegis of Oxfordshire Education Authority alone</i>. It has all of the standard trappings of state schools: PTAs, 6th forms, newsletters, school trips, and so forth. And there is <i>nothing</i> to mark it out from the crowd of 34, let alone from out of the vastly larger crowds of all secondary schools in the United Kingdom, or all secondary schools in the world. It's worth noting that schools are, after all, <i>intended</i> to be uniform. Reasonably uniform provision of public education at this level is indeed public policy in many countries. There is nothing of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">importance</a> to say about such schools and their articles (with any <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">academic boosterism</a> neutered) are thus tantamount to directory entries. Indeed, this article has almost nothing more to say about Wood Green School than its listing in the Oxfordshire Education Authority schools' directory has to say. And that <i>is</i> a directory. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:32, 2005 Mar 9 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Although I was made aware of this by User:GRider I don't believe this invalidates my vote. My personal opinion is that all secondary schools are worthy of being on Wikipedia and I will vote on all relavent pages when however I am made aware of this. If the purpose of VfD is to determine what the community feels about an article then it is best that it involves as many people who feel concerned as possible.</li>

<dd>With regard to the above comment schools are never going to achieve uniformity whether it is intended to or not. I am sure this school, like any group of hundreds of people will have a unique history and events occuring in it which <i>are</i> encylopedic. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 22:32, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a directory</a> refers to business listings and is a directive against using Wikipedia to advertise. Using this argument against a state school is completely out of context. It is not suprising that this school has <i>all of the standard trappings of state schools</i> because it <b>is</b> a state school. However that does not mean there is nothing unique about it.</dd>

<dd>This page contains enough data about the school to merit its incusion in Wikipedia as a stub. The stub label is there as an invite to any Wikipedian from the local community or the school who knows more about the school than is on the website to update the page using their personal expertise.
