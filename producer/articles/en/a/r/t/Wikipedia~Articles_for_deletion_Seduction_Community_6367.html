<li><b>Merge</b>, I think that this is definately a notable topic for wikipedia. For example, look at the number of mainstream media articles about one seduction community guru in the media: <a href="http://www.mysterymethod.com/InTheMedia.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.mysterymethod.com/InTheMedia.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysterymethod.com/InTheMedia.aspx</a> . This area truely has an extreme danger for promotion however. Essentially, even though for example this mystery person has had a lot of articles about them, the majority of the techniques and lingo of these style organized pickup artists evolved from a ton of community interaction primarily on websites, making the particular notability of any one of them more suspicious. Therefore I propose we merge this and all current and future articles on particular individuals of this community into one article. The only articles I know of in wikipedia on individual members are on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Deangelo_370e.html" title="David Deangelo">David Deangelo</a>, mystery, and Ross Jefferies. Any new articles which crop of for other "gurus" should be merged into the one article. The question is what this one article would be called. As the first person noted, there is not a widely used name for this phenomenon as yet, either by outsiders or by those in the particular groups. I propose that we stick with this article name for now and rename it to whatever seems more apropriate as time goes by. As a final argument, wikipedia voted to keep the seven styles of lightsabre fighting article, which essentially voids all delitions for notability as being hypocritical&#160;:). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.127.176.41 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__68.127.176.41_ada2.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 68.127.176.41">contribs</a>).</small><small>same IP block as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seduction_Community&amp;diff=24131000&amp;oldid=23704349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seduction_Community&amp;diff=24131000&amp;oldid=23704349" rel="nofollow">main contributor</a> to this article.

<li><b>Keep</b>This is an underground trend that should be discussed in a balanced way. The few Internet sites mentioned are the most independent ones available and probably most representative of the community being described. Let's discuss how to make the article more informative, as the subject matter is of interest. I agree with the previous comment that the subject matter has a danger for promotion. Individual members such as Deangelo, Mystery, Badboy and Jeffries are commercial interests, and may not merit having their own page. These people are four among the most well known of the commercial seduction coaches. The term "seduction community" is probably the best and most common description used. This is how the community currently describes itself. See the term's use in a recent popular book on the subject (this week THE GAME is number 15 on the NYTimes Bestseller list). This book is being widely reviewed. An alternative title for the page such as "Seduction Strategies for Men" only sounds more promotional. <small>&lt;-- Unsigned comment by <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 06:26, 2 October 2005 (UTC), c. 03:30 UTC - this user has edited this article and <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction.html" title="Seduction">Seduction</a> and inserted as well as deleted affiliated links.</small></li>

<p>Hadal, upon what do you base this "viral marketing" charge? If you prefer to remove these links in favor of other, more neutral ones, please suggest them. The subject itself is worthy of an article, although it is true that there are link spammers active in this area. The current version does not contain these links. <small><a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 06:26, 2 October 2005 (UTC), c. 04:30 UTC - this user has edited this article and <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction.html" title="Seduction">Seduction</a> and inserted as well as deleted affiliated links.</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to quote User: Fubar here: "Wikipedia needs to be able to reflect all verifiable human knowledge." I fail to see how a page describing a big Irish department store or a popular video game called "Ghosts and Goblins" has more interest and value than an article about the seduction community. Suggest criticism be given to help REVISE and avoid deleting information. Everything written on this page is not intended to be promotional, but purely descriptive. Please verify information provided. Here is <a href="http://www.mysterymethod.com/Article.aspx?aid=4" class="external text" title="http://www.mysterymethod.com/Article.aspx?aid=4" rel="nofollow">an excerpt from an article in the NYTimes</a> that provides more background.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Subject matter is somewhat controversial. The article needs to be improved and made more balanced. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 06:26, 2 October 2005 (UTC) <small>This user had less then 50 edits, on all this topic or closely related articles</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> the page was extensively re-written after going up for AfD to remove the spammy elements. Then it was extensively re-written again after discussion on IRC, to make it more like a proper wikipedia article — it's even got an excellent reference section now!. I don't have a stake in it either way (well, I'd prefer it were deleted, just to remove the phrase "seduction community" from my user contribs&#160;;-)) but if you're going to delete it, please delete it on the merits of the article as it stands and the notability of the community, not because it originally looked like spam. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>I have seen reference to this thing in the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_DeAngelo_10f5.html" title="David DeAngelo">David DeAngelo</a> article which is also voted for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> DeAngelo is arguably among the most successful of the commercial dating coaches in this community. That article seems promotional is nature, and contains a number of factual errors. Perhaps it also should be marked for improvement/revision.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> it does talk about commercial products, but does not appear to be hyping them and it does give some criticism of the products. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMosheZadka_d42e.html" title="User:MosheZadka">MosheZadka</a> 18:53, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This topic is the main subject of a book on the New York Times bestseller list, "The Game," by Neil Strauss. If that isn't an indicator of worthiness, I don't know what is. Contributors can filter out blatantly commericial links, but the subject should be in. <small>Unsigned comment by User:70.225.167.229</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this article is very intresting but it could be checked for accuaracy. <small>Unsigned comment by User:157.62.105.5</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's an interesting subject that I think people will find fascinating to read one way or other. The page should be kept and improved. Puga 08:18, 2 October 2005 (UTC) <small>User:Puga has only two entries, from an account created today, all on this article</small></li>
