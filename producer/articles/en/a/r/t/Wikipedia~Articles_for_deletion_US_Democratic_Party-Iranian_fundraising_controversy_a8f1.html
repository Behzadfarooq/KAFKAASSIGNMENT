<li><b>Delete</b> much of the factual content on the article is disputed and seriously looks like use of article space to support a point-of-view. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 17:56, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Devil, how familar are you with this subject? Have you read any of the 18 sources listed on this page? If so, how many. How much have you contributed to this article before the deletion? I don't see your name in any of the 500 edits on this page. You state: "much of the factual content on the article is disputed" What factual content is disputed? You don't say. Have you attempted to discuss this content on talk? Please correct me if I am wrong, but I don't see your name anywhere on the talk page either.<br />
As per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfd_743f.html#Before_nominating_an_AfD" title="WP:Afd">WP:Afd#Before_nominating_an_AfD</a>:<br />
Before nominating a recently created article, please consider that many good articles started their Wikilife in pretty bad shape. Unless it is obviously <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">a hopeless case</a>, consider sharing your reservations with the article creator, mentioning your concerns on the article's discussion page, and/or adding a <a href="../../../c/l/e/Category%7ECleanup_templates_a43d.html" title="Category:Cleanup templates">"cleanup" template</a>, instead of bringing the article to AfD.<br />
Jersey Devil, have you or any of the editors who want to delete this article edited the article before? Have you:<br />
1. consider sharing your reservations with the article creator,<br />
2, mention[ed] your concerns on the article's discussion page, and/or<br />
3. add[ed] a <a href="../../../c/l/e/Category%7ECleanup_templates_a43d.html" title="Category:Cleanup templates">"cleanup" template</a>?<br />
Now these three points are not policy, but it is something that should be considered by every person who wants to delete this article, and by the person deciding this case.<br />
<a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">a hopeless case</a> links to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">Wikipedia:Speedy deletions</a> does this page meet any of the policy reasons under Speedy deletion? Editors have to guess if this page violates <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">Wikipedia:Speedy deletions</a> because your nomination explains no reason behind this <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. Since you have not edited the article ever before you put it up for deletion, editors can't depend on these reasons on the article talk page either.<br />

<li>Excuse me Devil, but are you trying to say that just because some people with a strong opposite POV (hence NOT NPOV), we should delete this article???

<li><b>Delete</b> per JD, sources either have nothing to do with the article, or are to Conservative web-sites. Article appears to be a NPOV violation <a href="../../../c/i/t/User%7ECiticat_8adf.html" title="User:Citicat">Citicat</a> 18:41, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Additional comment</b> For some reason people started to accuse one another of being "leftish" or "conservative" here. Just for the record, my edit history is bipartisan and I'm not related to U.S. in any way. I edited the article even before it was nominated. This article has 11 sources:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>First linking for whatever reason (???) to the homepage of The Iranian-American Bar Association.</li>
<li>Second one after sentence "<i>Nemazee was also national finance chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee until late 2006.</i>" cites <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketplace_%28radio_program%29.html" title="Marketplace (radio program)">Marketplace</a> commentary on democratic financing, but sentence needs rather official source saying that Nemazee was indeed chairman from xxxx until late (?) 2006.</li>
<li>Third source is for Nemazee being <i>"top fundraiser and donor to the Democratic National Committee for the past 10 years."</i> But doesn't state that this title was given to him by activist blog...</li>
<li>Paragraph "<i>During his presidency, Bill Clinton attempted to name Nemazee U.S. Ambassador to Argentina but was rejected by the US Senate after Forbes magazine published in May 1999 an expose of his financial dealings and involvement with the Islamic Republic. According to the New York Times he withdrew.</i>" Doesn't cite source for his rejection but than states that NYT said he witdrew - so what's the true?</li>
<li>Another source (<a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybercast_News_Service_61c8.html" title="Cybercast News Service">Cybercast News Service</a>) really sources what's written in the article but why quote conservative news website?? No other outlet ran this story? What about some major daily?</li>
<li>Anoher sources is for what Nemazee testified - <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldNetDaily_c1c3.html" title="WorldNetDaily">WorldNetDaily</a> - and again, why source from conservative website?</li>
<li>The same as the one before...</li>
<li>Another two are Chinese People's daily and Iranian farsi.net stating that Clinton's "missive" was ignored. Farsi cites American State dep. spokesman, etc. Again: No other source?</li>
<li>NYT is about other unrelated letter and should support that there was only one previous letter sent to Iran ("<i>This was Clinton's second letter to Mohammad Khatami.</i>") Could there be other letters as well? Does this source guarantee what it should? (Well, this is really not so terribly important to the article.)</li>
<li>In the last one People's daily says that Teheran Times said...</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This is just about the sources... there are lots of unsourced statements/weasel words and I removed the most POV statements before this article was nominated. There is no substance in this artcile, is unencyclopedic, is indeed badly sourced and I still do think it should be deleted.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPethr_1b0f.html" title="User:Pethr">Pethr</a> 21:28, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per Travb and Khodavand. Article is sourced and sources meet the criteria of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As Khodavand writes, calling the sources listed as "far-right" or "extremist" is itself POV. We're not talking about white supremacist sources or the John Birch Society or anything like that which would obviously not such criteria. Whether or not anyone agrees with the sources is moot - the fact remains that such allegations against the Democratic Party do exist and go back to the JFK administration (when there were accusations of Democrats being "soft on Communism".) Similar accusations (though in a slightly different vein) have been leveled at the Republican Party, such as the relationship between the Bush dynasty and the Saudi royal family. These are actual allegations - they exist. You cannot ignore them due to your ideological or partisan bent and to delete this material would be stripping Wikipedia readers of valuable information that is difficult to find elsewhere. Khodavand makes a wonderful point in suggesting that all relevant POVs be included in the article. This proves to me that the article was started in a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> move. Again, deleting or ignoring sources is not the answer. Rather, the answer is to include opposing viewpoints to balance such articles. This is the way it's always been done on Wikipedia, and when adhered to, things always remain neat and copacetic.
