<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject of this article is verifiably real and has been widely documented in the global print, television and radio media. It is clearly notable, as has been discussed at length during two previous unsuccessful article deletion attempts made since February 2004. The article has obviously been worked on by multiple contributors. This is an spurious vfd by an individual who is apparently a disgruntled member of a Roman re-enactment micronation group called Nova Roma, who has recently been attempting to delete all references to that group from the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">Micronation</a> article. This user's only other contribution to Wikipedia has been the creation of an article, on the subject of a completely non-notable, undocumented, and very likely fictitious internet club Societas Via Romana, which I listed for deletion earlier today.--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 05:29, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Isn't there meant to be some ruling on how often a page can be listed for VfD? I'd have though this was too close to a previous vote to be allowed. On the other hand - well, I've had international papers published, been interviewed by the BBC, had formal interactions with government representatives (and anyone in the UK could - MPs surgeries are rarely over booked), and have no Wikipedia article on me</li>
</ul>
<p>because I'm not important enough. As for being interviewed on Radio 4... well, Radio 4 likes interviewing eccentrics - [<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/presenters/purves_interview.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/presenters/purves_interview.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC link</a>] - I like the reference to the man who lifted washing up bowls with his stomach. The editor blocked the dwarf throwers, though. I'd like to stress that I'm not saying you're a nutter, but I am saying that being interviewed by the BBC is clearly no official stamp of significance. Can you tell us on which BBC Radio 4 programme this interview aired? Also, the lack of links to anything other than atlantium.org isn't impressive. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 13:08, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment: If you'd followed the link you'd have noted the reference to the <i>Outlook</i> programme. I agree that notability is not determined by <i>an</i> article in the media. Notability is determined by the confluence of multiple factors - media attention from multiple sources in multiple locations being one factor - which Atlantium obviously has - (most recently a top-of-page 3 article in Australia's leading broadsheet paper with a 250,000 daily circulation). Academic attention is another mark of notability - and Atlantium has that too - as the subject - along with Sealand and Hutt River Province - of an exhibition at the University of Sunderland (UK), commencing Nov 7. The products of Atlantium are also held in numerous museums - again see the above link to a receipt from the Brazilian Central Bank as an example. I mean, seriously, how much empirical evidence do you want? --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 13:30, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you ever develop the ability to link to something other than your own webpage in these arguments, it might be a little more convincing. As for Outlook, they are one of the BBC programmes that interviews both the serious and important and the completely deranged - here's an excerpt from the BBC webpages "Liar, liar This year's King of Liars has just been crowned in a small town in France, but what makes a good liar? We will be finding out on Outlook today.". The Brazilian Central Bank - you sent them something, they sent a receipt. Isn't that just standard practice? <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 12:23, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>As you are no doubt aware, few media outlets retain active online article links for more than a few months without charging for it - hence the multiple pdf articles listed on our media coverage page - all of which are clearly from the stated external sources. I can also source video footage from Reuters and the ZDF network in Germany if desired, along with documents/references from the University of Sunderland, and, with a certain amount of time the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Working Group on Indigenous Peoples and the Office of the Dominican President. The importance of the Brazilan State Bank receipt is the fact that it "recognises" the source in full titular detail, which I would presume to be at very least an unusual occurrence. All of these arguments about "legitimacy" are however rather off-topic; we are not discussing the "legitimacy" or even the "worth" of Atlantium. We are discussing whether it is noteworthy based on the fact that significant numbers of people, having heard about it, are likely to come to Wikipedia to research it further. I believe that to be self-evident.--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 03:58, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Atlantium verifiably exists, at least to some degree. Concerns about the content of the article, as stated above, or the participation of the "Emperor" of the article in is editing, are not valid reasons to vote to delete; they are valid reasons to modify the content of the article. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<li>Delete. Much of the "evidence" above is bogus, for example the "Imperial Legate" to Brazil is primarily the Albanian consul-general in Brazil, and it was no doubt in the latter function that he was on that conference and got to speak to the vice president and other diplomats. And I suppose anyone can send an example of their private coinage to the Brazilian Central Bank and get a note of receipt. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 14:55, Aug 10, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment. So... the Albanian consul-general, who one assumes is a real live diplomat, also functions as a repesentative of Atlantium... but somehow the fact that a real live diplomat is associated with Atlantium at all doesn't count as notable, because... why exactly? And this group that has produced physical artefacts that were receipted in the name of the group, and that are held in the state collection of the Central Bank of one of the world's largest countries is not notable because... why exactly? --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 15:12, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<li>Consuls often do weird things. No, it is not notable that he plays this role for you. You may be paying him, without him having to do anything other than allow you to call him "Imperial Legate" and use his photos of his usual activities for your purposes. And it's not notable either that you minted coins and sent them to the Central Bank which puts it in some curiosities collection. The bottom line is that neither Albania nor Brazil nor any other country recognizes Atlantium. Therefore Atlantium is of no significance to anyone outside its own membership. And the size of that membership is not verifiable. I wonder why you spend so much time personally defending Atlantium on Wikipedia - isn't this beneath an emperor? If you really have thousands of members, why can't you recruit some of them to do some of the propaganda work here? <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 15:49, Aug 10, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>1. The point of the discussion is not "is Atlantium recognised by Brazil or Brobdiginia?". The point of the discussion is, "is Atlantium a notable, verifiably real entity that is likely to be the subject of Wikipedia research by someone who has heard about it somewhere else?" - the answer to which is "yes". The fact that it has been the subject of extensive TV, radio and press coverage over an extensive period in many parts of the world, and is to be given formal scholastic attention by a tertiary educational institution, as noted elsewhere in this discussion, would certainly seem to indicate that it is "of interest" to plenty of people outside its membership. 2. I have been a Wikipedia editor since 2002 and I enjoy it as a socially beneficial and intellectually stimulating diversion. Unlike some here I have created and contributed to a multiplicity of articles on a wide variety of subjects - the majority of which I have no personal interest in. Are you suggesting that it is acceptable for me to invite the general membership of Atlantium to join Wikipedia for the express purpose of supporting this article? --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 21:16, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The answer is that it is <i>not</i> notable. It is an extreme exaggeration to call the media coverage "extensive". The media page on your website lists probably the entirety of it - and they are typically <i>ridiculing</i> the whole thing, so you are apparently not selective, but put up every press coverage you can find, and it's a total of 13 articles. And you can add a few minutes on BBC and your part in a university micronation exhibition and it is still by no means "extensive". The second point is that your personal involvement here, and the lack of other Atlantians, casts doubt on your claimed membership, which, if of a certain size, would be the only justification for having an article on an entity that lacks any <i>outside</i> significance. It would not be acceptable to invite your membership here, but I don't think you would shy away from it if you could - you just invited 16 people on their talk pages to vote here too. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 21:53, Aug 10, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Again, you are (selectively) missing the point entirely. Firstly, you don't appear to grasp the meaning of the term "extensive" - in either is geographic or other contexts. Secondly your perjorative use of the blanket term "ridicule" - which, apart from not applying to all (or even most) of the cited examples - does not address the point of the discussion and is therefore moot. Thirdly, you assume that I have provided (or indeed, that I even <i>possess</i>) a complete list of either media references or other available evidence, when it should be clear to you from publicly available dissusions tied to previous deletion attempts and discussions for this and related articles that I have not and do not. Fourthly, I did indeed invite people who have supported and edited this page previously to review the current discussion - exactly as any other editor can. It is obviously particularly relevant to those editors - and they all, to my knowledge, possess intelligence and free choice in sufficient quantity to act in the manner they decide is most appropriate. Attempting to turn that into some sort of half-baked character assassination does you no favours.--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 23:27, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How am I not grasping the meaning of "extensive"? 13 articles is not extensive; the geographical distribution makes no difference there. And I think titles like "the boy from Hurstville who now rules a big flat", or a picture of His Imperial Majesty with the royal vacuum cleaner, or speaking of "plenty of fun-filled, fun-sized enclaving for micromaniacs everywhere" is not exactly evidence of taking Atlantium seriously - it is just reported on as a curiosity, like thousands of others who are not therefore encyclopedic. The assumption that you provide all articles you are aware of is a rather safe one, and you must be aware of most of them since the reporters will contact you unless they just make a story on the basis of the website (and such stories would not be any more credible than the website itself). As to your invites, I was just telling the facts - you're obviously doing your utmost to save the article (you didn't invite people who <i>opposed</i> the article before) - if you take that as a character assassination, then that's you describing your own character. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 02:05, Aug 11, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>1. <i>How</i> exactly is 13 articles in newspapers from Romania to New Zealand <i>not</i> extensive? Is 14 extensive? Is 20 extensive? 50? And what about the Reuters television coverage screened everywhere from Peru to Azerbaijan? Or national coverage on one of Germany's 2 national television networks? I suppose that is "not extensive" too, according to your endlessly rubbery goalpost-shifting definition. And how about addressing the Uni of Sunderland exhibition? I assume that the opinions of gallery curators are somehow excised from serious consideration too. I can offer you mobile phone numbers and videos in the mail if you really want them - but of course you won't take up my offer, because if you were honest you would admit that you are not actually interested in establishing the article's validity at all - merely in sharing further irrelevant disparaging commentary. Notwithstanding all of the above, your central thesis is flawed. <b>The point of the discussion is, and remains, "is Atlantium a notable, verifiably real entity that is likely to be the subject of Wikipedia research by someone who has heard about it somewhere else?" - and the answer is, and remains, "yes".</b>--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 03:12, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At 50 articles it might start to get interesting. Two television items don't make a difference, nor does one exhibition. And the point of the discussion is not whether it is an "entity that is likely to be the subject of Wikipedia research by someone who has heard about it somewhere else", because too few people will have heard about it somewhere else to begin with. The point is that it is not notable. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 03:22, Aug 11, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>International media attention? I suspect you are currently lagging well behind the [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/3023369.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/3023369.stm" rel="nofollow">killer badgers of Evesham</a>] on that account.<a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 14:49, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your criteria are extremely interesting - if only as an illustration of your total lack of objectivity on this subject. Please share with us which established academic standard they are derived from. And please also explain how an audited BBC World Service audience of 153 million people (as just <i>one</i> example) can be considered "too few".--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 03:36, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Obviously there is no "objective" standard for this. If you want to maintain that a total of 13 articles plus 2 TV and 1 radio item constitute "extensive media coverage" which makes anything significant enough to have an encyclopedia article, fine. I disagree. And 153 million would not be too few if all those heard about Atlantium, but this is just more manipulation. A bit of research reveals that this is not the total number of listeners at any time, but the average number of listeners <i>per week</i>. Considering you had just a 7-minute segment (according to your own claims), and that is just the 1,440th part of a week, the number of people who have heard it is of course not in the millions. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 03:50, Aug 11, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>So now there is "no objective standard" for notability. Well I guess that's <i>one</i> way of justifying a position that can be summarised as <i>"it's not notable because I say so"</i>. Clearly, your arguments are becoming more and more torturous, the longer you persist in attempting to promote your indefensible position on this subject. Even if your latest proposition were to be taken at face value, it puts you in the position of claiming that 106,250 people being aware of a subject is somehow not significant. But, oh dear, you will have to double that to 212,500 people because that particular segment was broadcast on 2 separate occasions. Does that make it twice as in/significant as before? Are you proposing to make similar assertions concerning newspaper articles based on column inches vs number of pages? Anyway, I think I've made my point fairly clearly, so I won't waste any more keystrokes on it. Our viewpoints are clearly divergent. I hope you will consider taking a more balanced approach in any similar future circumstances. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 05:12, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if you have an objective standard of notability (or, what it boils down to, of "extensiveness" of media coverage), share it. So far your position could likewise be summarised as "it's notable because I say so" (or, "it's notable because of the extensive media coverage, and 13 articles etc. is extensive because I say so"). And there are lots of insignificant things which hundreds of thousands of people may hear in the radio about. Sorry, that is not encyclopedic. Any two-headed goat born in Peru will get more coverage, but we won't need an article on it. But you're right in that our viewpoints are clearly divergent, so we may end this before you descend any further into flamewar mode (and you probably couldn't top your performance of years ago anyway, reading the Usenet thread linked to above). <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 14:54, Aug 11, 2004 (UTC)</li>

The fact remains, verification is easily publicly available to those who want it, and the until someone takes the effort of doing some actual research, blanket statements such as yours have no credibility whatsoever. If you are going to make definitive assertions such as "I doubt the real number [of members] is much higher than 50", then the burden of proof is on you to sustain that statement with evidence. If you elect not to do so, then you are in no position to present such assertions as though they are somehow factual.

Let me also add that at the bottom of the <a href="http://www.crank.net/micronations.html" class="external text" title="http://www.crank.net/micronations.html" rel="nofollow">Crank.net page on Micronations</a>, Atlantium is listed with the most usual distintion as the <b>CRANKIEST</b> nation on the Net. If TTF-Bucksfan doesn't deserve its own separate page even though one of its citizens is a former Italian Minister of parliament, even though it owns a 256-node IPv4 network, runs 8 alternate root top-level domains, a university, a professional news agency, and hosts the best website on the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Savoy_731f.html" title="House of Savoy">House of Savoy</a>, then clearly Atlantium doesn't deserve one. Atlantium also lives largely outside the micronational community, yet its emperor acts like he's some sort of a specialist of the same. Many people in the micronational community are complaining just how POV that <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a> page is, and the emperor of Atlantium is a frequent contributor/destroyer of work on the same. --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndigoGenius_daff.html" title="User:IndigoGenius">IndigoGenius</a> 19:52, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: I have to agree with SWAdair on this one. No vote, but if this has already survived two attempts at VfD, I believe that it's unfair to put it up again, especially so soon. I also get the impression that this was nominated out of spite. - Lucky 6.9 01:24, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I didn't even bother reading its page -- IMO if it has survived the deletion process, then it has survived the deletion process and it's quite dishonest to try and delete it yet again and again and *again*. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 02:47, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
