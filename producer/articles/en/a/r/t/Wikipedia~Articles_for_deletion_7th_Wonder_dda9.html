<dd><b>Comment</b> - before I created a few of them this year, many multiple Olympic gold medallist swimmers, world champions and Tour de France winners did not have articles- so we should delete them too?

<dd><b>Comment</b> - just because they don't yet doesn't mean that they won't ever. I'm currently working on pages for ESC entries going by country (in the middle of Luxembourg at the moment) and I can tell you that the following Contests have their second-place songs written up: 1956 (inasmuch as there was a second place, we probably have it), 1957, 1967, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002 (the subject of this AfD), 2003 and 2006. The majority of the missing years are due to the fact that the United Kingdom has placed second something like 15 times and I just haven't got as far as U yet. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:41, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for a number of reasons. Most importantly, the song placed second at a major (arguably <i>the</i> major) international competition. Eurovision performances are broadcast throughout Europe, as well as at least as far as Canada and Australia, which means that it attracted a sizable audience. Additionally, to get as far as the Eurovision stage, it had to win a national competition (the Maltese pre-selection) first. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:41, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Per that guideline, too, it's notable. The big four it misses out on, true, but turning our attention to the other 11 criteria we can see that it <i>Is the signature song of a performer</i>, certainly in the sense that Losco has a signature song for non-Maltese listeners. It was also <i>the subject of a major publicity campaign</i>, in that Maltese television wanted it to win the ESC that year and promoted it accordingly. I'd argue that it is also <i>a particularly well-known song from a piece of musical theater, radio, film or television</i>, being performed live at an internationally-televised event. I'd also suggest, subject to research which I'm mid-way through at the moment, that it could well have <i>appeared in the Top 20 of a national singles chart in a large or medium sized country</i> or <i>Charted in the Top 100 of a national singles chart in a large or medium sized country, for at least six months</i>, although I may be proven wrong there. Add into that the fact that it was nominated for a national award and I think we've got a notable song on our hands. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:42, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> You said it yourself: Maltese chart. <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> is far from a large or medium sized country, hence, it misses out on that criteria. You also stated that it's her "signature song", but that's merely your opinion. You also stated that it's a "well-known piece from a piece of musical theater, radio, film or television", citing the fact that it was performed live on tv, but you are fully aware that the guideline refers to a theme song or other song associated with a specific production. I will concede that it was subject to a major publicity campaign, but that's about it. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus1234_8c08.html" title="User:Marcus1234">Marcus1234</a> 11:02, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am in fact blissfully unaware of that interpretation of that clause, for the simple reason that it's not clarified anywhere on that page or its associated Talk. In terms of one's "signature song", the description of any song as such is often going to be a matter of debate. What I <i>will</i> say, though, is that it's the song for which she is best known outside of Malta, which would go quite some way towards it being her signature song. In terms of the size of the country, there's also <a href="http://www.maltasong.com/page.asp?n=newsdetails&amp;i=7612" class="external text" title="http://www.maltasong.com/page.asp?n=newsdetails&amp;i=7612" rel="nofollow">some evidence</a> that it charted in Germany. I was reluctant to add this at first, since the page doesn't actually say what number it charted at, but in an effort to counter systemic bias then it seems important. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:31, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Out of curiosity, is not a song competition covering all of Malta a "major award" within the meaning of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_SONG_0353.html" title="WP:MUSIC/SONG">WP:MUSIC/SONG</a>? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:36, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Regarding being in the German charts, there is absolutely no evidence that it was listed <i>for at least six months</i> and I'm most certain that it was never in a major Top 20 chart. Regarding your other point, I certainly do not classify winning the "Malta Song for Europe" as a major award, and I doubt anyone would. Technically, it's not even an award, as the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta_Song_for_Europe_7512.html" title="Malta Song for Europe">wikipedia page</a> itself states: <i>it's the song festival which decides who will be Malta's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest</i>. If the "Song for Europe" competitions were a "major award", then every song that has ever participated in the ESC would merit its own page! I'll stop here...<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus1234_8c08.html" title="User:Marcus1234">Marcus1234</a> 12:10, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b> So far, the precedent has been that every ESC entry <i>does</i> merit its own page. The two AfDs I've linked to before have upheld that idea, even as far as to say that a song that came second-last is notable. Indeed, <a href="../../../l/o/p/Lop%C5%A1in%C4%97_Mylimai_35d1.html" title="Lopšinė Mylimai">a song which came stone motherless last</a> was sufficiently notable to appear on DYK. We talk a lot about "ESC winners" meaning the artists who perform the song, but in a very real way it's actually the song which wins or places - hence the notability of a song which places second, especially when this is the equal-best (then-best) result that a country has had. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 20:44, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
