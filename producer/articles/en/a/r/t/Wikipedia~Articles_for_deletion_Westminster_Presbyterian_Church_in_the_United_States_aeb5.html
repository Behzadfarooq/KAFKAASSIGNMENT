<li>Thought experiment: Let's say two geographically remote, nondenominationl tiny churches of little worldly significance come together to form a group which they call Tiny Churches of North America. This group is established to restore the purity of the faith. It never gets any press coverage, never grows, and peters out after 20 years. Is it worthy of inclusion in the Wikipedia at the beginning of its existence? At the end? I'd say no on both counts. What if it had five small churches? --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Fl</a><a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_Esperanza_f062.html" title="User:Flex/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">x</a> (<a href="../../../f/l/e/User_talk%7EFlex_ff35.html" title="User talk:Flex">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%7EFlex_7487.html" title="Special:Contributions:Flex">contribs</a>) 22:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>We're not talking about small non-demoninational churches uniting here, but a separation from a large and well-established body. This isn't just about the Westminster Presbyterians, or about Presbyterians. The same sort of separation is happening throughout American protestantism, and (at least in Anglican circles) worldwide. I'm arguing for keeping this article because it's illustrative of the larger phenomenon. (BTW, we do seem to have a large number of articles on various "Popes" who claim that they're the real Roman Catholic Church. I don't recall AfD discussions about them, but maybe I'm just too new.) -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">Bpmullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBpmullins_8769.html" title="User talk:Bpmullins">Talk</a> 19:03, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which large and well-established body did they separate from? As far as I can tell, they split off from another small group. I agree with you about documenting the phenomenon of schisms, but I don't think it follows that every minor split need be given its own page. Some just aren't that notable or even footnotable (see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). As for the "real" popes, some are notable and others aren't.

<li>The problem is that it is not a question of numbers but a question of permanence.

<li><b>Keep</b> This new denomination was reported in the Banner of Truth magazine in 2006 and has representation in five states in the Union. Also of interest is that international discussions with groups in England and Australia are on their way. Mind you this is not just five congregation - but this is a denomination which have locked arms together. In fact it is the only full subscription denomination that I know of in the United States and the only American Presbyterian denomination that has a substitution fund for it's ministers. -- Note: It was commented that we are like the <a href="../../../w/e/e/Wee_Frees_1f96.html" title="Wee Frees">Wee Frees</a> - however we are more like The Wee Wee Frees.

<dd>Quote: "On January 13-14, 2006, a new Presbyterian denomination was formed. During delegate meetings in Philadelphia, PA, the body adopted the name Westminster Presbyterian Church in the United States (WPCUS). The founding churches came together because of perceived equivocation towards important biblical doctines and because of tolerance of excesses in contemporary worship in other Presbyterian denominations."

<dd>HanleyBri, I am not yet convinced. Re international discussions: the <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, and future, potential significance is not a factor in current significance. Re having churches "in five states of the Union": I see only four states listed on the <a href="http://www.wpcus.org/congregations.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.wpcus.org/congregations.asp" rel="nofollow">denomination's webpage</a>, but even then, since there are only five congregations total, that they are in four or five states doesn't seem particularly <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. As for the quote, I don't think two sentences that merely state the existence of the denomination qualifies as non-trivial coverage. What did the <i>British Church Newspaper</i> have to say? This is an American denomination; did any American publications take note of the WPCUS? What is a "substitution fund" and why does it make the WPCUS notable? --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Fl</a><a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_Esperanza_f062.html" title="User:Flex/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">x</a> (<a href="../../../f/l/e/User_talk%7EFlex_ff35.html" title="User talk:Flex">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%7EFlex_7487.html" title="Special:Contributions:Flex">contribs</a>) 02:51, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Quote: 'The WPCUS is concerned at the spread of liberal teaching (such as Federal Vision theology) within Presbyterianism in the USA. Federal Vision theology questions doctrines such as Justification by Faith, and the Perseverance of the Saints. In the event of various USA presbyterian groupings failing to deal firmly with such liberalizing trends, the WPCUS could well prove to be a new home for individual Presbyterian churches and minister who are unhappy with the stance taken by their own denominations.' As to your question regarding five states; we plan to have a congregation in Delaware in short order. As to your question on a substitution fund, sorry I meant to write Sustentation fund. It's a means of congregations joining together financially and there is an entire history of it's use from Charles the Second of England and its continued use.

<li><b>Keep:</b> I have studied the ferment and churn of British and North American Presbyterianism for almost 40 years. Splitting, formation, and merging of denominations of various sizes is an important part of that history. Many small groups have come existence for a brief time but have lasting influence upon the English speaking Presbyterian and Reformed landscape. For example, the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (RPCES) came into existence in 1965, and disappeared in 1982 when they were received in to the larger Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). The RPCES was itself a merger of elements from the Bible Presbyterian Church (BPC) and the Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America (RPCNA). Though the RPCES remained a denomination for only 17 years, it is indisputable they have a continuing influence upon the PCA. Their brief history is essential to understanding American Presbyterianism.<br />
I’m a minister of the denomination from which some of the WPCUS congregations come, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC). Yet, I recognize the WPCUS has taken an unique confessional position, reaffirming the original version not only of the Westminster Standards but also the original form of government and worship approved in England and Scotland in the 1640's. In this, they offer the possibility of union with other like minded groups on the basis of historic confessional Presbyterianism. Their similarity to older existing Scottish and Irish denominations also makes them notable. Whatever their future may be, their efforts should be noted by Wikipedia if it is to be a reliable and useful reference tool. Jglennferrell 17:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)J. Glenn Ferrell</li>

<dd><b>Keep:</b> Is this Notability thing fairly new? I've been editing on Wikipedia now and then for nearly two years, and have come across loads of instances of historical and present-day individual churches and church buildings (let alone denominations) having an article on Wikipedia, without anyone objecting. I'm starting to wonder whether there is a complete change of atmosphere on Wikipedia, with nowhere near the level of freedom there once was. It seems to be getting much more like government and corporations in the way people are trying to patrol/control it. Not the friendly place it once was! On looking at the Notability page I see that it is heavily disputed, and personally I often go to Wikipedia for information I can't find readily elsewhere. And where would Notability leave articles about long-forgotten people who were very well known in their day but who are only covered in books, not on the net! This is the sort of thing Wikipedia is ideal for. Give Wikipedia back to the people, and stop the stuffy academic types controlling it!</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is not paper, so there is room for many subjects that would not be covered in a traditional encyclopedia. However, Wikipedia is also not an indiscriminate collection of information, nor a directory, so some criteria for inclusion need to be met. Removal of articles on non-notable subjects is an important function. The existance of similar articles on non-notable subjects is not a reason to include any article. Although details are disputed, there seems to be a broad consensus (as reflected in the various notability guidelines) that coverage by multiple independent sources is a fundamental criterion for inclusion. Quoting Jimbo&#160;: "It's all about whether we can write a proper article with reliable third party sources and no original research." <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-November/057186.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-November/057186.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> There is no requirement that sources be available online. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 22:53, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. We're not here to predict the future, so whether this denomination grows or shrinks is of no concern. What I can't work out is whether it's notable or not. Is there an article for "assorted small fundamentalist sects arising by schism from Presbyterianism"&#160;? If there is, we have an obvious course of action. If not, I'm not sure. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:15, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
