<li><b>Keep</b> - per Mark "Mr. X" Delfs &amp; Just Julie Delfs--Jawbone was one of the very first Podcasts I listened to and actually enjoyed. They are the epitome of Podcasting and should be kept on Wikipedia. Not many shows out there have done the sheer amount and breadth of shows that Len and Nora have done. Futhermore, Len took the time to actually do sketches and drawings of the major Podcasters for FREE, for them to use as their artwork in iTunes. Please give them the satisfaction of having a Wikipedia article which really is a very simple thing to ask for!

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Jawbone sets the bar for podcasting as one of the highest quality (both in content and in production)podcasts that exists on the Internet. You cannot judge podcasts by hits from any search engine or static source when determining notability. Podcasts, by definition, rely on RSS feeds. If you're going to criticize an entry in Wikipedia, at least be familiar and educated with the entry's background and source. If Jawbone isn't notable, then neither is any podcast or new media venue. It's absurd that this discussion is even being made. People that believe this podcast shouldn't be part of Wikipedia are simply showing their ignorance, and the editors shouldn't fold to ignorance. ----charleyw 05:47, 6 December 2006 (UTC)charleyw

This alone is most note worthy simply because Jawbone has been recognized and substantiated within Wikipedia already as to making a substantial contribution to the legacy of Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson. Thus Jawbone Radio has made a significant contribution to the world of cartooning and podcasting and is a notable entry to Wikipedia based on Wikipedia's own recognition and acceptance of Jawbones Multimedia contribution to the Calvin and Hobbes legacy. --74.38.18.241 08:11, 6 December 2006 (UTC)Steve

<dd><b>Comment</b>. That it is "entirely trivial" is merely your opinion. The [WP:WEB] guidelines do not state how many times the subject needs to be mentioned in the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Len Peralta, one half of the couple behind Jawbone, was an early presence in the visual side of podcasting, creating many of the logos and images used by podcasters in the ID3 tags of their shows, and on their websites. Jawbone is hugely influential; a page on the podcast directory, Podcast Pickle, shows their influences in the world of podcasting and lists many podcasters that were inspired by Jawbone. And throughout numerous interviews and affiliations with singer Jonathan Coulton, and writer/comedian John Hodgeman, Jawbone is a significant contributor to the pop culture of podcasting. bibbott <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.33.154.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.33.154.117_1de5.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.33.154.117">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Ben Rollman <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> qualifications state that an article must meet 1 of the 3 criteria. The third being, "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.[7]" Wouldn't being distributed through an news aggregator or podcast directory (such as iTunes) qualify this and any other podcast that is listed as fulfilling the minimum criteria? Would including that link (as stated by the quailifications) be enough? Given the additional print sources, the site creator's artistic contributions to a premier podsafe musician as well as numerous other podcasts, I think it fits the web criteria just fine as laid out by the rules given. Also, if it helps the point of Self Promotion, I was the original creator of this article, the owners have since edited for mostly clarification and additional information.<a href="../../../x/a/d/User%7EXadrian_0a95.html" title="User:Xadrian">xadrian</a> 15:29, 6 December 2006 (UTC)xadrian

<dd>I really didn't assume that there was any difficulty with self-promotion in the article. iTunes distributes a lot of content, podcasts included, so I don't really think that's relevant to meeting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>.The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms... I would assume this would also include songs written with the hosts of the show and referencing the show, therefore fulfilling requirement one. I ask you, AlphaChimp. how many songs have been written referencing you personally? Must one have several songs referencing them and their show before it is considered a fulfillment of the criteria #1? Nobbynees 17:41, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, whether or not any music is written about me is entirely irrelevant to this discussion. Creative commons music would seem both trivial and non-published. Don't get me wrong, I think it's great that people are recording music, and I'm sure their song is awesome...I'm just saying that there is a substantive difference between that and get mentioned in a notable published work. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 19:18, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I wonder if all the Creative Commons musicians and authors would feel the same way about your assessment of their work being trivial. I assert that simply because a piece of music isn't backed by SONY or Time Warner, that it is still a published work under Creative Commons, thusly fulfilling criteria 1. I would certainly like to hear Creative Commons opinion on this.Nobbynees 20:35, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i><b>Holy sockpuppets and meatpuppets, Batman!</b></i> Now that I've said that, at this point in time, <i>no</i> podcast is by itself sufficient enough to satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It doesn't matter if it has its own theme song (or Christmas Song) unless the song itself meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Of the sources that are cited, only <i>one</i> is independent of the podcast (thus not qualifying for "multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the site itself). While it can be argued that the BBC citation would qualify under guideline #2 of WP:WEB, a look at the linked article clearly shows otherwise: it is not one describing any awards but an article recommending six podcasts "worth listening to" (in the same sense of recommending six restaurants for a festive Friday). As for guideline #3, since the Newhouse News Service is redlinked, I cannot conclude that it (NNS) satisfies <i>"The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i> Thus it fails under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:52, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Followup</i> - Newhouse News Service does appear to be notable by itself, but I have found no evidence independent of the podcast (which actually originates from blogspot.com) supporting the article's assertion that NNS was actually distributing it (I did find an article discussing Jawbone without mentioning any relationship between the two entities). The last paragraph of the article indicates that Jawbone is self-distributed (via its own Trypod Network). Thus my position is unchanged. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:52, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Comment</i> - I think the citation of the article in Newhouse News Service was in reference to criteria #1 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, not #3. Dcoulter 04:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The host of Jawbone Radio was invited to speak on a panel at a Comics Symposium at Lakeland Community College in April 2006 on the above mentioned Calvin and Hobbes podcast <a href="http://www.academicventures.com/comics/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.academicventures.com/comics/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> on the Watterson podcast. On the panel was former Watterson editor and current VP of Universal Press Syndicate, Lee Salem. This podcast is also worthy of note as it is the only audio interview exisiting with a close member of the Watterson family (his mother). It should be noted that Bill Watterson has steadfastly refused to give interviews to any press.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Jawbone radio is a rather notable podcast for its episode about <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Watterson_0556.html" title="Bill Watterson">Bill Watterson</a> alone. Len got an interview with Bill's mother, which is an amazing thing given the high degree of privacy Bill maintains. The article is fairly well-written -- certainly not "stubbish" -- and more information could probably be added to it as well. It may be borderline as far as <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is concerned, but that aside, I see no reason to delete this perfectly good informative article.
