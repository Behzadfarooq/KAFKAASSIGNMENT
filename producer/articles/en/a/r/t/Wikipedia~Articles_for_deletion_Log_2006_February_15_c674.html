<li>No, it will not. If an article about a "Protestant pastor pedo" <i>who received the same amount of press attention</i> is swept under the rug, <i>then</i> it will indicate the same thing. Like it or not, notability is a criterion taken into account for articles, and like it or not, individual cases of pedophilia, no matter how reprehensible, aren't reaching the levels of infamy achieved by the Roman Catholic sex abuse scandal. I Google "Paul Shanley" and get 116,000 hits. I Google "Roy Gordon Lawrence" and get ... ten. The first of which is Wikipedia's own article. Plus... when you say Paul Shanley has "a whole article" on him, you're referring to <i>two paragraphs and one external link</i>. How many paragraphs are we devoting to Roy Gordon Lawrence?

<dd>You have a point there, but the difference between Shanley and Lawrence is that Shanley was a little more notable, and was a "prominent figure" in a greater Boston scandal (and we just love scandals), whereas Lawrence, although according to allegations is as equally troubled, is a little less notable.

<li>(I apologize if editing in wrong place) - my official notes were put in the Talk page for that article. JzG is correct in that this is a difficult one. There are some factual things here. Roy Gordon Lawrence was charged, and served prison time. Those articles did appear in the paper. Most of the history (as in things 10+ years ago), though questionable POV, are true... the biggest criteria of db-attack are the comments regarding recent history (that Roy Gordon Lawrence is going to reoffend, won't admit to certain things, unrepentant, that he formed his own church, etc.) These things are 100% POV. The author can make statements to back up his POV, but there are other POVs (contraty to the authors POV) which can be backed up. Bottom line... this has "future battleground" written all over it. I just don't see its value or place on Wikipedia. Even just looking at the history of Roy Gordon Lawrence --Does Wikipedia want to become a criminal records database? This screams of an attack page, under the guise of public informance. This isn't about pedophilia (and indeed such is horrible!), this is about creating a soapbox and trying to taint the image of people associated with Roy Gordon Lawrence today (10+ years after the crimes) .. which in this case includes a local church that Roy Gordon Lawrence attends. Surely Wikipedia is not the place for this? Andyru</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> If Saddam Hussein claims to have sworn off massacres and poison gas attacks, does that mean that Wikipedia (or at least Christian WP editors) "should forgive" him and therefore should delete articles about his verified past activities? I'm not saying this person's history is equivalent to Saddam's; I'm just saying we should use WP's standards of verifiability and importance, rather than deleting the article because its side effects may include the unhappy consequences of this person's own actions. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:19, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Point well made Barno! I would reluctantly admit that there is valid argument where the article could be kept to the "historical" elements of Roy Gordon Lawrence's past in a NPOV format. (Though, I do believe even that would result in a bit of a battleground with the Author.) The main reason this was tagged as db-attack is that this author is well known for the spreading of "dirt" on Roy Gordon Lawrence in many forums (distribution lists, letters, now Wikipedia, etc.). It is done under the guise of public informance (akin to a "sex offender registry" ... "who's in your neighborhood" ... "he current lives here" ... "he goes to church there" scenario).</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The author is using this article as a soapbox to mount a savage attack on a man that he victimized. Granted, Mr. Lawrence has an unsavory past. However, the author is intent on using any medium as a soapbox to attack Mr. Lawrence with allegations about more recent behavior that are untrue and designed to destroy him.

<dd>Bzzzt, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>, and misleading too. Measuring the river on the map <i>is</i> also OR. Of course, other people have already measured the lengths of rivers, and published the results, so we don't even have to do the measurement in te first place. Also, street names are entirely arbitrary, so being the longest in London isn't in any way notable, particularly as some continuous routes may have more than one street name. Sorry, but there's nothing anywhere which mandates that we need to be the repository of all information ever.

This solution is no more acceptable than simply copying a chunk out of someone's research paper because we don't know anything about the subject. If nobody else has published the lengths of these streets, neither can we.

<dd>"Interesting" <i>is not</i> a valid inclusion criterion. "Verifiable", however, <i>is</i> a valid inclusion criterion (required, in fact), but this list doesn't meet that.

<li>I think you're all missing the point here. <b>Original research</b>, people. Kappa's statement that this might belong here is provably false, since the list is indisputably original research (go on, just <i>try</i> finding some circumstance which makes this <i>not</i> OR). The <i><b>one and only</b></i> way of obtaining this data at the moment is to do the measurements yourself, and the <i><b>one and only</b></i> way of verifying this data is to repeat the same measurement process. Thus, the article is unavoidably OR, and cannot be verified independently of the original data.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notwithstanding the anon's argument above, I don't see any OR here. In fact, if there is one thing that should be fairly easy to list it's street length. Although instead of measuring it myself, as suggested above, I'd depend on an established reference such as <a href="http://www.microcolour.com/ldn_memory_map.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.microcolour.com/ldn_memory_map.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>Your vote is evidently misinformed, because your reasoning is patently false (no offence). If you don't see any OR, it is either because you don't know what OR is, or it is because you're deliberately ignoring it. Your suggestion of using the A-Z is <i>still</i> OR. Wikipedia thrives on <b>source-based research</b>, but excludes <b>original research</b>. To summarise <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, OR is any research that introduces <b>new information</b>, SBR is any research that uses only <b>existing information</b>, though you are allowed to present this information in a different way - what's important is that nothing is done to the information. For the list of rivers, we are taking the already widely-published figures for various rivers, and arranging them by length. We're doing nothing new (Google for <i>Nile km</i> and you'll see what I mean). For the list of London streets, the data is generated by measuring using maps, or by physically measuring the route itself. In either case, we get raw data that we didn't know before - this is <b>new information</b>, therefore it is <b>original research</b>. Follow? What matters is not whether or not it has been measured, but who measured it and who published it. Since it appears that Wikipedia is the first to publish the fact that Western Avenue is 11.8 miles long to the M25, this is OR. The fact that this page is OR is not even up for debate, as it is indisputable fact. One deciding factor is its value to Wikipedia weighed against this fact. It is my opinion that, because nobody has <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITEd</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (forgetting for a moment that this being <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> means that no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> exist), and that it can't be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the very little value this list provides is not worth setting the dangerous precedent of essentially allowing OR into Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>that all seems to be a question of interpretation, not smashing through any rules. This is pretty lighthearted information to cause such a serious debate, but no reason why an encyclopedia should not be amusing as well as informative. Absolutely no reason why this information should not be presented in a neutral way, but again I don't see anyone actually seriously challenging the accuracy of this information, so it becomes a bit absurd to demand sources. As to copyright, it is not clear that this is copyrighteable information, since the same information exists in many different works. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 01:20, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In defense of 82.15.28.195 I think the OR concern is arguably a legitimate one, not a "measly technicality", but also not a clear-cut case.

<ul>
<li>Let's turn this discussion on its head. Assume for the moment that there is no OR issue here. If this were not OR, there would already be a list somewhere in a credible and reputable publication stating literally the lengths of the various streets in London. Reputable sources for this would include <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordnance_Survey_7313.html" title="Ordnance Survey">OSGB</a>, various map publishers, and perhaps academic research. A trawl of OSGB turns up no such list. Google for the top five on the list as it stands produces only three pages of entries, including some lists of streets by name, none of which contain lengths. There are some documents related to TfL describing traffic schemes, but nothing giving the total lengths of all of these. Restricting the search to .ac.uk yields no results. Thus, there is no list, and as such the statement that the list is not OR cannot be true. Add in the fact that the talk page actually contains the methodology and <i>confirms</i> that Wikipedians have been applying it, which as stated is clearly aimed to produce new primary data; this reinforces the fact that it is <i>undisputably</i> OR. The clinching factor in deciding "Is this or is this not OR?" is this: according to the map sources, what are the N longest streets in London? If they can't tell you, then they're not the real source of this information. When you have taken the measurement from the map and recorded it somewhere, the map is not the source of that data, your records are. As for this: "<i>Perhaps the editor who feels strongly enough to backchat every vote on this page ...</i>", perhaps <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> needs reminding that AfD is <i>not a vote</i>, but <i>discussion</i>. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> - what you might perceive as "back-chatting the votes" (TINAV), is actually engaging the "voters" (TINAV) in the discussion about their reasoning, particularly to establish what <i>they</i> think, beyond "<i>per X</i>", to see what we agree on, where we differ, and where our views diverge. 03:31, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

One, Purley Way is 3.6 miles long, and Two) Purley Way is the tenth longest street in London. Item one can be checked from the map, although that has accuracy issues — if I reference the original source given and get a different answer to that published, can you truly say that it's a verifable fact? Item two is not verifable, to verify it was item 10, I would have to measure every street, and hope that I hadn't missed the same streets as the original author.

For example, what part of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#What_is_excluded.3F" title="WP:NOR">What is excluded?</a> is violated here? I'm not proposing that we waive NOR willy-nilly, but that we recognize that some types of content lie on the border of NOR (for example, plot summaries for books or films). If the street lengths in this article come from measurements off a map (and if so, let's get the cite for that map), then is that original research, or just reproduction of published data, since the map is published and the street lengths are on the map in a non-numeric form? I can see both sides to that argument. I take the view that if the map is published, then the measurements are not original research, and they're verifiable. If the article contains measurements made by some guy with a tape measure or a really long piece of string, then the article still stays but needs a {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}} tag.

Any map which does not contain that information is pretty worthless. This argument is entirely analogous to a table published in French, which someone translates into English and still cites as a source. Just because some people are unable to read distances off maps, just as some people are unable to read words out of a book, does not condemn us all to map dyslexia. Locating visual facts on a map sheet is no different to locating particular sentences in a book and including them in a history article. In fact, it might be rather easier to see which is the longest road than to find a particular mention of something. The only thing which writers of an encyclopedia do is collate information. This requires people to organise data and present it in a way which is useful to readers. If editors are not permitted to do that then someone might just as well pull the plug on all the wiki servers right now, and save the elctricity. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 00:45, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's a few components of original research in reading street lengths off of a map, and an additional one in trying to list the longest streets in a given area. There are a number of problems to contend with that make the issue much different from reading text. For one, what measurement tool is used? If a ruler by hand, then the scale of the map <b>greatly</b> influences the answer that will be had from the measurement, but so does the ruler used. Different measuring tools will come up with different answers for the length . How is that accounted for in the results reported? Some rulers have greater accuracy than others, even the thickness of the lines on the ruler will affect the result. How are curved streets handled? Are they considered at all? The choice of what to consider as one street is a problem. Where does the measurement stop if the street changes names? What precision is to be reported in the answers and how did one arrive at that confidence level? If the map is electronic, what tools are used to measure the lines, and how does the algorithm work? All of these items are judgement calls that are innapropriate original research. And no, ignore all rules cannot set aside any of the major content policies. You can't have a POV article just because you want to ignore the NPOV policy, and no "consensus" can do that. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 03:07, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difficulties you suggest in translating the data off the map are really not quantitatively different from the difficulties anyone faces when trying to prepare an article from different sources. It is my experience that different sources disagree with each other, and editorial judgement is needed to choose which versions to include in an article. I have also seen the result of someone who plainly does not understand a source then trying to write an article. Articles do not get scrapped because people make mistakes interpreting, they get corrected. Normally when editors have a difference of opinion over content, they fight it out and a consensus on the correct interpretation is reached. Just so here, though I have yet to see any real suggestion that people are arguing the factual content is incorrect. I am sure there are many wiki editors who have the source material on their own bookcase and the necessary ability to read a map to check for themselves that information here is correct. I regard the existence of such an accessible method of checking as making this article very much more readily verifiably than many others which might have a long bibliography which is however not immediately to hand. I remain of the view that a strict interpretation of NOR as suggested by some people would mean that this encyclopedia should totally be deleted. It is not possible to create a synthesis of data without doing original work. That is why such a synthesis is specifically permitted, indeed last time I read it, was mandatory.</dd>
<dd>As to major policies. A perceived violation of a policy is not grounds for deletion of an article. It is merely grounds for initiating a debate over whether such an article should be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b> To check the length of any street, you can check the map for that street and measure it.

So, to verify fully any <b>one</b> item in that list, you have to do <b>everything</b> again.

<li>Actually, I found this one not so convincing because it relies on the amount of processing and expertise required.

<li>Indeed, this is another important issue. Where are the beginning and the end of a street often cannot be determined from the map irrespectively of the amount of processing allowed. A formal criteria could be stated in the article, but the information required by the criteria (such as what is private or public) might not be available.

<dd>That's somewhat beside the point. If you can't point at the source showing the information you need, it's not the source of the information. In this case, you can't point at a London A-Z or OS Landrangers of the area that states categorically the length of Oxford Street. We've heard plenty of reasons why this <i>is</i> OR, but what I (and others) would desperately like to hear before some admin mistakenly closes this as a "keep" (IIRC, they're supposed to weight the <i>reasons</i>, not the <i>votes</i>) is the reasons why people think it's <i>not</i> OR, in relation to the list itself (i.e. not excuses such as "if this is, then everything else is"). Particularly, why they believe that it's not the <i>measurement</i> that makes it OR. 09:27, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>The required information is not on any cited map: where a street begins and ends, for example when the street changes name, cannot be found on the map. Often one would need to physically go on the site or rely on local non-published knowledge.</li>

<dd>I don't like these reasons because they assume that it must be simple for anyone to see that a sourced information is supported by the sources, which is not a policy requirement.

<li><b>Comment:</b>. While my vote is still at delete (not bolded, JJAy&#160;:) I want to mention that I don't think it is appropiate to remove the guts of an article — basically deleting it — while it is still under offical discussion for deletion. (I haven't reverted the removal, as if the result is keep, it will be done anyway, and if the result is delete, it would be pointless.) I don't see anything explicitly forbidding it in the Deletion policy, but the afd notice does ask people not to blank the article, and taking the majority of the text is going against the spirit, if not the letter of that policy. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 13:44, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, since its not really clear where I should put this point which has cropped up repeatedly above: no source of information is exact. Tables of scientific values all have limits to their accuracy. Arguing that a map is not a suitable source because of the inherent inaccuracy of obtaining data from it is not a helpful way to decide this point. All it means is that there is a limit on the accuracy of the data. Again, if all data subject to errors was deleted, there would be none left on wiki. A more interesting question is whether this use of the maps violates the copyright of the originators. I am sure that the aim of the map makers copyright conditions is to prevent other people making copies of their maps, which is certainly not what is happening here. Also, if I pick up a text book and use information tabulated in it, then I would not expect to be taken to task by the authors for using that information without permission. As I understand it, the information content is not copyright, only the actual presentation of it? What is presented here is only exerpts from the total of information, and is not unique information as many companies have independently gathered the same information.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 00:57, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b>. Would an article that simply list all the streets in London with their length, assuming that everything is verifiable, be acceptable in Wikipedia? This question is not about the verifiability issue, but about What Wikipedpia is not (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">this section in particular</a>). One of the comments above says that entries in a list must be notable.

<dd>Lumiere, i don't think it helps this debate that you go through and change things which you have written and others have already responded to. It makes their responses nonsense, which is unfair, and retrospectively does not allow them to respond to your changed comments, which is also unfair. Please stop doing it. I can see that you have corrected your own arguments where you have found them to be mistaken, but instead of changing them, just continue by stating your changed position.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I would interpret noteablity as being a relative as well as absolute term. it means what is worth including, as well as what is widely accepted (as distinct from what is widely refuted) The wikipage you cite suggests that a sense of proportion is needed. So a complete list of all street lengths in London would be unacceptable, but a list of noteably long ones would be includeable. On the other hand, wiki is not paper, which is say it does not have the same space constraints as a conventional encyclopedia. In a paper volume there is a real sense that if one article goes in, another must come out. That does not apply here. So wiki can afford to include articles on relatively minor topics. Wiki resources are creaking at maintaining a free service, but I think the issue is numbers of people wanting to read it, not the still relatively small volume of information which makes up the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 10:13, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If we succeed to have a consensus on only one reason for delete, then the article should be deleted. If, for every proposed reason for delete, we obtain a consensus that the reason is not valid, then we will keep the article. Otherwise, I guess that we will continue to seek a consensus until the decision will be taken by whoever is in charge. My feeling is that only a few main reasons for delete will be proposed, and this will focus the discussions around them instead on around individual votes or comments. I know that I am not very well known, and already I am attacked as a troll, spammer, disruptive, etc. by a few (and also for making many modifications to my own comments, but this one is well deserved), but I still propose this idea for what it's worth. -<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumiere_50cb.html" title="User:Lumiere">Lumière</a> 16:18, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Guys, I see how you are arguing. Your view that this people can in no way be notable only being the relative of somebody. In most cases, that is true. But in some cases, it is not. This is one of those cases. First, Muslims places so much time and effort on the the genealogy of this people, that only being related makes them notable, in a Muslim POV. There are entire books that list this people and gives entries on what is known about each. Second, there is also the problem of research. Much of the information on this guys are in Arabic, meaning its hard to google them out, since they havent been translated. And when they are translated, they are transliterated in different way, making it harder to track them down. And some times, they are not even named, only refered to as " the mother of x did this and that". This results in taking a lot of time to create articles. And third, we have the problem of where to put information, if not on her own article. For example, Hind bint Awf is connected to 5 people. Am I supposed to repeat everything I find on here in each of those five articles? Every single bit of information on this people are of very high significance, where they live, who long, when they married and so forth...</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The notability claim here seems to be that one of this lady's daughters married Muhammad the Prophet, <s>three</s> two other daughters married early followers of Muhammad, and she is the grandmother of a major early Islamic theologian. The sheer number of people significant to Islam among her progeny makes her notable. Besides, if we can let Jeanne Marie Cossanges hang around for a year, we can give this article a few days to develop. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:51, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> being one famous person's parent isn't notable; having so many of your children end up in such significant marriages is a different thing altogether.

<li>Agree with Georgewilliamherbert that improvement/expansion is needed. I'd like to see the dates when this lady lived (even if approximate), an explanation of what happened to husband #2, an indication of what religion she followed, and some discussion perhaps of what kind of work her various husbands did and what work she did. Also, did she have any other children? And if alternate spellings of her name is a problem, they should be listed. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 06:49, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Overwhelmingly mighty mondo-keep:</b> Do you see that this is something being taken seriously? That this is an attempt at a career? Now I don't particularly like N*SYNC. I don't think those fellas are particularly talented and I'm far from interested in anything they do, but it's important to somebody. Dismissing this because you don't like it, don't understand it, or don't think it deserves popularity would be like opting for the deletion of N*SYNC's Wiki. The page seems dumb to me, but I know it's important to someone else, and it may help someone find the information they desire. If you oppose this page on the grounds that AtR is unpopular, keep in mind that creating a Wikipedia listing is a way of generating popularity and spreading knowledge of the existence of something. By the way, this is not, as banned by Wikipedia, a fad from a school or an inside joke. It is a film company, albeit a low-budget, unknown, modest one, that happened to be formed by school chums. If you are at all familiar with entertainment groups, you will know that many began as an idea begun between school friends that eventually took off. I'm not saying that Across the Road will ever be a well-known success, but humble beginnings, even without definite endings, are no reason for deletion. Is it really that big of a problem for you that someone wants a bit of recognition? I see no harm being caused, and vote overwhelmingly for a mondo-keep. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tougi (<a href="../../../t/o/u/User_talk%7ETougi_5b29.html" title="User talk:Tougi">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tougi_89db.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tougi">contribs</a>).</small></p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Points of Issue:</b>
<ul>
<li>1. Where is *Brideham Lake* and *Brindle*? Apparently, Brideham Lake is next in line in size after Kathleen. I can't find Brideham Lake anywhere in my NC Atlas and Gazetteer.</li>
<li>2. If Kathleen Lake is home to one of the biggest fishing derbies in the south, why does a Google search on "fishing derby" "Kathleen Lake" return bubkis?</li>
<li>3. Call me crazy, but I don't think *Kimberly* was a fashionable name for a woman who was likely born in the 1830s or 1840s. Does anyone know of any references to Kimberlys from that time period? It seems to me that the name Kimberly is a child of the latter half of the twentieth century, rather than antebellum times!</li>
<li>4. If the Union soldiers beat Kimberly to death as she gave birth, who delivered the baby? This article makes it sound like the baby just popped out on its own and ran off to Raleigh to run for office (which was apparently vacant in 1891!) You beat up a pregnant woman and there's a pretty decent chance you kill the baby along the way.</li>
<li>5. What is a "mosquito density" test? Do they weigh mosquitoes or something? That line sounds Monty Python-esque.</li>
<li>6. A 3-mile bridge span costs way more than $65 million.</li>
<li>7. An artery as important as I-95 would never be allowed to be breached until 2010. If this bridge couldn't support truck traffic, NCDOT would be replacing it as we speak. What, do we flag down trucks in the middle of nowhere and have them exit before crossing the bridge? The Wilson Bridge in DC hasn't even taken that long!</li>
<li>8. If I-95 was built in the 1960s, but the lake was extended in the 1970s, how did they extend the lake? Did they dig under I-95?!</li>
<li>9. These people that are "fishing" in Kathleen Lake...hmm, I guess they live on oceanfront property in West Virginia.</li>
<li>10. This whole thing reminds me of an episode of Family Guy when the other fisherman play a prank on Peter Griffin and tell him to go to some longitude and latitude supposedly in the Atlantic Ocean - but it turns out to be at the middle of a temple where a Jewish kid's having a bar mitzvah. "Yeah, there's some great fishing in the middle of I-95!"
<ul>
<li>It's a fascinating article, and an interesting scavenger hunt, but it doesn't seem to belong here. I'd love to know why the original writer created this article - it seems like it has some significance. Does Ricki Lake have a sister named Kathleen? ~~LynnW</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> hoax. By the way, the LG for NC in 1891 was not named Foster but Holt <a href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/reference/lieutenant_governor_of_north_carolina" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/reference/lieutenant_governor_of_north_carolina" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I understood what you meant when you wrote "<i>stage-only actors...don't register as notable in my mind"</i>. Let me be clear, in my opinion if the Bio page does not address the stage then it should be revised if not completely trashed.

<li>So if there was an article here for a janitor and I brought it here for that reason, that means I have no respect for janitors?! Come on...

</ul>
</li>
<li>Wp:Bio is a set of extremely inadequate guidelines. It does not address the stage and it does not address janitors. Based on your own statements, you have very little regard for stage actors. Your nom has neither examined Ms. Alers' standing within the theatrical profession, nor explained why an actress who has appeared in a number of Broadway shows- the major leagues of her profession- should not have an article here. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Again, you're equating my saying something is non-notable to me having little regard for that thing. My mother isn't sufficiently notable for Wikipedia - that doesn't mean I have little regard for her. You seem to have little regard for the WP:BIO guidelines which I think is more germaine to this argument. Here's a reason she shouldn't have an article.

<li>I'm going further and saying <i>no one</i> writes articles on stage-only actors. I didn't find a single counterexample except this one. I stopped after five examples out of boredom. With Wikipedia now having been around this long with this many contributors and this many articles, I think that shows a clear pattern. Even if someone starts writing articles about stage-only actors, it doesn't sound like they should start here. All but one of my examples above have IMDB credits so they're more deserving of articles first. There's more chance that the billions of people outside of New York City may have seen or heard of them - that's just a fact, not disrespect. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 11:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've been very clear about my opinion of the guidelines. The use of the qualifier <i>seem</i> is not required. In the same way you have been very clear in stating that you do not believe that stage actors deserve inclusion here. I have disagreed. Ms. Alers has been in the casts of a number of Broadway shows. I have confirmed Rent and Capeman. That is good enough for me. There is no point in debating this further. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:53, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>In some ways I would argue it is better. She was an understudy with the original cast of Rent, which means she played almost all the female roles at one time or another in front of a live audience. She then had a marquee role with the first touring company. She was also in the original cast of the Paul Simon show Capeman. Those are the only two I tried to confirm but there may be more based on the list on her website. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 08:00, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This AfD is just a display of aggressive ignorance; asserting that stage performances alone cannot provide notability is astonishingly foolish. Alers' Broadway credits are certainly substantive, if not stellar, as shown in the IBDB; a comparable entry in the IMDB would with next to no dispute satisfy the Wikipedia notability requirement. (A "swing" performer is not an understudy, as several of the comments here dismissively suggest, but one who is prepared for most if not all of the relevant non-lead roles in the program, and appears fairly regularly as a substitute performer.) Wikipedia has scores of entries for women who perform on stages with poles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_strippers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_strippers" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, particularly women who have had attention-grabbing (if not outright deforming) cosmetic surgery and perform on stages with poles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. There is something creepy about the way so many editors believe that being an open participant in the commercial sex trade is inherently notable, while being an above-average working artist is not.

<li>Wknight94's peculiar standards notwithstanding, the answer to the lack representation of notable stage-only or mainly theater actors (not an oxymoron -- the TV/film industry isn't the end-all and be-all of acting notability) is NOT to lower the bar to pad out Wikipedia's coverage, but find and include the headliners who aren't represented, the likes of, off the top of my head, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristin_Chenoweth_e82e.html" title="Kristin Chenoweth">Kristin Chenoweth</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherry_Jones_1657.html" title="Cherry Jones">Cherry Jones</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sara_Ramirez_136d.html" title="Sara Ramirez">Sara Ramirez</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Jones_ae19.html" title="Sarah Jones">Sarah Jones</a> (who all, checking the "Show preview" button, have articles).

<li>Good points, but can we please lose the "stage-only" bit from the discussion? The proper term is stage actor, theatre actor, or thespian.

<li>No, I don't see how we can. It's 2006 and whether a person has television/movie experience is a totally relevant criteria. Calton seems to have found in Sarah Jones the only other person with IBDB credits and no IMDB credits that has an article on Wikipedia. If that standard is so peculiar, then why isn't anyone here adding similar articles? If I can somehow drag this discussion back to the original article here, there appears to be dozens or hundreds of actors that are in IBDB and not in IMDB that would be more notable than Yassmin Alers but don't have articles here. How can that <i>not</i> be relevant? It's like making a list of all notable American cities and starting with <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palisade%2C_Nebraska_a4dc.html" title="Palisade, Nebraska">Palisade, Nebraska</a> --- and then giving up after that one.

<li><b>Delete</b> The claims made above are misleading. The use of the phrase dates back at least as far as 1988, when it was used by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> during the Presidental debates, according to this <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/88debates/2prez4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/88debates/2prez4.html" rel="nofollow">PBS transcript</a>. No evidence has been adduced, thus far, for the NEI's coinage of the phrase at so early a date. The decision made by the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus in 1998 (the "adjuticating" body referred to above) speaks generally to the juxtaposition of "clean" and "nuclear power"; this specific phrase does not appear in any of the coverage of the decision (I cannot find a copy of the decision itself). Having researched all this since the article (which I originally proposed for deletion with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">Template:Prod</a>) was moved to AfD, I stand by my original assesment: the article is NPOV and of little value, and none of its contents merit an article separate from <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 04:44, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Obvious keep</b>. Being a Rhodes Scholar is in and of itself notable. Being a blind Rhodes Scholar from Iran, written up in the New York Times as an example of the sort of recipient who contradicts Rhodes' goal of recognizing a new white/Anglo aristocracy, and whose work as a disability rights activist has been recognized, is certainly notable. <a href="http://www.rfbd.org/newsuccessbravos.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rfbd.org/newsuccessbravos.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> It's worth noting that Playboy Playmates are generally regarded as notable, even though their principal social role is to serve as masturbatory objects for adolescents and sexually frustrated males, and their career paths typically involve, at peak, promotional appearances at auto and boat shows, as well as appearances in exploitation films and softcore and occasionally hardcore pornographic projects, as well as work for more expensive "escort services" and "gentleman's clubs." While this almost unblemished record of achievements apparently towers over the records of achievements by Rhodes Scholars, as shown here, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Scholars" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Scholars" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> , the notability of Rhodes scholars should not be so casually dismissed as the editors here do. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 16:09, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not Swedish - it's Norwegian. It's about the Karmøy branch of a political group (party?) called Rogaland Unge Høyres, which I think means 'Rogaland Young Rights' (Right vs Left, not rights vs duties). I may have Unge wrong though - I wonder if it might not be 'New Rights' (like German 'Jungendstil' for 'Art Nouveau'.</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's in Norwegian, and about the local chapter of Unge Høyre ("Young right", not 'new'), the youth organization of <a href="../../../h/%C3%B8/y/H%C3%B8yre.html" title="Høyre">Høyre</a>. It's basically a short blurb on how they're the largest political youth organization in north Rogeland (see? you can always be the best with enough qualifiers!) who are fighting for diversity and equality, and then a list of the board members. Given that the Unge Høyre doesn't have an article (just a single paragraph in the one for Høyre), I don't think this warrants its own page. It's vanity. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluePlatypus_82c6.html" title="User:BluePlatypus">BluePlatypus</a> 02:04, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They may cite it that way now that Cheney shot someone, to make him look bad in comparison, but I always remember the story of the duel being viewed negatively. The pride of two men leading to the death of a Cabinet member.

<li>The wikipedia has an article on Dan Quayle's famous misspelling -- <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potatoe.html" title="Potatoe">potatoe</a>.

<li>Various other contributors have argued here that there shouldn't be a list because only two VPOTUS have shot people. Actually though these are the only VPOTUS shooting incidents that are well known. I have an open mind as to the possibility that there were other incidents which aren't well known. I am sure I am not the only one who wonders how many known incidents there have been.

<dd>Hey, I have a brilliant idea! I'll start a <b>List of U.S. Republican Presidents named "George Bush"</b>. Sure, there are only two entries, but maybe someday there will be more!

<li>I don't think that is a brilliant idea. I think it is a disrespectful attempt at sarcastic mockery. Did you even read my rewrite of the article? I did you the courtesy to take your contributions seriously. I strongly urge you to show the same courtesy to other wikipedia contributors.</li>
<li>The question of whether other sitting VPOTUS shot people is not a ridiculous one. Duelling used to be popular. Lincoln was the first POTUS to have a security detail. It is quite possible that earlier VPOTUS engaged in duels that weren't publicized, maybe because no one died.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I hope that this doesn't come off as too defensive or hostile. To those who think it's not encyclopedic, what makes it not so (besides being very long and fictional)? I (and probably most other frequent Naruto editors) realize that there's a problem with article length, but nobody has a good, efficient solution other than splitting up the pages. --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentasyllabic_4b26.html" title="User:Pentasyllabic">Pentasyllabic</a> 00:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm very new to Wikipedia, but I've read through the guidelines for deletion and I don't see anything that applies... could someone explain the issue here? What is 'listcruft'? What makes self-acknowledged list like that in <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_of_the_House_bd81.html" title="Baby of the House">Baby_of_the_House</a> acceptable and this one not? I'm not a Naruto maniac, and I found this (via Google) while I was trying to make head or tail of it... i.e. it was somewhat useful and also as noted clearly represents a lot of work. Why does it need to go?</li>
<li><b>KEEPKEEPKEEP</b> Why should anyone delete this?! This is a TON of EXTREMELY useful information in regards to Naruto! It's just plainly unfair to tear it down after so much work has obviously been put into it!</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It may need a bit of organization, but that doesn't justify deleting the whole thing. A ton of work was put into this, and you want to destroy it seemingly because you don't care. SA9097</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> I might be willing to go along with those saying it's listcruft if there were a Wiki resource for anime similar to what Memory-Alpha.org does for Star Trek, but there isn't that I've seen. Plus I have found this article useful when trying to refresh my memory on what occured in remote backissues of the manga, and having it here was much better than having it at an ad-laden, inefficiently designed website like NarutoFan. Plus it exemplifies one of Wikipedia's strengths: a traditional encyclopedia would have a very weak main article on Naruto, if any at all. Articles like this strengthen Wikipedia's position as a reference of note for popular culture. <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstewart_4c12.html" title="User:Istewart">Istewart</a> 01:33, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It's really informative if you are a fan of the series, and you will not find all this information compiled in this way elsewhere on the Internet. It also explains the translated names of all the Jutsus, wich is really interesting.

<p>Listcruft. A list of every single time a particular object (in this case, a firearm) has appeared in any piece of fiction, no matter how minor that appearance.

<p>The introduction is the only vaguely encyclopedic part of this article, and that text already appears in <a href="../../../f/n/_/FN_P90_8a66.html" title="FN P90">FN P90</a> (the article this was split from, so no merge is necessary). As merging this into <a href="../../../f/n/_/FN_P90_8a66.html" title="FN P90">FN P90</a> would be to the detriment of that article, this article needs to be <b>deleted</b>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:43, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment and Question</b> Over the last couple of months, entries on popular firearm articles listing popular culture (game, movie) appearances have gone from minimal to common and voluminous. I am beginning to feel that a formal policy discussion needs to be held regarding how much of that sort of info is appropriate; right now, I know of no WP standards on the matter, and I fear creeping listitis will overwhelm many articles' other content.

It required careful monitoring and maintenance as a result. People from both sides of the argument would revert constantly, and it took weeks to stabilize the situation.

<li><b>Keep</b>. These are standardized and relevant part of firearm articles. Many firearms do not have any film/game use at all, so the ones that do are especially notable among firearms.

<li><b>Keep</b> I thought disambiguation pages were meant to differentiate between two or more articles that had the same name...<a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 23:19, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're missing the issue. Yes disambig pages are a generally good thing but when there are only two pages listed to differentiate between it's significantly more efficient to automatically go to one page (the more common one) and add a note at the top of it about the other page. This has already happened, and in fact the disambig page is not even linked to at the moment. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 00:54, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and fix links. It's true that disambiguation pages are supposed to have at least 3 links. Vicarious has raised this on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EDisambiguation_d461.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Disambiguation">Wikipedia talk:Disambiguation</a> and everybody is in agreement that there's nothing inherently evil with disambiguation pages with two links, and they should be left in place where they are created by historical accident. Moreover, "Primary topic" pages are supposed to be infrequent, and only after consensus building. They are currently less than 3% of disambiguated topics. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Allen_Simpson_95c6.html" title="User:William Allen Simpson">William Allen Simpson</a> 18:00, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Everybody is not in agreement. First off, only 5 people (including you and I) have even commented, so at the very least 20% (me) disagree, and secondly you're misreading some of the other people if you think they're opposed to the idea. There's a lot of caveats to most of their arguments and at least one person hasn't picked a side. Irregardless I did not use a nonexistent policy in my arguments to delete this page and I think it is inappropriate of you to use a nonexistant concensus to decide this page be kept. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 19:08, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Heck, a simple search found an album and a couple more songs, and there should be a "See also" to Forbidden Fruit (which has a reciprocal "See also"). That is another good reason for not deleting such pages. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Allen_Simpson_95c6.html" title="User:William Allen Simpson">William Allen Simpson</a> 18:07, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Although I find several of the additions to the disambig page dubious that's not an issue for this page and in light of there no longer being only two items I withdraw my vote. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 19:08, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Vicarious, you came late to the discussion, made up a "precedent" that 2 article disambiguation pages should be deleted (although there is <b>no guideline anywhere</b> that proposes or permits that action), and were wrong about whether "there's little chance of it ever being enlarged." Clearly, you didn't even search for <b>existing</b> references: missing several songs, another album, and a horse. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Allen_Simpson_95c6.html" title="User:William Allen Simpson">William Allen Simpson</a> 06:45, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First off, you said I made up a precedent and then said there is no such guideline which are very different things, but I did not claim either of them. In my nomination I did not say, delete as per so and so example, or delete as per so and so guideline, I simply gave my reasoning for why I thought it should be deleted. In case you I haven't been clear thus far I'll spell it out, I have never claimed any precedent or policy because neither of them exist. As you pointed out on the disambig talk someone is using this case as a precedent but I have no part of it, and before you said something had no knowledge of it.<br />
As for the additions you made to the disambig page I find all of them dubious. Especially the album you refer to, which doesn't yet exist so you put up a red link for it (the article not the album). I made a point of not reverting all your additions because I feared it might seem like I was being petty but I truly think that page only has two legitamate links. Further discussion of those links belongs at that page though, see you there. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 12:39, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'll even help you write the article. Until then, I'm sorry, but it fails notability. As to the two ign articles in question, they're written by someone using a pseudonym, I can find no bio details of the author, it's entirely possible the author is a user of the site, and ign would fall into the dubious portion of our <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> guidelines. I don't want to rain on your parade, like I say, get the coverage to be included here and I'll welcome you back.

<li>I am very very sympathetic to reference sites, (the notion that they should be subject to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as with any other site is one I do not agree with) and don't consider low Alexa rank (this one seems to have about 172,000?) as an argument to support a vote against a reference. But what I am not seeing in my searches is evidence that this site is regarded as a reference by others. If a link from official Marvel sites (more than just a fan link) were evidenced, it would help. If the articles had sourcing (for example <a href="http://www.marveldatabase.com/wiki/index.php/Captain_America_%28Steve_Rogers%29" class="external text" title="http://www.marveldatabase.com/wiki/index.php/Captain_America_%28Steve_Rogers%29" rel="nofollow">Captain America</a>, an article you'd expect to have depth (it does) and sourcing (it does not... all the facts in the bio have no ties to particular issues or sourcing of any kind), it would be more likely to be a scholarly reference. I think there is a great deal of work put into the site by the users (considerably more than <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowikis.html" title="Yellowikis">Yellowikis</a>, which I voted Keep for) and the article here shows a good deal of work, but it's by one person. And the community has come to consensus that it should not be kept, more than once. So, with some considerable regret <b>userify</b>. If it was a reference site that's referencable, I would have advocated keep. I am glad this was not speedied so it could be discussed. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 04:08, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Lar, thank you very much for looking more deeply into our site to see our value. We have worked really hard, but not all of our pages are completely polished yet. The information is still there, but some typos exist and some pictures and sources are missing. I, too, have watched our Alexa rating, but it seems to make no sense... We were at about 80,000 4 months ago, but our rank keeps falling. I have traffic analysis software that says our traffic has since doubled. I think Alexa is a VERY poor indicator of success. We are more well known than Steve would believe, I have 'chatted' online with several folks I just met, who knew about our site before I even told them...

<li><b>Delete without prejudice to an acceptable recreation</b>. I sympathise—I can see that a lot of work has gone into writing the piece. However, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and like all encyclopedias has certain editorial standards. I agree with Taxman that in this instance they have not been met; specifically, there is a lack of external verification to indicate the subject's notability. Wikipedia's policies on sourcing and verifiability have deliberately been set extremely low—far lower than for any other serious encyclopedia, to my knowledge. But they <i>are</i> standards, nevertheless. When MDP is sufficiently noteworthy that people independently write about it in reviews or critiques in reputable publications, I think most WPns would be glad to have a referenced article. I also note the point that there are articles on WP which, like MDP, do not meet articlespace policies. This however would seem to be a reason to improve them or delete them, not to allow other articles of a similar nature to join them.

<ul>
<li>ENCEPHALON, You certainly make good reasoning for the policies that exist. I certainly agree that the level of standards should remain as high as possible without excluding too much content. My contention is that the MDP IS more notable than has so far been shown. Here I have added a few examples of <i>notable</i> and <i>independant</i> sites that have indeed written articles citing our project as a reference. <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a>, a long-standing and trusted resource surely should count as <i>one vote</i> for our notariaty. Similar articles have surfaced in other major internet publications as well. I will continue to hunt for them and add them to the list. Hopefully, this will shed more light on the subject of our notariaty. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamieHari_adee.html" title="User:JamieHari">JamieHari</a> 05:35, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for that, Jamie. The IGN link is promising, isn't it? However, it seems to me that it does not talk <i>about</i> MDP, which is what one would hope for from an external reference that is meant to "do a lot of work", so to speak. I'm rather afraid it doesn't materially change my assessment, Jamie. But don't worry, WP will probably be around for a long while, and the moment you have the required refs...&#160;:-) <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:#002bb8;cursor:crosshair;">ENCEPHALON</span></a> <i>19:21, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<li>Incidentally, JamieHari, you are quite right about Alexa. There are (too) many folks who seem to regard Alexa rankings and google hits as some sort of indicator of "encyclopedicness". This is incorrect and unhelpful, for reasons others have written on more elegantly than I. The test of encyclopediability, if one may call it that, is compliance with the article space policies WP:V (and related guidelines), WP:NOR, WP:NOT and WP:NPOV. A page that meets them should not be deleted even if it had no google hits. A page that doesn't shouldn't be kept even if it had a million hits. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:#002bb8;cursor:crosshair;">ENCEPHALON</span></a> <i>04:32, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<p>Re: The deletion of the MDP page on Wikipedia.<br /></p>
<p><b>Keep</b>.</p>
<p>I thank you all for not speedy deleting and for the chance to discuss this further. I would certainly like to apologize for adding the page myself. I didn't, at the time, realise it would go against the applicable policy. This time when I added it, I waited until our site was of more substantial value to the community at large. Our site has now had over 55,000 edits and nearly 2.5 million page views. It is not even a year old yet and has already made it to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_wikis" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_wikis" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia's list of largest wikis</a> at 72nd place.</p>
<p>I had seen the <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a> page, a similar wiki-site about Star Trek. When I first added the Marvel Database Project, I was probably wrong to do so. Not that it wasn't a valid page, but that I was too eager and the project was not YET worth a Wikipedia article. I believe the situation has changed with our recent efforts. The Memory Alpha page was my inspiration to make our page, I figured wiki projects held a special place in the heart of Wikipedians. Their site, too, was added by their (co)founder. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaeMan_589e.html" title="User:MinutiaeMan">User:MinutiaeMan</a> / <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/User:MinutiaeMan" class="external text" title="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/User:MinutiaeMan" rel="nofollow">MinutiaeMan userpage on Memory Alpha</a>.</p>
<p>I assure you our Marvel project is not <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruft.html" title="Cruft">cruft</a>. We are growing at a very good rate. We have new editors all the time and we have worked very hard to build a respectable database.</p>
<p>I emplore you to reconsider your delete votes and consider other projects of similar nature that have their own articles. The damage was done when I created the article myself, but I believe the value of our project still is there...</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<dd>I think the verifiability issue is affected by the fact that most wikipedians are young white males (I read somewhere). This results in WP content being shaped by the inherent baises of its editors (virtually no articles on stage actors/actresses but dozens of articles on Star Wars, for example). I agree that in a perfect WP an editor would post more information, like influences that carry through to today's Indian music. I worry that by deleting things be cause "we" don't know about them, "we" (who are not very representative of humanity as a whole) are creating a biased result. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:38, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Most subjects on wikipedia I know nothing about - and I don't nominate for deletion. This has nothing to do with the subject matter or my skin coulour gender or (lack of) youthfulness.

<dd>Although WP is supposed to be a collaborative medium, applying that standard means that if an author writes an article about an obscure subject that can't be readily googled, he has to get it right the first time or else. I voted above <i>weak delete</i> because the article hadn't been edited in months, but I think we should be open to the possibility that the article standard and AfD process will sometimes reinforce <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:29, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm all for combating systematic bias, and I'm great believer that Google isn't the be all and end all of verification (a citation from a book or reputable journal is good too). But, what are you suggesting? That we shouldn't require the verification of articles on 'obscre' subjects, or that they should hang arround for weeks waiting for someone to verify them? That way lies hoaxes. Indeed, it is procisely where the subject is obscure and few wikipedians would recognise errors and inaccuracies that we must be rigourous in demanding authors verify and cite. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 16:46, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You miss the point again. The choise is not beween expansion or deletion, but between verification and deletion. You say 'the article should be expanded with references to books' - and that google is not the only source, I agree, but can it be, and are there other sources? If it can be verified, then keep it, if not then delete it for now.

<dd>I think the article deserves more time to have a knowledgeable editor to add the information. This article is not vanity, nor promotion.

<dd>Officially that's true. Unofficially, such an editor must also be knowledgable in speedy deletion and beaurocracy of DRV. As any new article, of a deleted name, stands a good chance of being speedy deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Also keep the verificaton tag on. In point of unfortunate fact there are <i>many</i> unverified articles on Wikipedia. The solution is sometimes to tag, not delete. Tagging both alerts readers to be especially careful in considering the article's contents, and puts the article on the road to eventual improvement. Patience. A researcher, armed with nothing but the name, will come here someday and use the extra info provided to further his search -- and then, hopefully, return and footnote the article. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 17:49, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nice theory, pity it hasn't worked after 6 months. How much longer would you give it? 6-12-18. And your theory only works if there is verification out there to be had (there isn't at the moment). What if the article is a hoax, or the guy is truely nn, then nothing will happen and we might be left with an unverified and potentially incorrect article indefinately. I'd say 6 months is long enough when there is no corroberation at all. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 17:57, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I've a little problem with this nom because the nominator seems to have done this in retaliation for the AfD of OfficeDebo... This was also done after the nominator blanked and vandalised the HoboWars site. AnonIP 82.38.91.15 engaged in a little vandalism too, as well as what appears to be a puppet vote.

<li>Let's think about bands that released one EP: Siege and Neanderthal, both important to the creaton of the power violence and grindcore genres, Last Rights, notable for ruling hard and being the last band that Choke from Slapshot was in that was good, Negative Approach barely released anything more than that, Straight Ahead, Antidote really only released one. The EP is the main format for hardcore punk, and it's common for bands to release only one before breaking up.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My understanding was that this was largely a defensive measure to deal with people constantly wanting to add a implementation of quicksort in their language of choice to the quicksort page - users are deflected here rather than deleting implementations off the quicksort page, and potentially righting revert wars over it. "<i>somewhere else</i>" is a good sentiment, but I would suggest it would be useful to figure out where exactly. <a href="../../../l/e/l/User%7ELeland_McInnes_a728.html" title="User:Leland McInnes">Leland McInnes</a> 17:08, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>WikiBooks might provide the best fit — maybe there needs to be a "Programming examples" book there or something. I don't think it's useful to move inappropriate content to back alleys and dark corners of the encyclopedia; if people keep adding non-encyclopedic content, we need to point them toward Wikipedia's guidelines and policies, rather than toward articles with lower standards. --<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonhalcon_96f2.html" title="User:Donhalcon">bmills</a> 17:26, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The argument against <b>X implementations</b> pages is that anything interesting about the algorithm is already in <b>X</b>; anything interesting about the languages of implementation is already on respective pages. So all that leaves is a bunch of code: Wikipedia is not a source code repository.</dd>
<dd>I agree, however, that some code is useful: in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_loop.html" title="Infinite loop">infinite loop</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffer_overflow.html" title="Buffer overflow">buffer overflow</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/i/Pointer.html" title="Pointer">pointer</a>, viz. this code with concrete, unambiguous semantics relevant to a particular point has this meaning. But implementations are reiterating what has been said in general in pseudocode.</dd>
<dd>For example, the C in-place implementation of quicksort is interesting, but what is interesting about it is that the work is done in place; put it on the main page. Functional versions which make naive allocations are relevant to FP; the problem of aliasing and other optimizations of functional code should be mentioned <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functional_programming.html" title="Functional programming">there</a>.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, the copyright and licensing implications of posting code from a non-GFDL-compatible project make implementation listings a terrible idea.</dd>
<dd>I think the existence of "defensive measures" is fairly silly. If we can keep the day and year pages free of vanity, we can keep implementations out of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/g/r/User%7EMgreenbe_c499.html" title="User:Mgreenbe">Mgreenbe</a> 19:00, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, do we need WP:CEMETERY guidelines now? Reading through the article, the only thing I could think of that would confer enough notability for a graveyard to be listed would be if several very notable people were buried there, or the graveyard was the site of some historical happening, or had some sort of general historical significance. Otherwise mention of it could simply be made in individual bios (i.e. person A is interred at graveyard B). Based on that, I think Salem Street Burying Ground falls short of those criteria, unless there are more nationally or internationally recognized historical figures interred there than are mentioned in the article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:46, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>, old by USA standards but practically new compared to the range of British and European graveyards. Not much indication of historical significance. Only indication of notable burials there are one governor and one "war heroine" who doesn't appear in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete.</b> It should be noted that "vanity" is not a deletion criterion. So called vanity articles <i>are</i> frequently deleted, but an article written by its subject is not, <i>per se</i>, a deletable offence on WP (if Bill Clinton had written the article on Bill Clinton, we would not delete it, although it would probably be heavilly edited to remove a non-NPOV). The reason many "vanity articles" are deleted is simply that the subject is usually not notable and there is a lack of reputable sources on him/her that may be used as a basis to write the article and satisfy the requirements of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<li><b>A reply to Calton</b>. Thank you for the preceeding, Calton. It's regrettable that you presume I'd written my comment without doing what you helpfully inform us is '"research", people'. I did make the requisite appeal to the research tool of choice for scholarly writing these days—the search engine. I got online booksellers, blogs, ads and notices; even a dog training outfit. Many of these are no surprise: Mike Daisey has a play in print, <i>21 Dog Years</i>. This explains many of the hits, in particular the booksellers and notices. You adduce a sample, and claim that they are sufficient to meet what I termed <i>reputable sources... that may be used as a basis to write the article and satisfy the requirements of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a></i>.
<p>I saw some of the things you've put up. The <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1119068" class="external text" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1119068" rel="nofollow">NPR link</a> is a three sentence scheduling notice about <i>21 Dog Years</i>. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/afternoonplay/pip/d7qiz/" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/afternoonplay/pip/d7qiz/" rel="nofollow">BBC link</a> is a similar 1 sentence scheduling notice about a play. This <a href="http://music.sfweekly.com/issues/2004-06-16/index.html" class="external text" title="http://music.sfweekly.com/issues/2004-06-16/index.html" rel="nofollow">SF link</a> has a single sentence, about his play. In my search I had also found others of a similar nature: <a href="http://www.assemblyrooms.com/programme2003/prog_code/21DOG/programme_item.php" class="external text" title="http://www.assemblyrooms.com/programme2003/prog_code/21DOG/programme_item.php" rel="nofollow">Assembly Theatres programme item</a>—1 sentence about the play. Now, when one writes an article—an <i>encyclopedia</i> article, how well do 1-sentence sources serve as reference works? How well do scheduling notices about plays serve as a basis to write an encyclopedic biographical article, in your opinion?</p>
<p>You mention the number of google hits your searches produced. I have found that using the number of hits to indicate encyclopediability to be suboptimal suboptimal—what matters most is the quality of the references and sources with which you can write on the subject. Not the number of hits.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the article on <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopkins_syndrome.html" title="Hopkins syndrome">Hopkins syndrome</a>. This is an exceptionally rare medical condition—many doctors go through their entire professional lives without having once heard of it. However, it is the subject of serious study and is perfectly encyclopedic. Our WP article is a summary of what is known about the condition; every claim in every sentence is verifiable in the references, all of which are of good quality. We'd be hard-pressed to put up an argument that that article in not suitable for WP. Yet, if you perform the much-vaunted google search, you'd get only some 250 odd links, of which many are duplicate copies of abstracts pulled off another site. Google hits are a suboptimal measure of encyclopediability. The numbers may coincide with encyclopediability, but they are not the crux of the matter; at the very best, they are merely what might be called a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrogate_endpoint.html" title="Surrogate endpoint">surrogate</a> measure.</p>
<p>The crux is how solid an article can be written about the subject, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. If the subject is a disease, are there excellent references that report what is known about its clinical features, pathology, etiology, epidemiology, natural course, possible treatments? If the subject is a <i>person</i>, do we have references on <i>them</i> (ie. <i>them</i>, not just reviews of their books or plays or theses)? The latter issue lies at the heart of this AFD, and perhaps we should discuss it further.</p>
<p>I have noticed a curious difficulty many of us Wikipedians seem to have with biographical articles on writers (I think it has something to do with misunderstanding the relationship between <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). If a person happens to have written a book, and there is available a review/critique of the book, there is immediately an (odd) assumption that a WP article can be written about the <i>person</i> (as opposed to the book). "John Brown has published a novel? Oh, we definitely should have an article on him, then." This is often said despite nothing ever having been written <i>on or about</i> John Brown, the subject of the proposed article. IMHO, this misunderstands how an encyclopedia article is written. An article on the subject "John Brown" can only be written per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> if we have works <i>on John Brown</i>, just as an article on <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> may only be written if there are publications on asthma. If all available acceptable sources pertain solely to John Brown's <i>book</i>, one may write a good, NPOV article on the book, but unless one wishes to break <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, the author page should not be more than a redirect.</p>
<p>Consider as an example the article <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>. The reason we were able to write that article on WP is that there is a rich trove of works on Russell, the person: Ray Monk's famous two-volume biography, AJ Ayer's work on Russell, Clark's—even Russell himself wrote a three volume autobiography and numerous papers on his own life and convictions. We have libraries-worth of works on his works, his philosophy, his mathematics. So when we put together the article, including in it those features that one would expect to find in a biographical account, we have rich sources from which to write and verify. When we say "Russell was born on May 18, 1872", we can <i>verify</i> that, easily. When we write "He was born in Wales into an aristocratic family", we can <i>verify</i> that. When we say that his father was so and so, his mother had an affair with so and so, his siblings were so and so, his adolescence was lonely, he attended Trinity on scholarship, his influences were Whitehead, Moore, Hume; he married so and so, he taught at XYZ, he was forced to leave City College because of controversy, he won the Noble Prize in Literature... every such claim is <i>verifiable from excellent sources</i>. And then of course we have the works on his philosophy and thought, his politics, his professional life... For the opposite situation, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Balagangadhara_3ada.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Balagangadhara">this AFD</a> for an example of a case where there were a lot of sources on the writer's work, but absolutely nothing on the person.</p>
<p>With <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Daisey_eca1.html" title="Mike Daisey">Mike Daisey</a>, the "references" I found were</p>
<ol>
<li>Online bookshops selling <i>21 Dog Years</i></li>
<li>1-2 line notices of the sort I've alluded to above, and</li>
<li>his personal website, which contains little biographical information (and which is furthermore inadmissable as a good source, being a personal website).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I do not believe these hits to be "<i>reputable sources that may be used as a basis to write the article and satisfy the requirements of WP:V and WP:RS</i>". Which is why I said so. You've been a Wikipedian for a while, Calton, and I'll not waive policy pages in front of you, but I would ask that in future you assume good faith of your fellows. In discussions, do not presume that they haven't given a matter any thought, or haven't performed "research, people". They may simply have come to different conclusions than you. Resorting to condescension, incidentally, is rarely productive (particularly when it falls flat).
<p>Now, I <i>am</i> thankful for your contribution above for one reason in particular: you found a couple of good reviews of the <b>play</b>, <i>21 Dog Years</i>, that I didn't. For example, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2131493.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2131493.stm" rel="nofollow">this BBC link</a> from the old UK BBC website. It's a very good write up. I've also found an SF weekly review, which now that I look at it is actually linked from one of your links above: I think you got a TOC page. These pieces all pertain to the work <i>21 Dog Years</i>: they're either reviews of the show or the book. One can write a very decent article on <i>21 Dog Years</i> from these sources; along the course of which one can mention the author's other play (which seems to have considerably fewer reviews), and works. That outcome I'd fully support, because the article that is written will be congruent with the both the subject and quality of the available sources. If someone writes <i>21 Dog Years</i>, I'd support having <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Daisey_eca1.html" title="Mike Daisey">Mike Daisey</a> and <i>The Ugly American (play)</i> as redirects. If not, my opinion above still holds. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;">ENCEPHALON</span></a> <i>06:52, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>NB</b>. As there has been a significant discussion over this, I think all participants should be given an opportunity to reconsider their views: while my opinion remains unchanged, some others may wish to change their vote from delete to something else. I'll contact those who edited the AFD before Calton's post to ask if they would like to reconsider. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;">ENCEPHALON</span></a> <i>06:52, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</i>

I added the "Simon" so you might get the point -- that the host of the program has singled out the subject and his work -- but it seems to have escaped you.</li>
<li><i>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/afternoonplay/pip/d7qiz/" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/afternoonplay/pip/d7qiz/" rel="nofollow">BBC link</a> is a similar 1 sentence scheduling notice about a play.</i> Yes, a BBC scheduling notice about the play <i>that the BBC is broadcasting</i>. Your phrasing makes it sound as if it were merely a theater listing -- though given your complete misreading of the NPR link, maybe that's what you thought it was.</li>
<li><i>This <a href="http://music.sfweekly.com/issues/2004-06-16/index.html" class="external text" title="http://music.sfweekly.com/issues/2004-06-16/index.html" rel="nofollow">SF link</a> has a single sentence, about his play.</i> Technically true, but misleading: it's round-up page for that week's edition of the paper, with a <a href="http://music.sfweekly.com/Issues/2004-06-16/culture/stage2.html" class="external text" title="http://music.sfweekly.com/Issues/2004-06-16/culture/stage2.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> to a full review of the play. You DID notice that link there, right?</li>
<li><i>You mention the number of google hits your searches produced. I have found that using the number of hits to indicate encyclopediability to be suboptimal suboptimal—what matters most is the quality of the references and sources with which you can write on the subject.</i> Which is, you know, '<i>utter irrelevant to what I actually did</i>. The number of Google hits was not -- and as far as I'm concerned, <i>clearly</i> not -- the primary argument, merely the jumping off point for a quick jump through what the Google hits reveal. That you would pick nits -- and in the obvious case of the NPR link, be objectively wrong about it -- rather than note what the pattern reveals makes me question the purpose of your response.</li>
<li>As well, your self-congratulatory (and redundant) lecture about sources is duly noted. It's also utterly irrelevant: none of the links I note are for the purpose of sourcing the article -- they're for rebutting the claim that that this article is a vanity piece for promoting a non-notable writer, by demonstrating the breadth of the attention he's received. What choices I made of which to cut and paste were based on medium, significance of source, and geography -- a San Francisco alt-weekly, two Seattle daily papers, NPR, BBC, Spoleto USA, etc: they seemed sufficient to the task I set out to do. The BBC profile page might have been the tiniest clue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>With Mike Daisey, the "references" I found were...</i> That rather speaks more to your research skills than to the source material, doesn't it, as the NPR link you misread indicates. Perhaps the time you could have spent actually reading the (essentially random) links I pulled up or doing some actual research would have been better spent than on composing a rambling and tangential 1300-word rationale for your pomposity -- along with the self-congratulatory side-trip. I, for one, do not plan on spending any more time rebutting nonsense: I only responded as I have because, as rule, I hate pomposity and I hate having my intelligence insulted, especially at length. Now excuse me, I have work to do and -- when time allows -- an encyclopedia to contribute to. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:30, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>That is an unfortunate post, Calton. Do try to keep uncivil remarks, personal attacks and/or disparagement of your fellow Wikipedians off these pages; we all benefit from courteous and thoughtful AFD discussions. As to the substance of your comments:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In this AFD we're mainly concerned with whether there exist <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">multiple independent, reputable references</a> on the subject "Mike Daisey", which may be employed to write an encyclopedic account of him. I found none, and stated so in my first comment. In a discourteous response, you disagreed, pasting a number of links that you felt disproved my suggestion that <i>there is a lack of reputable sources on [him] that may be used as a basis to write the article and satisfy the requirements of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a></i>. The links sadly did nothing of the sort; indeed, they have confirmed my original conjecture about the paucity of reputable, independent references on Daisey.
<p>This is the core of the issue: to write a WP article on a person, we need works <i>on that person</i>, just as we do with any other subject in order to comply with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. If <i>a thing</i> that person has produced has received wide attention and comment in reputable publications, we may certainly write an article on that thing, but we won't be able to write a good article on the person if we lack verifiable facts about him. That's it, really: that's all I'm saying.</p>
</li>
<li>In <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mike_Daisey&amp;diff=39809096&amp;oldid=39800414" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mike_Daisey&amp;diff=39809096&amp;oldid=39800414" rel="nofollow">your last comment</a></b>, you write that discussion of the use of Google hits was "<i>utter irrelevant to what I actually did</i>". Well, I was responding to your first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mike_Daisey&amp;diff=38998773&amp;oldid=38974984" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mike_Daisey&amp;diff=38998773&amp;oldid=38974984" rel="nofollow">comment</a>: you informed me that "Google is your friend", and proceeded to relay a string of Google figures: "<i>67,400 hits for "Mike Daisey" (in quotes), 2 from Google Books (though one is from one of those damned</i> Chicken Soup for the Soul <i>collections), and 9 from Google Scholar -- and a Google Ads link to buy audiobooks by Mike Daisey from Audible.com.</i>" I was simply addressing this apparent faith in the relevance of hits; it's also an issue that bears discussion, IMHO, given the widespread use of this technique on AFD.</li>
<li>With respect to the links:
<ul>
<li><b>The <a href="http://music.sfweekly.com/issues/2004-06-16/index.html" class="external text" title="http://music.sfweekly.com/issues/2004-06-16/index.html" rel="nofollow">SF link</a></b>. <i>...it's round-up page for that week's edition of the paper, with a link to a full review of the play. You DID notice that link there, right?</i> Yes—I explicitly noted that in the second last paragraph of my comment. I'd read the short, 1 paragraph review of <i>21 Dog Years</i>; you had actually linked a TOC (table of contents) type page of the SF Weekly. Did <i>you</i> read what I wrote, Calton? Not that any of this is directly relevant to the crux of the matter: the availability of good sources on Mike Daisey. Like all the other quoted sources, this one is focused on the play, not the man.</li>
<li><b>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/afternoonplay/pip/d7qiz/" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/afternoonplay/pip/d7qiz/" rel="nofollow">BBC link</a></b>. It's good you acknowledge that this is simply a scheduling notice—1 sentence long. You then ask if I knew the play was broadcast by the BBC. One would hardly expect a schedule on BBC Radio to pertain to some other institution's line up, Calton. I most certainly have not alluded to theatres. Again, though, this is neither here nor there. This is a brief notice on a performance: it's not a reference work on Daisey. We can use this page with its solitary proclamation as a source in an article on the play <i>The Ugly American</i>. We could use it as a source in an article on Mike Daisy to indicate that one of his performances was broadcast on BBC—<i>if</i> we had enough other material on Daisey himself that could be used to write an article on him, that is. As must be apparent, I am doubtful of this.</li>
<li><b>The <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1119068" class="external text" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1119068" rel="nofollow">NPR link</a></b>. You reserve especial odioum here, over a point as incorrect and IMHO as inconsequential as the above. Yes, I did spy the "Listen" button, Calton—it's a bit hard to miss on a page with 3 sentences. Before you make the inquiry, yes, I had even clicked on it and listened to all 14 minutes and 36.5 seconds. The interview is, once again, <i>on the show 21 Dog Years</i>: they spoke about the play, the experiences behind the show, and played a number of clips from it. Not a single second was spent on Mike Daisey the individual apart from the show: nothing on his childhood, or education, or influences, life... or even his other works. It was a chat about <b>21 Dog Years</b>; the description was not "wrong", Calton—quite the opposite, if I may say so. And, once again, the point you raise is IMHO tangential: whether or not I saw the "Listen" button hardly changes the simple, straightforward nature of the page—three sentences concerning a scheduled radio interview about <i>21 Dog Years</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The primary consideration remains: where are the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">multiple independent, reputable references</a> with which we may write a balanced, factual, verified WP article on the person, Mike Daisey? I do not see them: what I see are simply blurbs and reviews on the play/book. They are best utilized as a basis to write about the play; until Mike Daisey is notable enough that people start writing about <i>him</i>, I'm afraid a page on him is premature.
<p>Finally, do moderate your tone. I was disappointed (and surprised) to read your last post: we would all benefit from courteous discussions, and that tone is hardly helpful. I've given your comments all due consideration and respect: this despite being subjected to an incredible amount of condescension and incivility ("<i>It's called research, people</i>; "<i>gaseous and defensive</i>"; "<i>self-congratulatory</i>"; "<i>your pomposity</i>"; "<i>speaks more to your research skills</i>"; "<i>rambling</i>"; "<i>pick[ing] nits</i>" "<i>nonsense</i>"). In fact, I stopped the normal course of the AFD, contacted each participant who had commented before you and asked them to consider your views, even though they are opposed to mine, because the AFD would not have reached a fair conclusion otherwise. It would be nice if you could say what you have to say with a little less discourtesy. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;">ENCEPHALON</span></a> <i>14:32, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>NB. I've just gotten a hunch as to why one of my comments above was disparaged as "self-congratulatory". Is it that I referred positively to an <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopkins_syndrome.html" title="Hopkins syndrome">article</a> I initiated? If so, please note that that was not the intent at all: I only used the article as an example because I'm aware of it (I consider articles WP's anyway, and refer to them that way). I don't know that many articles of the top of my head that can serve as a good example of what I was referring to: something on an encyclopedic subject with very low google hits, but which had been written up on WP and completely referenced to acceptable sources.

<li>Great effort there! The first promising plausible source. However, on checking out at the website I was discouraged. According to <a href="http://www.gale-edit.com/cas/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gale-edit.com/cas/index.htm" rel="nofollow">gale-edit.com</a>, their <i>Contemporary Authors</i> index is essentially written by the authors themselves. Any person who has published one non-vanity press book can fill out their questionnaire; Gale editors will turn the answers into a prose sketch and then return this piece to the author. Then, "we will incorporate any changes you wish to make at that time..." This certainly does not seem to be a reliable source as defined in WP policies. Sources acceptable to WP are those which have undergone a fact-check or peer-review process (eg. as in published scientific journals, theses, newspaper articles etc). This is especially important to WP because we completely lack any kind of mechanism for doing this internally (ie. we have no peer-reviewers, editorial offices, fact-checking departments etc—we're just an anonymous wiki, so everything must be cited to reputable external sources).

<li><b>Keep As-Is</b>, The <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Hyles_12fe.html" title="Jack Hyles">Jack Hyles</a> Wiki was originally hijacked by a small and dedicated group of anti-Hyles persons who want everyone to think that their accusations are "significant to this man's ministry" and that they are "well sourced and referenced". Their constant vandalism of the main Jack Hyles Wiki caused a wiki-war. A consensus solution was reached whereby this fork article was created. This solution is consistant with Wiki guidelines on article forking (POV fork) which states, "<i>As Wikipedia articles grow, they often need to be segmented, or branched, into manageable parts. This is an accepted premise for forking an article, and the nature of that split more often depends upon consensus — e.g. a "Criticism of" article may be justified if there is enough (or going to be enough) material to justify a separate article...</i>" Go ahead and delete this article and merge these outrageous accusations into the main Jack Hyles Wiki, but you will surely enter right back into the wiki war again, which no one wants. - GeorgeS <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User:69.214.212.201">69.214.212.201</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User talk:69.214.212.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.212.201_0d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.212.201">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, again... this seems to be a fork that is there strictly to create an "out of sight out of mind" scenario. The main article has not grown enough to merit a fork. To quote POV fork: <i>"The generally accepted policy is that all facts and majority Point of Views on a certain subject are treated in one article. As Wikipedia does not view article forking as an acceptable solution to disagreements between contributors, such forks may be nominated for deletion."</i> As I said above, if the criticisms of Mr. Hyles are If these claims are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and can be legitimately sourced without being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, they should stay in the article and anyone who initiates an edit war by repeatedly deleting material should be warned and then banned if they continue. Conversely, if the criticisms are not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> then they do not belong on Wikipedia at all and anyone who repeatedly adds this information should be warned and then banned if they continue. Forking just to keep 2 opposing sides from having to work together is, in my opinion, not a supported reason for a fork and is bad precedent.

<li><b>Reply to Comment</b>, The point is that we came to a consensus solution here and most seemed to be happy with it, and most thought it was an equitable solution and it ended the wiki-war, or at least it was a temporary "cease-fire". The truth is that there is equal Wikipedia guidelines for BOTH positions (deletion vs. forking). The forking solution will work; deleting this fork will only add fuel to the fire on both sides of this issue. From the last wiki-war, it's apparent that banning IP addresses is not the solution, since both parties seem to have an abundance of methodologies at their disposal for avoiding such control schemes. Please allow me to ask for YOUR solution to this problem-- allowing the anti-Hyles people to place their extremely biased and unproven pet theories and character assassinations on the main Jack Hyles Wiki is NOT a solution that will work without major challenges. The majority of the anti-Hyles editors have proven time and time again that they CANNOT write in a Neutral Point of View on this subject. -GeorgeS <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User:69.214.212.201">69.214.212.201</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User talk:69.214.212.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.212.201_0d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.212.201">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Wikipedia doesn't allow POV forks, you should familiarize yourself with the resource. If something is sourced and murder allegations are part of his past it should be included on the main article.

<dd>Arbustoo, perhaps YOU should familiarize yourself with the resource. A fork is clearly acceptible when there is enough material to support it. (Try reading the comments above and checking out the Wikipedia guidelines on forking) AND WHAT THE HECK is this stuff about "MURDER ACCUSATIONS"?? See folks, this crowd just keeps piling on false accusation on false accusation, tell a lie long enough and eventually it makes it into the Wiki. That's crap, sir. - GeorgeS <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User:69.214.212.201">69.214.212.201</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User talk:69.214.212.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.212.201_0d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.212.201">contribs</a>).</small>

<p><s>*<b>Keep it here</b> Well, all I can say is that if you rabid Hyles-haters don't abide by Wikipedia's rule of Neutral Point of View, you're edits will be deleted asap; and placing your own personal web site as a "source" is not valid, neither is an obscure rant from a lunatic's blog a valid "source"... if you have valid sources from accepted media or news outlets, that is what makes a solid Wiki.

<dd>Surely the important thing is that independent third parties think that this is a notable product. These include the Royal Television Society, who thought it was the most signficant of any product anywhere for advancing the process of video post production, and awarded it as such, as well as the biggest production company in the world, the BBC (FORscene works on their 27,000 desktops).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The product is widely used, with distributors in six countries on three continents.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the product pushes the boundary of what is possible on the web - a complete web-based editing and publishing system for web and mobile phones (cell phones in the US). By using Java in novel and powerful ways, the client takes the strain rather than the server, giving the internet its first complete (ie from shooting through editing to publishing and viewing) browser-based real time video application.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, in short, I'd like to contest this deletion, which removes from Wikipedia what has been judged by senior independent people in the industry a very significant product.</dd>

Perhaps something looking more like <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Premiere_10d5.html" title="Adobe Premiere">Adobe Premiere</a> would be preferable, showing development history back to 1990.</p>
<p>I notice that other similar UK listed companies have entries eg <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vividas.html" title="Vividas">Vividas</a>. Would the VSCA people be happy with a Forbidden Technologies entry, with a link to the description on the Forbidden website? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 08:24, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The presence or absence of other similar companies having articles is irrelevant.

</ul>
<p>I'm not after removing Vividas, but thinking of adding Forbidden. Are there any guidelines on what makes a company notable?</p>
<p>I would rather read about a company or product on Wikipedia, where independent third parties can amend or write their own content, than rely on the company website or literature.</p>
<p>To me, notable is not the same as popular or established. In particular, some novel products can be very notable. Judging by the response from independent third parties in the industry, FORscene would appear to fall into this category ie novel and notable.</p>
<p>I've included a couple of third party articles which mention FORscene, and which give a broader picture than the current FORscene article.</p>
<p>I notice in the guidelines that there is no prohibition per se to writing articles about products you are involved in. I know that this has been controversial when applied to biographies and such like, but I would have thought a web based product is relatively simple to verify and so much less prone to bias.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> provides guidelines for notability, further broken up into subpages for different categories (companies, products, etc). <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 18:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks. I'll have another look. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 19:01, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Notability pages themselves mention some discussion as to how important notability is, but I don't think anyone is concerned with this here. More useful is the criteria for notability expressed in the guidelines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28companies_and_corporations%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28companies_and_corporations%29" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In particular the sufficient criteria for notability which is for multiple independent non-trivial published works including newspaper articles.</p>
<p>Forbidden Technologies, which has been around for a few years, easily meets this notability criterion, with numerous articles including in the national press eg Telegraph, Independent, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_Times_8705.html" title="Financial Times">Financial Times</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Business_%28newspaper%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Business_%28newspaper%29" rel="nofollow">The Business</a>, Investors Chronicle, The Daily Mail and the Sun as well as the trade press articles which talk about FORscene (see next paragragh), and thousands of "articles" in invesment websites. <a href="../../../a/d/v/ADVFN_587d.html" title="ADVFN">ADVFN</a> alone has over 4,000 since the beginning of last year (Forbidden Technologies does not post on these boards).</p>
<p>FORscene itself, although relatively new, has also received multiple independent articles, both on the web and printed trade press particularly eg Broadcast, Televisual, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Media_Age_5338.html" title="New Media Age">New Media Age</a> and Showreel magazine, as well as winning multiple independent awards (the RTS being the most recent and important).</p>
<p>So if people here are happy with these notability guidelines, I'll fish out references to some of these press articles.</p>
<p>Moving on to the VSCA question. The guidelines suggest that although desirable, it is not required, that the author of the article is not an investor in the company.</p>
<p>I've been tidying up the entry, with the objective of making it more encyclopaedic. This process is still ongoing. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 00:02, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
History section added showing developments since 1990. This could be thinned, but launch date in 1990 is significant because it shows FORscene is not some random new idea, but the result of many years of development in the industry.</p>
<p>I've included Eidos plc developments NOT because I founded Eidos plc (which had reached UKP 1Bn market cap the year I left to found Forbidden), but because thousands of broadcast TV programmes were made on it. One of the reasons for the success of FORscene is that Optima developments had responded to vast numbers of criticsms from professional editors over many years, and this knowhow is incorporated into FORscene. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 10:14, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the alexa information in particular, which shows a significant recent rise. However it's not obvious to me that links to Forbidden Technologies website directly relate to the importance of FORscene. Most FORscene users have locked down systems and would not register at all in alexa, which may in any case be weighted towards the US, where FORscene is not available.</p>
<p>It's true that FORscene is not widely linked to in Wikipedia. In fact, the original article was deleted after about 1 minute, so I wouldn't expect many links in Wikipedia! No one will link to an article recommended for deletion, so I think the link point is spurious.</p>
<p>The notablity guidelines suggest that the large number of printed press reports, both in the national press and trade journals, should be enough for notability.</p>
<p>Now I've got to know Wikipedia a bit more, I acknowledge that independence is an important issue though, which can only be resolved either by either:</p>
<p>a) people who are independent (such as customers) writing an article; or</p>
<p>b) reducing the article to a stub which contains little information.</p>
<p>As FORscene itself is still a new product, I suspect that over time some of the growing FORscene user base will also be a Wikipedia contributors, so a) will happen at some point.</p>
<p>In the mean time, seeing as I'm me, the most constructive thing I can do is to reduce the page to a non controversial stub, and wait for other Wikipedia users familiar with FORscene to add to it as they see fit.</p>
<p>I was thinking along the lines of:</p>
<p>FORscene is an award winning <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_platform.html" title="Java platform">Java</a> internet video platform, enabling users to edit and publish for web and mobile.</p>

If there are libellous/disparaging additions, delete only these edits, not the entire article. If it's vandalised, then revert on sight, and keep a watch on the article. - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 01:17, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> well, because its crap, not worth having in Wikipedia San Saba 18:58, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- You "Zodiac sceptics" are just too much. Just because you people disagree with astrology or whatever does not mean it is crap. Actually, to obliterate information because you disagree with it is nothing short of FASCISM. This information has relevance for a lot of people who are interested in astrology and believe in its efficacy and have seen it demonstrated in their lives. The information concerns an author of many books who has lectured around the world, has a web page with over one million hits and students all over the world. If you want to delete something, why don´t you consider some of the crap you may be interested in or believe in. If you delete the article, it will be reinstated and a complaint lodged. I am new at this and really don´t know Wikipedia protocol very well, but take the liberty of removing the DELETION TAG. It just strikes me as being a very unjust and uncircumspect action - just consider the comments by this user above. As stated in the History page, a further edit is being considered to reconcile opposing viewpoints. Ramayan 19:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ramayan, please do <b>not</b> "take the liberty" of removing the delete tag. As the tag itself says:

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article has serious problems, most notably in the controversy section... which should be relabeled criticism and be expunged of the subtle attempt to justify the main text of the article while making it appear to be a counterpoint.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have been disappointed with Ramayan's approach. I have attempted to make the article NPOV and have added a criticism section which he has continually deleted or alterered. He (I'm assuming a 'he') has failed to understand NPOV and it irritates me no end that he puts such advertising gumph and cobblers on wikipedia. That said, there appears to be people who believe in this stuff and therefore we need to include it in a comprehensive encyclopaedia. It just needs to be written properly. Come on Ramayan, you have got my vote to 'keep', so if it kept, let's work together to have a neutral article? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 22:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Lots of people care about horoscopes, and an article about methods surrounding them is encyclopedic. I would, however, keep NPOV for the 'controversy', because I don't think there's much question that horoscopes are entertainment, not science. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 04:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I appreciate the group spirit of administrators and members of Wikipedia and the apparent consensus to keep this article. I´ve entered a new version of the article, with a bit more elaboration on theory and also the original criticism by Maustrauser but with a section offering a rational reply. Hopefully this meets the standards of NPOV. Your comments are welcome on talk page or to insert factual changes in article <i>as per</i> your best judgement. Thanks.

<p>Hi, I am the editor of the article on Dr. Holla. I know there were and are so many doctors. But not many like him even in these days in many countries. In the 1970s when medical facilities in villages were often almost nonexistent in India, he would provide the best possible care given his education, equipment and fees he would take. Most of all, he would keep case-histories when I see even in 2006 not many doctors in the developing world keep any case history of any patient.</p>
<p>I appreciate it very much if Dr.Holla page is not deleted.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - it is generally accepted here at WP that skillfulness is a criteria for notability, and this is overriden by lack of skill only in famous cases, such as <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Moussambani_e70f.html" title="Eric Moussambani">Eric Moussambani</a>. Unless this fellow is well known because of his lack of skill, or is a celebrity, skill is an important criteria.

<li>Change my vote to <b>keep</b>. On reflection there are enough Christian novels that the history of them should be interesting enough to deserve an article.

There are various farm and animal related activities referring to a Norrie Maclaren living in Scotland, consistent with the interest in gardening prominently mentioned in the article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: "Assistant to Stanley Kubrick" is NOT the same as "Assistant Director": the former job is more of a gofer than a technician's job. If you have <i>The Shining</i> on DVD, check the credits again under the former title, not the latter. Kubrick's assistant while he was making <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> got a credit (and if you're wondering why I would remember such a thing, it's because he {Leon Vitali) gets mentioned in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Modine_b415.html" title="Matthew Modine">Matthew Modine</a>'s <i>Full Metal Jacket Diary</i> -- which I just read -- and I spotted his name in the credits).</dd>

<p>How is this purely vanity? Someone must have had some serious sour grapes to consider this page, which is informative and one of the few sources of information on this "fad" purely in vain to the organizers. If that's the main objection limit the off going links.</p>

<p>This organization exists in the real world and has had press coverage. The San Francisco Chronicle article, which is linked to at the end of the page, would seem to clearly indicate that Pillow Fight Club is of interest to those outside the organziation.</p>
<p>This is TOTALLY valid!</p>
<p>I agree this is interesting to some and not a harmful entry. Please keep this entry here(JB, 2/15/06).</p>
<p>Someone must be really vengeful and spiteful to want this page removed. There is no other reason. I think the support for this page speaks for itself. If it's deleted, I'll probably stop using Wikipedia altogether, since its whole foundation would be flawed and its name a fraud. ---</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll elect to ignore the psychologizing, and say only that you must have a very skewed idea of Wikipedia to consider deletion of this page constituting 'fraud'.</dd>

Yes, before this event took place the article probably wasn't deserving of a page but now that there existed such an event, that it is imtimately linked with <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_mobs.html" title="Flash mobs">flash mobs</a> which is itself is a legit topic (it would have been an actual flash mob if it was planned covertly), and it has garnered enough notoriety to become newsworthy, I believe makes this topic worthy of inclusion. Its clear it has elevated beyond something that was just made up and I'm sure someone can find the feathers around the ferry building to prove it. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 01:37, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The "event organizers" mentioned in the original post are parties unknown, who seek to remain anon &amp; who make no money or other gain through any aspect of an event.

"Like many others, Davis learned of the pillow fight from a friend who directed her to a Web site -- <b>in her case it was Wikipedia</b> -- that gave details about a planned flash mob pillow fight on Valentine's Day in San Francisco."

<li><b>Comment</b> Your comment reeks of subjective judgement, Mal. First off: what is non-notable? What is your criteria for notability? Seems newsworthiness is not a criteria you'd use, although the topic passes your "good coverage in independent sources" criteria. If it helps any, Google has about 10 articles for the SF pillow fight.<a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=san%20francisco%20pillow%20fight&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?q=san%20francisco%20pillow%20fight&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> Second, if you have content on an article that is promoting or advocating an event, you have an example of POV in an article, which would warrant <i>editing</i>. I will concede that the article outside of the opening section and the external links should probably be deleted, and perhaps the opening needs some editing too. However, you can argue any proper article on an event, say, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Winter_Olympics_f27d.html" title="2006 Winter Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a>, is functioning as promotion as well: all you need is a time and place. It's not the job of the editors to police what the contents of an article is used for by individual users. And the quote does not make it clear that the article was used for the purpose of promotion or as just as a reference. Lets not get into silly authoritarian <i>we need to make an example!</i> sillyness, it's gonna punish Wikipedia users more than the promoters. We on the Keep camp have proposed newswortiness as a criteria for notability, please present your own objective criteria and argue for it. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 05:39, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I already said, all your news articles prove one thing: that in a couple of places people had a couple of flashmobs in the form of a mass pillow fight. This article is a) trying to bulk up those isolated incidents into a global phenomenon and b) trying to turn it into a global phenomenon by using Wikipedia as a promotional tool. As for the Olympics, you might be interested to know that those have been going for decades and receive worldwide coverage from every form of media, and have already become notable without Wikipedia's help. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 13:37, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And it should be clear that I'm not denying that, yet I'm saying that's enough for inclusion within Wikipedia.

<p>First of all, her name should be Satomi Ishihara or Ishihara Satomi in Japanese, not Isihara Satomi. The spelling is wrong. The page for Satomi Ishihara already exists and Ishihara Satomi also redirects to Satomi Ishihara. Also the user categorized the page as Japanese porn stars, which is totally wrong and insulting since she is a popular Japanese idol drama (dorama) actress and has a very clean reputation! The link to that category has already been removed by me before it misleads others. Imperfect information 08:04, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>This sounds like an argument to make it into another redirect, not to delete. If your allegations above are correct, it's a plausible misspelling (plausible defined as "somebody's obviously already done it once"). As for the concern about the categorization, I'd say sofixit but you already have. Either way, that's not an argument for deletion. (By the way, as a regular article page, this should have gone through the Articles for Deletion process, not Miscellany.) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 14:52, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>NOTE FROM THE CREATOR OF THE ARTICLE: I disagree. I've seen it mentioned MANY times on a number of different Internet message boards. Just because you haven't seen it personally doesn't mean it wasn't an Internet phenomenon. It was probably just one that you didn't catch. There are many things on the "Internet Phenomenon" page that were also incredibly minor as well, yet still are on it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please read about <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. The fact you saw it on many boards and concluded that it is a "pheno" does not count in wikipedia. A published reputable source must report is as "internet phenomenon". There are zillions of things in message boards. Like, I see the word "fuck" in tons of boards. But fck it is hardly an intrernet phenomenon. 04:09, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>True, but this was actually a big thing amongst forums. I think you have enough server space to accomdate a coulpe k of information that actually deserves to be up there moreso than some others. The moderators have an awfully fickle opinion when it comes down to what deserves to be included and what doesn't.</p>

<p>No grounds given for notability. Writing a few minor books (only one of which is possessed by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Library_1c04.html" title="British Library">British Library</a> incidentally) and being a retired schoolmaster are not grounds for being included in an encyclopaedia.

<p>Hiya. I created this one... I'm pretty new here, but is it really a problem if I use a few bytes on this? Actually I've only just started this article, there are a whole lot more interesting biographical facts about AKB that I'm going to add, if you chaps will let me - e.g. he was a pupil of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien at Oxford in the 1930's, he taught John Wain (future Oxford Professor of Poetry) at Newcastle High School when Wain was a boy, he was in charge of the RAF cadet unit in which Anthony Benn served in the Second World War, he was a close acquaintance of Alan Bennett when Bennett was setting up the New Vic Theatre in Newcastle... Give me a chance? A hnau</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have to say that I don't think any of these are particularly notable achievements. I'm not trying to discourage you from contributing, but being the pupil or teacher of someone famous, commanding someone famous and knowing someone famous are not really grounds for notability. Many, many thousands of people could claim that. The question is, was he notable <i>in his own right</i> instead of by association? -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 11:01, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again. Thanks for the pointers; I did dive in without really checking the FAQ's, which is poor netiquette so apologies. I've read the links Craig recommended, and have a much clearer idea of the criteria for biographical entries now. Certainly AKB doesn't hit the big, obvious criteria, but there are one or two things which may convince folks to let him stay;</p>
<p>- the basic biographical information is verifiable (starting with the St Edmunds Hall <i>Who's Who</i>)</p>
<p>- his publications likewise are verifiable (Alibris, Abebooks, Internet Book List, getCITED, BookFinder.com all list and/or have for sale one or more of his books, and the BL lists both <i>Circling the Square</i> and <i>Mystery</i> in its catalogue; the Library of Congress lists <i>Circling the Square</i> in its holdings)</p>
<p>- all three of the educational institutions he studied or taught at have their own Wiki articles, so there are places to link to and from him, even if just as an 'Old Boy'</p>
<p>- certainly he has lots of connections as well as the ones I've already mentioned (e.g. he holidayed with Alvar Liddell's family in Devon as a child, his family knew the Jeromes as in Jerome K. Jerome, though I take the point about this not being conclusive)</p>
<p>If this tips the balance, I'd love to carry on adding to the article. A hnau</p>
