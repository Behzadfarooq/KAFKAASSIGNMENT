<p>I just transwikied this to <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a>, another Wikimedia project, which I think is a more appropriate place for it than Wikipedia, a general interest encyclopedia. There's already an article at MA on "The Physics of Star Trek," which is basically a book review. I thought transwikiing the article would make for a nice complement to that article. I also transferred the talk page. If consensus is to delete on Wikipedia, I'd be happy to go back to MA and fix all the red links.

This one, on the other hand, is much more well-written and appears to be a topic of interest to a large audience of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Take a look at the book, which has serious scientist explaining how Star Trek could work or why certain things couldn't work.

<li>Actually, it doesn't. The comment/response format makes it pretty obvious that this is not encyclopedic.

<li>Wrong. The existence of sources <i>does</i> makes this topic suitable for an encyclopaedia article.

<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Delete</b>. Should we add, for every piece of science fiction X, "X and physics"? Of course, almost every piece of science fiction is going to involve scientifically impossible/unlikely elements, scientifically possible/likely elements, and elements whose possibility depends on future physics. Elaborating on this in detail for every piece of science fiction -- or even just major ones like Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. -- is just <i>fancruft</i>.

<li>We should add them if they have been the subject of multiple independent non-trivial published works, and we should not add them if they have not (because doing so where there is no pre-existing source material would be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>). Wikipedia should reflect the subjects that exist in sources. People <i>have</i> written and published non-trivial works about the physics of the Star Trek universe as compared to the physics of this one. Therefore Wikipedia should discuss the subject. They have not (to my knowledge) written and published such works about the physics of (say) the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magic_Goes_Away_95e4.html" title="The Magic Goes Away">The Magic Goes Away</a></i> universe.

<li>The subject has been discussed in multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the authors of the universe, and the article even cites these as sources. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:15, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and <b>eventually merge</b> . Science is important to science fiction (hence the "science" part) therefore it is not fancruft (a discussion of a trivial issue or one peripheral to the topic would be fancruft). A suggestion has been made on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Physics_and_Star_Wars_4504.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Physics and Star Wars">AfD for "Physics and Star Wars</a> to create an article on Physics and Science Fiction.

<li>Hi again, y'all. I've tried to be a really good sport about this article and not mention the f#$cr^&amp;t word or any bias for or against Star Trek. I can't help but think that Trek gets extra-special treatment around here, and that squicks my fundamental ideas of fair play and the rule of law. I personally don't vote to keep articles I happen to like or articles on subjects I like if they grossly violate policy or what a Wikipedia article should be. I even transferred the article and its accompanying talk page to Memory Alpha, which is a Wikia (Wikimedia) project, and I didn't even have to do that. NO KNOWLEDGE WILL BE LOST. I'm starting to think that if this is a no consensus keep, it will need to go straight through AfD after a grace period of one month, and if it is a consensus keep, and I hope it's not, it will have to go to deletion review based on the flimsy evidence given in the keep votes. Honestly, I try to be a nice, reasonable guy, but this kind of thing really makes me wonder. The known laws of physics are do not apply in the TV shows and movies associated with Star Trek. That's not a revelation of any kind. Please, folks, do the right thing. Erik the Rude 11:37, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>the flimsy evidence given in the keep votes</i> — The "flimsy evidence" is not flimsy at all. And it is <i>the article itself</i> that cites sources. <i>Please, folks, do the right thing.</i> — Keeping an article on something that has been the subject of multiple independent published works <i>is</i> the right thing. Wikipedia encompasses human knowledge, and that includes human knowledge about fiction. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Erik, I find your comment somewhat condescending. Why don't you argue policy and guidelines instead of telling us what you will do if this AfD doesn't go your way? The relevant <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">guideline for closing admins</a> says <b>When in doubt, don't delete</b> so I don't think the burden is on the keepers in this discussion. Imho, there's been no convincing argument to delete based on policy. The fancruft essay says that the problems are usually verifiable sources, NPOV, and avoiding OR. None of these seem to be a problem here (though I acknowledge there's not much beyond the one book). I don't think this article is any more marginal than an article on a certain cross-dressing street performer (<a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html#Baton_Bob" title="User talk:Kchase02">remember?</a>).--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 19:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The referenced published book seems adequately notable. Because of the 5-8 editions, it's hard to establish an amazon.com sales rank, but 2 of the editions were ranked between 100,000 and 250,000 at the last check. (It was also available in the last three community libraries where I looked for it — I haven't checked <i>our</i>list of library catalogs to see if the book would be notable if an article were proposed on it.) — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> well written. Sourced. NPOV. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne27</a> 03:33, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I didn't think that you could transwiki things to Memory Alpha, as their license is different from the GFDL. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 22:38, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
