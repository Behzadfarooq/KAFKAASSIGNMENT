<dd><b>Keep!</b> Thank you, Ecophreek, for your support!! I have done everything to re-write this article and to conform to policy standards, with help. Those who frown on self-published or POD books are simply biased and have no reason to be heard here. I thought the purpose of Wiki was to write factual articles in a upfront factual way. And to comment on content and writing as opposed to judging whether someone or their work is 'notable' or not. These books are available in bookstores and online and one has been recognized as entirely notable by your standards, since it has been picked up to be re-published as a special edition by a traditional publisher and has also garnered the interest of a respected film producer. People who downplay the importance of self-published works obviously have no idea where a large percentage of the great literature in the world has come from. Mark Twain and a number of other respected authors have started this way. If you delete this article on the basis that the book was first self-published, then you will have to delete articles on other authors who self-published, such as Mark Twain (Huckleberry Finn), Irma Rombauer (The Joy of Cooking), John Grisham (A Time to Kill), James Redfield (The Celestine Prophecy) Beatrix Potter (Peter Rabbit Classic Series), Whitman (Leaves of Grass), Jack Canfield and Mark Hensen (Chicken Soup for the Soul), Margaret Atwood, Tom Clancy, Deepak Chopra, D.H. Lawrence, Edgar Allan Poe, T.S. Elliot, George Bernard Shaw, Virginia Woolf and more. Regardless, I can't educate the biased uneducated on the subject of literature because honestly you really have no idea what you are talking about, but I will defend that the Whale Song (novel) article has been edited now and is no different from other author pages listed on Wikipedia. And that is all that should matter.(<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECherylktardif_fdb6.html" title="User:Cherylktardif">Cherylktardif</a> 22:34, 5 August 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: My vote to keep was accompanied by a request for a citation concerning the statement that <i>Whale Song</i>, when published in 2003, "captured the interest of a leading Canadian film producer". The first citation provided, from the publisher's website, speaks of a "much-talked-about screenplay"; no producer is mentioned. The second citation, also from the publisher's site, is a word for word repetition of the claim ("captured the interest of a leading Canadian film producer") and provides no further information. In all fairness, the citations provided give no indication that "the book is to be turned into a movie". Furthermore, ghits for this "much-talked-about screenplay" (again, to be fair, the words of the publisher) appears to be limited to blogs and sites associated with the author. I suggest that this issue might be remedied by including citations to at least one trade journal (<i>Quill &amp; Quire</i> or, perhaps, a film publication). The name of the "leading Canadian film producer" should also be included.--<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 17:18, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately none of you understand how the movie industry works. When you submit a screenplay (and mine is in their hands now), most screenwriters will sign a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement. This protects the producer from having their projects stolen until they have committed to it financially and are ready to release that info. So I am simply not authorized to release the name of said producer. My publisher on the other hand is fully aware of the arrangements between me and this Canadian producer as Kunati initially wanted movie rights and I could not give it to them. It has been documented all over the internet that a screenplay was in the works and that a producer requested it. I won't jeopardize my chances at a movie over a request for a citation that you deem viable. There already is a web link that backs up my claim. If this producer releases me from the agreement, their company name will go up immediately.(<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECherylktardif_fdb6.html" title="User:Cherylktardif">Cherylktardif</a> 15:41, 8 August 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Assertion aside, I do happen know something of what I speak when it comes to the film industry. A great many novels come under consideration by producers - sadly, few are accepted and the public is never the wiser. Were it not for the claims of a young, as yet untested publishing company, and those of the article's subject, we would know nothing of this possible project. Ms Tardif is justifiably proud that her book has attracted attention from the world of film, but her claim is unverifiable. I expect that in the happy event the novel is optioned, there will be a major press release. These things are always more than trumpeted on company websites and in <i>Quill &amp; Quire</i>, the Canadian journal of the publishing trade. Until the time the claims can be verified, I respectfully recommend that references to the unidentified "leading Canadian film producer" and his request that Ms Tardif produce a screenplay be deleted.--<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 23:59, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
