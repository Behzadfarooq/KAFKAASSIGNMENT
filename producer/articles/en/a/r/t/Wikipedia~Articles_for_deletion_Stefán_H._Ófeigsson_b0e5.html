<dd>6 of those votes (since you're counting anonymous votes) state reasons that have nothing to do with the notability of the subject as such ("it has only caused trouble", "it's harmful to the Icelandic Wikipedia", "it will undermine the image of the site", "it's indecent"). I also think it's quite discourteous of you to place your comment above everyone elses (rather than in ascending time order) in <b>bold</b> as if what you have to say on the matter was somehow much more important than what everyone else has to say about it. —<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason">Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason</a> 14:02, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I accidentally counted a anonymous vote, this has now been corrected. You are probably leaving it out on purpose but 4 of those 7 votes say that the article is <i>unneeded</i>, additional two votes are from users who have made it perfectly clear that they think this is an unencyclopedic subject (one of those users is me). This comment is not a answer to a specific vote so it makes most sense to place it at the top. I am the one who started the vote now, am I not allowed to amend my original message as new information appears, am I not? The comment is bolded to draw attention to it, the fact that another language version of this article is being voted on is quite significant whatever your opinion on it is. --<a href="../../../b/i/e/User%7EBiekko_f159.html" title="User:Biekko">Bjarki</a> 14:20, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Is the fact that it was prematurely started reason enough to abandon the whole idea of getting third party input on the matter? Might it not be advisable to refactor the page and try again? One might conclude that your refusal for a vote on meta is due to the wider community being in favor of keeping the article. —<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason">Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason</a> 15:16, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Several users, including Biekko agreed that a <i>binding vote</i> should take place on meta to decide the future of the article, without any mention of a local vote being held first. Biekko later made a post that began the current vote where he stated (yet again, this time direcly and not by a vote) that a binding vote should be held on the Icelandic Wikipedia <i>first</i> and and only in the case of the result of that vote not being <i>clear</i> would a vote on meta be held. The terms of the vote <a href="http://is.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spjall%3AStef%C3%A1n_H._%C3%93feigsson&amp;diff=70475&amp;oldid=70463" class="external autonumber" title="http://is.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spjall%3AStef%C3%A1n_H._%C3%93feigsson&amp;diff=70475&amp;oldid=70463" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> were later modified by another user to state that whatever the majority decided to do with the article (options being <i>keep</i> and <i>delete</i>) would be the outcome of the vote. So the only way I see this ending in a vote on meta is if the vote were to end in a tie.</dd>
<dd>I haven't voted in the Icelandic vote because I think that a vote on meta should be held as was the original <i>binding</i> agreement. I don't consider it the private matter of individual Wikipedia editions to decide whether articles on certain topics which are clearly considered notable on the biggest Wikipedia edition should be included. This is not a case of the Icelandic Wikipedia merely having such extreme standard on notability either, it doesn't, we have tens of articles on subjects much less notable than this one, this is a case of selective enforcement on one subject. Furtheremore when people are listing <i>harmful to the project</i> as their reasons for deleting something that in my opinion is something that warrants a project-wide opinion. —<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason">Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason</a> 14:56, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>5 people had voted in favour of the meta solution when you started the vote there, 9 people have voted in the local elections thus acknowledging it. It surprises me that you are such a huge formalist all of the sudden that you are speaking about "binding" agreements on wikipedia! on the basis of 5 votes! I did not foresee that the vote on meta could possibly continue and in any case it would be very time consuming to translate the debate so I sought to end it without outside involvement and the community agreed. You may think votes like "this is damaging the project" are worthless and I would agree with you if it was about controversial but obviously significant material but this is not it, it is my sincere believe that this is tabloid stuff with no encyclopedic value at all. With that I must say that I do understand and respect your point of view, I simply disagree. This is nothing personal, you have made the Icelandic Wikipedia into what it is and I hope you will keep up the good work, I will continue to support you in doing good things as I have done in the past.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../b/i/e/User%7EBiekko_f159.html" title="User:Biekko">Bjarki</a> 02:10, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you think it has no encyclopedic value at all why did you propose that it be deleted but stated that you'd accept the removal of the criminal case, the image and "preposterous categories" (presumably the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Category%7ERapists_0a6b.html" title="Category:Rapists">rapist</a> and/or science web categories) as a compromise? One can only assume that you do think the subject is notable but are uncomfortable with having certain information in the article. Since I think the subject itself is notable (and would be with or without the criminal case) I originally wrote an article article on it with the same goals that I have when writing any other article, to explain the topic in question from a fair and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. To write an article on this man and not include what he's arguably most notable for would would be biased an unneutral.</dd>
<dd>Regarding my future with the project (iswiki) I don't think I'll continue to contribute to it. The only reason I ever did was with the goal helping create a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free</a>, unbiased and neutral information resource. Although I do realize that I could continue to make uncontroversial edits there — which I dare say applies to all of my approximately 13,000 edits save for around two <a href="../../../d/o/z/Dozen.html" title="Dozen">dozen</a> on this topic — I belive that an encyclopedia needs articles on controversial topics as well. This article is unanimously (save for the nomination) considered notable enough to exist on the English Wikipedia and I consider it a major flaw and a severe sign of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> that the Icelandic Wikipedia doesn't consider this a subject that it can have an article on, especially considering that this is a matter local to Iceland which, all other factors being equal, should work in its favor on the Icelandic Wikipedia and against it on the English one. —<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason">Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason</a> 09:40, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Keeping the article but removing the references to the rape case would be a lousy solution, I suggested that as a <b><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Compromise" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Compromise">compromise</a></b> like adult people sometimes do while trying to reach an agreement on something. --<a href="../../../b/i/e/User%7EBiekko_f159.html" title="User:Biekko">Bjarki</a> 20:10, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> The article is a biographical article on Stefán H.

He holds a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s_degree.html" title="Master's degree">masters degree</a> (MSc) in space engineering (one of the few, if not the only Icelander to hold such a degree). He has played an instrumental role in investigating the possibility of Iceland joining the European Space Programme for which he received approximately US$7,000 (450,000 ISK) funding in 2003 from Tæknisjóður (now Rannís, The Icelandic Centre for Research <a href="http://www.rannis.is/english/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rannis.is/english/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The man is 28 years old, he received a grant for his ESA project, a project has not given any results so far and will probably not continue now. A university degree is hardly enough for a Wikipedia article, even if it is a rare one.</i></dd>

It was covered on the front page of <i>DV</i> the third most widely distributed newspaper in Iceland with ~17% market share and on the opening fold (page 2) of <i>Fréttablaðið</i> (<i>The Newspaper</i>), the most widely distributed newspaper in Iceland (~65% market share).<br />
<br />
When the case was at its peak, 7 of the 20 highest ranking queries in <i>Ebmla</i>, an internet search engine run by <i>Morgunblaðið</i> (<i>The Morning Paper</i>), the second most widely distributed newspaper in Iceland with ~45% market share whose website <a href="http://www.mbl.is" class="external text" title="http://www.mbl.is" rel="nofollow">mbl.is</a> ranks as the second most visited website in Iceland <a href="http://www.teljari.is/sv" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.teljari.is/sv" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, were directly related to the case.

<dd>This is not a greater coverage than the average rapist is likely to get. DV names the person and blow their face all over the cover, Fréttablaðið often mentiones the person by name and perhaps includes a small picture, Morgunblaðið reports about the verdict but does not reveal the identity of the person except in homicide cases. All of this is the "standard procedure" of the Icelandic media, there is nothing special about this case.

<dd>All these things add up to notability:

<li>Having a master's degree in a rarely practiced scientific field.</li>
<li>Media coverage of the criminal case which was farabove the avarge of the typical criminal case. This also is a great example of how Icelandic media covers its criminals.</li>

<dd>I don't think having a Master's degree and essentially no publications makes one a noteworthy scholar. Throughout the discussion I have seen numerous references to his being the only or one of the only Icelanders to hold such a degree and no supporting citation or reference of this fact, so I think basing decisions on that fact is questionable. From what I have been able to find, he was a minor functionary in a government-sponsored technological and economic development agency who was working on proposals for cooperation with the ESA.</dd>
<dd>If the guy's notability derives from his work, as many claim above, can someone find something published about him prior to the rape scandal? So far, we just have (1) that he was recorded in the census and (2) a line-item in a government report that confirms he got a grant for his project.</dd>
<dd>I think the substance of the article betrays a lack of perspective on encyclopedic scope: Someone's house got egged? Some Q&amp;A items were removed from a website? --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 20:57, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. There's nothing notable about his career or crime, at least the article and sources don't claim that he is. The smallness of a country doesn't make its citizens individually more notable - his B.Sc. degree is not notable by itself, even if it is in rocket science. The only other thing that could make him notable is the rape case. Since we are not in the business of listing everyone in the world who whas been sentenced for a crime, that doesn't make him notable either, even if it appeared on "front pages of Icelandic newspapers". Slovenia is nearly 10 times as big as Iceland is, and I have written for and appeared in newspapers and on national TV. My name was even used once in a crossword in Delo, our national newspaper. That alone doesn't make me notable. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 16:23, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
