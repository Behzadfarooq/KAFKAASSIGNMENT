<dd>Reading the sources through though. The hansard entry is the text of the local MP's speach about the 2004 positive changes at the radio station, the ABA's release is just an announcement of awarding them a broadcast licence and the speech reported is just a duplicate, on the speaking MP's website, of the same speech given in parliment - exactly what is expected of a local MP to promote local issues.

<li>No, notability is being the subject of multiple <i>reliable</i> sources, not multiple <i>notable</i> sources. The Sunbury newspapers have a circulation of about 47,000 each, but even if that's not considered notable (and once again, we don't have a guideline on this), they're published by <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Limited_72a3.html" title="News Limited">News Limited</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fairfax_Holdings_dbd9.html" title="John Fairfax Holdings">John Fairfax Holdings</a> respectively - so as reliable as the <i>Herald Sun</i> and <i>The Age</i> for sources. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 04:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak delete</b> the rules just don't work well in dealing with very different sized places: the two LI newspapers that were (probably correctly) deleted have a larger circulation than any small town paper, and I would certainly vote to keep an article on the only paper in even a very small town. But in any case the requirements for N as a source are less than N as an article, and here the two papers are actually independent, for that is not always the case.. But we are discussing the radio station, and the problem is that most radio station stubs basically give only directory information, and never develop further. So if its really a stub, and you do intend to add more &amp; think you can find it &amp; source it, come back when you have. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:02, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, I’m afraid I don’t understand. I get the feeling you are either avoiding or not understanding the arguments and the issue at hand. Let me rephrase things to make it crystal clear:</dd>
<dd>WP:Bio states that a sportsman should be considered as notable if he or she <i>...performs at the highest level...</i>. I, and many others here argue that being picked to play for one's country on an international level (such as FIFA world cup or UEFA competition qualifiers) and especially against the likes of Germany, France, Ireland and so on, constitutes <b>that highest level</b>.</dd>
<dd>Now you obviously disagree with that. And fair enough, that might be your opinion. However, still in your opinion, and especially as a self confessed <b>potential future administrator</b>, what constitutes <b>that highest level</b> of achievement in a football player? In other words what should a football player need to have achieved in order <b>for you</b> to consider him or her as notable? Not in a community worker as you refer to above, (or in any other profession at hand) <b>but in a football player.</b> I expect you to have an opinion if you’ve taken the trouble to vote in this discussion. <i>(Also would you be kind enough to paste your reply in chronological order. ie below this paragraph and not above it)</i>Georgeg 23:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think there are some rules we all have to respect. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says exactly for players who have played for <b>fully proffessional league</b>. Cyprus is not a fully professional league and not only that, we are talking for a very weak championship, by which having just a participation in that league can not at all be considered notable. The level in Cyprus is generally low and not only the championship but the national team as well is very weak, one of the weakest in Europe. Getting the pride to play for such national team, can not be considered notability since, playing for such a national team cannot considered notability. This is not my POV, but however the rules in WP:BIO do not refer about national team participation, since if there was a notability by playing for national team, it would have been refered in WP:BIO. By saying highest level it does not mean playing with national team. Because national team have even, Cyprus, Faroe, Bagladesh, Somalia. It is natural that media in a report for a match will refer about player's name since he played in that match but however to be international can not be considered notability.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Highest level means by playing in Champions League or UEFA Cup groups, in a semi final or final of those competitions or playing in World Cup or European Championship. If he does that, even if he played for APOEL, then yes means that player is notable. I think if you want international appearances to be included, then change WP:BIO. But rules will be violated if that too non-notable player will be included.</dd>
<dd>I also recommend you to take a look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Football_Clubs_c635.html#Current_squad" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Football/Clubs">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Football/Clubs#Current_squad</a>, for which players must be wikilink to have their own article. It says, (Current squad of the club. Players should only be wikilinked if notable enough to merit their own article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, a semi-pro club would often have a few players whose earlier careers fit WP:BIO, so there would have some players wikified (e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Albans_City_F.C._0754.html" title="St Albans City F.C.">St Albans City F.C.</a>). APOEL fit this definition and Makrides deserves to be wikified (and have an article). <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtVandelay13_daad.html" title="User:ArtVandelay13">ArtVandelay13</a> 22:45, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment for KRBN</b> KRBN, I would suggest you read <b>the whole</b> (and not just stick to the beginning) of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> paragraph for sports people. At the very end of the paragraph it clearly states that apart from playing in a fully professional league a player can be considered notable if he performs <b>at the highest level</b>. Now I have not noticed anyone in this discussion claim that every <a href="../../../a/p/o/APOEL_780e.html" title="APOEL">APOEL</a> player deserves a wiki article, because as it stands they might not. You seem to repeatedly overlook that <i>the argument here rests on Makrides’ achievements on the international stage</i> and not with his career in APOEL.</dd>

<dd>So would you be kind enough to clarify this for me: are you suggesting that 24 caps for the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_national_football_team.html" title="Cyprus national football team">Cyprus national football team</a> is not a notable achievement?

<p><b>Comment</b> StephP, what is the achievement? To play for a national team such as Cyprus??????????????? Cyprus may have got few good results in the last 2 of three matches, suprizes can happen howeverdon't forget how was this national team doing the last years (beating only san marino, malta and andorra). By saying that Cyprus is one of the weakest in Europe, I don't mean it is same level with Andorra. Highest level I don't mean only champ.League and Uefa Cup but also final rounds of World Cup, Euro etc.. Highest level sure are the world cup and euro final rounds and sure are much lower level (that's right cannot be defined as highest level) their qualification rounds by having teams such as Burkina Faso or Cyprus. However, I am asking you the same question, who told that highest level is just to play with national team, eventhought if this national team is Andorra or Cyprus. As about <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Valentine_f84b.html" title="Ryan Valentine">Ryan Valentine</a>, he is not having an article just because he plays for Wales NT rather that he plays for a fully professional league such as the English. Because of this, I have no right to purpose him for deletion since he satisfy the rules of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Of course you will tell me, Wrexham sure is weaker than APOEL, however, it is fact that plays in a fully professional league. If you are aksing my POV, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should have strengthen the rules of inclusion of footballers and such players, even if they are Ryan Valentine, shouldn't be even there and I would like to purpose him for deletion, however the rules are rules, anad we all must respect them in both cases about Makrides and Ryan Valentine. As for Kaiafas, despite I believe that you understand why he is considered notable, I refresh your mind that he is notable, since he won the European Golden Boot, which means top goal scorer of Europe. Becoming a European winner, there is no doubt about the notability of any player.</p>

<dd>i am sorry KRBN, but to me you seem to contradict yourself. On the one hand you claim that Makrides does not meet WP:BIO criteria. On the other hand Kaiafas who (as illustrated in my previous entry) meets less of the same criteria by your definition, apparently deserves an exception due to the golden boot award. Unless I am missing something somewhere there is absolutely no reference in WP:BIO of golden boots (or any other award as a matter of fact) being a notability criterion. Don’t get me wrong, I think that Kaiafas was a great player and should never be considered for deletion, however you have to admit that by your own definitions so far, he does not meet your or WP:BIO’s notability criteria.</dd>

<dd>And yes, I agree with you. Cyprus is not the strongest football side in the world, but it is in the top 40% (73rd out of 206) of this planet. You’ve made it obvious that this is no achievement in your books but like it or not, Cyprus certainly competes at the highest level by most other editors’ opinion. So to answer your question with the thousand question marks, <b>yes</b>, I think 24 caps at international level is an admirable achievement. Unfortunately the meaning of <b>highest level</b> is not clearly defined in WP:BIO so we could go on and on and on as to what you or I think it represents. I guess we will just have to wait and see what the administrators think.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephP_6b99.html" title="User:StephP">StephP</a> 03:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't contradict myself at all. Kaiafas winning the golden boot, he became top scorer of Whole Europe!!! This is too strong reason to be called notable. Also if you want to compare those players, Kaiafas awarded in Uefa Jubille Awards as the best Cypriot footballer ever! And yes, becoming in the top of Europe is a great reason to be considered highest level Having capacity of 24 appearance with a weak nationalt team in friendlies and qualification rounds can not be compared for what Kaiafas had achieved. I will not have problem if you put that article also for deletion because it will be sure not deleted. Another last point, Imagine if any player who is international is considered notable; Andorra may have hundred footballers, same for Malta even if they play in the worst level of football and even may be someone has just one appearance.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Since I have commented on several recent AfDs of academics, and this may be a confusing issue: I have no connection to the "David Epstein" who wrote the "web of lies" article referenced by this article. Certainly Bradford seems non-notable from an academic point of view but the part of the article that leaves me undecided about his notability as a whole is the "frequent commentator in local and national media" paragraph. A shorter article that emphasises that part and mentions but does not go on at such length about his academic career would seem an improvement. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 23:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> probably notable as a professor, since I did succeed in documenting the PhD thesis and at least 13 law review articles-- this is a respectable N publication record in law, being more than one per year, regardless of anything else. But certainly seems notable as a fraud. We need someway of mentioning that this has become the subject in many conservative blogs or the sort we do not use for sources, because the use they are making of this case is part of the notability <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:33, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Frankly, I don't perceive the giant problems with WP:V that you do. It's unfortunate that the Indystar link you removed has gone dead, but it's still available from archive.org, and even if it wasn't, the key information is still confirmed in the "Web of Lies" article. On the most damaging point, the alleged embellishing of his military record, the WP:V sourcing is solid. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 19:35, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A product or service is notable if it meets <i>any</i> of the following criteria:<br />
1) The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations <i>except</i> for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media re-prints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about its products or services, and advertising for the product or service. Newspaper stories that do not credit a reporter or a news service and simply present company news in an uncritical or positive way may be treated as press releases unless there is evidence to the contrary.</li>
<li>Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as simple price listings in product catalogues.</li>

<li>Are you arguing that every product which is reviewed by places like CNET should get an article? They review thousands of products. I think it is arguable that a particular product should be covered only if it is particularly iconic and unique - the iPod, for instance - and certain Bose products might qualify. This, on the other hand, is just a line of home theater setups, of which there are many. Is this stuff so unique and different that it needs an article? And yes, you are right, there is lots of "Applecruft", and some of it should be removed - not all Apple products are notable. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> having a PR department to generate product reviews does not make a product notable. Where is the press stating that this product had a cultural impact such as Ipod?-<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsHyde_99ac.html" title="User:MsHyde">MsHyde</a> 17:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>So only the iPod and the walkman should be listed, since it had a "cultural impact"? That is not the official stance from wikipedia where it states that, if it is "<i>the subject of multiple non-trivial, reliable published works whose source is independent of the organization itself, and fulfills the verifiability guidelines, then it is considered notable.</i>" -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 20:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The notability guidelines are <i>guidelines</i>, not rules, and the "multiple non-trivial, reliable published works" part in particular should, I feel, frequently be ignored. It works best as a minimal requirement. I'm sure I can find multiple independent and reliable reviews of quite literally <i>thousands</i> of products. We have to use our common sense here. I think the rough criteria should involve the number of people this product impacts, the uniqueness of the product, the cultural impact, and such. I would be far more impressed with a news article about how these Bose products have changed people's lives. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 21:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that you can even say that an iPod did that. Going with your criteria I believe that only medical or human assisting technology's could qualify. Its not like a iPod could cause someone to breath like an Iron lung, or an entertainment system allowed someone to walk again! Notability is why we have <a href="../../../h/p/_/HP_LaserJet_2400_6911.html" title="HP LaserJet 2400">HP LaserJet 2400</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_n_Series_47f0.html" title="Dell n Series">Dell n Series</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Inspiron_fa02.html" title="Dell Inspiron">Dell Inspiron</a>, <a href="../../../h/p/_/HP_series_80_1a2e.html" title="HP series 80">HP series 80</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macromedia_JRun_8a1d.html" title="Macromedia JRun">Macromedia JRun</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_HDR-FX7_716d.html" title="Sony HDR-FX7">Sony HDR-FX7</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Creative_Suite_039b.html" title="Adobe Creative Suite">Adobe Creative Suite</a> etc, etc... and this was only after a quick search!

<li>I completely agree with you that most of those should not have Wikipedia articles. The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_n_Series_47f0.html" title="Dell n Series">Dell n Series</a> might be notable due to not shipping with Windows. I feel quite certain that the iPod could pass the test I suggested; there have been any number of articles on its social, cultural, and business impact. I also think certain products could pass just due to the ubiquity of their advertising; the Bose "Wave" for instance - what human being in the US has NOT seen one of their magazine ads? OK, some haven't, but a minority, I'm sure... --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 09:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well my point was that they shouldn't be deleted, but thats besides the case. I also think that the Wave systems should have an article but how can they pass with your criteria of life changing products? Now the main reason for this article is to make sure that the official Bose company page is not too large. Because if this was removed they would have to be placed in the main page and just clutter it up. To alleviate this an article was made. This is not an uncommon practice and due to the several 100's of thousands of reviews available on the net I don't think this is too uncalled for. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 09:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't say that a product needed to be life-changing to have an article, I said I would be more impressed with that sort of thing than with reviews. I also disagree that this would add too much content to the Bose article, primarily because I don't see any actual useful content. What should be kept? The pricing? The information about what module does what? I can boil this down to one sentence: <i>Bose also sells home theatre systems which use their ADAPTiQ audio calibration system.</i> That's it, you're done. That's all the encyclopedaic content I see here. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:59, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article is wrong in that the error analysis presented is not rigorous. It says that the error in f(x) is the derivative f' times the error in x raised to the second power. This is a decent error estimate except that you shouldn't raise the error in x to the second power. However, it is not rigorous; a rigorous error analysis would yield a <i>bound</i> on the error, not an <i>estimate</i>.</p>

However, there is nothing left after removing the wrong parts. I don't know what an article "rigorous error analysis" could be about and I don't think that I should write the article just to get some wrong information removed from Wikipedia. Surely, the phrase is used, but in my experience it means just "a error analysis that is rigorous".</p>

<dd>If a notable minor rock star had become a painter and gotten some attention for that, an image of one of his paintings would be relevant, even though he made money from his art. I see no fundamental difference here. The caption should be brief and neutral, of course.</dd>
<dd>One of the issues in the no-consensus AFD for <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Shaw_Brown_310c.html" title="Richard Shaw Brown">Richard Shaw Brown</a> was people's inability to find the profile of him in the International Herald Tribune -- unsurprisingly, considering that it had both the wrong title and the wrong date. I did find it in ProQuest Newsstand and corrected the citation. It's all about the gemology, mentioning the band only briefly. There were several other articles mentioning his work as a jeweller/gemologist as well; I have no problem believing there'd be more if I had better access to Thai publications. The section certainly needs cleanup, but it's notable within the context of his life. <font face="Trebuchet MS, Trebuchet"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 01:10, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> - I hereby change my vote from "delete" to "merge". *Sigh*. I thought Brown's notability stopped with his career as a rock artist, but that is because at first he presented himself to be the draft dodgin' psychedelic with a story to tell. The main problem was a lot of his sources were self-published and those that were not, as Celithemis mentions above, were poorly cited; therefore difficult to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a>. After communicating with <a href="../../../r/s/b/User%7ERsbj66_69c2.html" title="User:Rsbj66">Brown</a> and re-researching the sources presented by <i>him</i>, it is now my opinion that Brown is more interested in promoting his current career as a gemologist.

<p>Most of this is original research and unsourced. List items are based on subjective judgment by editors as to the supposed atheistic nature of movies, books, etc. List criteria are vague, poorly defined, and overbroad, making the list an indiscriminate collection of information. In any case, a list of atheists in fiction ought to begin as a subsection of the main List of atheists. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 05:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I started the page, and I'd like to point out that Wikipedia already had a Category:Fictional atheists before I made my page. Why didn't that get deleted? I incorporated all names in that Category list. It's a good page, but I admit that I list some works in the first few sections that can be removed. Still, if you have 'List of fictional jews' and 'list of fictional catholics', you can have a fucking list of fictional atheists. And no, to address the question above, you can't just list a character if he/she never expressed belief in god- you have to cite an example of the char. saying something atheist or the like.</li>

<dd>If you guys delete this page while allowing 'list of fictional catholics' or 'list of fictional jews', it'll seem like Wikipedia is biased against atheism. Why allow those two pages if you aren't going to allow mine? Because fictional atheists aren't relevant enough?</dd>

<li><b>Keep if properly sourced.</b> This is the kind of thing that during CfD we tend to say "delete category and listify". If every name on the list is properly referenced with an external source identifying the character as an atheist, then it can stay. Don't just pick sources that interpret the characters as atheist. We need to know that the original source of the characters clearly identify them as such.

<li>I was under the impression that for something to be verifiable, it means that a person can go look in a book or other media and see that the info is true. On the page, I claim that certain characters say certain things in episodes of certain shows- a person reading it could go check for themselves if they wished. So why do I need to link to the proof for it to be verifiable? It's not like every fact in every article of Wikipedia has a cite to go along with it- some info is just stated, because the author knows people can go find the support for the info in a book or other media. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewdt85_00b5.html" title="User:Andrewdt85">Andrewdt85</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrewdt85_762c.html" title="User talk:Andrewdt85">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andrewdt85_6192.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andrewdt85">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I reiterate that the primary grounds for deletion is the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> content of the article, which is a criterion for deletion in Wikipedia policy. I don't think anyone here has objected to creation of a List of fictional atheists that is not original research and which is well-sourced. There is no double standard. If List of fictional Catholics and List of fictitious Jews were primarily composed of original research, they would be appropriate candidates for deletion too. Merging of the small amount of properly sourced content of the List of Atheist fictional characters with the main <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">List of atheists</a> is in no a way binding precedent for merger of other lists of fictional religious adherents with lists of real-life religious adherents.

<li>Comment: so I see that you deleted the article, even after I removed the OR in the first handful of stupid categories at the top of the page. Fine, then you must now delete the catholic and agnostic fictional character lists. Otherwise, you are favoring non-atheist lists. That wasn't your intention, but that is what you are doing.

<li><b>Delete</b> this version. Way too broad a subject for a list. Steve, above, brings up a good point, but I think that pretty much demands more specific list topics, rather than a blanket "list of skateboarders" which in theory could invite any kid with a board to add their name.

Perhaps a "List of PROFESSIONAL skateboarders" or something like hat could be created. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:59, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I feel a 'List of professional skateboarders' could prove unstable, as there'd be kids putting themselves in because they feel they are pros, and then there'd be others removing their rivals or somesuch... just a loose thought. --<a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOuro_8ad2.html" title="User:Ouro">Ouro</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/u/r/User_talk%7EOuro_6623.html" title="User talk:Ouro">blah blah</a>)</small> 17:50, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It wouldn't be any less stable than other lists about popular subjects.

<li><b>Comment</b> What's with the attitude? The explanation on the list cleary states that there are only professional and amateur skateboarders. You can remove <i>notable</i> if you wish. The list survived vandalism long enough before anyone decided it was a candidate for deletion. Please, if anyone wishes to contribue to skateboarding coverage on Wikipedia, please skateboard at least 5 years before you do so and get educated about the subject.--<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKoRnholio8_c03c.html" title="User:KoRnholio8">KoRnholio8</a> 20:29, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep provided it is restricted properly</b> There may be millions of skateboard users, but only a handful of people will have skateboarding verifiably and notably mentioned in their article (eg professional and amateur competitive skateboarders like <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Hawk_d6da.html" title="Tony Hawk">Tony Hawk</a>). Provided the list is properly restricted to only articles which have referenced, notable comments about the person skateboarding, there's nothing wrong with this list. Also, note that it is quite acceptable to have both a list AND a category, since lists and categories serve slightly different purposes and reader audiences.

<li><b>Comment</b> Such a book would be a small-press, local publication, so I remain neutral on the question of whether the book exists.

<li><b>merge and stubbify</b> but merge the two articles as 90% of the material repeats.

I suggest going instead to <a href="http://uclid.uc.edu/" class="external free" title="http://uclid.uc.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://uclid.uc.edu/</a> and searching for it. There is a discussion of whether to use manuscript sources on the WP:RS discussion page; for this, I do not consider it an RS, but more important it has been guessed that nobody will go to Cincinnati to check the manuscript copy against the aticle.

<li><b>Comment</b> To this anon commenter - local politics in school systems is totally irrelevant! WTF does a local school board have to say about internet content that's not theirs (under their definite/specific jurisdiction). Do they think that they can limit free speech about their schools, especially on a world-wide basis? As long as there's nothing libelous, copyvio, etc., contrary to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a>, it's free game. (And, remember in the US, there's a thing called the U.S. Constitution (See the First amendment), that might just apply). FURTHERMORE, as a reminder - content submitted to Wikipedia is licensed under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a> and need not be removed merely at the request of interested parties.

<dd><b>Comment</b> --Im personally disappointed by the actions of <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">User:DGG</a> as an admin. It seems s/he has suggested that this is a copyvio of the previously mentioned book to the author of the article. Im not an expert, but it seems to me that if this is an <b>a University of Cincinnati unpublished typescript Masters Thesis</b> as stated by DGG, then Wikipedia would have full copyrights under GFDL because User:Aaronl23 chose to use Wikipedia this as his forum to publish verifiable information (versus OR which a Master's candidate wouldn't risk). And a few great pictures to boot. I think this entry should be nominated for a featured article, to quash any AfD debate and to show what a notable school entry should be.<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDUBJAY04_bab5.html" title="User:DUBJAY04">DUBJAY04</a> 06:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's assuming that User:Aaronl23 is the author of the thesis, though. If not, it's still (potentially) a copyvio. It is entirely possible that the user is in fact the author -- I know of 75-year-olds who are conversant with the Internet -- but the writing style does seem rather different from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Augusta_High_School_%28Kentucky%29&amp;oldid=48213735" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Augusta_High_School_%28Kentucky%29&amp;oldid=48213735" rel="nofollow">the earliest version</a> by the same user. I can't consider DGG's suspicions unfounded or his actions (as an admin or otherwise) disappointing -- we absolutely should be using caution when it comes to potential copyright infringements. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 06:39, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do NOT Delete</b>Nicholas Rockefeller is at the center of organizations seeking to require national ID cards, loss of personal data privacy, monitoring and surveillance via special cell phone technologies, and loss of cash as a vehicle of currency exchange among other Big Brother agendas. To refer to him or his activities as "nothing notable" is ludicrous. Of even greater curiosity is the fact that the name of Nicholas Rockefeller is NOT listed among the family tree members of The Rockefeller Family (decendants of John D. Rockefeller) shown at Wikipedia, although Nicholas Rockefeller is a prominent member of many organizations owned or controlled by the Rockefeller family. Who are the parents of Nicholas Rockefeller? When and where was he born? [removed, per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>] Nicholas Rockefeller told Aaron Russo 11 months BEFORE 9-11 that an "event' was soon to occur that would cause the US to invade Afghanistan, then Iraq.

<dd>Comment: The WSJ says, "Nicholas Rockefeller declined to say where in the Rockefeller family he fits. But the family's patriarch, David Rockefeller, said through an associate that he doesn't recall ever meeting Nicholas. The relationship 'is probably quite distant, seventh or eighth cousins,' according to the associate, Peter Johnson." Not quite "absolute zero" but also not quite "documentation", IMHO.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 11:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment: Moderator Thomas Basboll said earlier on this page that "Just being a member of that family would, to my mind, constitute notability." + the page I just mentioned (<a href="http://www.webinaction.com/tcg/team.html" class="external free" title="http://www.webinaction.com/tcg/team.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.webinaction.com/tcg/team.html</a>) asserts that he was the "Managing Partner at RockVest, <b>a Rockefeller family investment vehicle</b>" So.. Rockefeller as surname, and former highranking partner in a Rockefeller family investment vehicle. But no links however to the Rockefeller family? Seems logical. --Rubyscube 02:21, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I had no idea the Faculty Olympics were being held this year at McGill! As a result of this article I have formed a group to challenge McGill's talent in the areas of academics and athletics. Without this page I would not have realized that this opportunity to showcase McGill students' abilities would soon occur. Please keep this site as I intend to refer to it to learn about future developments.</li>

<dd>basically i think you didnt read carefull what i said ok? independent sources doesnt means any information on net, not everything on web is true or Updated information, to post information on encyclopedia the facts need to be checked as in real life not copy and paste . understand CaliforniaAliBaba&#160;? the basic fundamentals of digital Information its 1 and 0, true or false and all information needes to be checked because not every information is true there always noise , if you dont understand advise you to study the theiry of infomation then u might know waht is all about .dont use the copy paste thinking. best regards <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 202.175.101.188 (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.175.101.188.html" title="User talk:202.175.101.188">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.175.101.188_4738.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.175.101.188">contribs</a>) 2007 Feb 10 04:50 UTC.</small>

<dd>Do you understand what is an independent source? Let me define it for you: it is someone who is not working for Jet Asia (e.g. not you the IT manager, and not Chuck Woods the CEO). As I have repeatedly pointed out to you, the independent sources are required by Wikipedia policy for us to verify that your company meets the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">inclusion guidelines for corporations</a>; editors also use independent sources to check the truth or falsehood of information which corporations write about themselves. You continue to complain that the information about in your company's article is false, and that the information in the newspaper articles we have been able to find about your company is also false; well I ask you again, now for the third time, <b>can you point us to true and independent information about your company, whether on the internet, in newspapers, in books, or wherever?</b></dd>
<dd>Or does such information not exist? If not, then there should not be a Wikipedia article about your company; to continue to keep it here would be in contravention of our policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. This is non-negotiable. If you would like to spread truthful information about your company, I would suggest you do so by updating your own website. Or, you may suggest to your public relations department that they contact journalists to inform them of your company's accomplishments and see if they are interested in writing about your company. Per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">policy</a>, Wikipedia is not a publisher of first instance for new information; it is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>, which means it relies on information which has already been fact-checked by other reliable <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary sources</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 07:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Even if you assumed that the article was properly referenced (which it doesn't seem to be) there's the issue that it makes no claims that the appearance of the number 23 in these movies is anything other than sheer random coincidence. Lacking any verifiable connection between these items other than a random number, it's simply a list of random unrelated snapshots. Why restrict this to films, for instance? The number 23 occurs in thousands of places in notable media.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the proposal for deletion is based on a misreading of the article (the band has released music on multiple record labels, one of which is a well known DR label based in Germany, not a single "unknown label"), and uses criteria that have nothing to do with Notability (number of fans) to assert non-Notability. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJeandjinni_32e6.html" title="User:Jeandjinni">Jeandjinni</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/a/User_talk%7EJeandjinni_47fe.html" title="User talk:Jeandjinni">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jeandjinni_a347.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jeandjinni">contribs</a>) 02:30, 10 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I've cleaned up some of the writing and added in <i>five</i> more references. Are <i>eight</i> sources sufficient to satisfy the primary notability criterion (considering other relevant criteria, such as notable cross membership), or what? If not, there are more sources that can be added, but I fear that doing so would make the contestation over this article's notability look rather <i>overwrought</i>, which might reflect unfavourably on its detractors, who are probably well intentioned people that for some reason won't admit that they're <i>wrong</i> about a topic about which they lack basic knowledge. I notice no one's given <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Vanity_Set_cc7a.html" title="The Vanity Set">The Vanity Set</a> or even <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Inkel_9fa1.html" title="Jeremy Inkel">Jeremy Inkel</a> equivalent scrutiny.

<p>Utterly non notable webcomic.

<p>This article, as it is now, along with all the resistance against it being fixed, is very poorly written, it mostly has the anti-feminist backlash as opposed to definitions and history of what the department is... I do not think it is fixable and I suggest this article be deleted and rewritten from scratch. It is an <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttack_page_c5ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Attack page">Attack page</a> as far as I see it, and its history seems to confirm me. <a href="../../../t/o/w/User%7ETowsonu2003_97f3.html" title="User:Towsonu2003">Towsonu2003</a> 19:29, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

There have been occasional problems with (anonymous) POV-pushing, though even most of the text is NPOV (the remaining problem being one of <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">undue weight</a>, and there was an NPOV tag on it until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women%27s_studies&amp;diff=106076718&amp;oldid=106073567" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women%27s_studies&amp;diff=106076718&amp;oldid=106073567" rel="nofollow">the nominator removed it</a>).

<dd><b>Comment</b> I did not remove the tags, I replaced them with db-attack, which turned out to be the wrong tag.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep, and Comment</b> - Towsonu2003 has correctly observed that this article is not well-written and not well-balanced. It's a stub that has been about 70% dedicated to covering criticism of the subject field (from a fairly obvious POV), with only 30% or so of the article dedicated to the subject field itself. This article &amp; other articles in gender studies have been under protracted attention from editors (usually anonymous) who express criticism of the articles, and of the subjects of the articles (e.g., "This article on feminism is really biased, and is clearly written by feminists who hate men; the feminist movement has fostered grave injustices on men and this is one example.) That's a caricature but not much of one: Truly if you follow these discussions there is a lot of ranting about feminism, that is not directed to improving the article as a reference source, but is instead just expressing the editor's frustrations &amp; personal / political views about feminism.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>More seriously, a lot of these editors effectively treat the articles as a battleground. They don't get the <i>encyclopedia article is a reference work</i> angle; instead, they think that an article <i>about</i> women's studies is actually an advocacy piece <i>for</i> the subject. Coming from that perspective, their interactions on Talk pages and their edits are often combative, expressing their view that "equal time" for criticism is the way to express NPOV.</dd>
<dd>However, I disagree with Towsonu2003 on to handle the problem. Towsonu2003 thinks we should scrap &amp; start over. Unfortunately, that's not going to be a good solution, because the instant a new stub is created for women's studies, it will still be a magnet for the critics of feminism who want their voices to be heard on the matter.</dd>
<dd>I think the only way out of this mess is to (a) write the individual articles as they should be written, anyway; not stubs subject to overbalance, but reference pieces with length and depth appropriate to their subject matter. Criticism and alternative views will naturally find a home in such an article, hopefully satisfying the anti-feminists &amp; feminist critics, but more importantly, satisfying the real reference needs of someone trying to understand Women's studies -- the discipline, the political responses to it, and so on. And (b) educating the editors about the purpose of wikipedia, appropriate behavior, what good articles look like, and so on, and crucially, that an article is not an advocacy piece for or against the subject of the article, but a NPOV reference <i>about</i> the subject of the article. This work is incredibly tedious and difficult when people are hostile, but I don't see a way around it.</dd>
<dd>I am trying, now, to work on this one article; to add substantive content that needs to be there, so that it's not just a stub; and so we can integrate the necessary criticism that should be in the article in a way that makes for a useful reference source for someone seeking to understand what women's studies is, its history and context, its ties with political feminism (including how the discipline &amp; movement have affected each other, and how criticism of each has affected the other), and its influence and role in modern cultural studies. I think we should <b>keep</b> the article &amp; would appreciate it if editors of good faith would help think about what the article <i>should</i> look like. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 21:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: AFD is not generally the place to argue article content. I agree that the article is lousy, but the topic is clearly encyclopedic. There is, as far as I can tell, nothing in it that is (for example) so slanderous so that we should delete it so as not to have it in the article history. There is nothing to prevent a complete rewrite without going through any formal process like AFD. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:06, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'm not interested in the article's history so much. I believe that a formal procedure that deletes the article will make it much easier to rewrite it.

Much like the Potter Puppet Pals, AfDed a week or so ago, this is better covered in Neil Cicierega's own article, and indeed a much better version of it is already there.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as per the same argument we brought up the last time this was nominated. This is <b>not</b> just a webtoon, it's a very popular comedy song and was <a href="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd06.1231.html" class="external text" title="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd06.1231.html" rel="nofollow">the top song of 2006 on the Dr. Demento chart by a longshot</a>!

<ul>
<li>Yes, the song did chart and thus passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines. However, this article is rife with original research and unverifiable claims and "trivia"; if edited down only to verifiable facts, this article would have no more content than <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Cicierega_969c.html#The_Ultimate_Showdown_of_Ultimate_Destiny" title="Neil Cicierega">Neil Cicierega#The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny</a> does now, hence why redirecting would be a good solution. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 05:13, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It is a notable internet culture meme. We may as well prod the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a> for AfD, or <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Numa_aede.html" title="Numa Numa">Numa Numa</a>.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and shorten by a lot. It's a notable meme, but the current article's level of detail is hopelessly crufty. --Sneftel 17:29, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete/redirect</b> The animation, while perhaps popular, is not notable. The comparisons (above) to "Star Wars Kid" and "Numa Numa" are inappropriate, as each of the other two internet phenomena have spawned parodies, tributes, etc. This article is basically a vanity page. <a href="../../../j/i/g/User%7EJiggz84_4b74.html" title="User:Jiggz84">Jiggz84</a> 18:36, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>Ultimate Showdown</i> has spawned parodies as well, the most popular among them being <i>The Ultimate Orgy of Homosexuality</i>, but it seems any time someone puts a link up to it or it even gets so mush as a mention, it gets reverted O.o There is also the tribute to it in <i>Destroy All humans 2</i> that's mentioned in the trivia section -- <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmiOfBrie_6b47.html" title="User:EmiOfBrie">EmiOfBrie</a> 18:55, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The only thing is, how credible of a link is the parody of a parody? <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="black">bibliomaniac</font></a><a href="../../../b/i/b/User_talk%7EBibliomaniac15_e27b.html" title="User talk:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="red">1</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bibliomaniac15_b1b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bibliomaniac15"><font color="blue">5</font></a></b></i> 22:09, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This should absolutely have an article. Most <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_memes.html" title="Internet memes">internet memes</a> have articles and this one is well written. It's popular enough to be notable and should stay around 24.107.6.167 06:08, 9 February 2007 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>As <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_popularity" title="WP:N">WP:N#Notability is not popularity</a> describes, though, popularity does not render a subject notable, multiple secondary sources do. It has been established that the artist is notable, and the song charting means it meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and merits a mention on the artist's page. However, no secondary sources have confirmed its notability as an "internet meme" worthy of its own separate article. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 06:56, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sure, I can certainly understand why we appear to lack notableness (the journal is new and lacks content, so, yeah, it is not notable in that regard) but when sociologists see what is developing and examine the editorial advisory board it is more than notable; it is a real powerhouse; it's not that we just have some famous people on board (I know that fame is not notability around here) but tnys.org represents a major convergence of established and emerging intellectuals that rivals anything of its kind. tnys.org is administrated out of a single campus but that's just the administrative unit.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I totally understand why we look like candidates for deletion and, if that's the decision, so be it. Just keep in mind that when a sociologist examines tnys.org it's pretty darned impressive. Thanks. tnys</dd>

<li>TNYS has the makings of what could very well evolve into a respectable journal. And when that happens, Wikipedia should list it. I also see no reason why it can’t be listed now as an organization created with the purpose of creating a journal. My only point is that Wikipedia needs to differentiate between The New York Sociologist published by the New York Sociological Association and TNYS published by Cortland State College. I think Tikiwont’s disambiguation page does just that and I appreciate the effort. I’ll create copy for the NYSSA page. As to how NYSSA and Cortland work out the same title problem, that is not Wikipedia’s concern, so long as we find a way to make the existence of the two efforts clear. The fact still stands that NYSSA is a statewide organization of sociologists that counts among its members, Cortland State College sociology faculty, NYSSA has been holding conferences for 53 years, NYSSA has been developing a journal since 2005 when calls for papers went out, and NYSSA published a peer reviewed journal in 2006. That journal is online. There is no reason to delete an entry referencing it. I suggest two pages: one with “NYSSA” in parenthesis and one with “SUNY Cortland” in parenthesis if the consensus is to not delete that listing. NBeat 02:23, 8 February 2007 (UTC)NBeat</li>

<li><b>Delete both</b>. The The new york sociologist / TNYS (Cortland State College) journal <i>really does</i> have a very impressive advisory board, but has not yet achieved enough notability in its own right. Not surprising since it hasn't launched yet. The The New York Sociologist (NYSSA) journal article is not dissimilar, having only just launched.

<li>Actually there was, but the author created the page with the NYSSA abbreviation in the title. It's now at the correct page. I take the organization's 50-year history as some sort of notability assertion, but other than that the organisation is also borderline notable.

<li><b>weak delete</b> but the key issue for me, is that the journal is <i>not yet published,</i> and acccording to its web site, does not have the first issue scheduled <i>until 2008</i> (as is said in the above discussion) I don't think we have any basis just yet for entering it. From what I've seen here, we wouldn't include any media that far in advance of publication, with no idea yet of what is to be actually included. It's good that you are starting to establish its web presence, but even librarians do not usually think seriously about a journal until it has at least a table of contents for the first issue. Come back then--as I think everyone above has said. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:51, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not notable high school. Jeez, people at least make an effort to make it notable if you must have an article about your school! <a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 15:19, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. My position after long consideration is that high schools (of any substantial size) should be considered <i>per se</i> notable to end the endless debates. These articles are also a good gateway for future contributors. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:02, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Every school is notable to its ex-scholars. There have been bouts of debate about schools pages before. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 17:04, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Newyrokbrad, you could end the endless debates by taking the opposite position as well: every school is non notable unless notability is verifiably demonstrated. This would be equally clear, and would bring schools in line with all other subjects, instead of making an arbitrary exception. As for being a good gateway for future contributors; they are also a good gateway for vandals and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> violations (with comments on individual teachers and co-students). Taking such a principal position as yours only helps in antagonizing those people who feel that schools should not get a special treatment. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>Whatever. We need a policy (I know one is being batted out) and a way to implement it. There are over a hundred similar stub articles for Ohio alone, and it probably run into the thousands for the nation, to say nothing of the rest of the world. In my opinion, a secondary school should either be notable of itself, or else should be subject to speedy deletion if no notability (famous alumni, notable nationally for its sports program, famous or infamous incident took place there) is shown.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 13:08, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This school's recent basketball state championship makes it notable. I vote to keep the article. Not sure why some users in here are quick to nominate for deletion. EagleFan 15:13, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Six years ago? EagleFan, I realize you have an interest in this, since your user contributions reflect that you do almost nothing but create and edit articles about high schools and lists of high schools, but is a six year old championship (and how many champions does Ohio have in a year, how many groups are there?) enough?--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 15:21, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>See my point. Wehwalt, like several others, is on a mission to delete pages rather than add content. That will work against Wikipedia's long-term development into the premier encylopedia in the world. EagleFan 15:41, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh come on, EagleFan, I have nominated perhaps 20 articles for deletion. I have contributed to dozens of times that many articles. Let's not engage in invective.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 00:48, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to encourage everyone here to "assume good faith". It seems to me that we all want Wikipedia to be the best it can be, but we interpret this in different ways and have different talents at the service of the project.

<li><b>KEEP</b>. This article was created as a Stub on 1/26/07 and should be given a chance to gain some traction. Seems like a "Stub" article ought to at least be given a few months before being nominated randomly by another user. EagleFan 20:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> I understood the policy on stubs was to keep them if it appeared possible for them to become an article.

It was reverted to the discussion page of the first episode (very quickly, I might add), which has been ignored for two days. I would like all the episodes to be on one page, or better yet, for them to be on the show's page but that won't happen unless these episodes are deleted.

However, the fact that it was published by <a href="../../../p/u/b/PublishAmerica_23f8.html" title="PublishAmerica">PublishAmerica</a> shouldn't be a reason for deletion; describing them as a "vanity press" is a POV comment, as their article says that they claim to be a "traditional publisher".

<dd>To be perfectly clear: I am not recommending the deletion solely based on the fact that the book is published by PublishAmerica. But there is a total absence of reliable third-party sources on the book and its author. Saying that PublishAmerica is a vanity-press is not really POV by the way: most of the editing world considers PublishAmerica to be akin to a vanity press in the sense that they publish just about anything as the article on the company explains. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 16:58, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What exactly is an independant source? a review of the book prehaps? These can be found on amazon.co.uk. Prehaps the authours page should be deleted as she has only published a single book, but why should the book itself be stigmatised because of the fact that it is written by a currently unknown author. I know for a fact that people have bought the book, and enjoyed the it, so why should it be deleted, I find this grossly unfair. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Martyn1987 (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyn1987_c086.html" title="User talk:Martyn1987">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Martyn1987_a050.html" title="Special:Contributions/Martyn1987">contribs</a>).</small></li>

The article BML Hillen Keene said that Mrs Keene's boyfriend is a Matthew Stenning, although you deleted this information right after posting the above note <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BML_Hillen_Keene&amp;diff=106346055&amp;oldid=106334517" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BML_Hillen_Keene&amp;diff=106346055&amp;oldid=106334517" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. The second review is by "M. Newton" which has no other reviews written on Amazon and wrote the review a mere 12 days after the book's publication. Given that PublishAmerica does not do any promotion for its books, it makes it unlikely that this reviewer is not in some way or another connected to the book's author. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 17:12, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your point? just because they happen to know the authour does not mean that they lied about liking the book or anything else. And you did not in fact answer my question, what is an independant source? Why should this book be stigmatised? This is what you are doing, yes, you have not prehaps read this book, you may not prehaps ever read it, but why should you have the right to disallow someone who has read it and enjoyed it, to share it with others? This site as an infinate amount of space, so one little section devoted to a little known book should really be no skin off your nose. Why are you even bothering about this really? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Martyn1987 (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyn1987_c086.html" title="User talk:Martyn1987">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Martyn1987_a050.html" title="Special:Contributions/Martyn1987">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>You can read all about reliable sources <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">here</a>. I have indeed never read this book, nor do I plan to. However, this debate is not about the book's worth: it could very well be a brilliant piece but as far as anyone can tell, there do not exist any reviews of the book from sources independent of the book's author or publisher and there are no third-party sources about the author and the book fails all of the criteria outlined at <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a>.

<p>I do not see exactly why reveiws of the book are so important, is this supposed to be an information site, or is it not, if looked for it is very obvious that this book is indeed a real book, not a fabrication made up by some random person wanting to mess with this site. It is information on book found enjoyable, and yes, prehaps there are no other reveiws, but these do not really matter. Personally I do not reveiw items that I buy online, does this mean some other person should be stigmatised and not allowed to express how much they enjoy another book? And the fact that the book was published by publish america should not factor in at all, everyone has to start somewhere, every page on this site has to start somewhere. You must give these things time to develop. Also, the Newry Democrat did a piece on this book, I do not know if this can be found online, but I do know that it was done because I happen to own a copy at home. And no, you cannot just say now that just because I own a copy and you cannot find it that I am making this up, because I would have no reason to. besides this I can offer nothing else. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Martyn1987 (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyn1987_c086.html" title="User talk:Martyn1987">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Martyn1987_d3f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Martyn1987">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>You know, this book is a book, there has not been enough time for it to gather the momentum to become a bestseller, and o will probabaly not garner any more reviews. It's not really fair what is being done, but I suppose you will do what you will do. It is a book, I should be allowed to write about it, as everyone here is allowed to write about books on this site. I really don't see why this is realy such a big deal. Reviews should really not matter, when you walk into a shop do you ask the sales person about reviews on a book you wish to buy, no, you read the blurb, which tells you about the book. henchforth, a page that tlls you about this book, not forcing you to buy it in anyway, merely informing you of it, about the characters the plot etc. it doesn't make sense that yo should make such a big deal. but do as you wish. However, if things need tobe proven, how can you prove timetravel, why do you have pages on magic, is magic real, can it be proven? Thi will be my last post, do s you want.</p>

<p>A large-scale terrorist-simulation preparatory exercise in Singapore.

Nothing unexpected happened here - all went to plan.

<p>A supposed poet whose existence is unverifiable. Google searches for his name and any of the poems come up empty. Anon removed the prod and added the following to the talk page: "I think there were no Google matches because this poet is some sort of lone nut who writes his poems on napkins. Simply because he does not have any matches on Google does not mean that he is not worthy of being recorded in digital history.".

It seems to me everyone here is missing the point. The people who call for deletion and those in favor of keeping the article don't understand that this guy represents the unheard mass of people who clamour for a voice in this new world. Look at this discussion page, it has brought serious inquiry into a life no one would have bothered with before the article was written. I am in favor of keeping the article simply to remind the world how powerful one life can be. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.7.218.32 (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.7.218.32.html" title="User talk:208.7.218.32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.7.218.32_8a4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.7.218.32">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>The first source is not a blog, usenet post or the like. It's a publication from an unrelated company.

<li>No, it's not a blog... it is a PDF of the forensics report compiled by an outside consultant that they apparently made available on the web. personally I think it is a bit of a stretch to consider that towards <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>... "multiple published coverages".

<li>Well, that's one instance of a independant published source in which he's the focus and which is nontrivial. The OC Weekly article is a second such item.

<li>I'm not sure you can make a plausible argument to that effect. Even simple dictionary definitions will show that it's published coverage.

The essay <a href="../../../h/o/r/WP%7EHORSE_7e36.html" title="WP:HORSE">WP:HORSE</a> may be applicable, but it's a fairly inscrutable argument you're making, so I'm very likely wrong. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is a saying that says, "Sometimes you have to call a spade a big F*&amp;^ing shovel." Why do we give people with crazy conspiracy theories a voice on Wikipedia for fear that might we offend someone. Read this guys userpage. He is pretty clear on his intentions and what this article is here to accomplish. Officiallty Colonel Sabow committed suicide and no one on this site is in a position to contest the findings.... pretty simple. So can I assume that any suicide that is contested rates it's own wikipedia article? I mean anyone who complains loud enough will eventually get a mention somewhere.

<li>Thank you all, however it is very sad, that you choose to judge and delete after an article has been published on wikipedia, this shows a certain weakness in this system. Allow me to explain:<br />
The administrators of wikipedia could have been more creative in a way that they would include all material that are subject to approval in a waiting zone prior to their publication. Once they are approved they should be published. It is quite discomforting in my particular case since the person being my own father, and he will find out that because he does not have internet evidence of his work well guess what you are not credible and all what you have done is to be considered as nothing and subject to deletion. In this case i think it will only humilate the person and his work.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it is very nice from all of you to have followed this issue and no offence Go ahead and delete it. You have my approval Signed Walid HADDAD 01:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear all,</li>
</ul>
<p>I Thank you to write and I appreciate your comments and trust that you will make wikipedia better.</p>
<p>I have added the links to Mr Kennedy and Mr Gingrich on my father's page. I have also deleted the link to his homepage not to appear as if i am making any attempt to sell his work through wikipedia.</p>
<p>My father being born in 1935 (which is not yesterday) most of his papers used until this day by scholars at the AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT are not to be found on the internet. Actually most of the studies written or not by him are not to be found listed on any internet databse this was back in the 1950s where i beleive not even computers existed. So checking references on the internet for some facts is irrelevant. Internet is a product of the 1990s So anything before that has 90% chance not be available on this internet. Or is in the process to be inputed in a databse. This is why through <i><b>wikipedia</b></i> <b>there is a chance of letting these historic facts come to light.</b></p>
<p>So once again if you feel there is no way that this article / bio is by the guidlines of wikipedia because there is no proof of it/he/she on the web please feel free to remove it. Knowing that his notability is valid only to a very tiny world for astronomers, scholars of astronomy astrophysicians of Lebanon, a country that will may be stop to exist one day. I just hoped that one day in the far future people would consult and find facts, about this person and know about astronomers and that particular period of time.</p>
<p>Thank you all for you concern, and time. Sincerly Walid HADDAD 21:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)<br />

<p>Deletion contested on the grounds 'This church is famous within the local area, providing outreach to people from all sections of the community and providing a chirstian light in the city by its famous window'. Unfortunately, there is no indication of notability, although some claims, and no sources. Other than that there is minor spam on what groups meet when. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 17:41, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The trouble is, <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> hasn't really reached a solid consensus on what notability criteria are. Is any school that ever had a pupil that was notable on any level worth keeping? Because that seems like each notable person would then deserve at least two or three school entries along with. Over the course of a few decades, any school with an enrollment over a few hundred will probably produce someone able to reach a notability threshhold -- ultimately, I think that leads to every school in the world winding up on wikipedia eventually. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeltopia_6c33.html" title="User:Deltopia">Deltopia</a> 20:04, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and a hearty <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROUT_3ce4.html" title="WP:TROUT">troutslap</a> to all of you who think that IAR has any place in this discussion at this point. Let's look at it this way. First, check the sources. We have one oft-reprinted AP article that stemmed from the Microsoft issue where Kohs is a primary subject. We have the German article linked above which is non-trivial as well, so he meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standard, as well as any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> questions that may crop up. Some claim that the article is spam, which is patently false - I know of no evidence that Kohs is currently editing the article, being banned, and if he is, we can certainly edit to fix that. BLP isn't an issue here, either, I'm not sure why that's being brought up. In full, there's absolutely no policy reason to delete this - he's "notable" by our standards, he's verifiable by our standards, and the only argument that seems to be permeating throughout this protracted debate is that since he did something that some Wikipedians didn't like, he should be held to a different standard. That's simply absurd, and should be treated as such. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's not often I agree with Badlydranjeff but he's absolutely correct in arguing that many of the appeals to various policies are flawed. Sure, there would probably not be a page about Gregory Kohs on Wikipedia if he hadn't gained attention for his actions on Wikipedia. This is a completely routine phenomenon: articles tend to be created because some editor cares but that does not make it an automatic <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> problem. This is like saying that the article on Jimbo is a self-reference. (Yes I <i>do</i> understand the relative unimportance of Gregory Kohs) The only debate worth having here is "do the sources provided constitute multiple, non-trivial published works?" If the answer is yes, we should keep this regardless of the fact that <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">we don't particularly like the article or its subject</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Once again, an article has to go prove itself repeatedly, and we have more bites at the apple until the desired result is obtained. There are multiple non-trivial published sources.

Let's take a close look at <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a>: In a nutshell, "To ease reusability, never allow the text of an article to assume that the reader is viewing it at Wikipedia, and try to avoid even assuming that the reader is viewing the article at a website. There may also be stylistic issues with using phrases such as this article unnecessarily." This article does not assume that the reader is viewing it at Wikipedia or on a website, or make any statements about "this article." Therefore, <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> <i>simply does not apply to this article.</i> The reason I voted "weak" is that I wonder if we should <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">deny recognition</a>. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> or <b>merge</b> into Controversies related to Wikipedia if there are enough to split it from <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Wikipedia_74f2.html" title="History of Wikipedia">History of Wikipedia</a>. <s>This guy's name isn't even in the story cited as a reference; it appears only in the caption of a photo. The article itself mentions another guy.</s> (The article also says "The imbroglio will soon pass", which sounds like "trivial" and "not notable" to me.) All the other stories I've seen or heard on this topic don't mention Kohs' name at all, although I haven't checked out the one from Die Welt. The <i>incident</i> is notable, but I have to stretch to consider this person even at the edge of notability under WP:BIO. A better analogy for trialsanderrors' complaint would be if people were arguing to keep a biography of the Queen Mary 2's captain because there were news stories showing RMS Queen Mary 2 docks in San Francisco, California. (While I was researching this, the ref link was changed and now points to a story that does contain Kohs' name.) I still have the opinion that the person hasn't achieved enough notability to pass the hundred year test or even the one year test. Scraping the edges of one part of WP:BIO doesn't make something a mandatory keep. The second AfD was closed as delete (albeit borderline) and people should not keep hollering for multiple chances to get their desired result if they want "keep" any more than if they want "delete". If you want it kept, improve a poor article with sources and substantial content, instead of putting more "no no no I insist" text into the AfD than is in the article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:40, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The piece in <i>Die Welt</i> is substantial (so not having checked it before offering an opinion is rather strange, to say the least). The AP piece is rather less interesting, but between the two of them, plus the <i>SdZ</i> article, I think there's enough to build on. Since <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are met, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> doesn't apply, consider the other alphabet soup offered in support of deletion arguments: <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> are irrelevant; <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a> likewise (why are <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Leslie_Brandt_2d95.html" title="Daniel Leslie Brandt">Daniel Leslie Brandt</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Wikipedia_74f2.html" title="History of Wikipedia">History of Wikipedia</a> in mainspace if ASR is prescriptive?; clearly it's not); it is hard to see how <a href="../../../a/d/s/WP%7EADS_2ee6.html" title="WP:ADS">WP:ADS</a> could be applicable to the article in its current state. Additionally, a number of delete opinions are based on erroneous assertions (only two articles; articles do not mention Kohs; not much evidence that anyone but us cares).

<li>The <i>Die Welt</i> article was described in the Deletion Review debate (after the second AfD as just a reprint of the AP piece.

I also read several newspaper articles which used only the first few grafs of the AP feed, content about Microsoft and Wikipedia that had no mention of Mr. Kohs. I first learned of the topic through hearing an NPR radio report, where Microsoft and Wikipedia were the focal points I heard and where if Kohs' name was mentioned I didn't notice it; it certainly wasn't featured. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>. Still non-notable, still self-referential, still the not-primary subject of multiple trivial works, no matter how much air Badlydrawnjeff tries to pump into the minor news articles or how much (as he did at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>) he pretends not to understand "self-referential". As sources for anything even resembling an actual encyclopedia biography, pretty worthless. As bonuses, throw in the fact it's thinly disguised spam, of no importance outside Wikipedia, and a big honking example of why <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> is needed. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:12, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. (To an extent as a reply to badlydrawnjeff's concern at the DRV): I think that <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> applies, although in a supposedly contrived way: the events are reported through several outside sources because the case has raised some dust and contoversy here, and we're <i>big and important enough</i> for that to catch attention of journalists. But all the references are not about Kohs as an individual, but about Wikipedia—Kohs might as well be a John Doe. Other than that event, I see no claim of notability; we routinely merge e.g. articles about otherwise unremarkable victims, scandal-causers, criminals, and similar into articles about the events they participated in (and which are the sole cause of their notability); I don't see why this case should be different. At best, his name and the event should deserve a couple of sentences in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article or one of its subarticles. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 09:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They're mostly about Kohs in the context of his associations with Wikipedia. That does not make the article about Wikipedia, but about Kohs, thus invalidating any contrived concerns regarding WP:SELF. Meanwhile, his claim to notability <i>is</i> the attention his business got, and I'm not sure he's exactly unremarkable given the circumstances. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:58, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but that's circular. If his marketing business becomes notable enough that it earns a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> article not related with Wikipedia (and/or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>), I'd agree with inclusion.

<li>That, of course, is impossible, since he and his business are concerned with Wikipedia.

If you look at the articles, they actually contain little-to-no additional info compared to the episode summaries already on the parent article, and are entirely redundant.

<p>To begin with, it's hard to call the page a memorial page when it existed long before the subject passed away.</p>
<p>I prefer to begin addressing the claim of notability by analogy. Logan Whitehurst is to the Velvet Teen -- a band which does warrant inclusion on Wiki -- as Pete Best is to the Beatles. Pete Best has an article, despite having no claim to fame himself except for having been a member of the Beatles before they became famous. Given that the Velvet Teen is notable, it stands to reason that Logan Whitehurst's page belongs here as much as Pete Best's.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Logan Whitehurst released six albums and has been acknowledged by indie labels such as Pandacide and Slowdance records as a notable figure. Dr. Demento, Pab Sungenis, and Nigel P. Stinkwell have all played his music on their shows. Dr. Demento and Pab Sungenis have dedicated entire broadcasts of &gt;30m to his music and his memory. While the actions of these three individuals (and probably more who I'm not aware of at the moment) do not constitute a major radio network, they are nationally known. Dr. Demento's show is syndicated and gets airplay on major radio stations, so this could be argued to count.</p>
<p>Along with the Velvet Teen, Logan Whitehurst has gone to Japan on tour. Sources: <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/music/concerts/v/velvet-teen-040814.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.popmatters.com/music/concerts/v/velvet-teen-040814.shtml" rel="nofollow">popmatters.com</a> <a href="http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=89347&amp;category=32741" class="external text" title="http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=89347&amp;category=32741" rel="nofollow">Portland Mercury</a></p>
<p>On his second to last album, members of Death Cab for Cutie and Pedro the Lion -- both notable bands -- recorded with him.</p>
<p>Another thing of note, though unrecognized by wiki as notability as far as I know, is that much of his popularity came from MP3.com.</p>
<p>All this and I haven't even mentioned his artwork which has appeared on the covers of releases by The Velvet Teen and Tsunami Bomb.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There's no question in my mind that Logan Whitehurst's page belongs on wiki. <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerise_55d3.html" title="User:Cerise">Phil</a> 21:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Logan toured internationally (wiki criteria 3 for musician notability) and was the subject of a half hour or more radio broadcast (wiki musician criteria 11) on the nationally aired Dr. Demento show (<a href="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd07.0107.html" class="external text" title="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd07.0107.html" rel="nofollow">January 7th, 2007</a>, and <a href="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd03.1012.html" class="external text" title="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd03.1012.html" rel="nofollow">October 12, 2003</a>.) In addition he was a founder, lyricist and drummer for the wildly successful group "The Velvet Teen", which is notable by wiki standards, and wiki criteria 2 for notability of lyricists says "Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above." In addition, he was a highly visible and well known artist in the Northern California indie music scene, and apart from his musical talents was an accomplished graphic designer, creating <a href="http://www.loganwhitehurst.com/artwork/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.loganwhitehurst.com/artwork/index.html" rel="nofollow">album art</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami_Bomb" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami_Bomb" rel="nofollow">Tsunami Bomb</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_Boy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_Boy" rel="nofollow">Dynamite Boy</a>, and many other bands. There is no doubt in my mind that Logan meets wiki's standards for notability. FilmCow 22:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Not only are all the other keep arguments still valid regarding <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but I have done a lot of work on the article to better assert his notability, include more sources, and provide a whole lot more information about his actual career than his death. The disparity there was among the reasons it was speedy deleted as a memorial site in the first place. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrot_4fa3.html" title="User:Albrot">Albrot</a> 05:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, the primary requirement for notability is that the musician in question "has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable." As was noted in the Deletion Review discussion, there have been multiple, non-trivial, independent published works, although these were not adequately cited within the text of the article. I have edited the article to incorporate additional citations to these independent sources. Argument about individual WP:MUSIC criteria doesn't seem particularly fruitful to me, because these criteria are simply those which imply the above-stated central criterion, which is, in my view, met. Nchaimov 00:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Notability is apparent under the guidelines of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and the recently edited article better conveys this notability than the original, deleted, article did. This may have been a better candidate for cleanup and expansion than deletion to begin with. PabSungenis 23:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Deletion reason was -- <i>{{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-a7_53d5.html" title="Template:Db-a7">db-a7</a>}}</i>. It was contested with a reason of "Lindsay Dawson is a notable artist. He has been painting professionally for over twenty years. In addition he is a regular Television Guest on the National show "the Fine Art Showcase". He has appeared five times to date, and is scheduled to appear again in March. He is also listed on the AskArt.com site, and the Internet Movie Data base. He has also been published by three major art companies. they are listed in the bio. He has worked on numerous television shows and movies. More sources and references will be added asap".

<ul>
<li>This article was tagged for afd before it was actually completed. The reason this happened was that it was the first article I had submitted to Wikipedia, and I did not realize that it would post when I saved it. I thought I could edit, correct, and add to the article before I published it to Wikipedia. I thought there would be a “publish article” button somewhere, but of course there was not. As soon as I saved the initial article it published an unfinished piece and that was why it was tagged for afd. I believed “saving” the article would place it in cyberspace for future corrections without posting it to Wikipedia. I have since added reference, links, and corrections to the article which I believe meets the standards of notability and writing style for Wikipedia. Please check out Dawson’s credentials before you make a decision. I believe this is a Keeper article. Dawson is certainly more notable than many artists listed already at Wikipedia (how many artists are on national TV as Dawson is regularly). In addition, I will add a "published" area to the article, because Dawson has had over twenty published works of his original paintings. I am in process of gathering the info for all of this, and will post it soon.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as is now. Lindsay Dawson is not mentioned once in any of WP's 1.6million articles, which seems strange for a "notable" person. Are the events mentioned in the article notable? They dont strike me as notable. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 21:20, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It does not state anywhere in the Wikipedia:Notability on people section that to be notable they have to be mentioned in other WP articles. However he is mentioned and written about all over the web. - L. Collins <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.5.113.23 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.5.113.23_16f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.5.113.23">contribs</a>) 18:24, 2007 February 9.</small>
<dl>
<dd>The article does not establish notability as far as I can tell. If an artist is notable, then, for example, he is an influential person in a certain style or he wins some award. Dawson is not mentioned in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Center_College_of_Design_493c.html#Notable_graduates" title="Art Center College of Design">his alma mater's notable graduates list</a>. There's no evidence in all of wikipedia (let alone the article itself) that he is notable. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 23:45, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I’m a little confused about this inclusion thing. Grubber above votes to delete because Dawson does not come up on other WP articles. But in an old article (Edward R. Thaden) that was deleted Daniel J. Leivick wrote: Being mentioned in a Wikipedia article does not equal notability. Please read WP:NOTE and it will make everything a lot easier. --Daniel J. Leivick 00:58, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>In addition, Dawson has talked at length on The Fine Art Showcase about how Political Art Center was. He paints in a style that is not Modern (and he actually makes money), and for that reason Art Center does not want to recognize him. He has won several awards including the California Arts league Best of show (1991). As I have stated I am getting more of this information together. I'm still bewildered by the shifting standards for notability. For example check out Ferenc Cako who is listed here at WP. He has no sources, references at all, and does not appear in any other WP articles. The only links are to his site, and a video of him doing his art (cool as it is). Why is this acceptable as an article and Dawson is not? I am not trying to be a pest. I truly am trying to figure out the standards.</li>

<li>It says above that my post was unsigned (although I did sign it), but I wasn't logged in. Sorry for this. I am not a tech person. I am an art collector. - L. Collins</li>
<li>In response to Grubber’s comments about not being listed on Art Center’s notable Graduates WP page. As mentioned above Dawson has explained in many interviews, but also he did not graduate (please see WP article), he only attended for three years, so he would not be listed under notable graduates because he isn’t one.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Grubber also asserts: “If an artist is notable, then, for example, he is an influential person in a certain style or he wins some award.” Please see list of awards below which have also been added to the article.
<ol>
<li>California Arts league Best of Show, 1991 (media/oil on canvas)</li>
<li>Gold Star, Worldfest Charleston International Film Festival, 1997 (media/film)</li>
<li>Gold CINDY, International Cinema in the Industry competition, 1997 (media/film)</li>
<li>Bemerkenswert Award, Festival Der Nationen, Austria, 1998 (media/film)</li>
<li>World Premiere, Breckenridge Festival of Film 1998 (media/film)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In addition, Dawson is very influential in his style of Impressionism. He is one of only ten living artists to be represented by <a href="http://209.85.45.137/artist_dawson.html" class="external text" title="http://209.85.45.137/artist_dawson.html" rel="nofollow">The Fine Art Showcase.</a> (a national TV show) that also represents Salvador Dali and Azoulay (who is the youngest living artist ever to have his work accepted into the permanent archives of the Musee du Louvre in Paris). Dawson is the ONLY impressionist that they represent. This fact alone is prestigious and notable. Therefore it would seem to me that Dawson has certainly exceeded the standards which Grubber has listed.</dd>
<dd>Once again I would like to point out <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferenc_Cako_3460.html" title="Ferenc Cako">Ferenc Cako</a> that IS listed on WP. One can debate whether a museum exhibition is more important than a national award, but you certainly can’t debate that Dawson’s credentials far and away exceed Ferenc Cako’s. Please don’t dismiss Dawson so easily. He is more influential and notable than other artists already listed on WP. It would seem to me that to remain consistent and fair that the article would be kept. How else could I gauge what is and isn’t acceptable on WP if WP is not consistent with there definition of “notable person”? L. Collins – 2-9-07
<ul>
<li>Every artist has a list of awards. That does not entitle them to an article. When I read the article about him, I do not see anything "notable". If he is notable, then the article must talk about those accomplishments. The fact that the article does not establish notability and that nothing in wikipedia itself vouches for his notability and the fact that the top 10 results from Google are sites selling his art (rather than vouching for his artistic abilities) makes me believe he is not notable. If there is something notable, then add it to his article. Otherwise the article should be deleted. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 17:18, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In response to the first point: Grubber stated: “the article does not establish notability as far as I can tell. If an artist is notable, then, for example, he is an influential person in a certain style or he wins some award.” When I listed a series of award Grubber dismissed it this way: “every artist has a list of awards. That does not entitle them to an article.” So in one post he states that one award would establish him as notable, but in another post a series of awards is not valid. I’m confused about the standards. In addition, it is obvious that every artist does not have a list of awards especially at Dawson’s level.</dd>
<dd>In response to grubbers second point above: I have added to the article, and have established Dawson’s notoriety beyond what I see in almost all of the other articles at WP (imho). Please read the article.</dd>
<dd>In response to the third point I had stated above: Grubber above votes to delete because Dawson does not come up on other WP articles. But in an old article (Edward R. Thaden) that was deleted Daniel J. Leivick wrote: Being mentioned in a Wikipedia article does not equal notability. Please read WP:NOTE and it will make everything a lot easier. --Daniel J. Leivick 00:58, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In regards to the forth point: Grubber states that Dawson’s top ten hits are sites selling his work (rather than vouching for his artistic abilities). Actually it’s 9 out of 10; one being the ASKART.com hit that does vouch for his notoriety. I did a search on Thomas Kinkade (arguably the most notable living artist) and his top 9 hits where also sites selling his work. I also did a search on Wyland (another incredibly well known Artist) and his top 10 hits where of sites selling his work. Both Kinkade and Wyland are included at WP, so the top 10 hit rule is obviously not a way of establishing notoriety. In addition, does the fact that sites sell his work mean that he is NOT notable? I would think just the opposite. Most artists do not make a living at it until they are notable.</dd>
<dd>My statement in regards to Ferenc Cako was not addressed.</dd>
<dd>I appreciate all the feedback from Grubber. I am truly, with all honesty trying as hard as I can to understand and comply with the “notable Person” standards.</dd>
<dd>Thanks—L. Collins 2-10-07

</ul>
<p>In response to Addhoc; why aren’t the sources reliable? They are real brick and mortar businesses with real people that have written about Dawson’s art. Is Addhoc saying that if they were “reliable” then the article would stay? Why are there other articles at WP about living artists with NO references (<a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferenc_Cako_3460.html" title="Ferenc Cako">Feenc Cako</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_Williams_62e9.html" title="Kent Williams">Kent Williams</a> to name two)?

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The current references all seem to be promotional in nature, except for imdb.com, which says very little. You would not expect a sales outlet to give an unbiased judgment. Surely if he is widely known his work will have been reviewed in the press.

</ul>
<p>Actually there are three sources that are not promoting his work: imbd, askart.com, and the Montecito article (can be verified offline). The fact that most of his references are promoting his work is one of the reasons that he is notable, because he has been very successful. A lot of what has been said about Dawson has been on television. How can I verify that? Thanks - L. Collins 2-12-07</p>

The decision of the media to use polling results to determine inclusions in debates/interviews is somewhat suspect, as the media coverage influences those very results! The media <i>should not</i> be the gatekeepers who decide which candidates are "important" enough to bother with - that's for the <i>voters</i> to decide. That being said, I agree with the <b>delete</b> nom. Someone with "losing candidate" as their whole biography probably shouldn't be on Wikipedia. ⇔ <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristTrekker_3e2b.html" title="User:ChristTrekker">ChristTrekker</a> 17:40, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak delete</b> based on the article, and assuming it all Verifiable, it is not enough from the point of view of a conventional academic career. I am not sure how to evaluate it otherwise--there are a large number of very informal publications--this is a continuing problem with those publishing mainly on the internet. Using the experimental indexes Citeseer and Citebase, which do cover information science and related fields, I found no articles and only 1 possible citation to his work. There is a language barrier, because most such indexes do not make a serious attempt to cover non-english language sources. The subject of the article should be able to document references to his work, which can then be verified--if he or his relatives see this, that's something that might help.

<dd>Hi Brendan! if you wish to make your project public I recommend you add it to the freshmeat.net index; it's far better suited for that purpose than Wikipedia. Also, open source projects abound, and while most have entries on freshmeat, only the most important merit a wikipedia article. Hopefully it'll become a successful application and eventually without you even realizing it a wikipedia entry will appear "on its own". <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadmr_3c40.html" title="User:Roadmr">Roadmr</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoadmr_d19a.html" title="User talk:Roadmr">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roadmr_eaa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roadmr">c</a>) 17:14, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>PROD removed. Unencyclopedic OR by synthesis; Wikipedia is not a repository of how-to materials or policies or procedures or other instructional documents. The article was originally the author's work and was a detailed set of instructions on how to run a field trip; the present version is a simplified set of policy/procedure issues, either the author's own opinions, or summarized from the school district manuals cited as primary sources.

The very title demonstrates that it is an indiscriminate list. Furthermore, it does not define "commercial failure", and is written in a gossipy tone. List of films that grossed less than their budget or List of Broadway plays that ran for less than 6 months are well-defined, potentially encyclopedic topics. This article is not and should be deleted or blanked and restarted with real criteria and sources. <a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 22:46, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Here's the history behind this article: It was once at the title "List of major flops", but later changed to "List of commercial failures". Later, someone decided this list was too big, and split it into a bunch of different lists, accessible from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECommercial_failure_lists_65b9.html" title="Category:Commercial failure lists">Category:Commercial failure lists</a>. Entries that didn't fit into one of the delimited flop types ended up on this list. Anyway, like most of the other "commercial failure" lists, this is almost pure original research. This is unsourced trivia appropriate for an entertainment website, not an encyclopedia. A neutral, verifiable article on this subject is possible, but it would have to be rebuilt from the ground up.

<li><b>Comment</b> I do feel slightly sorry for any kids who have put some effort into a page about their school, only for it to be deleted as nn. (Some school entries are better than others but a school is still non-notable even if the article on it is well written) That's not a reason to keep these articles however, unless the concencus is that <i>all</i> schools are notable. That doesn't appear to be the general view, so is there any way to have a mass cull of nn school pages? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 10:56, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel slightly sorry for anyone who puts time and effort into Wikipedia only to have it deleted; still, we don't want to end up with a whole class of articles that are of so little interest to all but a few individuals that we end up with little graffiti magnets subject to very little peer review. Schools are particularly notorious for this; I've got five or six high schools on my watchlist and the amount of vandalism I have to revert, compared to other articles, is ridiculous. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 17:59, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Funding is a complicated issue; most (or all?) states have a state aid system, in which the state provides funding to local governments for local improvements. These are not marked by the state. Similarly, many states choose not to sign some of the more minor state highways. And in a few states, the numbers are assigned to and marked along major highways, regardless of whether the state maintains them. Essentially, a numbered and signed state highway is a highway that the state not only (usually) maintains, but has decided that it is useful to mark it as part of a system for motorist navigation. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 02:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This section of roadway fails notability. Apparently there has been no coverage in reliable and independent sources where it is a primary subject. There is absolutely no Wikipedia policy that every section of road with a number on it is inherently notable so that it doesn't need to satisfy the basic notability criterion. The government pays for and puts numbers on lots of things, such as toll booths and salt spreading trucks. Signs are pretty cheap. There are marker signs on every mile of interstate, but that does not entitle every mile of interstate to its own article. There are articles about sections of state higheway less than 1/3 of a mile long, and articles about county highways are defended with the same arguments as for longer statw highway sections. The notability arguments do not go beyond "ILIKEIT" and the joy of making an article out of every datum in a state database of numbered roads. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 15:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't think anyone is arguing "Cruft Blvd. in Podunk, Idaho" deserves an article because it's a road, and therefore notable (or if they are, they're seriously mistaken). State highways, though, are another matter. If they weren't important, they wouldn't be state routes in the first place. That's the basis behind the "State routes are inherently notable" debate: That being enshrined into law makes them so. The comparisons to farms and mailboxes and the like are just silly, because it assumes that if <i>all</i> roads aren't notable, <i>none</i> of them are. There are some notable roads, just like there are some notable farms (though I'm unaware of notable mailboxes at this time). As I mentioned in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Minnesota_State_Highway_127_9237.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Minnesota State Highway 127">other AfD</a>, it may be a good idea to go to mediation or some other dispute resolution process and hammer out some notability criteria for roads. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not my point. My point is that other things with this amount of information would be deleted, and a road should be no different. Plus, all your arguments for why a road must be notable apply to pretty much every room in any City Hall with a big enough population. For instance, let's take the legislative chamber of a random city. Thousands of people use it every day, and it's very important to the local economy, as they make laws which regulate it. It may or may not be given a number, but being given a number is really not even close to notability. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 22:03, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
