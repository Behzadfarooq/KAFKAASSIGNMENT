<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Apart from the author and David Gerard, the outright 'keeps' are not included, being rants from anons (with sometimes forged signatures). David Gerard conditions his comment on acceptable references — the references do not appear to have sated the critics. What remains is consensus to delete. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:40, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Webpage with Alexa ranking of 862,598. Alexa description: Church of Scientology effort to expose religious intolerance, especially--but not exclusively--that directed against Scientology.

<li>Ok but make sure you attribute any claims. I doubt you have any proof that it was founded "to harass critics."

<li>I am afraid I am going to have to vote <b>Delete</b> on this one. Despite <a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">AI</a>'s claims that he wants "contribution from all POVs and NPOVs" his actual editing shows that he wants it to be his own view and no one else's. Since when was it acceptable Wikipedia practice to revert three times, asking for attribution and then refusing to accept it once you get it, and then placing all the attributed material you don't want under a header stating "Claims by [[USERNAME]]" <b>in the article</b>? If AI is going to defend what he erroneously sees as his article with these unacceptable tactics, then we are better off having no article on this subject -- rather than one claimed by this editor as his private soapbox. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:36, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>AI, I agree that VfD is not the place to resolve NPOV disputes, but I have looked at your edits, and it is pretty clear that you are behaving very poorly. Antaeus needs to supply sources (online or off) for the various statements in the article that you are trying to delete. But right now, it appears that you (AI) are behaving very disruptively. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 03:42, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sources were supplied for all of them except the claim that RFW is a Scientology group -- a source for which was given in this very AfD. After that, AI changed his story; instead of wanting contributions from POVs other than his own to be sourced, he wanted them to not "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Religious_Freedom_Watch&amp;diff=22514873&amp;oldid=22514449" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Religious_Freedom_Watch&amp;diff=22514873&amp;oldid=22514449" rel="nofollow">look like propaganda to me</a>" -- i.e., he does not want all POVs to contribute after all, he only wants information <i>favorable</i> to RFW to go in. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:00, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> The only noteworthy thing about this Web site is that it is a Scientology propaganda page full of unsubstantiated, undocumented claims designed to smear critics of Scientology in a slanderous and arguably libelous manner. The site is not newsworthy (only mentioned at all in Scientology press releases), and the group has done nothing except harass critics of Scientology. This is not noteworthy enough to warrant a Wikipedia entry, as it is already amply covered in the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_controversy.html" title="Scientology controversy">Scientology controversy</a> section (under "Dead Agenting"). It is in the same category as an article created by a company trying to advertise their own product: biased, irreversible POV, and nothing more than hot air. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 12:59, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Religious Freedom Watch is just one of a long series of bogus groups used as fronts for Scientology's Office of Special Affairs. (Earlier ones included the Scientology Parishioners League and the Foundation for Religious Tolerance.) According to Tory Christman, the now ex-Scientologist who worked with him on a previous front group, Joel Phillips is clueless and is NOT the real person behind RFW; he's just a cutout. RFW deserves at most a few sentences in an article on Scientology dead agent campaigns. This article should go. --<a href="../../../t/o/u/User%7ETouretzky_3a3d.html" title="User:Touretzky">Touretzky</a> 14:23, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The RFW site was created mainly for internal consumption by Scientologists. Its impact on the larger world is nil. A wikipedia entry should not have more substantial content than the subect of its article, which limits the practical size of this entry to to or three lines.</li>

What has religion to do with writing on Wikipedia? Apparently, these people who attack Scientology are not as good and innocent as they want to be viewed, and there is no reason why their true characters should be not portrayed on Wikipedia. Wikipedia accepts as information sources Usenet articles that could have been fabricated by anyone. Why not accepting a website that backs most of its claims up with official court and archive records? Note also that the anti-religious extremists never sued the RFW. If it would be true what Dave Touretzky claims, how come he did not sue them? He has money. There are even two attorneys portrayed as anti-religious extremists and the site is all over the Internet. I am sure they would represent their anti-religious extremist collegagues for free, if anyone of them would have a case. The problem is that Dave Touretzky and his friends are an anti-free speech advocates. They remove any critical data about themselves when they can. I had at least five websites with true and supporting information about Dave Touretzky on the Internet. I was informed that he goes after them and threaten to sue the ISP if they don't take the critic down, and the ISP don't want to be involved in legal actions, give in and remove the websites. Fine free world we live in. There is no free speech and that the RFW websites is bullied from Wikipedia is also a sign of no free speech. User Vivaldi rocks!</p>

<dd>Godwin's foolish philosophy works to protect Holocaust revisionists and other Nazis who try to keep their work undercover. I say shine a bright light on them and trash this obsolete Godwin's law.
