<dd>We've already established that webcomic cross-overs are plentiful and that this comic "usually involve[s] some sort of harebrained scheme to increase his readership." What we haven't seen is anything to suggest any of these schemes actually worked, that is, anything to dispute Nifboy's assertion that "the comic in question is largely an entity within the webcomics spectrum, rather than having any influence outside it." Following your link to the webcomics blog "Websnark" only confirms this: One of the comments off the home page is from the creator of Checkerboard Nightmare saying "I gave it five years and it plain old didn't do enough to justify me continuing it." I'll respectfully suggest that you reconsider your vote while trying to apply the same standard that you would for other media. A self-published book filled with numerous literary allusions that only attracts a handful of readers is un-encyclopedic. An un-signed band that attracts only a very small audience while playing numerous cover songs is un-encyclopedic. A webcomic whose only claim to fame is that it did numerous cross-overs and cameos but never attracted a large audience is also un-encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:29, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Dragonfiend, I find it a testament to the strip's pervasive how you have fallen for every single meta-property Checkerboard Nightmare purported to be, in its effort to deconstruct the nature of webcomics themselves. Checkerboard Nightmare should not be deleted by virtue of it being the only webcomic that used its self-aware nature as a means to further exploration of success and failure on the internet. All other webcomics you have referred to simply use it as an excuse for lack of a punchline. Straub is being playful (as he often is) in his "admission" that the strip failed. He has been invited to speak on webcomics panels with Gabe and Tycho from Penny Arcade, Scott Kurtz from PVP, and many other popular webcartoonists. His strip has been referenced as THE standard for metahumor in webcomics by many webcartoonists and readers. Straub himself has said that if the strip did become popular, it would sort of have failed at its own mission, which is why I believe he decided to end it. He had said all that was needed to say about webcomics as a search for internet fame. If Checkerboard Nightmare is deleted, so should the equally "unsuccessful" strips Road Waffles, Framed!!! A Modest Destiny, No 4th Wall to Break and Queen of Wands. DrHot 22:44, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b>. A far more valid example of webcomics metahumor than any other webcomic mentioned in this AfD. The author, Kristopher Straub, has been invited to speak on many panels at conventions at the same table with web giants Penny Arcade, PVP and Bob the Angry Flower. It is the quinessential example of metahumor, to the point where the original requester for deletion missed its nuance entirely. DrHot 22:44, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b>. This is a joke, right? It would be hard to consider a more notable webcomic within the webcomics community outside from absolute top tier webcomics like PvP or Penny Arcade. It was significant news and of significant impact when Straub left Keenspot to connect with Blank Label Comics (after several years on said Keenspot and significant time as one of the top webcomics on Keenspace, both of which would on their own indicate automatic inclusion over here). Clearly, whoever put this up for deletion doesn't understand even the most cursory elements of the artistic field he's trying to 'edit.' I would recommend he or she not muck around with the webcomics entries without significantly more exposure to webcomics in general and the community in particular.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Burns_bdeb.html" title="User:Eric Burns">Eric Burns</a> 23:02, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> I'm neither a fan of Straub nor his comic, but to imply that it is not a major influence in the webcomics community, or that it is 'unnotable' due to spurious statistics or because it is ended is to ignore all the discussions inspired, the events chronicled and the concepts explored by this very, very well known strip and by Straub. I would recommend that if you want to consider whether or not an entry concerning webcomics be deleted in the future that you actually consult with someone with at least a passing familiarity with them. For future reference, a strip ending does not always mean failure, and after a number of years, such as this, it almost never does. It just means that the author has said what he/she needed to say.--</s>Blackbyrd2 02:17, 21 November 2005 (UTC) <small>—<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> 216.134.160.149 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.134.160.149_a442.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.134.160.149">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<li>It's all very well to claim such things, but unless it can be confirmed, the deletion decision will progress as if such claims had not been made. Something like mentions in newspapers, weblinks to media, <i>anything</i> other than simply "it's so because I say it is."<br />

<li>And yet you're not holding yourselves to those standards. All your arguments for deletion are "because I say so". By your own admissions you don't even READ the comics you're putting up so how would you know their value? And have you ever considered simply asking Kris about some of this stuff? I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be difficult to get confirmation that he goes to the San Diego Comic Con or that he's been a speaker there. And if you're looking for a recent link at a major site, Blank Label Comics (Kris included) just got done a shortwhile ago with a guest week at PVP. - Donny (who doesn't give a flip how many edits he has)

<li>I think its clear that anyone speaking in favor of deleting this comic's entry doesn't read webcomics. Is that specific enough for you Brennemen? And whether you like to admit or not the people who submitted it for deletion are the ones who shoulder the burden of proving their point. Like I said, its as simple as asking Straub about the cons and a look into PVP's and Penny Arcade's archives show that Kris is linked by them not simply because they like his comic, but because they view him as a peer, as an equal voice in webcomics. I'm tempted to say that the shit-storm you guys unleashed simply by nominating this comic is enough to prove its worth but you're likely to question that as well. - Donny.

<dd>Since, while I was spellchecking my writing, a warning about ensuring citing appear, let me list more directly why Checkerboard Nightmare should continue it's listing:
<ul>
<li>It is a part of both Keenspot (retired) and Blank Label Comics, two places the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> lists as large enough Webcomic Syndicates to count. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041129091516/http://www.keenspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20041129091516/http://www.keenspot.com" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://www.blanklabelcomics.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blanklabelcomics.com" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></li>
<li>As mentioned above, a Google search turns up 53,000 hits, not the 212 listed by Dragonfiend. His link: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22checkerboard+nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=210&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22checkerboard+nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=210&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>
<li>If I'm understanding the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Directory argument correctly, it only applies if the wikipedia article is being used to provide only, say constantly updating information or scheduling. This is not the case with this article.</li>
<li>The fact that the comic is based around the quest for popularity does not mean that is lacking in popularity. Rather, it is entirely based on mocking the average webcomic's quest for fame and glory. All the various cheap 'tricks' that a webcomic will try to gain viewers are pulled out and mocked, a field that is not exactly deeply covered in webcomics. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobulus_adcd.html" title="User:Bobulus">Bobulus</a> 05:28, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The criterion in question was actually added as a result of this discussion, is now being used in support of this discussion, and has very little support outside that of the person who added it to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</li>

<li>No, I just won't go along with the inconsistency. I've seen articles I've written deleted even though their subjects were far more notable than this trivial webcomic. If it was a genuinely notable webcomic that succeeds in meeting the general guidelines for giving websites articles, then I would vote to keep.

<li>Thanks for explaining. I'm don't know whether CxN is more or less important than the stuff you've seen deleted, but I'd hate to see something removed that someone might actually find useful one day. I am admittedly new here -- I'm not sure WHY anyone would delete ANY article that wasn't specious or damaging. Consistency is important, but isn't it better to err on the side of inclusion? And mightn't it be a bad precedent to fight to delete something because something else was deleted unfairly?

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards my original Google search, 212 was the number of <b>unique</b> sites Google turned up when I created this AfD. Looking at the number of unique sites is commonly used to avoid over-counting sites which have multiple pages with the same keyword. For example, right now when I go to the last page of a Google search for "Checkerboard Nightmare,"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22checkerboard+nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=220&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22checkerboard+nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=220&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> I see "Results 221 - 223 of about 53,900."

<dd>This isn't quite right. When you perform a google search, it collects a sample of 1000 pages (based on pagerank). What you are seeing is the total number of unique pages per the thousand collected. A rough extrapolation requires therefore that you take the total number of unique hits x the total# of pages, divided by a thousand. It's far from scientific, but it gives you a rough idea of the overall web presence, compensating for Google's search return system. This, btw, is why the number of duplicates frequently changes, even over several minutes or hours. Google is returning a slightly different sample. A quick verification of this is using wikipedia itself on google. You will see that WP only generates a few hundred 'unique hits,' despite millions of returns. That is the duplication within the 1000 sampled result. In this case, based on your link above, the 53,900 google hits should be multiplied by a fifth - or roughly 10,000 unique hits. This organised forum voting notwithstanding, a defunct nn webcomic with a few rabid fans is still a defunct nn webcomic. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 13:00, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

You can't just expect to alienate one small community after another, and get a good project out of it. If in doubt, don't delete.

Next, this is a ridiculous candidate for deletion. The rules were designed to prevent vanity posts. This is not a vanity article. CxN may not have gained a huge readership, but it was exceedingly influential in the webcomics community. Mr. Straub has spoken alongside lumanaries such as PvP and PA repeatedly. It is by nature a webcomic about webcomics, and as such is a humor parallel to a webcomics trade journal. Finally, this discussion should not be taking place. Remember: Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy. Rules are not applied regardless of applicability. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia. There is no limit to what may be covered.

<li><b>No vote</b> Despite being a CxN fanboy, I can find no compelling reason why it absolutely needs a WP article; I think it would be somewhat remiss to let it pass without any mention at all, but the exact details of the strip are probably not of great importance (and are readily available on the strip's own site). However, I can't help but think that this deletion proposal is an arbitrary one; it's based on proposed guidelines that could potentially exclude a majority of the items on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a> (depending on how strictly the fuzzier ones are interpreted), yet I don't see anything else up for deletion and it's not like CxN falls outside of those guidelines by an especially flagrant margin. Unless someone's willing to bring out the pruning shears (or more likely, the chainsaw) on Wikipedia's webcomic section, I think this debate would have been more appropriate as part of the discussion on the guidelines for webcomic inclusion. Given the broader discussion that's taking place on webcomics policy, I think that it should be examined not only why CxN should or shouldn't be deleted on its own merits but also what makes it more or less worthy of deletion than any other questionable webcomic entry. I certainly assume Dragonfiend had no ulterior motives in moving this for deletion, but the only unique qualification CxN seems to have compared to other entries for non-major webcomics is that the series just ended. Is active update status going to be a consideration for future deletion policy, then? In the absence of any other visible reason why CxN in particular should be moved for deletion, it seems like its update status is the deciding criterion for this proposal. Either some deciding factor (whether the strip's recent ending or some other reason which I have missed) that's been applied for the consideration of this page's deletion should be brought to the talk page on websites, or it's time to take an axe to the webcomics section. 137.48.20.136 18:03, 21 November 2005 (UTC) (I have a grand total of 2 edits, as I fixed a typo once a couple months ago. Make of that what you will.)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This seems to be popular in the webcomic community, and I see no reason to be deletionist about anything that's not blatant vanity or nonsense. Some people on other sites are badmouthing Wikipedia because we're even considering deleting this; while I don't favor caving in to outside pressure on any issue here, this is one where there just isn't any reasonable justification to delete compared to the justification to keep. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 00:09, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pre-emptive note: user has ~20 (non-webcomic-related) edits. To new users and/or those user with very low edit count: your <i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_democracy" title="WP:NOT">votes</a></i> will never count as high (if at all) as those of more established editors. This is simply a precuation to prevent self-promotion. You are, of course, welcome to vote and comment. But expect such notices as the above. The best suggestion I could offer these users is to provide sources which help establish the given subject's notability. That carries infinitely more weight than voting keep &amp; commenting. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 00:29, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm fascinated how lack of coverage in <a href="../../../w/e/b/Websnark.html" title="Websnark">Websnark</a> is being used as reason to delete, and when Eric Burns, <i>the writer of Websnark,</i> votes to keep, <i>his vote is discounted</i> because of a low edit count. If the President of the United States voted "Keep" by announcing that Checkerboard Nightmare was America's Official Webcomic, the Wikipedia admins would cross it out: "only one edit." I imagine a good way to build an edit count is to nominate as many things as possible for deletion. DrHot 01:03, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow. Discounting votes bewcause of low edit counts seems a bit ... odd. Especially as I tohught this was pretty clearly stated as NOT a vote! (and for the record, I have more edits than recorded, because it took me a while to register. What do you suppose the cutoff count is?) At leastt he comments are still fairly legible, as I think some good points have been made entirely separate from "voting." <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScix_1b53.html" title="User:Scix">Scix</a> 01:18, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
