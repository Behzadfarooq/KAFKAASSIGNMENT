</ul>
<p>Ubelivable behaviuor! Congratulations! You have just deleted all my argumentations here that were well written and documented forcing people to read another page to read my arguments, so people who must vote to keep the article have nothing to read directly about WHY to keep it.</p>
<p>I hope these are not the methods of all moderators in Wikipedia, i.e. to delete testimony!</p>
<p>I don't want to comment more or I will start being offensive about these methods.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p><b>I warn you mr.Stifle.</b></p>
<p>Delete any other argumentation from mine and I will start a Request of Arbitration versus you.</p>

<p>An Amiga emulator is no more a <i>Virtual machine</i> then any other emulator. Should we have pages for NES virtual machine, Mac virtual machine, etc...? I believe the topics in this article is sufficiently covered by <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga_emulation.html" title="Amiga emulation">Amiga emulation</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WinUAE_d2f0.html" title="WinUAE">WinUAE</a>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnss123_b25d.html" title="User talk:Anss123">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anss123_de65.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anss123">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> An emulator is just a program running into an host machine. Programs run by the emulator are considered alien by the hosting machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amiga Virtual Machines create a series of Hardware Abstraction Layers between the hosting machine hardware, and the software, and let it run as if it was in the original Amiga environment.</p>
<p>Often Amiga VM are associated with emulators engines and/or code interpreters, but this fact can't let an Amiga VM be considered as like as a merely simple emulator. AVM just could be integrated with emulators to obtain new results with limited re-use of existing software solutions.</p>
<p>There are at least 4 Amiga Virtual machine known. Petunia from AmigaOS 4.0, ABOX from MorphOS, Amithlon as stand alone product and Amiga Anywhere as standalone product. Read more about these products into the article itself.</p>
<p>Also I remember to all readers that the Amiga world it is evolving and different solutions are considered by different people developing Amiga. In the future more about virtualization will take place into Amiga world, so more phenomena will emerge and will deserve Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>This is a summary of all my testimony to let this article be kept alive, and a summary of all my comments to detractors of Amiga. Hope that at least this summary will be let to stay finally without receiving any censorship.</p>

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike> <strike><b>Keep with reserve</b></strike> <b>Strong delete</b> (this is getting more and more absurd). This looks life a strange (and OR) "parroting" of things like the <a href="../../../j/v/m/JVM_18b5.html" title="JVM">JVM</a>, which are actually <i>intended</i> to be virtual machines, and never were real hardware. "Write once, run anywhere" was never a stated goal for Amiga <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola_680x0.html" title="Motorola 680x0">Motorola 680x0</a> executable programs, and the term "AVM" itself is not attested at all. <b>Advice</b> that the content of the "Bytecodes" section (by the way, again, nobody ever called M68k instructions <a href="../../../b/y/t/Byte-code.html" title="Byte-code">byte-code</a> before, and they most definitely are not) be merged into <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola_680x0.html" title="Motorola 680x0">Motorola 680x0</a>, as it may contain useful information about the M68k instruction set. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 19:01, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If you don't personally like Amiga Virtual Machines then that is fine but that is no reason to damage wikipedia by removing a clearly written article. To Mr. LjL, your complaint is false as Macintosh Virtual Machines and PC Virtual Machines are already listed in various other parts of the wikipedia such as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_virtual_machines.html" title="Comparison of virtual machines">Comparison_of_virtual_machines</a>. Perhaps you feel that Java inc. owns the term "Virtual Machine". It does not. Furthermore the term "Virtual Machine" is synonymous with "Emulator". The trouble is that people who type in the phrase "Emulator" are usually looking for games, while people who type in "Virtual Machine" are typically searching for some type of serious application to perform work. Thus 2 different articles are needed, each with its own clear focus. Also if you were to discriminate against PC, Mac, Amiga virtual machines and delete them then you would also have to delete Java Virtual Machine. It sounds like your complaint is an attempt to give Java a Wikipedia monopoly. There are <b>many</b> types of virtual machines in the world today and they are <b>ALL</b> worthy of wikipedia articles.--StoneGiant 07:16, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the discussion here is getting a little out of hand. Keep the the article for now. The discussion about where to merge it, or what content should be here vs. elsewhere, should take place on the article talk page, and should NOT have the time limit that an AfD discussion has. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 22:06, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> or possibly redirect to <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga_emulation.html" title="Amiga emulation">Amiga emulation</a>. Emulation of the Amiga is already covered in <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga_emulation.html" title="Amiga emulation">Amiga emulation</a> and various articles such as <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix_Amiga_Emulator_be25.html" title="Unix Amiga Emulator">Unix Amiga Emulator</a>. It's redundant to have two articles, so they should be merged, or this one deleted. I agree than "Amiga emulation" should be the primary name - this phrase is far more common that "Amiga virtual machine". Furthermore the article confuses Amiga emulation with Amiga Anywhere, which is an entirely different thing - this should be moved out into its own article. I realise that the article states they are different - but it's confusing to cover them together like this. If we want to cover both articles, then the article should be converted into a proper disambiguation page. This should also be deleted as a non-notable or unreferenced term - only 1 non-wikipedia Google hit <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Amiga+Virtual+Machine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=jKW&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Amiga+Virtual+Machine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=jKW&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and that says "Too bad there isn't an Amiga Virtual Machine"! <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 00:44, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> It's debateable how many hits should be considered "enough", but 5 is absurd. Even <i>hundreds</i> is generally considered non-notable (e.g., I get over 1,000 on just an online name I use which is unique to me). Also note, of those 5, none are relevant to this article: 1 actually appears to mean a Java virtual machine, 2 talk about a hypothetical Amiga virtual machine for the A\BOX, which was never released, and 2 are actually duplicate hits, I've no idea what the mention of Amiga virtual machine is about, the phrase just appears in some RSS feed. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 11:40, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
