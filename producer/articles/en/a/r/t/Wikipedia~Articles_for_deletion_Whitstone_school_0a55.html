<ul>
<li>Wrong. They are usually extensive, and this 33-page report certainly is. You apparently do not understand what a trivial published work is. For an example of what a trivial published work <i>actually</i> is, read <a href="http://www.cornwallearlyyears.org.uk/quality/f_accredit_east.asp?id=17" class="external text" title="http://www.cornwallearlyyears.org.uk/quality/f_accredit_east.asp?id=17" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which is just a directory listing. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong. The extensiveness of the report is irrelevant, and you are confusing "extensive" with "nontrivial". Since an Ofsted report, as far as I am able to tell, is made on almost every registered school in its purview, they are not useful for distinguishing noteworthy schools from the alternative. JoshuaZ is correct. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 13:55, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That rationale is clearly not based upon reading the article, which cites one source that is a 33-page document about the school, that is an in-depth report on things ranging from the school's Young Enterprise program to its deficiencies in the teaching of art, music, and drama. Moreover, lacking assertions of significance is not a deletion criterion for anything except certain <i>specific</i> categories of articles, which does <i>not</i> include articles on schools. It is good that you are addressing the sources. But please actually <i>read</i> them. And please familiarize yourself with our deletion policies and criteria. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:26, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The info sourced from the Ofsted report appears to be in breach of Crown Copyright - which requires that <i>all extracts quoted are reproduced verbatim without adaptation</i> - the race percentages have been adapted. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 12:58, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's ridiculously weak argument that is bordering upon outright silly. Repeating a percentage figure is not making an extract of a document and quoting it. Data are not subject to copyright. If such reaching is your only way way to criticise the sources on the article's subject, then please consider whether your opinion actually has any foundation at all. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:56, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was just surprised I didn't find your 99.6% figure in the report, then saw you had gotten your calculator out. I wasn't criticising the source, merely the use of the source in the article. It does seem strange that the most noteworthy thing you chose to include in the article - out of all 33 pages - is the ethnicity of the pupils rather than the average spent on each pupil from April 2002 to April 2003 was 3,025UKP or that '<i>provision in IT is very good</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 14:41, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I will thank you not to speculate on my analysis of sources. I do not and have not found Ofsted reports nontrivial, nor the coverage provided by them to have been significant to assert notability at any point. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 23:25, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Analysing sources is what we <i>do</i> here at Wikipedia. It's a fundamental part of the task of writing an encyclopaedia. If you don't want people to point out where your analyses are wrong, or clearly not based upon reading the sources concerned, then Wikipedia is not for you. Moreover, any editor who finds 33-page documents on subjects to be trivial has a completely skewed idea of what constitutes a source for an encyclopaedia article. The notability criteria on <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> describe what the triviality criteria are <i>actually</i> aimed at, which are sources that are simple name+address directory entries with no real meat to them. A 33-page detailed study clearly is not a directory entry. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How you managed to construe my concern with the Ofsted report on this school (which, as far as I know, are made on every registered public school under their purview, and thus is not a helpful factor for determining which schools have received significant mainstream attention) for a concern that the report was not extensive enough, I do not understand. It's great that an entity had a job to report on this school, but I do not find that sufficient to assert that this school has the thinnest claim to notability because of it. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 13:55, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I suggest that you, too, actually <i>read</i> the cited sources and consider what material they have available for expanding the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:26, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't consider the school inspection report a sufficiently important mainstream source. Every school has one, and this does not distinguish this school from any other. This one clearly states that this school is average in almost all aspects. In fact, most companies, shops, clubs, ... have numerous official reports (work inspection,; food inspection, whatever): would you include articles on all these entities if those were made public as well? If all you have are official, obligatory inspection reports, then you have nothing of value on its own (though they can of course be used as additional info on notable schools, if needed). I don't think this school is (or for that matter, most schools are) notable, so I have no interest in expanding the article. And if you need to expand the article by including that an equally non notable local cricket club uses the school cricket ground as their training ground, then that is for me a reason more to delete it, not a reason less. As for deletion policy and criteria, one of the criteria is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscrimante collection of information, which states that "there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries". Schools obviously are one of those classes, and to me they do fall under WP:NOT. These discussions are an ongoing attempt at consensus forming, and implying that one cannot vote delete because there is no consensus for it is circular reasoning. There is no policy or guideline that says schools should never bne deleted, and there is none that says that schools should always be kept. Applying more strict interpretation of WP:NOT or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for schools is the right of the individual editor and the only way to perhaps, one day get a consensus by precedent. For the moment, there is no such consensus and no clear precedent (I have seen schools deleted, kept, redirected, ...). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:58, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your thinking is confused and erroneous. What is necessary to consider about sources when writing an encyclopaedia article is not their <i>importance</i>, but their <i>provenances</i> and their <i>depths</i>. (Some very confused people talk about "notable sources" and "important sources". There are no such things. It is <i>subjects</i> to which the two distinct concepts of notability and importance apply, not sources.) A 33-page document produced by someone who is not only independent of the school but officially so, has depth and is clearly not sourced from the school itself. Your argument that companies have reports like this is also wrong. They do not. (If you wish to demonstrate otherwise, please point to the reports for Conflict Computer Limited (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Conflict_Computer_Limited_4c07.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Conflict Computer Limited">AfD discussion</a>). You will find that you cannot.) Not even all schools have such things written about them.
<p>You are also abusing "not an indiscriminate collection of information", a criterion that is <i>not an indiscriminate criterion for deletion</i>. It is <i>not</i> a simple synonym for "I think that this should be deleted.", as it is sometimes abused to be.</p>
<p><i>if you need to expand the article by including that an equally non notable local cricket club uses the school cricket ground as their training ground</i> — The information is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, and encountered when I looked to see what sources existed for the school. If you think that editors should not include verifiable information that they come across, and cite their sources when including it in articles, you have a very odd idea of how to write a verifiable encyclopaedia. If you think that it has a bearing upon notability, then you should re-read <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> (which makes no mention of cricket clubs) and this discussion (where you yourself were the first person to mention it). Please don't use straw men.</p>
<p><i>implying that one cannot vote delete because there is no consensus for it</i> — Please don't start the "stuck record" arguments over schools again, and please don't use yet more straw men. You were doing quite well in addressing the sources, which is the proper study of encyclopaedists, until you reached that point. The criteria for schools are <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, whose primary criterion is the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a> that focusses discussion upon the provenances and depths of the sources that exist. This article has at least one source of suitable depth and provenance. You have yet to show that that source is unsatisfactory for the purpose of writing an encyclopaedia article. The only arguments raised against it so far have been your argument that other such sources exist to support other articles, which is clearly fallacious, and <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a>'s ridiculous argument that one cannot use government published documents as sources for encyclopaedia articles because numbers are copyrighted. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:56, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The notability criteria for schools are <i>not</i> <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, which is only a proposed guideline. The notability criteria for schools are undefined and hence up to the interpretation of the individual editors. Your criteria may well be <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, mine aren't. As for the cricket quote, I did not say that it was unverifiable, just that it is a prime example of things that can be verifiable (and thus correct wrt <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and in this case <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), and still of such extreme obscurity that they are very much not of encyclopedic value. Probably all results of all matches some team of the school ever played can be sourced to some local newspaper, but I don't think that means that they are of any value to the encyclopedia. This is just a prime example of why notability is a concept that should be a guideline. Other points you raise: it aren't only confused people that talk about important and notable sources: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (a policy) says that "Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy". The next paragrahp even talks about "reputable" sources. To parapharse this as "notable" or "important" sources seems not so confused to me. By the way, your sources can, according to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, be considered primary sources, which are not allowed as the main sources for an article. Certainly the "cricket" source is, on top of being about a very non notable subject, clearly unacceptable as a main source of information according to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:13, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is confused. Please learn the difference between "reputable" and "notable". And, again, please don't use straw men. The only person who has suggested that the cricket source is the main source of information, indeed the only person to have raised the subject, is you. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't use straw men, and repeating it won't make it so. I raised the subject of the cricket ground because you introduced it in the article. I suppose that means that you find this info important, not trivial, and that you consider the source a reputable third-party source. Discussing a source you introduced in the article is not a straw men, as it does not misrepresent your position. A for your question on Conflict Computer Limited: talking about strawmen... An article about a company that is already deleted and that may well have been a hoax.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Re: the arguments above about whether the gov't report demonstrates notability: (1) With respect to <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>, the existence of sources of depth and provenance clearly pertains to verifiability of deep and provenant facts, but not so clearly to notability of the subject. To assert that the existence of deep and provenant sources automatically implies notability presupposes a particular outcome of a long-running and unresolved general debate among Wikipedia editors. (2) With regard to the question in this case of whether the gov't document establishes notability: As Uncle G writes in his <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">essay</a>, "A subject is notable if the world at large considers it to be notable." The existence of gov't published documents about a school doesn't show that the world at large deems the school <i>notable</i>, just that people care about the quality and specifics of institutions of gov't education, hence the gov't mandates reports on schools. Likewise, the gov't issues reports on local businesses (for example health inspection reports on restaurants), but these reports don't imply that local businesses are notable. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:42, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>This idea that local businesses have reports is simply wrong. Once again, I challenge you to cite such a report on Conflict Computer Limited (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Conflict_Computer_Limited_4c07.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Conflict Computer Limited">AfD discussion</a>).

<ul>
<li>Well, I wouldn't say that my argument is built on that premise. Essentially I'm saying that the burden is on your side to explain why this (or any) primary school is notable. And the gov't report, even if it is deep and provenant, doesn't show notability. I would argue that in general, one has to look at the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the source, as well its content, to determine notability of the subject. In this case, as I explain above, the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the gov't report is not that anybody, or the world at large, considers the school notable. Contrast the mandatory gov't report with a hypothetical press report that Whitstone School, say, consistently produces kid geniuses. That press report would be issued because an editor would make a judgment that the school's feat makes it sufficiently notable. So the issuance of such a report might show notability. Not so the mandatory gov't report. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:45, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You are mischaracterizing the opposition. "Trivial" is not used to imply that no work goes into such reports, but rather that they are not sufficient "independently published sources" on which to hang an article. I'm inclined to agree -- are we going to develop articles on all restaurants because of government-mandated health inspections? Average schools should no more be placed into an encyclopedia than average businesses or average individuals. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 06:26, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The report cited here is independent of the school itself because such reports are <i>required</i>, by law, to be independent. "Trivial" in <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is specifically dealing with the depth of material in the source. Directory entries are trivial. 33-page reports that discuss the subject in detail are not.
<p><i>are we going to develop articles on all restaurants because of government-mandated health inspections?</i> — Your argument is based upon the false premise that all restaurants have the same sort of things published about them as what is cited in this article about its subject. That is not the case. (Once again, please cite such a report for Conflict Computer Limited (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Conflict_Computer_Limited_4c07.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Conflict Computer Limited">AfD discussion</a>) if you wish to demonstrate otherwise.) Your argument is fallacious and falls apart from its foundations upwards.</p>
<p>I suggest that editors who have made the "a 33-page detailed government report is trivial" argument ask themselves why xyr convictions have caused xem to adopt the patently wrong position of arguing that lengthy and detailed government-published documents on subjects do not constitute sources for encyclopaedia articles. If one's convictions take one to a point where one is making an argument that would clearly not hold water for any other subject, such as articles on drugs (which reference government reports from approval agencies) or towns (which reference government census reports), then it is time to question one's convictions. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The report may be technically independent of the school, but the fact that it is required by law is what makes it trivial as a source. If every school has such a report, then its existence says nothing in particular about the noteworthiness of the school. If the school is noteworthy for other reasons, however, then the report may indeed contain useful and relevant information for the article. I don't believe that was in dispute. On another note, all restaurants (in many countries) <b>do</b> have information "independently" published (by government agencies) about them, along similar lines as this (though perhaps not in quite as much depth). I do concede that Conflict Computer Limited probably does not have such health inspection reports, however, as it doesn't sound like a restaurant to me. Why you think that fact is relevant to my example, I couldn't say. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:32, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the school is found to be notable enough to warrant inclusion in this encyclopedia, then the school inspection report is a useful source for some information. But to use an obligatory inspection report, made for every school in many countries (and, while not so often made public, made for many companies in many countries as well), as evidence that the school is notable is incorrect. When some source is produced for a very large number of similar subjects, that source becomes trivial as an indication of notability. Similar inspection reports are made for daycare centers and nurseries (see e.g. these pdf's<a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=ccreportpdf&amp;id=169464" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=ccreportpdf&amp;id=169464" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=ccreportpdf&amp;id=115977" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=ccreportpdf&amp;id=115977" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I can write a sourced, verifiable, NPOV (but short) article on L'Oven Fresh Donuts based on e.g. their five food inspection reports I can find here<a href="http://www.region.waterloo.on.ca/web/foodinspection.nsf/Index?OpenAgent&amp;city=c&amp;prefix=L&amp;start=31&amp;pages=3&amp;valid=y#" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.region.waterloo.on.ca/web/foodinspection.nsf/Index?OpenAgent&amp;city=c&amp;prefix=L&amp;start=31&amp;pages=3&amp;valid=y#" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and the same goes for many thousands of similar places. I could make quite a long historic overview of the reports of e.g. the specific Macaroni Grill in Denver (not the whole chain) from reports like this one<a href="http://www.denvergov.org/eh/search.asp?mode=get_insp&amp;est_id=3093&amp;dte=5/18/2006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.denvergov.org/eh/search.asp?mode=get_insp&amp;est_id=3093&amp;dte=5/18/2006" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (29 reports in 6 years, this has to be important!<a href="http://www.denvergov.org/eh/search.asp?mode=inspections&amp;est_id=3093" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.denvergov.org/eh/search.asp?mode=inspections&amp;est_id=3093" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). Does this source makes the subject notable? Of course not. So, until now, the only claim to notability this school has is that the local cricket club trains on a school field. Apart from that, it is a completely average school, as indicated by the inspection report. And so, this article should be deleted if you feel that schools must have some notability to be kept, and should be kept if you feel that all schools are notable. And that, obviously, is why I have supported a deletion. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:50, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This involves the word "trivial" in the proposal, which means "worthless" or "without value". When it comes to writing an encyclopedia, these inspection reports are of little value. However, due to their breadth, OFSTED reports are of significant value towards writing an encyclopedia. Because schools are written about in OFSTED reports, they are "notable", which literally means "worthy of writing about". <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:11, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Trivial" does also mean "commonplace", "ordinary", which perfectly fits the Ofsted reports: they are made for every school and even for some non-schools, so they are commonplace.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Whitstone_school&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Whitstone_school&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. And a commonplace source which says that the subject is average on top can hardly be used to show that something is notable, which is also "prominent, important or distinguished": this school is neither of the three.<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/notable" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/notable" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> 05:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
