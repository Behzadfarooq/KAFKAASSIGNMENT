<p>On March 14, 2006, Nicole Holness was named among the seven hosts of MTV Canada and its new flagship show, MTV Live. Marking the comeback of MTV to Canada, MTV Live was announced as a live &amp; interactive evening program addressing pertinent social, political, and entertainment issues. Premiering on March 21, 2006 at 6 PM EST, MTV Live reached homes across the country from Toronto's historic Masonic Temple.</p>
<p>Nicole Holness was already familiar to many Canadians prior to the launch of MTV Live. An experienced musician and performer, Nicole was the lead personality in urban/R&amp;B group X-Quisite. The group earned a 2004 JUNO nomination for R&amp;B/Soul Recording of the Year along with Glenn Lewis and Tamia, and at the ceremony was named Best Dressed by The Edmonton Sun. X-Quisitre snagged nominations as Best New Artist at the 2002 Urban Music Awards of Canada and Best New Artist (CHR) at the 2002 Canadian Radio Awards, as well as Favourite Urban Artist at the 2004 Canadian Independent Music Awards.

<p>City of Chiang Mai (<a href="http://www.chiangmainews.com" class="external free" title="http://www.chiangmainews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiangmainews.com</a>), after Bangkok the second largest city in Thailand (with population only under 200.000, comparing to Bangkok's close to 7 Mio people), is the lands' "northern capital". With many typical features of local culture, unusual leisure activities, lanna (as this part of country is known) food (<a href="http://www.lannacafe.org" class="external free" title="http://www.lannacafe.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.lannacafe.org</a>), local markets and shopping, featuring special local items and handicraft or handmade items of great variety, Chiang Mai area is the must stop in Thailand for most of the tourist or business people who come to Thailand. Along with the beaches of south, 24-7 busy and awake, energetic Bangkok, with only 55 minutes long flight from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport (<a href="http://www.airportthai.co.th" class="external free" title="http://www.airportthai.co.th" rel="nofollow">http://www.airportthai.co.th</a>) Chiang Mai is easily accessible and it's visit completes the journey of major destinations in Thailand. Leisure searchers in CM area can choose from options like elephant riding, rafting, or visit a center for extreme sports (<a href="http://www.chiangmai-xcentre.com" class="external free" title="http://www.chiangmai-xcentre.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiangmai-xcentre.com</a>). Anyone can become a shopper in Thailand easily. Typical shopping items for tourists are handicrafts, silk products, ceramics, carvings, wood products - they can be found in small shops and market places around the city. However, Baan Tawai with surrounding area and places along the way to village of Hang Dong, 15 minutes drive from the city by the south-bound highway, is the center for local handicrafts, ceramic and wood-art shops, or places selling antiques. Tourist come here to find cheap but interesting gift items - wooden toys, figures, vases, plates, carvings, ceramics, decorative objects and accessories. Some shops offer huge vases and pots, or different kinds of ceramics for garden or porch, or indoor display. Items of a higher historic or artistic value are often found available. Teak wood products have here a long tradition. Teak wood is the commodity of choice for craftsmen making wood carvings and also furniture makers. Antique furniture shops scattered around the area carry a lot of furniture from British colonial era (<a href="http://www.goldentriangle.co.th" class="external free" title="http://www.goldentriangle.co.th" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldentriangle.co.th</a>). The British colonized the neighboring Burma, along with other places around the region in the period of 1870s-1940s. They influenced the local architecture as well as the interior design. Baan tawai does not need to be presented as a place for shopping only - it is a place which provides for the visitor an insight to local temporary and historic art, the wood - workmanship which has a long tradition here, along with a variety of other unusual items and products of the local craftsmen.</p>
<p>The author uses a few links in the article to favorite webs covering Chiang Mai information and places for Thai-typical arts. I believe along with other information in this article they will be useful for so many visitors who come to Chiang Mai all year round</p>

In order to give Kevin and his brothers a better life his parents picked up and left the only place they called home and moved to the United States to a town named East Hartford a suburb of the city Hartford in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Kevin grew up middle class. His parents of Jamaican descent, but his maternal great grandmother was Jewish and from the country of Yemen. He grew up like a lot other middle class kids in the suburbs but Kevin was attracted to drugs and money. He looked up to the guys in school who drove the nice cars and had the nice clothes.

With a little bit of trickery and some connections Kevin's father was able to fake an address in a neighboring but affluent town and was able to get Kevin into Glastonbury High School. Over the year Kevin proved himself to not only fit in, but to get his grades up so that he would be able to graduate on time with his peers.</p>

<p>In Clay County Kentucky there was a feud between people named Bakers and people named White that began in the 1820s. Legend has it that it began over a minor insult about a dog. The feud, also known as the Clay County war, took roughly 150 lives. This is far more than the more famous Hatfield McCoy Feud. The newspapers of the day reported on the feud. A Baker parent said the first thing she taught her children was to hate Whites. There is a History Channel special titled "Vendetta: Clay County War" on the subject. <a href="http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=72427" class="external free" title="http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=72427" rel="nofollow">http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=72427</a></p>

<p>Racing Identities was an Australian progressive pop band formed in 1985 and disbanded in 1987. Their members include Paul McTigue on lead guitar and vocals, Trevor Dooley on bass and vocals and John McVeigh on drums. The three met while working for the ATO in Sydney and began practicing at a house McVeigh was minding and had their first gig at the croydon park hotel, where Keith Crook saw the band and invited them to record a few of their songs at Loft Studios in Sydney.They recorded a single "The Way That It Ends" which debuted at number four on the DoubleJ charts. An self-titled album quickly followed which sold over 100,000 copies in Australia, but the band fell apart in November of 87'. The band went on a sellout reunion tour in August of 93' a few weeks after McVeigh's first son had been born. In 1997 McTigue and Dooley formed another band, but according to McTigue nad Dooley, they weren't as popular without McVeigh.</p>

<p>From 1994-1999 He attended and graduated from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cincinnati_College_of_Design%2C_Architecture%2C_Art%2C_and_Planning_2614.html" title="University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning">University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning</a> (DAAP) He majored in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Design_f46b.html" title="Industrial Design">Industrial Design</a> and focused on Transportation Design.</p>
<p>Graduation brought him to L.A. where he signed on with the <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Wheels_2a3d.html" title="Hot Wheels">Hot Wheels</a> Design Team. Working at Hot Wheels, Tscherne developed many vehicles collectors have come to love including:<br />
1964 <a href="../../../b/u/i/Buick.html" title="Buick">Buick</a> Riviera<br />
<a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford.html" title="Ford">Ford</a> Focus Dragster<br />
<a href="../../../n/i/s/Nissan.html" title="Nissan">Nissan</a> Z concept<br />
Sho-Stopper<br />
Seared Tuner<br />
Muscle Tone<br />
Rockster<br />
<a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrari.html" title="Ferrari">Ferrari</a> 360 Modena 'Tooned<br />
<a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota.html" title="Toyota">Toyota</a> Supra 'Tooned<br />
Tourque Screw<br />
and many others.</p>
<p>Tscherne is credited with ushering in the "<a href="../../../t/u/n/Tuner.html" title="Tuner">Tuner</a>" trend into the previously all-American brand. Tscherne is an influential member of the "Tuning Community". His designs have appeared in publications like Super Street, Import Tuner, <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowrider.html" title="Lowrider">Lowrider</a> Edge and many other magazines. He has worked for: <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford.html" title="Ford">Ford</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/p/Mopar.html" title="Mopar">Mopar</a>, Chevy Performance, NuFormz, Wings West and many other aftermarket companies to create various products to restyle a person's car, wings, body kits, wheels,etc.</p>
<p>Tscherne also is associated with the "Cartoon" look becoming popularized in die-cast. His Car Tunerz then renamed Hot Tunerz line captured the essence of a car in a cute stylized replica. This line sold well for 2 years before fizzling out on the pegs</p>
<p>An off-shoot of the Car-Tunerz look were the 'Tooned vehicles produced by <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Wheels_2a3d.html" title="Hot Wheels">Hot Wheels</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattel.html" title="Mattel">Mattel</a> from 2004 through 2005. Many castings are still used, however the 'Tooned name along with many other "Cartooned" Hot Wheels vehicles are not. Tscherne has been said to have created the Hardnose look as well. Collectors generally do not like these or other cartoon styled Hot Wheels</p>
<p>Tscherne appeared on an Episode of Monster Garage. He was the Designer for the Red Rocker in an episode that brought the Mattel classic <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%27em_Sock_%27em_Robots_bc0f.html" title="Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots">Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots</a> game to life. He is credited as the designer of the Red <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scion.html" title="Scion">Scion</a> xB.</p>
<p>in 2004 Tscherne left Hot Wheels after 5 years. Not much is known about the time between this and in 2006 when Tscherne surfaced again this time as Creative Director for <a href="../../../r/c/2/RC2_a45d.html" title="RC2">RC2</a>'s JL Full Throttle line.</p>
<p>The JL Full Throttle line is supposed to be his vision. The JL Full Throttle line is composed of cars by <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Foose_f854.html" title="Chip Foose">Chip Foose</a> and a series of Trucks called Rock Rigs. Tscherne also helped to bring <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Foose_f854.html" title="Chip Foose">Chip Foose</a>'s dream car Hemisfear to life at the 2006 SEMA show. JL Full Throttle, a brand of RC2's funded the construction of the Hemisfear while simultaneously building scale replicas. Tscherne was on hand to help unveil the concept and answer questions about the diecast and build.</p>

<p>The role of a Netball umpire is to ensure that the rules set for the game of Netball are complied to within all games by the according players. Each match, at international and most national levels are allocated two highly accredited umpires, with another umpire as the reserve.

Individually umpires on the international pool, or the above table, have no individual ranking or classification. This is due to the International Federation of Netball‚Äôs policy to have umpires from independent nations, do top matches such as any of the matches above. For example this means that an Australian umpire can not umpire any match involving the Australian Netball team. The same applies for all other nations.</p>
<p>Despite this, from the above matches, the most consistent of the international umpires to have umpired and/or reserved the top level matches are ‚Äì Maggie du Plessis and Marion Johnson-Hurley, with the recent inclusion of Chris Campbell, who has umpired several consecutive tests between Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Arguably the top International umpires from Australia and New Zealand are said to be Sharon Kelly &amp; Amanda Nottingham. This was proven at the 2006 Commenwealth Games when both where appointed to the Bronze medal match (the highest match for Umpires from Australia and New Zealand to be allocated to.)</p>
<p><br />
The Next Important Event on the International Umpiring Calendar is the 2007 World Netball Championships to be held in Fiji. This will be an event where over 20 international umpires will be invited to officiate.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-12_9571.html" title="Edit section: payback period Rule">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">payback period Rule</span></h2>
<p>The payback period is the number of years required for a firm to recover its initial investment required by a project from the cash flow it generates. Payback period rule is one of the most popular alternatives to net present value (NPV).</p>
<p>It is an investment decision rule which states that all investment projects have payback periods equal to or less than a particular cutoff period are accepted, and of all of those that pay of in more than the particular cutoff period are rejected.</p>
<p>However, there are some drawbacks in applying this rule. Timing of cash flow within the payback period is not being considered within the payback period. As compare to NPV, it does not discount the cash flow properly.</p>
<p>Another problem is payback period ignores cash flow occurring after the payback period. This makes decision maker need to have an artificially short-term orientation, which may lead to decision not in shareholders‚Äô best interests.</p>
<p>There is no comparable guide for choosing the payback period so the period is arbitrary to some extent. Unlike, NPV approach, it can go to the capital market to get the discount rate.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-12_9571.html" title="Edit section: Petenera (Flamenco)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Petenera (Flamenco)</span></h2>
<p>La Petenera Corta de Preparacion - La Petenera Grande - La Solea Petenera</p>
<p>Peteneras are flamenco songs full of emotion, melancholy and sentimental feelings, usually lamenting aspects of injustice. There is, however, a lot of mystery about its origins. This type of 'cante' is by some believed to be of Sephardi Jewish origin, due to a few of its lyrics, however, experts do not exclude any other origin. This particular song ows its origin to a flamenco singer called 'La Petenera' from Paterna de la Rivera in the Andalusian province of Cadiz.</p>
<p>1) The name 'Petenera' has neither Andalusian nor 'Gypsy' roots.</p>
<p>2) Andalucians pronounce 'paternera' as 'patehnera' with a very audible letter 'h'.</p>
<p>3) The singer 'Juanelo' was acquainted with a singer called 'La Petenera'.</p>
<p>4) Both tradition and legend have given us some clues about the life of this singer who,</p>
<pre>
    according to some of her lovers, was cruel towards men : 
</pre>
<p>Quien te puso Petenera no te supo poner nombre, que debia haberte puesto la perdicion de los hombres.</p>
<p>La Petenera, malhaya, y quien la trajo a esta tierra, que la Petenera es causa de que los hombres se pierdan.</p>
<p>Petenera de mi via, Petenera der corazon, por curpa de la Petenera estoy pasando dolo.</p>
<p>... and after her death :</p>
<p>La Petenera se ha muerto y la llevan a enterrar y en el panteon no cabe la gente que va detras.</p>
<p>People from Triana (Sevilla) used to call those lively 'Seguidillas' lyrics which were sung with much greater emphasy than in normal seguidillas, and with a far more penetrating voice full of inexplicable melancholy. Seguidillas are regional Spanish folk songs dating from 18th Century, and many are much older than this. As from the mid 19th Century they became extremely popular with the young people of Andalusia. Since 1879, they became the rage in Seville, and especially in the year 1881 when they sang :</p>
<p>Del ano de las peteneras nos tenemos que acordar, que anduvo la Pura y Limpia en el canasto del pan.</p>
<p><br />
VEN ACA , REMEDIAORA - Petenera Corta - Canta : RAFAEL ROMERO</p>
<p>Ven aca, remediaora, y remedia mis dolores, que esta sufriendo mi cuerpo, una enfermea de amores.</p>
<p>Donde vas, bella judia, tan compuesto y a deshora ? Voy en busca de Rebeco que esta en la synagoga.</p>
<p>Al pie de un arbol sin fruto me puse a considerar : que pocos amigos tiene el que no tiene que dar !</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>AL PIE DE UN POCITO SECO - Petenera de Medina El Viejo - Canta : PEPE DE LA MATRONA</p>
<p>Companera de mi alma, tu dices que no siento na, si las carnes de mis huesos a pedazos se me van.</p>
<p>Al pie de un pocito seco de rodilias me hinque, fueron tan grandes los llantos que el pocito rebose.</p>
<p>Tu, misionero de Dios, por el mundo si la encuentras dile que yo la perdono, mare de mi corazon ! - pero que no quiero verla.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>YO HE VISTO A UN NINO LLORAR - Petenera de Chacon - Canta : ENRIQUE MORENTE</p>
<p>Ven aca, remediaora, y remediame mis males, que si tu no los remedias no me los remedia nadie.</p>
<p>Yo he visto a un nino llorar a la puerta de un camposanto y en sus lamentos decia; mare de mi corazon ! por mi mare son los llantos, que dolor de mare mia.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>QUE PENITA Y QUE DOLOR - Petenera de la Nina de los Peines - Cante : GABRIEL MORENO</p>
<p>Pastora Pavon, Pastora, que penita y que dolor, quero reflejar tu cante poniendole el corazon.</p>
<p>Quisiera yo renegar de este mundo por entero, volver de nuevo habitar, mare de mi corazon ! por ver si en un mundo nuevo encontraba mas verdad.</p>
<p>EN LA HABANA HICE UNA MUERTE - La Solea Petenera - Cante : PEPE DE LA MATRONA</p>
<p>En la Habana hice una muerte, La Puebla me sentencio. La Habana dice que muera, La Puebla dice que no.</p>

<ul>
<li>Many behavioural facets which were implicit in LINC are explicit in AB Suite. This means more objects and more logic if you desire identical behaviour.</li>
<li>Many constraints which were imposed in LINC have now been lifted. If you specify to do something that you couldn't do before, generated code should either tolerate any mistake that the developer made or exhibit new behaviour to match what the developer specified. Note however that the Runtimes are bug-compatible with past releases so any behaviour that you could specify in past releases and caused buggy behaviour at run time will still do just that ie using <i>DT; LAST</i> with a large <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle_database.html" title="Oracle database">Oracle database</a> table is still a bad idea.</li>
<li>Multiplicity means much. Multiplicity of 0 means that you have defined a class but no instances of it. Multiplicity of 1 means that you have 1 instance of a class. Higher multiplicity gives you an array of the class.</li>
<li>Syntax options that better match <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_Basic_5ea7.html" title="Visual Basic">Visual Basic</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_C_4f10.html" title="Visual C">Visual C#</a> like <i>if</i> and <i>while</i> are now available. The old ones are still available also. Semi-colons are unnecessary.</li>
<li>Statements and predicates go across 1 line only (unlike the many lines in LINC) and precedence is defined using brackets (no more OR has precedence over AND).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have an existing LINC LCIF, you can easily load that into an AB Suite Model. Your Ispecs, Reports, SDs and GLGs will be converted to different types of classes and objects with different methods. As stated above, you will notice objects and logic defined explicitly where it wasn't before. As your knowledge of the new product improves, you might decide that the behaviour implemented is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Non-native English speakers may observe additional comments in English that they didn't put there. These describe changes made during the migration. Native English speakers may observe this too.</p>

<p>This is a JAT Tribe whose head-quarters appear to be in Hoshiarpur and Jullundur. They have spread westwards as far as Rawalpindi and eastwards into Ambala. Their ancestor Bains came came eastwards in the time of Firoz Shah. They give their name to the Baiswara, or the easternmost portion of the Ganges- Jamna doab. The Sardars of Alawalpur in Jullundar are Bains, whose ancestor came from Hoshiarpur to Jalla near Sirhind in Nambha some twelve generations ago. Today there is a big population of Bains in the UK in places like Bradford, Birmingham, Derby, Nottingham, Walsall, Burton on Trent and Oldham. Bains use the title Chaudhry since they are Jats.</p>

<p><b>Facebows</b> are caliper-like devices commonly used in Removable Prosthodontics (Dentistry). They help to facilitate recording and transferring of information from the patient to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Articulator.html" title="Articulator">articulator</a> thus allowing the maxillary (upper) cast to be mounted onto the articulator. However, it has nothing to do with orientating the mandibular cast with the articulator - as sucj, it is not a "true" Maxillo-mandibular record.</p>
<p>Their main function is to record the relationship of the jaws to the opening axis of the jaws (hinge axis), and orient the casts in the same relationship to the opening axis of the articulator; it does this by locating the bite fork relative to 3 reference points (1 anterior and 2 posterior reference points). The anterior reference point is the orbital margin and the posterior reference point is the skin over the condyles for the Conventional facial facebow. For the Conventional earpiece facebow, the anterior reference point is the nasion area, and the posterior references are the external auditory meatus.</p>
<p>Without a facebow record, errors in the inclination and positioning of the maxillary cast will manifest as errors in achieving balanced articulation of the denture in situ.</p>

<p><b>1. Kinematic</b> This face bow type is more accurate and relies on several tracings on the path of the condyle to determine the exact location of the intercondylar hinge axis. However, it is technically demanding and time consuming and as such is not a popular choice amongst new dentists.</p>
<p><b>2. Conventional</b> This face now is the more common type used; it utilizes population averages to predict the position of the condyle as being ~12mm along a hypothetical line drawn from the tragus to the canthus of the eye. This may lead to a slight inaccuracy when locating the transverse hinge axis as not everyone follows the population mean. However, it still manages to produce excellent results when used properly.</p>
<p>Types of conventional facebows include 'Ear piece face bows' (e.g. Whipmix facebow) where the external auditory meatus is used as the posterior landmark and the 'facial face bows' where the condyles on the side of the face are utilized as posterior anatomical landmarks (e.g. Dentatus face bow).</p>

<p>As <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainframe_computer.html" title="Mainframe computer">Mainframe computer</a> users looked to move away from mainframes including Unisys ones, Asysco has provided services to move to more modern platforms. They are recognised as a partner in the Mainframe Migration Alliance (<a href="http://www.mainframemigration.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.mainframemigration.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mainframemigration.org/</a>) and as a partner with Microsoft (<a href="http://members.microsoft.com/CustomerEvidence/search/ListCompany.aspx?PageMode=2" class="external free" title="http://members.microsoft.com/CustomerEvidence/search/ListCompany.aspx?PageMode=2" rel="nofollow">http://members.microsoft.com/CustomerEvidence/search/ListCompany.aspx?PageMode=2</a>).</p>
<p>A lot of this consists of migrating customers' <a href="../../../c/o/b/COBOL_14eb.html" title="COBOL">COBOL</a> code. However, for LINC customers to move to Windows they have <b>Lion</b>. The introduction of this product meant that Asysco now competed directly with Unisys for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> customers in addition to selling complementary products and services.</p>
<p>Asysco has many stories of successful migrations. At the same time, they have many customers who use their services and support-tools while continuing to use LINC, either on a mainframe or on Windows.</p>

<p>Senator Rose Ann Vuich was the first woman to the CA State Senate. Elected in 1976, she served four consecutive terms through 1992.</p>
<p>When elected there were no restrooms nearby for her to use. A restroom near the Senate Chamber was designated ‚ÄúThe Rose Room‚Äù in Senator Vuich‚Äôs honor and is the only room in the Capitol named after a woman.</p>
<p>As of, October 2006 there is no women‚Äôs restroom‚Äôs on the USA Senate floor. In 2006 there were 14 women Senators ‚Äì AK U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R), AR U.S. Sen.

<p>New York State had a law, if a building had to have 2 restrooms, and HAD TO HAVE 2 URINALS AND 2 STOOLS. The result was the Men's restroom had 2 urinals and 1 stool, and the women's restroom had only 1 stool. The law was later changed.</p>

<p>Radical moderatism holds that most political issues and questions are unscientific, unanswerable, or irrelevant. It differs from <a href="../../../m/o/d/Moderate_%28politics%29.html" title="Moderate (politics)">moderatism</a> in that the latter tends to mild-manneredly emphasize compromise, the merits of political arguments from all sides, and the status quo. Radical moderatism, as the name suggests, urges radical rejection of contemporary political priorities, while asserting that government-regulated <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a> cannot be optimized and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_issues.html" title="Social issues">social issues</a> cannot be <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morally.html" title="Morally">morally</a> or <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethically</a> decided.</p>

<p>Radical moderates are often frustrated with contemporary politics in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic.html" title="Democratic">democratic</a> countries because they disagree with political rhetoric that ranges from issue-based partisan sloganeering to extremism. Some think of mainstream politicians confident in their own views on an issue as unreasonably self-righteous. To many radical moderates, variations of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a> are the ideal manifestation of radical moderate beliefs. Because governments cannot effectively solve political problems, they should not try.</p>
<p>Other radical moderates cite political reality in advocating the election of moderate candidates. One strategy they hope to implement is to vote in primaries in favor of the most moderate candidate, so that mainsteam <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_party.html" title="Political party">parties'</a> moderate candidates have a better chance of winning <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_elections.html" title="Primary elections">primaries</a>.</p>
