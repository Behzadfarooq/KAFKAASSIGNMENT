<p>I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue. The term "Vanity" seems very innapropriate, in that the motivation for posting the Maximum Cultural Development (MCD) article is rooted in an appreciation for mankinds ability to adapt to his/her environment.</p>
<p><b>Premises:</b> All things enduring move through (4) progressive phases... These four (4) phases are: development, establishment, maintenance, and refinement...</p>
<p>Almost everything we see around us is at different stages in this process. Understanding this basic, universal concept empowers the knower with the ability to successfully architect positive change. This process also includes ourselves as people. What phase are we oriented towards as individuals, and/or as a group of people? What phase does your personal every day life reflect?</p>
<p>Though we as individuals come and go, we have the blessed opportunity of leaving behind us things that endure for those to come after us, our children... For our young ones to survive and thrive with dignity, it is up to each and every one of us to contribute in some way to the heritage, legacy, and culture that will be looked upon by those of us to come.</p>
<p><b>The concept of Culture, when fully understood is a very powerful one...</b> It should be noted that even an elaborate inventory of the parts and traits of a culture cannot adequately characterize it. Cultures have organization as well as content. Emphasis on some features as opposed others and the total interrelation of the isolable parts has much to do with the distinctive properties of a culture, in addition to the way they work together as a system. Many definitions have been submitted by scholars from many countries, from all fields of social and biological science and the humanities and in aggregate form the foundational basis for this article. Those herein are contemporary since this is the focus of the topic.</p>
<p>Culture: is the complex system of meaning and behavior that defines the way of life for a given group or society. It includes beliefs, values, knowledge, art, morals, laws, habits, language, and dress. Culture includes ways of thinking as well as patterns of behavior. Observing culture involves studying what people think, how they interact, and the objects they make and use.</p>
<p>The second emphasizes culture as a comprehensive totality and enumerates aspects of culture content. Franz Boas: “Culture embraces all the manifestations of social habits of a community, the reactions of the individual as affected by the habits of the group in which he/she lives, and the products of human activities as determined by these habits.” The third is built on the feature of social inheritance. Ralph Linton: “As a general term, culture means the total social heredity of man-kind, while as a specific term, a culture means a particular strain of social heredity.”</p>
<p>The fourth emphasizes culture as a way of life, a design for living. Paul Sears: “The way in which the people in any group do things, make and use tools, get along with one another and with other groups, the words they use and the way they use them to express thoughts, and the thoughts they think...”</p>
<p>The fifth is psychological in the sense that processes such as adjustment, learning, and habit are single out. Culture as a problem-solving device is stressed. Ralph Piddington: “The culture of a people may be defined as the sum total of the material and intellectual equipment whereby they satisfy their biological and social needs and adapt themselves to their environment.”</p>
<p>The sixth identifies as central the patterning or organization of culture, and its systemic quality. John Gillin: “Culture consists of patterned and functionally interrelated customs common to specifiable human beings composing specifiable social groups or categories.” The seventh and final definition used here focuses on culture as an accumulated product of group life. Kimball Young: “A precipitate of man’s social life.”</p>
<p>Wikipedia itself comfortably falls within the MCD framework with a stated mission of providing free and open access to knowledge resources (assets) for all... Its also reflects adherence to the above stated four phase process.</p>
<p>Wikipedia strays from the process, however, through its rampant merging of vaild, free-standing, concepts (articles) which represent Reusable Learning Assets (RLAs). A classic manifestation of european hegemony...</p>
<p>Maximum Cultural Development warrants that: "We must be producers of culture, not passive consumers of it. Cultural development must be intentional and proactive, focused on clear and valid goals with a concrete vision of how to attain them. We are inundated by language, symbols, ideas, and technology, none of which is neutral. We must therefore define where we stand with regard to them and adopt appropriate intellectual and behavioral responses, if we are to be champions and not victims."</p>
<p>May we all be blessed with deeper understanding. Thank you for allowing me to share... <i>Marcus William Tremble</i>--<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodestream_d3cb.html" title="User:Codestream">Codestream</a> 10:17, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
