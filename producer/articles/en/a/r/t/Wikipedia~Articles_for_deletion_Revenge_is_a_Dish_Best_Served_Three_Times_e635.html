<dd>It's in the <b>COPYRIGHT DATABASE</b>. Even if this article is deleted, it will just be recreated in a month, so I don't see the point. Don't believe me? Go here: <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/records/" class="external free" title="http://www.copyright.gov/records/" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyright.gov/records/</a> and search for this: PAu-3-027-449. Besides, whats the difference between this page and the half dozen other future Simpsons episode pages? Or the dozens of future episode pages from other shows?
<dl>
<dd>I don't doubt that there WILL be a <i>Simpsons</i> episode called "Revenge is a Dish Best Served Three Times," and that in the not-too-distant future, the article under discussion will be WP-worthy. The problem is that <i>right now</i>, this article is not worthy of being on WP, and judging by Google, it will not be for some time. Having a page of nothing but grade-D prognostication reflects badly on the incredibly well-documented pages for other <i>Simpsons</i> episodes. No Homers Club is calling WP a <a href="http://nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=55871" class="external text" title="http://nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=55871" rel="nofollow">"bad media source"</a>, right alongside <i>The Sun</i> (!) and TV.com (!!). We're better than that.</dd>
<dd>Besides, it's not like <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guess_Who%27s_Coming_to_Criticize_Dinner__25c0.html" title="Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?">it takes four hours</a> to recreate the page once more details are released... --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenohockey_178b.html" title="User:Zenohockey">zenohockey</a> 02:58, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

It's the COPYRIGHT DATABASE. You can't get more official than that. I hardly see how this is tabloid-esque speculation. It's not like it says anything unlikely or extremely speculative.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Quick Wiki lesson: if no information is available other than the title, anything within it will be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which gets deleted. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, even if an event will happen, we can't have an article based entirely on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> speculation. Yes, it will in all likelihood be aired, but <i>at this moment</i> there is no information available about it, leading to comments like this on the page:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>No plot is available yet, although the episode name suggests it will be about revenge and possibly Sideshow Bob (although Kelsey Grammer has not been announced as a guest star for this season) or Artie Ziff (Jon Lovitz HAS been announced for this season). The title also suggests that it could be an episode with three different stories.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That comment should be removed because it is just unsourced speculation. This will leave the article completely blank, essentially throwing it up for a CSD A1. When verifiable information is available, the article can be recreated. Remember everyone, <i><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.</a></i> --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:15, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So how come The Mook, The Chef, the Wife and Her Homer, Please Homer Don't Hammer 'Em and several more episodes were not up for deletion when we knew squat about them? There are several we still know nothing about and nobody's rushing to put there articles up for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Listing Wikipedia as a bad sources disclaimer is because anyone can edit it, and it was added following the addition of an obviously fake title (Simpsons Christmas Stories II), and the last time I checked that page was still there. Just because somebody rightfully said that things posted on this website should be taken with a grain of salt, doesn't mean you can delete an article. It's in the copyright database, IT IS AN OFFICIAL TITLE.</p>
<p>What is the point of deleting an article when in a few weeks it will just be recreated?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Scorpion0422, it will be created eventually. - <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamravenscroft_a1e0.html" title="User:Adamravenscroft">Adamravenscroft</a> 18:03, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not speculation. Although in future maybe new episode articles should only be created when there is a description. The episode is listed on the Season 18 page. Scott 17:01, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There's nothing to be gained by deleting this article, even though I'm in agreement that it should have not been created at this time. -- Boonjava 17:27, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> --<a href="../../../i/o/s/User%7EIossed_349b.html" title="User:Iossed">Iossed</a> 05:53, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>; if someday there'll be an episode, the article can be easily recreated; for now it should be removed, also to not encourage such practices.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 11:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for now. The fact that it's in a copyright database is meaningless: episodes change names in planning stages. Also bogus is the argument that it'll just be recreated - that's why we have a CSD for previously-deleted material. Salting the earth is also possible. Per Aldux, the article can be recreated when there's actually material. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 14:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd really love to know why we never get this sort of argument about any other episode we know nothing about!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would too, because as I pointed out, there are at least four other SImpsons episode pages that are similar. And not to mention the fact that TWO fake episode pages existed for several months wothout being deleted! (Simpson Christmas Stories II and Simpson Witches). I hardly see why this page is worth targetting. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion0422</a> 20:54, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If this page is deleted, the precedent it would set would prevent future fake-episode pages. And if there are currently any future-episode pages with as little real information as this one, they should be deleted too. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenohockey_178b.html" title="User:Zenohockey">zenohockey</a> 21:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Entirely agreed. The fact that we miss some is <i><b>not</b></i> to be taken as condoning others. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 23:47, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
