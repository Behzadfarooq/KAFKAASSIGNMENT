<p>Middle schools are generally not notable, generally it is only high schools that are listed. I find no reason why this school has any reason to be listed based on its notability.

<p>This isn't a <i>brochure</i>, it gives information to people who may be moving to Redondo Beach and are in the area of going to Adaams not Parras. Or for 5th and 6th graders going to Adams.

<p>one thing,TheArbiter-our class did not try so hard on this-our class is trying so hard on this. we won't stop until it is either deleted or we can keep it!support me!Sharku828 I agree with TheArbiter-not everyone may know that adams middle school even exists-like my family. we just moved this year and did not know about adams middle school. someone may be looking at the rubsd site on wikipedia and will see the link to adams site- then they can learn more about adams.it not like we are putting the entire adams website on wikipedia-and it is still being made. its kinda hard though-people keep vandalizing it.we have been working so hard on it at school-this is the first time making a web page for almost all of the class. please don't delete it.

<li>I sugest not merging the article with <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redondo_Beach_Unified_School_District_6949.html" title="Redondo Beach Unified School District">Redondo Beach Unified School District</a> because that article links to the pages about schools in that area, If someone had the time they could rewrite that article and put in all the schools mentioned into it. But I doubt anyone would because its fine right now... TheArbiter-- Try to make this more formal, look at some other middle school wiki's, this would help you understand how make this formal. If this doesnt have a major edit, i would say this should be deleted... Anyway, most school have their own website, if you want to make one about the middle school ask a teacher...</li>

<p>well, this is our first time, and so we wont be perfect. we have worked really hard on this and are still working on it. we've only been working on it for about a week, and most of that was spent figuring out how to edit the page.Sharku828</p>

<p>I think that our article is okay for the first time of our doing a wikipedia page...we are currently working on it, so it will get better. myself, i am making a part that has pictures of the classes and the campus.that was what "life at adams" was going to be-it was not done when it was deleted.Sharku828 01:29, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> needs work (especially on the tone) and expansion, but for an article created less than 24 hours ago it goes a long way to fulfilling the requirements for a middle school article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Let me just say that what is important is the consensus among all Wikipedians, not among schoolwatch this is a very <b>alarming statement</b> and not at all in the spirt of wikipedia goals. I visted the link to Schoolwatch and found no discussion as to what are notable or what is not. All I found were a list of AfD's current and a past AfD's with results totaled by month list with totals by month. As to its point of view I found this statement right at top of page <b>"the terms 'keep' and 'no consensus' are used interchangeably (as no consensus defaults to keep)."</b> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRanger_6fb8.html" title="User:TheRanger">TheRanger</a> 16:00, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Something to say about the arguement above is the fact that to complete the <b>Redondo Beach Unified School District</b> page is the fact that <b>all</b> the schools would have to be merged to make the page complete, and that would make the page too long to be practical. thats one thing to think about. another is the fact that merging the page would take an extremely long time to merge it, and the page would seem awkward without the other schools, relating to the arguement as stated by myself above. to make the <b>rbusd</b> site seem complete, you would have to <b>make</b> a page for the schools that do not have a page, and merge the ones that do have a page, and as said, it would be too long to be feasible.Sharku828 17:46, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
