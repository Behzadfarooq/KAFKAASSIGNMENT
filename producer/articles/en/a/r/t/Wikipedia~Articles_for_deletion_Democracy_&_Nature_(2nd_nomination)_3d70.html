<p>I'm renominating this for delete. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Democracy_%26_Nature_5afc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Democracy &amp; Nature">previous nomination</a> ended in no consensus. However, since then both the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclusive_Democracy_d5d9.html" title="Inclusive Democracy">Inclusive Democracy</a> page and the International Journal on Inclusive Democracy have been deleted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_International_Journal_of_Inclusive_Democracy_0ad9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy">on the 25th of December, 2005</a>. The International Journal on Inclusive Democracy is that same publication as Democracy &amp; Nature, when they changed editors they changed names. It seems the whole group of these three articles has been little more than vanity pushing of a relatively unknown ideology and this article is little more than a list of their issues and authors. It should be deleted per the discussion on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_International_Journal_of_Inclusive_Democracy_0ad9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy</a> and the first nomination, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Democracy_%26_Nature_5afc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Democracy &amp; Nature">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Democracy &amp; Nature</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/b/a/User%7EJbamb_757a.html" title="User:Jbamb">Jbamb</a> 14:21, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> a journal of which 17 issues were published, and for which there is no reliable evidence of any widespread currency. Many of these journals are vehicles for vanity - there is no evidence on which to weigh whether this one is or not, because much of what is said about it is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. A journal can publish an article by anyone through syndication or by paying them - do we have any evidence of whether the illustrious contributors thhought this a credible journal? Whether they submitted to the journal or whether they were approached for a piece of editorial? What the peer-review process was? Taylor &amp; Francis stopped printing it after five issues; is that a sign of a significant journal? Plus, the reaction of the "editorial board" is a clear violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 16:49, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>All the above ‘facts’ are FALSE indicating that it is through blatant lies that some try to have the journal deleted! First, the journal D&amp;N (formerly Society and Nature) has published not 17 but 27 issues in its over 11 years history. <a href="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.democracynature.org/dn/index.htm</a>. Second, the ‘illustrious contributors’ have submitted many articles, as anybody can easily find out by just checking the link above. Third, Taylor &amp; Francis stopped publishing it after five VOLUMES , not issues, as Just zis Guy, you know? [T]/[C] ‘discovered’ voting for delete, followed by SarekOfVulcan. Of course, we do not expect that the above real facts will make any of these ‘neutral’ users to change their mind! <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarap43_5b27.html" title="User:Narap43">User:Narap43</a>, 11:46, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Postscript</b> - On the matter of why the publisher dropped them, it could be related to the resignation of Murray Bookchin &amp; Janet Biehl from the editorial/advisory board <a href="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol3/biehl_bookchin.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol3/biehl_bookchin.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>: long time lags between political and business effects are not uncommon in journal publishing. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 02:28, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good detective work! The point however is that Bookchin and Biehl resigned in 1997, when D&amp;N was still published by its original publisher (Aigis publications) whereas Taylor and Francis started publishing the journal …two years later (in full knowledge of these events since, before deciding to take over from Aigis, they went through all the previous issues of the journal) and continued publishing it for another five years (i.e. another five volumes of 3 isuues each) when, according to our Sherlock Holmes, discovered that Bookchin and Biehl resigned and they were so shocked by this event that they stopped publication of the journal. Ingenious idea indeed! <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarap43_5b27.html" title="User:Narap43">User:Narap43</a>, 11:50, 4 January 2006, (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me outline a hypothetical scenario to make my point about time lags clear: one, the publisher hears about the resignation even before it is published; two, while the publisher is very concerned about the resignation, they decide to take a gamble on the new advisory board still working out; three, two years later they drop the journal when it becomes clear that the journal had lost a lot of credibility. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 13:47, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is not a hypothetical scenario but pure science fiction! I repeat: T&amp;F stopped publication not after two but after FIVE years of publication by them and SEVEN years after the Bookchin resignation. Second, can our Sherlock Holmes reply to the question why on earth a capitalist publisher like T&amp;F was so shocked by the resignation of Murray Bookchin when NO OTHER MEMBER OF THE EB has resigned since then but, instead, the EB expanded signigficantly since then (the same happened to the number of contributors and circulation)&#160;? And is the absence of Bookchin so signifibant when people like Sharon Beder, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Best_0f28.html" title="Steven Best">Steven Best</a>, Carl Boggs, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Bourdieu_5bf1.html" title="Pierre Bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</a>,<a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelius_Castoriadis_b492.html" title="Cornelius Castoriadis">Cornelius Castoriadis</a>, Dan Chodorkoff (who is the Director of Social Ecology created by him and Boochin!) , <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, Paul Ekins, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Gunder_Frank_4dce.html" title="Andre Gunder Frank">Andre Gunder Frank</a>, Arran Gare, Douglas Kellner, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serge_Latouche_55b0.html" title="Serge Latouche">Serge Latouche</a>, Brian Morris, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Pinter_87e1.html" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>, James Robertson, Ted Trainer-- among many others-- remained (or joined later) the EB?

<li><b>Comment</b>. Can any of the keepers tell me why this entry should be kept, but that the International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, the same journal, was deleted? The journal was published as Democracy &amp; Nature, then when it switched publishers a few years ago it became the International Journal on Inclusive Democracy. Same editors, same writers, same journal, one entry gets deleted, the other is magically notable?

<dd>It's the deletion etiquette policy. If you have skin in the game, your opinion is obviously biased. Apparently Paulcardan was once an editor of this journal. Would anyone take seriously a vote of someone who is the subject of a bio that is afd'd? Also, if you think it was wrong to delete the other article, feel free to recreate the article and try again but the consensus seemed clear then. -- <a href="../../../j/b/a/User%7EJbamb_757a.html" title="User:Jbamb">Jbamb</a> 17:36, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment. Jbamb's insistence on deleting the D&amp;N entry, using in the process a series of falsified "facts" like the above one on the affiliations of supporters of KEEP, as well as the statement that the Inclusive Democracy entry was deleted because it referred to "a relatively unknown ideology" and not because of a minor copyvio (from the Inclusive Democracy external link!) is very interesting indeed. The fact that this uknown (to him) ideology reserves a long entry in the Routledge Encyclopedia of International Economy presumably means to him that this is not as reliable an encyclopedia as the Wikipedia one! I wonder whether this insistence has anything to do with his interests as described in his own WP page!18:40, Dec. 31, 2005.</b></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: We aren't talking about those pages, we are talking about this one. Inclusive Democracy has been deleted, the International Journal on Inclusive Democracy has been deleted. There appears to be consesus on deleting The International Network on Inclusive Democracy. Everything associated with this is getting deleted. If all you have to defend this is assume I'm acting with bad faith, I think that says something about the inherent worth of these articles. I'm a latecomer into these debates, and I'm saying nothing about a dozen other people have already said. Those articles are getting deleted because of the non-noteworthiness of this theory. This page is no different. -- <a href="../../../j/b/a/User%7EJbamb_757a.html" title="User:Jbamb">Jbamb</a> 19:04, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment. Jbamb, it would have been much more honest not to pretend that you are a ‘neutral’ administrator on a deeply political topic belonging to the antisystemic Left when all your interests (and contributions) are on right wing-politics. The noteworthiness of this theory fortunately is not going to be judged by right-wingers who have the power, as administrators, to decide what should be and what should not be on encyclopaedias. At least, bourgeois encyclopaedias, like the one I mentioned above, (as well as the dozens of references to Inclusive Democracy you may find in books, journals --even in Google hits) have experts on the field who, even if they do not agree with the politics of what they assess, try to be as neutral as they can. Coming now to the new distorted ‘facts’ you presented above: I repeat, as it seems one has to repeat things to you so that you can assimilate them, that the Inclusive Democracy entry was deleted for a minor copyvio –nothing to do with non-noteworthiness. The International Journal on Inclusive Democracy was deleted after an obvious socketpuppet (currently under investigation) made an AfD, which is now recognised as an error by several administrators in their own WP pages. It is worthnoting that the decision to delete was taken by just two (2) votes in favor of delete, after all other votes to keep were discounted, on the dubious grounds that they were made by relatively new users (even if they were clearly more knowledgeable on the topic than the two administrators, who, like you, had no idea about it). A similar type of “consensus” is being attempted now with respect to the International Network on Inclusive Democracy. It is actions like yours that discredit Wikpedia and today the world press increasingly disputes the reliability of information it provides!19:47, Dec.31, 2005</b></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There has been no good faith practiced by 90% of the administrators. The originator of the deletes was discredited to be a sockpuppet and was to be banned. He never was and allowed to continue his attacks using other sockpuppets. Consequently, the 'neutral' administrators sided with him and the gangsterism commenced. Personal attacks is a matter of opinion. I can say that your personal attack against us is with your above comment depicting us as "nothing more than a kook patrol." You are not learning the history, so therefore you are repeating it. You are acting like a dictator with, "I'm about ready to move to get you all banned."

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Democracy_%26_Nature_%282nd_nomination%29_3d70.html" title="Edit section: ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF D&amp;N AND IJID">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF D&amp;N AND IJID</span></h4>
<p><i>removed</i> 1. We, the members of the Editorial Board of Democracy &amp; Nature (D&amp;N) and its present successor The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy (IJID) have, over the last few days, witnessed a concerted attack against the journal by an alliance of sockpuppets (who have been created by a disgruntled ex-member of the journal with a vendetta against us) and some administrators who are either apolitical (not in the sense of party politics but in the sense of a fundamental lack of understanding of politics in the broader sense) or who do not hide their hostility towards the Inclusive Democracy political agenda. This ‘unholy’ alliance has attempted to delete all Inclusive Democracy entries in Wikipedia and in some cases it has already succeeded in doing this.</p>
<p>2. The reasons for which Wikipedia have attempted to substantiate their AfDs range from silly WP copyright violations (from our own webpages!-- which, if applied to all WP entries, would lead to most of them being eclipsed) to arbitrary ‘assessments’ of the notability and significance of our entries. Such ‘assessments’ are given either by administrators who do not have any expertise on the topics they are assessing, or by others following their own political agenda which is at the opposite end of the political spectrum to the Inclusive Democracy project.</p>
<p>3. We find it humiliating, to say the least, to be subjected to this pseudo-democratic process which defames not only our journals, which have been honoured to have had as contributors and members of their Editorial Boards well-known writers such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Best_0f28.html" title="Steven Best">Steven Best</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Bookchin_794f.html" title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Bourdieu_5bf1.html" title="Pierre Bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelius_Castoriadis_b492.html" title="Cornelius Castoriadis">Cornelius Castoriadis</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takis_Fotopoulos_db26.html" title="Takis Fotopoulos">Takis Fotopoulos</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Gunder_Frank_4dce.html" title="Andre Gunder Frank">Andre Gunder Frank</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serge_Latouche_55b0.html" title="Serge Latouche">Serge Latouche</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Pinter_87e1.html" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>-- and many other equally important writers who do not have similar WP entries—but also our subscribers who have, in the past, included such notable institutions as Michigan State University, University of Maryland, University of Wisconsin, London School of Economics, University of Massachusetts, Stanford University, Simon Fraser University, Hamburg Library, University of New South Wales, University of Canterbury, Kent; Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal; Harvard College Library,Iinternational Institute of Social History, Amsterdam; Formazione ii Biblioteca, Palermo; Bath University and many others. Furthermore, we find this process equally humiliating to the authors of hundreds of references and citations to D&amp;N and IJID in books, journals, magazines, and electronic media.</p>
<p>4. Finally, we find appalling the fact that, through Wikipedia’s so-called assessment process, self-anointed administrators with no guarantee at all of any expertise in the fields they assess use their wide-ranging powers to decide which pieces of knowledge and information are appropriate enough to be included in Wikipedia. These powers include discounting the votes of registered users who are not long-established--even if their expertise is much more relevant to the topics assessed than that of the administrators, as the irrelevant comments of these administrators frequently show. These built-in fatal errors in assessment—only some of which have been mentioned--could go a long way in explaining the growing literature in the world press on the low standard of knowledge and information provided by Wikipedia.</p>
<p>5. When we created the WP Inclusive Democracy entries, we were functioning as bona fide users thinking that we were helping the development of a free and supposedly democratic encyclopaedia that could function as an alternative source of information to the established encyclopaedias. We were utterly disappointed when we discovered the irresponsible and completely unreliable way in which knowledge on important matters is supposedly created by this supposedly alternative encyclopaedia, which clearly will never reach the standards of the established encyclopaedias because of the fatal structural flaws mentioned. Therefore, the sooner it is disqualified as an authoritative source of knowledge, the better.</p>
<p>6. In light of the above we have decided the following:</p>
<p>a) to withdraw with immediate effect ALL the Inclusive Democracy entries from Wikipedia, including those that have been challenged only on account of trivial Wikipedia copyright violations, as well as those like the entry on the founder of Inclusive Democracy, <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takis_Fotopoulos_db26.html" title="Takis Fotopoulos">Takis Fotopoulos</a>, which has not been challenged by anyone during this whole process. b) to demand the banning of any new entry on the following topics: <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclusive_Democracy_d5d9.html" title="Inclusive Democracy">Inclusive Democracy</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_%26_Nature_3533.html" title="Democracy &amp; Nature">Democracy &amp; Nature</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_International_Journal_of_Inclusive_Democracy_3ccd.html" title="The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy">The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy</a>, The International Network for Inclusive Democracy and <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takis_Fotopoulos_db26.html" title="Takis Fotopoulos">Takis Fotopoulos</a>.

<li><b>Comment from an outsider</b>. Before anyone pounces on me, I'm just one of the guys that reviews the AfD nominations and closes them when appropriate. The discussion above, if it can be called a discussion, is out of place. Parts of it should be conducted in the article's talk page, other parts in personal talk pages. The editorial board announcement is so terribly out of place that I should remove it outright. I'm trying to find a way not to close this as "no consensus" but it's very hard. As I see it, this is not a problem of notability but of verifiability and control of content (please correct me if I'm wrong). If a journal is published over years and receives contributions from notable people, then it's notable. But if the only way to verify anything about it is by consulting the editors, and moreover, if the editors want to have control of the Wikipedia coverage of the journal and the concepts it presents, then we have a serious problem. I can only suggest that everybody calms down and think of a suitable compromise. If you can't compromise, then this article will have to go. <b>Legal threats, editorial pronouncements, and accusations of any kind not backed up by policy and immediately accessible evidence will not be tolerated.</b> Just for the record, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a democracy</a>. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li><b>Comment</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder how Pablo D. Flores derived his ‘wise’ conclusion that the problem is one of verifiability and control. All that the Editorial Board stressed was something that for everybody else (outside Wikipedia!) is self-evident: i.e., primarily, the authentic source of information about the history of the journal, as I suppose the authentic source of information on an article on the history of the New York Times, is its editors and not any user, even if he worked for the journal for a couple of years. Also, the primary source of information on Inclusive Democracy could only be its founder and his associates, as similarly the primary source of information on social ecology could only be its founder and his associates. This does not mean that editing to add information, provided it is reliable, should not be allowed. If that were the case, the editors would not have created this WP entry in the first instance. But, it is one thing to edit in order to add reliable information and quite another to distort the FACTUAL information given by the editors themselves, or to add malicious misinformation etc, as it happened in this case. And the WP rules about negotiation, arbitration, etc. are completely irrelevant. Why the Editors of NYT will ‘negotiate’ with a malicious editor on an encyclopedia entry on their own newspaper? In any other encyclopedia such problems are solved through expertise and specialized knowledge on editing any entry. This does not of course secure ‘objectivity’, but at least rules out malicious and distorted editing. In Wikipedia even this seems impossible since it establishes ‘equal right’ of any user, without distinguishing between editors who have more qualifications to give an accurate description, particularly on factual matters, and every other user. As an astute user stresses on the matter: “The danger in wikipedia is that secondary readers of secondary sources can become primary editors! …Truth lies in the eye of the beholder! Since that article and many others after, my faith in wikipedia as a reliable source with universal value has been questioned, and I can't trust the "anyone can edit" principle anymore” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chazz88#enlighten_me_about_objectivity_in_wikipedia_.28and_thks_for_welcoming.29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chazz88#enlighten_me_about_objectivity_in_wikipedia_.28and_thks_for_welcoming.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chazz88#enlighten_me_about_objectivity_in_wikipedia_.28and_thks_for_welcoming.29</a> john sargis 19:03, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I vote for <b>delete</b> as violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; an extra reason would be the apparently unsolvable issue of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. I must say I considered closing this as "no consensus", but I believe that would have been unfair. All articles should be subject to the same standards. If this nomination fails, I suggest further discussion is conducted at the article's talk page before re-nominating it. However, <b>if this nomination is disrupted again</b> by personal attacks, rants about Wikipedia's ideology, or any of the other ways in which it has been disrupted above already, I <i>will</i> block the offending user(s), protect the page to avoid an edit war, and re-nominate it myself. I refuse to believe this might be necessary. We're all adults (I think). --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li><b>Comment</b> Pablo D. Flores makes it clear that no criticism of Wikpedia’s ideology is allowed and he threatens blocking any offender. And yet he goes on to accuse us that, what we requested, amounts to the violation of the WP rule that articles should not be subject to the same standards (a rule that presumably does not apply to the administrators’ comments!) In fact, however, we never asked anything of the sort. We simply argued that for Wikipedia to survive, as criticisms about the reliability of the information it provides grow in the world press, it should change its own standards: i.e. a way has to be found so that primary editors’ views are not offset by those of secondary or tertiary –even malicious--editors. This is a bona fide advice. Since you have the power at your hands you can of course ban me but the future will show who is right and who was all along wrong! john sargis 9:16, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm closing this as "no consensus". The AfD process has been turned into a farce. I urge editors who voted above to come back to AfD, since I'm going to re-nominate this. I have blocked john sargis for 24 hours for disruption and seeming inability or unwillingness to understand what WP policies are about. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.
