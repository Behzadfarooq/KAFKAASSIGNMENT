<li><b>Keep</b> - As far as I can tell, this information is not widely available, and I can personally testify that most of the info here is original and not a cut-and-paste job. NOTE: While I'd be fine with a merge and <b>slight</b> condensation of the episode summaries (although EP 49 is the only one that seems like problematic to me), I think too much deletion (such as reducing it all to a general season by season account) would be going too far. Because RvB is broken up into so many small episodes, it's good to have information as to what happens in each individual episode so you know what you've missed if you don't have the entire set (which alot of people don't). Someone's already streamlined the descriptions considerably, I think it's fine the way it stands. Joylock 2:00, 15 April 2005.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The precedent for episode guides/lists is well established. It serves no purpose to strip an episode “guide” down to an episode “list” as a list of titles is virtually useless information, while a guide can provide useful encyclopedic information. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiros_d433.html" title="User:Miros">Miros</a> 9:25, 16 April 2005

<li><b>Comment</b> Also, some web cartoons such as the Homestar Runner set have entire articles devoted to single characters.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree, it's easy to be excessive with things like this. But I would also argue that it does have some value, and so long as it's confined to a relatively small number of pages, it does more good than harm. And as far as the articles being needed or unneeded, I see that as a poor way of looking at things. There are plenty of legit articles on wikipedia that nobody <i>needs</i> but there are plenty of articles that people find <i>useful</i>. I certainly think that this has the potential to be useful to some people for some of the good reasons people have already pointed out. And as long as it's useful to some, and harmless to everyone else (since we are talking about 3 total articles here), the obvious greater benefit is to keep it. Without it, there is no benefit to anybody. With it, there is no harm, and benefit to some. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiros_d433.html" title="User:Miros">Miros</a> 20:06, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's a sad, sad day that reflects the fundamental flaws of Wikipedia when a amateur web comic about a video game made by a couple of fanboys gets four pages of fancruft, while a perfectly legitimate art movement THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS IN REAL FRICKIN' LIFE gets VFD out of existence just because there aren't thousands of rabid fanboys on the internet smearing it all around.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just because some of your legit content got VfD'd (wrongfully or otherwise) does not mean you should go on a crusade against whatever content you feel you can blast out of existance.

<li><b>Comment</b> RvB is more than just "a amateur web comic about a video game made by a couple of fanboys". It is an example of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machinima.html" title="Machinima">machinima</a>, an emerging artform if ever there was one. If anything it gave machinima new direction, showing that episode based series are more successful than singular long movies. It also gave a lot more exposure to machinima. Some of the people behind RvB have television production experience. Its not just 'fanboys' standing around recording themselves ingame going "bang bang you're dead stooopid! Dur hur hur!". Hell, the people behind the series aren't even very good at the games.--<a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDooMDrat_775a.html" title="User:DooMDrat">DooMDrat</a> 18:50, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, I'm assume that's true, and I'll conceed that RvB is professional made. I'll even let it be said that it's quality-comparable to mainstream TV shows (certainly, the resolution is higher). Because the point remains that excessive coverage of it is still excessive. Take the <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a> page. A brief description about the show, the stars, and the general impact on pop culture. That's all there is. That's all that's needed. That's all there should be. Do we really need to know Kramer's favorite blend of cigar, all of Jerry's personal issues, or what a friggin Soup Nazi is? Remember, compare <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_art.html" title="African art">African art</a> to <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_La_%28song%29_b275.html" title="La La (song)">La La</a>, and see the fundamental flaw in Wikipedia's design. 166.666.666.011</li>

<li>Well, your point now looks a whole lot more valid. But the fact of the matter is, people care more about some stuff than others, and people mostly write about stuff they know/care about. Maybe nerds, fans, and gamers are overrepresented online, but nothing stops anyone from expanding neglected topics. Furthermore, more is simply a lot better than less, when it comes to content. Despite this flaw and others, Wikipedia is still the best encyclopedia we've got, and it's free. -<a href="../../../l/t/n/User%7ELtNOWIS_fcfd.html" title="User:LtNOWIS">LtNOWIS</a> 21:20, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If I may comment, that's precisely the point. The encyclopdia is in as good as shape as it is because people have fought to keep this fancruft out, to a large extent. An article describing the show, fine, but the actual article of Red Vs. Blue along with three seperately huge episode guides goes too far.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">The</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheGrza_ecac.html" title="User talk:TheGrza"><font color="green">Grza</font></a> 21:48, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Respectfully, I have to totally disagree with anonymous. Take Seinfeld, for example. There IS an article about the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soup_Nazi_b05d.html" title="Soup Nazi">Soup Nazi</a>, and I believe that it is perfectly appropriate. The phrase was huge back in the 90's. It's more than just mere "pop culture". It's hard to put into words, but it's like it's become part of our society's collective social dialogue. Also, without the dedicated article to <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmo_Kramer_eef9.html" title="Cosmo Kramer">Cosmo Kramer</a>, I would have never learned that he was based on a <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Kramer_ffb5.html" title="Kenny Kramer">real guy</a>. Sure, that info might not save anyone's life or bring them enlightenment or cure cancer or get them to vote for the <i>right</i> candidate or get involved in the <i>right</i> social issues, but it is <i>interesting</i> and informative and not hurting anyone. If you think an article is poorly written with embarassing or unprofessional grammer or outright lies, you can always edit it. As LtNOWIS said, nothing stops you from expanding neglected topics you think are worthwhile. But if you want to actually delete topics because you think that the information in an article is just "useless", than you might just be imposing your own POV on something you don't know all that much about. Who's to say <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a> is any less worthy of coverage than <a href="../../../g/%C3%B6/d/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorem.html" title="Gödel's incompleteness theorem">Gödel's incompleteness theorem</a>? Both provide information that is useful to different types of people. RvB isn't some vanity page about some brief animation a bunch of neighborhood kids cooked up in their basement for their friends. It's not a neighborhood cafe frequented by at most three dozen people. It's a professionally made piece of media with a HUGE following on the internet numbering on the hundreds of thousands.

<dd>Also, as far as Wikipedia standards go, the article on Red vs. Blue is very restrained, very conservative. All the information on the show is merged into one single article that just gives a brief summary of the story and a couple paragraphs for each character, which is not unreasonable seeing as how the show so heavily revolves around the characters. Compare that to, say, the <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a> article that has information about the show's fictional politics, religion, and seperate articles for each character.

<li><b>Delete</b> While I personally think that good long bibliographies would be a good thing for Wikipedia, I think that they should be incorporated into articles.

<li>Accordingly I have edited the article to read the following: "Derek Cheater is a derogatory nickname for New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter." IMO, it still should be removed. First of all, it is an orphaned Talk page. Secondly, this nickname doesn't have enough currency to deserve a redirect, much less a page of its own. Google shows only 117 hits. Compare to derisive Bush nicknames Commander Codpiece and Whistle Ass each of which shows well over a thousand hits and both of which the consensus on <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> was to delete rather than redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._Presidential_nicknames_f422.html" title="List of U.S. Presidential nicknames">List of U.S. Presidential nicknames</a>. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 10:46, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Vandalized? That is a little rude. I justified my changes in my edit summary, and my edits were in good faith. Abu Ghraib didn't orignally use Template:Photo warning, but rather Template:Morbid warning, which is the same as the current Photo warning, but it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Deleted/Archive/Feb05&amp;redirect=no#Template:morbid_warning" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Deleted/Archive/Feb05&amp;redirect=no#Template:morbid_warning" rel="nofollow">deleted</a>. The consensus was that the Abu Ghraib article would not use a template for its link to the censored version. A primary argument was that the existance of the template would encourage the creation of other censored articles. I did not realize that the link in Abu Ghraib had been replaced with the template in violation of that decision. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 14:42, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Would you please discontinue your overt hostility towards me, I'd prefer a civil discussion. I think it is probably useful to have a warning of the explicit nature of such pages, and I believe there was such a warning on on the article before that template was used. I was not attempting to ruin it so that it would be deleted but rather, I made two changes which I believed would improve it. I changed the wording to reduce a POV slant, and I removed the no pictures link because disabling images is the only sure way to not see naked pictures. I'm well aware of the TFD page, and would have nominated it myself if I felt that was clearly the best path at this time. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 15:48, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>There was a proposed addition to mediawiki in the past to provide a navigation button to disable images easily (eh, well I can't find the cite, but other people tell me I am remembering correctly). It was overwhelmingly denied. The process of creating a (no pictures) version of Oral sex is a substantially POV pushing action because it says that the encyclopedia has an opinion of what content is 'right' and what is 'wrong'. I would support an easy to use hide image button in the main navigation, but the creation of special no images pages is harmful (encourages forking and censorship, since the *text* is explicit as well so a Oral sex (no thought crime) is the obvious next step. I also oppose the semi-fork as it cruds the database, and because it encourages POV pushing in links (changing links to the censored version)). Also the (no pictures) version would be a huge target for vandalism, as someone could easily stick a shocking picture at the top and really surprise people who though they were safe. Finally, since it is not possible to edit Oral sex without looking at the pictures, we are effectively telling people that don't want to see nudies that we don't want them editing wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 15:08, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No vote. Comment:</b> The reason anyone would want this is not to prevent <i>themselves</i> from being offended, but so that it is safe to view in a public or semi-public place (school, library, work, at home with young children or paranoid parents). And while people can browse with images off, some people may not know how to, and in any case it's inconvenient. On the other hand, having it for an individual article is an ugly hack and perhaps bad precedent. I personally think there should be an option when browsing Wikipedia to not view any images inline, which would be much cleaner (no pun intended) and more effective. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">Nickptar</a> 12:46, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Right which is why I pointed out in the VFD that it's not technically a fork... although the practice encourages forking as now Woman on top sex position (no pictures) which is actually a fork, and even fails to link back to the orignal and is biased in what pictures it removes. Creating no pictures links for some articles and not others is POV. People who want a no pictures option need to start a vote for that feature. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 16:06, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>End-user image suppression is currently on hold because of technical and design problems.

<dd>It is a second article on the subject of oral sex. It is based on the article <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>. It is not exactly the same as the article <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>. Therefore, it is a fork of the original article. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 18:27, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The only time I edited Oral Sex was after this page was voted Delete here and I'd spoken to an administrator about archiving the discussion. Had it been my intention to orphan it in bad faith, I would have not let it sit for a week. My edit to the template was made without complete understanding of the template, and without realizing it was in use elseware because I was in the middle of doing RC patrol. For that I am sorry. I have left it alone since that discussion. I think it is wrong to force decisions on articles by deleting their content via TFD and IFD, or to hide something that should be deleted by removing a link. As far as the fork issue, I was clear in the nomination that it is not a true fork. ... I imagine those voting delete because it is a fork voted that way because it is a fork in spirit if not technically--<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:52, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with Korath. Gmaxwell's behavior could be interpreted as somewhat trollish, and I am sure that isn't the impression he wants to give. I hope he will reconsider his actions. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:35, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would to suggest, without the intention of offending, that you have failed to completely investigate the timeline of the events here before drawing your conclusion. I ran across the article on recent changes, saw the template directing to the no pictures version. I found the previously TFDed morbid photo warning template (by searching for the content of the template to figure out how it worked) and saw that it was deleted because (in part) it encouraged making forks/quasi forks. I adjusted the template to fit that concern (and did not remove it because I thought the warning was useful on the page). I then noticed that the Oral Sex (no pictures) page was actually a real page (I had previously thought it was a sideeffect for the template). I put it up for VFD. I was then told that the prisoner abuse used the template too... I'd missed that because when morbid warning was TFDed it was decided not to use a template by rather to include the text in the article. After that point I allowed the template to be reverted and left it alone. After this articles VFD timer expired with a clear delete decision, I talked to an admin about closing the VFD and I went and removed the template from the Oral Sex page. I presume this VFD has yet to be closed and archived because the debate restarted today after I yanked the template last night. After removing the template from Oral sex, I went to see if anything else was still using it, and then followed the link to the prisoner abuse article to read up on the discussion there.. After being confused by the history page, I realized that it was a copyright violation and followed the procedure for reporting it. In further discussion with Korath, I have discovered that it's possible to fix the copyright issue without removing the page... but I have to impliment that change because I am concerned by the fact that my intentions are being questioned. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:28, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, firstly I'm sorry if I've misrepresented what you did. Secondly, I've no idea what you did or what state the whole silly thing is in now--which templates exist or do not exist, or whatever. Thirdly couldn't we just revert the whole silly thing to the way it was a week or two ago and pretend it never happened?

<li>Comment: I think this was a good idea in principle, but it may have been abandoned. Literary criticism identifies various common themes, and it would be a good idea to list these themes, explain them briefly and give examples.

The obvious problem of the subjectivity of the list (I am personally appalled that the Jimi Hendrix version of the Star Spangled Banner comes in the bottom half).

<p>I've redone the entire page, wikified and listed correctly all the artists and songs, so I think all of these votes need to be recast because this is an entirely differently article then the one voted upon. As to my vote, I don't know how good the title of the article is, perhaps moved to Guitar World's 100 Greatest Guitar Solos would satisfy some, but piss others off even more, so I don't know about that solution. As for the notability of both Guitar World and the list, I think that if we can have a mess of oversized pages devoted to Halo fan-art which are completely acceptable and somehow don't cross into the non-notable or advertising realms then I think this one can stay. Especially because of the huge pain in the ass it was for me to rewrite it all in Wiki. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">The</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheGrza_ecac.html" title="User talk:TheGrza"><font color="green">Grza</font></a> 02:26, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Concerning "notability", only the first extra sources from <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">Dave the Red</a> makes some sense, the other two are opinionated rubish. More broadly, this list only makes sense if viewed from the perspective of the historical date when this list was made. Its like a time capsule. Certainly, the list would have looked different in 1980. It will certainly look different in 2010. The only honest thing to do, in order to keep this - at least for musicians and guitar fans - interesting reference, is to introduce historical perspective and delete all solos after a certain cut-off point. I would suggest 1975. Or anything that is less than 30 years old. Thus we can keep updating it based on naturaly POV, opinionated and unqualified perceptions of bad journalists, fanatic ott fans and frustrated musicians, provided there is a published reference by one of the mainstream guitar magazines. Wikipedians can also vote: maybe <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">TheGrza</a> could set up a Q on surveymonkey every other year and bring the results into this page? --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModi_2073.html" title="User:Modi">Modi</a> 16:58, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not really interested in putting any more work into this page; it was annoying and I'll be the first one to agree that it's not altogether interesting or certifiably valid. But it is the list, from one moment in time of the biggest magazine geared toward this stuff and I think it should be simply renamed to Guitar World's List of 100 Greatest Guitar Solos (2004) or something along those lines. It clearly isn't the 100 Greatest Guitar solos because there it's geared toward rock and away from, say Bach, but I still think it's relevant.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">The</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheGrza_ecac.html" title="User talk:TheGrza"><font color="green">Grza</font></a> 23:32, Apr 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Let me preface by saying I didn't write the ridiculous original article, but as a Delaware resident I do feel Charter School of Wilmington is worthy of mention.

<p>There are entries in Wikipedia for U2. How is this band any different? Why does it matter that U2 is well-known and this band is not? Is part of Wikipedia's charter that only notable people, places and things should be allowed in? And if so, what criteria should therefore be used to determine what is "notable"? There are plenty of important people events that got swept under the rug by a lack of media coverage, or a lack of awareness, that were nonetheless important. Many artists labored in obscurity during their own time, only to be "discovered" long after their death. It seems to me that judging an entry based on how popular it is does a serious dis-service to this project as a whole.</p>
<p>However, the "vanity" charge is fully warranted. I will update the text of the submission to make it more objective.</p>

<p>"If sockpuppets want to keep it..." What does that even mean? The first draft of the entry was biased, I admit, but I have changed the text to make it more objective. It now seems to conform with Wikipedia's own entry standards, does it not? And if not, then why? Certainly, deletion is not recommended here because of reviewer bias, right? So what objective standards are being applied now to warrant deletion?</p>

Unlike this band U2 meets the Wikimusic Project guidelines which specifies that an artist meet at least one of the criteria namely top 100 success in major or medium sized market, won awards, performed on a national tour, or recorded at least two albums with major label or reasonably well-known independent label. This band will be eligible too when it meets any of this criteria.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:35, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It is verifiable and may be of interest to more than a few people. From what I understand from the limited search that I made of this band on Google, their performances are more like the avant-garde "happenings" that were common in art communities of past decades. These events were ephemeral. Their documentation, whether only in the minds of the audience or as Christo has done in his tangible records for his projects, is the only proof that they happened at all. It seems that a wiki-community is an appropriate place for such an art form to be documented. --Newdeal 16:40, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete.</b> - according to The History of the Franks, by Gregory of Tours (Georgius Florentius) which is the oldest work which talks about the subject so far as I know: "The first King of the Franks was Clodio (Chlogio) [He was married to Basina De Thuringia, born 398 A.D., whose father was Wedelphus, King of Thuringians." Which leaves "Franco" out on a limb with no history, so to speak.

Many impressive names among the people he allegedly met or corresponded with. <i>"Fortunately, a small archive of Black's manuscript work survives in that village"</i>. The article author claims in this (and other articles he changed accordingly, which also makes up the entirety of his edits) that Black <i>"was an adept early practitioner of the limerick verse-form"</i> and offers this gem as proof:</p>

<dd><i>Seducing young Annie Buccleuch</i></dd>
<dd><i>In Hawkley, a storm raged and blew.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The Hanger collapsed [2]</i></dd>
<dd><i>But I did not lapse.</i></dd>
<dd><i>I enquired, “Did the earth move for <b>you</b>?”.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>[2] This dates Black's seduction precisely to the night of 8th/9th March 1774, when the side of the Hanger [the local term for a steep clay ridge] collapsed in a fierce storm. A cottage built on the site is still known as "Slip Cottage".</i></p>

<li>If there is a place for gentle comedy in WP, it's the user pages. Gentle comedy is wrong (and thus bad) information. If say a user checks "What links here" on Gilbert White's article, she won't expect to be offered, among other pages, a hoax. In my personal opinion, hoax pages that look genuine are much more damaging to WP than vandalism, <i>and</i> they are more expensive to fix.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Also not a vote, is a comment: I seen also the Vamp - Your sweet beasts!, and I think somebody put new information about an European magazine. My opinion is, who made, correct his/her first time errors...

<li>Well, let's see... Playboy.com has an Alexa rank of 785... the Vamp website has no Alexa rank at all (Alexa ranks the top 6 million sites or so). Pretty hard to compare notability between those two. It's kind of like saying that if a comic character I created in kindergarten doesn't get an article, then we have to delete Superman and Spiderman too. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:16, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm not even sure what the fact is. Is "Si-" a prefix attached to any name, in which case Ujang is just an example? This would possibly place it the equivalent of -san in Japanese or Mr. in English. The Japanese "-san", which is undoubtedly more notable than "Si-", only has a definition on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San.html" title="San">disambiguation page</a> for that term rather than an individual article, and "Si-" should just be added to the corresponding article at <a href="../../../s/i/_/Si.html" title="Si">si</a> and the example of siujang deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> Well I can't say that I've seen all the Playboy videos but I have the impression that there has been a significant change in Playboy's philosophy in the production of their videos from the early 90's to the present. In the early 90's the "Sexy Lingerie" and "Wet and Wild" series were produced and very popular. The production of these videos has completely stopped and we now have videos such as "Sorority Strip Party", "Sexy House Keepers", and "America's Sexiest Bartenders". It seems to me that Playboy is now more concerned with making a profit by producing these sleazy videos than producing tasteful, artistic, and erotic depictions of women. I hoped that in writing a detailed description of each of the Playboy videos one could get an impression of the change that has taken place in Playboy's view of women. I have taken your points into consideration and have removed the <s>NPOV</s> non-NPOV remarks from my article. I hope that other people will be able to contribute their ideas and improve the video articles.<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJester2001_5753.html" title="User:Jester2001">Jester2001</a> 01:20, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - there are three issues here. One is, can we have an article on an individual work of art, literture or music. Clearly the answer here is yes since we do it all the time. The second is whether this specific video is worthy of its own article. Little evidence has been provided about the notability of this particlar video; and we have not as a community set very clear standards. However, I suspect that any video distributed through the channels of Playboy Enterprises Inc is likely to reach a lot of people. Lots more, for example than many of our articles on underground rock bands. Since Wikipedia is not paper, we should err on the side of inclusiveness, hence my vote to keep. The third issue rased here is not about the existence of the article but about its content. Is it consistent with our mission to have such a detailed discussion of what happens in the movie? In some existing articles on movies or on individual episodes of "The Simpsons" we do have fairly detailed information. Personally, I believe the current version of this article has too much detail, but that is really an issue for editing, it does not matter here on VfD. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 15:38, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I probably have to agree with you about the amount of detail in this article, but as you said this is an issue for editing. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJester2001_5753.html" title="User:Jester2001">Jester2001</a> 21:54, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep BUT clean up</b>. There's a huge NPOV problem here. Lets have the standard literary analyses, response, etc. I see none of that in the article, and it seems the content is intentionally meant to be titillating? (It shouldn't.) Analyses like, its of this style (style in the sense of the delivery, ie. the movie Hero happens to be conducted in a manner which emphasises the fine actions of so and so...) as well as its obvious genre, and such. I don't mind individual articles on every magazine issue in the world, just as long as its encyclopedic. This one isn't at the moment, but can be fixed. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 00:20, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
