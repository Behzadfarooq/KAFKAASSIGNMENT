<li><b>Transwiki</b> or <b>delete</b>: there's nothing here but what a copy of a court document. <b>However,</b> contra above comments, <b>this was a notable case</b>. It involved the Church of Scientology trying to sue someone for posting their secret religious texts online, as a violation of "trade secrets" and as a copyright infringement. This was pre-DMCA, so the court had to work out its own concept of how much Netcom, the poster's ISP, should be liable for the conduct of one of its users—the case is notable for anyone wanting to study the Church, IP law, or the development of internet law in the 1990s.

<li><b>Keep</b> - as AshleyY correctly states, this has been debated both on the article talk page and on a policy page, with no consensus emerging to delete or redirect. On the article page, the discussion was split 1 to 1. On the policy page, there were two votes to merge compared to two (one of which was anonymous) to keep. Raising the issue a third time smacks of "forum shopping" until the desired vote is reached. The article should be kept seperate for two reasons: (1) Intactivist has an interesting etymology that would be diluting the main topic of the article at Genital integrity. (2) The communist/communism argument for merging is weakened by the fact that the Genital integrity article tends to use the term "Genital integrity advocate" as opposed to "intactivist". It is possible not everyone who self identifies as a "Genital integrity advocate" would necessarily self-identify as an "intactivist" and vice versa. Keeping the two articles seperate does a better service. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 17:22, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>This is one of 12 swords with their own articles from <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Swords_9a5b.html" title="Books of the Swords">Books of the Swords</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Long time reader, first time author! My initial thought was to keep all the sword stuff on one page, but then as I was writing it started to get unweildy, so I split it up when I created it. I also found it made it easier to reference from one sword page to the next. However, I would be happy to merge all 12 articles into one and turn the seperate pages into redirects. I'd hate to merge it all into the main <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Swords_9a5b.html" title="Books of the Swords">Books of the Swords</a> because I plan on further editing, adding to, and revising that, but bow to the authority of the other wikipedians. Also, RE: copyright violation, I think that quoting the verse for each sword meets the criteria for fair use, in that its for educational purposes, the amount of material is small comparied to the 10+ books of source material, and are a small part of the total article contents. But again, I defer the more experienced wikipedians.<a href="../../../a/k/e/User%7EAkerkhof_18c0.html" title="User:Akerkhof">Akerkhof</a> 15:29, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - this fancruft. I agree it is unlikely to interest any but a fan of the book series, but the same could be said for lots of topics covered here. There are apparently 10 books in the series, which is a substantial number of books, I assume they must have found some audience. "coinspinner"+"sword" gets 550 hits on Google, which is not too shabby. I'm not saying this series has achieved any where near the cultural impact of Star Wars or Star Trek, or The Simpsons, but these and other lesser franchises have spawned numerous articles here. For example see "Category:Star_Wars_characters". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 18:47, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I hope I'm doing this right and not messing up ettiquete, but since these are my articles and the main criticism is that they take up 12 seperate articles, I've gone ahead and merged them all into one at <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Swords_of_Power_3055.html" title="Twelve Swords of Power">Twelve Swords of Power</a>. I even think they all read that way better. Is it possible then to place redirects from the individual articles to each subheading? Do I wait until this VfD is complete?</li>
<li>You can create links directly to the section using the format [[Twelve Swords of Power#Coinspinner|Coinspinner]]. Unfortunately, page redirects can not yet reach down to a specific section. You can replace the content with #redirect [[Twelve Swords of Power#Coinspinner]] but it will still take the reader to the top of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Swords_of_Power_3055.html" title="Twelve Swords of Power">Twelve Swords of Power</a> page. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:30, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think the redirect thing is a "not yet" thing as much as a "not" thing. Redirects get done server side, whereas going to sections is done client side. I suppose it could be hacked up to work with javascript, but it isn't possible to make redirects to sections work across the board. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 04:41, 2005 Feb 2 (UTC)</li>
<li>Bummer. Well, I think the way its working right now isn't too bad. If someone punches in an individual Sword in the search, they will not be too astonished by what they find.

<li>I think one article covering all twelve swords is a much better solution than twelve articles. Thanks for your work! Sorry to be a pain, but even better would be for the Twelve Swords of Power just to be merged into the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Swords_9a5b.html" title="Books of the Swords">Books of the Swords</a> article, which is still a very short article, and anyway has a short section on the Twelve Swords of Power already, which could be expanded instead of linking to a separate article on the swords Why did you think the swords needed to be in a separate article? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:38, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mainly because I intend to flesh out the universe and major characters on the main page, and an enormous Sword article in the middle of it might get to be a bit of the mess. There are about five, maybe six characters that need a paragraph or two, and four or five unique concepts to the Swords universe that require the same treatment. There's also a quibble I have with placement and useage of multiple spoiler tags that can be avoided entirely, I think, by keeping the two articles seperate. However, if it works out that the completed <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Swords_9a5b.html" title="Books of the Swords">Books of the Swords</a> article is still a bit light, and the swords article can fit neatly inside it without being distracting and confusing, I'll merge it. Deal? <a href="../../../a/k/e/User%7EAkerkhof_18c0.html" title="User:Akerkhof">Akerkhof</a> 22:18, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you had already done all this, there probably wouldn't be much argument now. You could just point to the fact that the main article was already over 32KB, and you needed to split out something, and decided to make it the sword detail. Some people might still say this topic doesn't merit so much detail and more than one article, but you'd have more of a point. Why not work on the main article some, including the sword material, until it gets near 32KB, *then* split out the sword stuff? A lot of people start with grand plans for a series fully-fleshed out articles, create an elaborate framework of multiple articles, most of which are initially stubs. Then they lose interest or don't have time to complete their plan, and we end up with all these related stubs on something that would have made more sense as a single article or at most a couple of articles. Someone coming along later wanting to work on the same topic is more or less stuck with the incomplete editorial plan of the person who started all the stubs, because it is a lot of work to get articles and redirects deleted -- and this might be discouraging enough that they don't bother cleaning things up or expanding the articles. And Wikipedia gets stuck with some more stuff that is a bit embarassing and which has to wait a long time to get cleaned up. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:13, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By the way, redirecting to a section could be made to work easily if the server handled the Redirect pages by sending the HTTP Redirection Status Code (301) to the browser using the URL for the section. This would also be good in that bookmarks, links on search engines, etc, would end up being to the canonical URL/Article Title, rather than to redirect pages. But this isn't how things are currently done, and doing it this way would have the disadvantage of losing the "Redirected from" link that is currently displayed in a small font in the header of the pages after following a redirect. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:50, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>making this weak as I agree with the subjectivity of "not notable". This has the propensity to be notable, and it would be sort of silly to delete the article and have to rewrite the article in a few years time. Perhaps the article should not be deleted until the festival kaputs (if.. I mean <i>if</i>).

<li><b>Delete.</b> Wikipedia shouldn't speculate on potential future notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>, 'not notable' is very subjective. DA-IICT is a famous university in India and was ranked 3rd in the ranking of private universities (forgot where I saw the survey). Synapse is also becoming very popular among Indian students. It is true that it is not as popular as some of the other festival's such as IIT's, IIM's etc. BTW I was a student of DA-IICT... <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarunrebel_3399.html" title="User:Varunrebel">Varunrebel</a> 07:39, 1 Feb 2005 (IST)
<ul>
<li>As a student of DA-IICT and author of Synapse, you believe that it should be kept. But think about the precedent that it will set. There are thousands of college festivals in the world. My college has also got two - one cultural and another technical. Synapse isn't notable enough to have an article of its own. If it is kept, Wikipedia will be flooded with such entries. You can write something about Synapse in the <a href="../../../d/a/-/DA-IICT_c3f4.html" title="DA-IICT">DA-IICT</a> article. If it becomes really notable in future, it may deserve a separate article. But as of now, I think it's just another of the annual college festivals that every college has. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> 09:02, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li>"<i>As a student of DA-IICT and author of Synapse...</i>" - Please do NOT try to bias the dscussion by implying that I am saying what I am saying bcoz I am a DA-IICTian. I mentioned that I was an ex-student of DA-IICT just to fair and ethical. I didnt mention it bcoz I wanted to advocate on behalf of Synapse. My belief that is should be kept is NOT bcoz I am a DA-IICTian. However I do admit that my special interest in preventing its deletion _is_ bcoz I am DA-IICTian</li>
<li>The 2nd point you have raised is "what if the festivals of all colleges were to be added to Wikipedia? Will Wikipedia not become floded?" My counter-question is "So what?" I dont think the inclusion of college festivals in Wikipedia is harmful as long as it is made very clear that it is a college festival and the reader does not confuse it with anything else.</li>
<li>And my final question/issue that I have voiced before this also - "How do you define notable?" I claim that Synapse is well known enough to be included. You say that it is not.

<dd>Hi Varun, firstly, I am not trying to bias the discussion. Secondly, you should understand that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a repository</a>. Everything can't find a place here. A link to the <a href="http://synapse.da-iict.org/" class="external text" title="http://synapse.da-iict.org/" rel="nofollow">official synapse website</a> on <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhirubhai_Ambani_Institute_of_Information_and_Communication_Technology_ee37.html" title="Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology">Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology</a> page is more than sufficient. However, creating a separate article for it is not OK. Answering your third argument, since you've create the page, it's your duty to explain why the fest is notable, not mine. I (like other users who've voted delete) find it non-notabble, because it has not reached the level of significance required to find a mention in Wikipedia. It's not famous in India, and certainly not of international level. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> 04:35, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, I didn't necessarily mean to ditch the entire series or genre, but I think it's a valid question to ask whether a fictional universe needs to be described in so much detail on Wikipedia.

I do wonder if we're not wasting time and energy on a duplicate effort, when there's an excellent and IMO superior Trek Wiki available at <a href="http://www.memory-alpha.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.memory-alpha.org/" rel="nofollow">Memory Alpha</a>. For instance, compare "our" <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereign_class_starship.html" title="Sovereign class starship">Sovereign class starship</a> to <a href="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/index.php/Sovereign_class" class="external text" title="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/index.php/Sovereign_class" rel="nofollow">"theirs"</a>, or "our" <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intrepid_class_starship.html" title="Intrepid class starship">Intrepid class starship</a> to <a href="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/index.php/Intrepid_class" class="external text" title="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/index.php/Intrepid_class" rel="nofollow">"theirs"</a>.

<li>To have constructed a dictionary of 28000 words by <i>speaking</i> the language (assuming that this is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a>) is a notable achievement for "a few dozen" people. And yes, a quick Google Groups search shows that this does appear to have the "interest" (although perhaps not the "respect") of those who study constructed languages. <b>Keep</b> and send to <b>Cleanup</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:14, 2005 Jan 31 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The vast majority of conlangs are non-notable (as are, indeed the vast majority of micronations). Talossa is not a non-notable micronation; Talossan; having an extensive lexicon and grammar and being reasonably well-attested throughout the web, is notable as an example of its sort of conlang. Keep as exception to general principle. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 19:51, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't agree. For it to be notable, it would have had to break out of the conlang "community" to the wider world. Saying it is notable because conlangers talk about it on the Web is like saying that fictional planets in the Star Wars universe are notable because Star Wars fans talk about them on the Internet. Oh wait, never mind. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:28, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The simile would only be appropriate if real people <i>actually lived</i> on those fictional planets. People do, reportedly (see my previous caveat), actually speak this language. And, reportedly, the language grows by actual use. Whether it has as many speakers, or is used as often, as <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">Klingon</a> is certainly a factor. But the Google Groups search indicates that this is more than simply R. Ben Madison alone proselytising something that he made up. My biggest concern is not with the language, but with the "micronation" aspect. This seems more like a long running <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a> than a nation, which the players have fleshed out with a language with its own detailed fictional history. That's certainly a reason to be highly dubious of an R. Ben Madison article. However, whilst the position of king in an RPG isn't real the language invented for players of that game to use when playing <i>is</i> real, and appears to have garnered some attention (albeit, as I mentioned before, not as positive as this article makes out) from outsiders. So for me, the notability of this language rests upon whether it has any outstanding features (which, given that other constructed languages also grow by use, is not certain) and how widespread its use, and the study of it, are (which, I point out again, I'd like to see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verified</a>). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:33, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>People don't really speak these languages as a primary language, or even for any real purpose other than their own amusement. I read an article about a Klingon "speaker" who tried to make his infant son bi-lingual in Klingon and English. He spoke exclusively Klingon to the boy and his wife spoke exclusively English. This should have worked: lots of kids are bilingual, or even trilingual because of strategies like this adopted by their parents. But the experiment failed: the kid refused to speak Klingon after a while. One reason that was proposed for this was that Klingon didn't have a lot of useful words for households with infants like "diaper" and "sippy-cup". Or maybe it would have worked if it had been his mother speaking the Klingon. We don't call them mother tongues for nothing, but mothers are probably not nutty enough to try it. The reason might be more profound: there just might be something about real human languages that people don't understand well enough yet to create a language from scratch that someone can actually acquire as a child. A conlang that someone taught to their child might be notable. This one is just a hobbyist plaything. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:09, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: As a linguistics student, and one with an interest in conlangs, I would dispute this. There is nothing within the Klingon language's grammar that would prevent it being acquired as a native language. The reasons it its not have to do with <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociolinguistics.html" title="Sociolinguistics">sociolinguistic</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pragmatics.html" title="Pragmatics">pragmatic</a> factors. As for outstanding features, in terms of conlangs, it has an exceptionally large lexicon, quite a lengthy history, and an unusually large speaker/enthusiast base. These are what motivates me to consider this as an exception to generally non-notable conlangs. The point about Quenya, Sindarin and Esperanto is taken, but I think a fair overview of conlanging, existing as it does largely on the Internet, is prevented if we restrict ourselves to published works (as we wouldn't do, with say, the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry.html" title="Furry">furry</a> community). <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 20:04, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

Why do we have an article on <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Angleton_b9df.html" title="Doris Angleton">Doris Angleton</a>, a murdered socialite? is a socialite encyclopedic, but a telecommunications professional not?

Why is <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kris_Donald_7d8b.html" title="Kris Donald">Kris Donald</a>'s murder anymore note-worthy than McKeown's death?

<li>The quick answer would be that we have those articles because they haven't been nominated for VfD. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:16, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've gone through and had a quick read of all the articles you link to. I'll put a brief summary of my thoughts on each one below. Before I do that, I should say that I think that beign murdered is <i>slilghtly</i> more notable than being killed in a train crash, but not sufficent to merit inclusion in WP on its own, however if the murder is notable this can make the victim notable (for being notably murdered). Whether this is a view shared by others I have no idea. If others want to use my comments in any future VfDs on these articles you may do.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Angleton_b9df.html" title="Doris Angleton">Doris Angleton</a> (created <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">28 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, marked for cleanup since <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">8 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>): Doesn't seem notable to me, although if it is cleaned up notability may be established. 90% of the edits have been by <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">User:WhisperToMe</a>, who created the article.</li>

This apparently generated a lot of US-nationwide media attention at the time, which would establish enough notability for me. The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECarlie_Brucia_246b.html" title="Talk:Carlie Brucia">talk</a> page shows it was subjected to a VfD from <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">8 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the consensus of which was to keep that article.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Bergsten_6e2e.html" title="Jessica Bergsten">Jessica Bergsten</a> was murdered by "famous skateboarder <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Rogowski_2d96.html" title="Mark Rogowski">Mark Rogowski</a>". Because of his fame (his article firmly establishes that) and the fact she was prominently featured in a DVD about his rise and fall (see her article) I feel she merits an article.</li>

Of those 6, 4 are subject to current VfDs (all started by User:UncleG on <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_February_2030.html" title="1st February">1st February</a>, the current consensus seems to be to make them redircts to the massacre article. The only other one who is not subject to a VfD is <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Scott_89ed.html" title="Rachel Scott">Rachel Scott</a>, this seems to be because her parents have written very extensively about her and the massacre.

<p>This page describes (in great detail) a bill introduced to the U.S. Congress by Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul that would have repealed sections of the Patriot Act. Not only did the bill die without action last year, there are literally thousands and thousands of bills that get introduced during a session of Congress, about 7 percent of which actually get enacted. I'm sure the bill was a fine one, but a) it went nowhere, and b) it never had a chance to go anywhere, which to me makes this not notable and thus not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia, despite the controversial nature of the Patriot Act. (There have been fistfuls of bills introduced trying to do various things to the Patriot Act, and this one is not particularly special in that group. I am a Capitol Hill reporter, so unfortunately I am all too familiar with this topic.) <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 20:56, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just a quick explanatory note: It will never pass. It in fact has now ceased to exist. It was introduced in the 108th Congress. It is now the 109th Congress. When Congress enters into a new congressional session, all bills are considered dead. They can be re-introduced (with new numbers), but for all intents and purposes they no longer exist. So far this has not been re-introduced, and probably won't be. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 17:15, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)

This was more a protest action and a critique of the USA PATRIOT Act than it was ever really intended to pass into law. Think of it as a political demonstration by two House members whose politics are, in most respects, quite different from one another: Kucinich on the left edge of the Democratic Party and Ron Paul a right-libertarian Republican. I'm not sure if the detailing of its provisions is the right article to have, but I'd vote <b>keep</b> for rewriting this as a window into the strange bedfellows that have arisen from civil libertarian opposition to the USA PATRIOT Act. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:58, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Members of Congress introduce/sponsor legislation ALL THE TIME. I looked it up, and Kuchinich is listed as sponsor of 19 bills and Paul of 62. Listing all of them would be pointless, and since the one we're discussing sank without a trace, why give it special prominence?

<li>The term for keeping this article is "POV", and talk about "notability" is mere hand-waving. The bill was introduced, sank without leaving any real ripples, and is now officially dead: any "notability" is among those committed to those opposing the USA PATRIOT Act, not the world at large. This bill, is, at best, a historical footnote not deserving of a full article -- certainly not in the eye-glazing detail this one has -- and the purpose of keeping it is for consciousness-raising (or, to be blunt, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>) purposes. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 01:46, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I respectfully disagree with you, Keith. The fact that this bill was introduced in opposition to the Patriot Act does not inherently make it notable. I also disagree that it gains added notability because it was introduced by Kucinich. He was a presidential candidate, but only barely -- like this bill, his candidacy was futile from the start. Does this also mean that failed Democratic contender Carol Moseley Braun's bills are also inherently more notable?

<li><b>Keep</b> but cleanup and a rewrite is needed. Star Trek and Doctor Who episodes rate their own articles, so Twilight Zone stories are just as worthy (especially on the basis that many of them are standalone classics). However this article needs a lot of work to bring it in line with other episode articles (for example I can't tell from this which of the three TZ series The Library comes from). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:04, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>You could if you were to look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Twilight_Zone_episodes_3491.html" title="List of The Twilight Zone episodes">List of The Twilight Zone episodes</a>. ☺ Someone has recoloured a redlink. Picking a handful of bluelinks at random from that page, I find that some, like <a href="../../../h/e/r/Her_Pilgrim_Soul_%28The_Twilight_Zone%29_88e1.html" title="Her Pilgrim Soul (The Twilight Zone)">Her Pilgrim Soul (The Twilight Zone)</a>, are reasonably decent, whilst others, like <a href="../../../b/u/t/Button%2C_Button_%28The_Twilight_Zone%29_9a3e.html" title="Button, Button (The Twilight Zone)">Button, Button (The Twilight Zone)</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_See_the_Invisible_Man_%28The_Twilight_Zone%29_71cd.html" title="To See the Invisible Man (The Twilight Zone)">To See the Invisible Man (The Twilight Zone)</a>, are just as lacking as this one. However, the former indicates that an article like this can be done well, without descending into describing fiction as if it were reality, as is such a problem with many science-fiction articles. Either <b>Weak Keep</b> and send to <b>Cleanup</b> along with all of the other episode articles that are nothing but plot synopses or the teasers from listing magazines; or <b>Delete</b> to redlink to start again, since it seems that in this case we will only be losing a teaser, which has copyright connotations anyway. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:26, 2005 Jan 31 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although this is nothing like the sniggeringly juvenile article I expected from its name, it's still not the slightest bit notable.
