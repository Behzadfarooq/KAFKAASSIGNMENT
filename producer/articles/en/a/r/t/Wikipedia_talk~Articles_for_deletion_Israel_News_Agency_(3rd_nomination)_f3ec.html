	    <p>May I suggest that the discussion be extended to Joel Leyden, which has also been deleted and restored several times? It's currently deleted, but given the history of wheel warring, it's just a matter of time before someone restores it. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 18:02, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd suggest a separate nomination. Many, myself included, have expressed the opinion that, while the INA <i>may</i> be notable as an organization, Leyden does <i>not</i> himself merit an article of his own. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 18:12, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The INA has been voted on twice before in AfD and the result both times were "keep." It appears that there are a few here who are willing to ignore facts and pursue an agenda of attacking the INA. This is most vividly illustrated by the fact that Danny deleted the Israel News Agency article twice out of process after a community consensus to keep. If we are to judge notability by deeds, being the first Israeli government accredited source [www.israelnewsagency.com/inaabout.html] of online news in 1995 speaks volumes. To judge by association the hundreds of international media organizations <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=12183" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=12183" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and blogs using the Israel News Agencys materials is substantial. To judge by impact using Alexa.com and Google web / Google news <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-20,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22israel+news+agency%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-20,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22israel+news+agency%22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> reaching over 60 million readers world wide the INA appears more than notable on all three accounts. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnei_0e73.html" title="User:Karnei">Karnei</a> 19:16, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> However reputable this site is doesn't matter. Wikipedia has plenty of articles about other sources of propaganda or misinformation, but those articles just mention that they are considered as such. My proposed solution would be to edit the current article to say that INA has beeen accused of being spam and using wikipedia for SEO. But we should also include a section about criticism or censoring that this incident has brought up, then lock the topic. This would maintain NPOV and disprove claims of censoring by wikipedia. Whoever does the rewrite, though, would have to be very careful of language.--1337n00blar (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_1337n00blar_9731.html" title="Special:Contributions/1337n00blar">contribs</a>) 13:41, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is it just me, or is there something very odd about the way this VfD is being handled? What's up with the way people are moving plain old comments that aren't votes to this talk page and labelling them, in quotes, as votes? For that matter, what's up with the way people are moving votes from people who don't have at least 150 edits here, when it's Wikipedia policy that everyone is allowed to vote, even if their vote won't be counted? What's with people insisting that others are not to vote if they don't have the requisite number of edits, even though it is, as stated, Wikipedia policy that everyone is allowed to vote?</p>
<p>Controversial votes have had similar limits to the 150 edit one imposed here, but the good ones didn't suffer from attempts to deny people their votes and comments, even if some of the votes weren't counted. See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America_attempt_6_1311.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Gay Nigger Association of America attempt 6">this</a> for a great example.</p>
<p>Unfortunetly, it seems that this vote is already completely spoiled. Stanfor<font color="green">d</font>andson 18:07, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As the backstory makes perfectly plain, every time this debate has been run it has been serially disrupted by sockpuppets. The threshold is set very low. Oh, and it's not a vote - VfD went a while back. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:55, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Read my comment. I didn't once object to the threshold. Instead, I objected to the way it was implemented. Stanfor<font color="green">d</font>andson 04:12, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
