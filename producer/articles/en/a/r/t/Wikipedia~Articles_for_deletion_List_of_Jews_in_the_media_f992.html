<li><b>Keep/Merge</b> I'd like to respond to some of these comments if I may... it is maintainable and it is very useful, given the emphasis on Israel in American foreign policy. I agree it is not as exhaustive a list as I would like but it is a beginning, it would help if organizations like The New York Times (as an example) would release the names and ethnicity of their editors, for instance. Whether or not something is potentially a vehicle for anti-Semitism isn't relevant, unless you can cite official Wikipedia policy on this for me. Moreover, anti-Semitism isn't as clear cut a topic as many of you would like it to be. As for the list being moved previously, this appears to be false, it appears to have been recreated from scratch and now excludes all of those names which actually control these many news organizations, which of course is the more interesting aspect of the list. I think that if you delete you will call more attention to this issue than if you just leave it alone. Kirkswig 06:31, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I guess I mentioned potential for anti-semitism b/c I see it as a good reason to delete this article, though not valid under any wikipedia policy that I know of.

<li><b>Delete</b> this is exactly the kind of totally arbitrary, unsourced, &amp; unverified listcruft that should not be featured on Wikipedia. Ignoring any potential for this becoming anti-semitic flamebait, this article has severe <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> issues. What are the criteria for inclusion? How are we <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifying</a> that these people are Jewish? Where are the citations/sources showing that they are either practising Jewish religion or are Jewish by descent? What is our definition and cut-off for being considered part of the "Media" for purposes of this article? This just lists news personalities and CEOs. Where are the musicians, actors, directors, painters, poets, &amp; authors who could all be considered part of the mass media? I can find at least 4 sources that claim I am a member of the so-called "Jewish Media", do I get added (even though I am not a member of the media... or Jewish)? There are just to many problems with this type of list for it to ever be encyclopedic... and compare it to a list that is actually done right, with sourcing and verification: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_American_journalists_42ce.html" title="List of Jewish American journalists">List of Jewish American journalists</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:55, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The issues raised here are no different from those affecting any other list of individuals by religion or ethnicity.

<dd>If this other list didn't exist, I might not say delete, but this is a subject of obvious and high potential for controversy.
