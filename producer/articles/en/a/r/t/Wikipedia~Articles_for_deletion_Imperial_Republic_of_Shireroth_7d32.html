<li><b>Delete</b> - that is possibly the longest article I have ever seen nominated for deletion. Its such a shame to delete so much work. Unless its a copyvio issue off the page <a href="http://shireroth.org/" class="external free" title="http://shireroth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://shireroth.org/</a>, which it doesn't seem to be, I say to keep it just for effort. However, I believe that 25 members does not meet Wikipedia criteria. If online forums need to have 5,000, then I imagine that so do micronations. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 09:52, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As the author in question, I'd like to keep it.

<dd>Furthermore, Shireroth is a nation--granted, a nation that claims no territory or even independence, but a nation nonetheless. We have existed for five years and fought (and won) against the plagues that most other online political simulations succumb to.</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Most micronations of today are considered large if they have anything above five "citizens" or members. This hobby may be small, and it's easy to brush an article about it aside, but this is the largest and oldest micronation, and as such deserves the tiny disk space it takes up here. -foghorn5950|<sup>(talk)</sup> 9:57 PM, 7 December 2005 (UTC +5)

<li><b>Live and Let Live</b> Shireroth is the godfather of micronations, deleting this means almost total rejection of the hobby itself- we have stood longer than any other, and as was pointed out, we're doing a lot better than others that have been allowed to keep theirs. And really, why do you need to nitpick at this stuff? Surely you have better things to do than take on a page and 25 protestors? -Oz Mons <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.128.41.59 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.128.41.59_9d96.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.128.41.59">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Shireroth is, by the standards of the hobby, huge. It's peak population is may seem small compared to some random generic forum, but over the years it has earned a place in the hearts and minds of many people and comunities. I has has links with a TV show with one of the highest audiance participation levels around (of non sports related or prize giving shows) -<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConglacio_318e.html" title="User:Conglacio">Conglacio</a> 3:29 AM, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Calling Shireroth the largest and the oldest is a bit of an exaggeration, but as micronations of its type go, it is quite old, the oldest yet standing of its tradition; and it is larger than most micronations than it has contact with (the Kingdom of Lovely being the notable exception). If, despite this, having only 25 people ulimately makes it unsuitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, then so be it; but this will also exclude for the forseeable future all other members of a vibrant and diverse community, which itself is, as a whole, poorly represented in Wikipedia. -Shyriath <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.77.52.31 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.77.52.31_98a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.77.52.31">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> This is more than a children's club, or just a message bourd, it is a thriving micronation of over 5 years, which in of itself is a feat, which has a sizeable, in micronational terms, population. The Micronational community exsists, and just because individual micronations are not massive in scale, (5,000+) members/citizens does not make them any less real, or any less worthy of mention in an article. This article interfers with no other articles of similar name that I can see, there are NO copyright issues over the name or the micronation itself. The Imperial Republic of Shireroth has a citizenship spanning many nations and continents. Why is it many who may not even know what a Micronation is to begin with are seeking the deletion of this page, passing it off as simply a "children's club" or some juvinile group. Yes, many members find their age to be under 25, does that make them, and what they have built any less substantial. Is not this article informative, and is not that the point of an encyclopedia? To allow people to look up and research information, no matter how obscure. Now I recognize there are some lines that need to be drawn. but saying a Micronation of sizeable age and population is unworthy of mention, is drawing the line in the wrong place. If you are seeing this as unworthy of mention due to the age of members, that is ageism, in it's purist form. If you are judging it by it's current citizen base, you are judging it by the wrong criteria. Shireroth has endured much as a political model for many years, and through it's trials and tribulation much can be learned about government, political-science, psychology, sociology and even religion/spirituality. The point is; this article is more than just the organization that it covers, it is all that has been learned and discovered through the project that is the Imperial Republic of Shireroth. To delete this article would be to deny the world information, possibly useful, possibly not, but it should be up to them to decide.

<li><b>Keep</b> Shireroth is a well-established and senior micronation, and to delete it is pointless.
