<p>Hi guys -- I don't think I'm nearly important enough to qualify for a Wikipedia entry on myself but I'm flattered that Rev. Moon follower SteveDufour created one about me. Nevertheless its claim that i'm an "unprincipled dogmatist" isn't really NPOV. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohngorenfeld_0721.html" title="User:Johngorenfeld">Johngorenfeld</a> 13:31, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - original nomination was incomplete and formatted incorrectly, so I've corrected (I think). I also removed the "unprincipled dogmatist" comment from the article which was inserted by an anon-IP, not by the article's creator. As far as the article, I'll have to think about this. I'm sympathetic to those who do not want WP articles about themselves, but I don't think that's a valid reason for deletion. - <a href="../../../a/a/g/User%7EAagtbdfoua_3bd2.html" title="User:Aagtbdfoua">Aagtbdfoua</a> 14:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do we have a way of knowing that the WP editor "Johngorenfeld" is really the John Gorenfeld of the article? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 17:25, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that in cases of borderline notability (which I'd classify this as) that a request from the individual to remove their article seems reasonable. I agree that certifying the person's identity is a bit of a problem, but since we are supposed to assume good faith I think we are thus inclined to accept the claim in the absence of contrary evidence. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 18:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> In fact, the piece plagiarizes from my professional bio at www.gorenfeld.net.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Huh? I did write (or start, most of the current words are not mine) the article. It was as part of my general work on Unification Church related articles. (I am a church member as "Johngorenfeld" mentioned.) I tried to be fair and accurate and certainly didn't plagiarize anything. I never used the words "unprincipled dogmatist", it is just not the kind of expression I would use. <a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a>, a critic of the Unification Church, also contributed to the article. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 17:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC) p.s.

I did add the sentence, "He is a graduate of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley_70e2.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>'s journalism school and was a crime reporter for the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modesto_Bee_7255.html" title="Modesto Bee">Modesto Bee</a> newspaper of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modesto%2C_California_6985.html" title="Modesto, California">Modesto, California</a>." based on information from John's site.

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> in deference to Mr. Gorenfeld; I'd normally vote "keep" on this, because the ABC news and Washington Post coverage of him certainly suggests a level of notability that's usually acceptable for inclusion--but given that Gorenfeld states that he wasn't really the <i>subject</i> of that coverage--and because it is already somewhat borderline and the subject himself would prefer not to have it, I don't see a reason not to delete. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 17:58, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've read the arguments below and the article as it is now, and I'm still not convinced of the subject's notability. He reported a story that got national attention, but how much of that national attention did he himself get, in a way that wasn't trivial? (I'd think just a mention of the fact that he wrote it is kind of trivial, unless the coverage featured him) Does just writing a story that gets national attention make you notable in itself? I admit that it wouldn't be terrible if the article is kept, since it's verifiable and that, in my mind, is the most important aspect of notability. I'll keep an eye on the discussion and change my mind if someone finds press coverage that specifically features him. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 19:40, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Summary</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Reason 1 to delete</i>: The subject of the article requested it. This reason may no longer apply.</p>
<p>The subject of the article is a new user, and seemed in his early comments not to understand vandalism (or not to believe the inappropriate phrase was vandalism). He happened to see the article just afterward, but not before the vandalism was removed. He can verify that it was vandalism by unregistered user 203.59.166.123 by going to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Gorenfeld&amp;diff=99070962&amp;oldid=94520311" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Gorenfeld&amp;diff=99070962&amp;oldid=94520311" rel="nofollow">history tab</a>. Perhaps he is afraid that the article might be vandalized again. Assuming he still wants the article deleted, unless he comments again here, giving his reason (other than vandalism), "Reason 1 to delete" seems to carry little weight.</p>
<p><i>Reason 2 to delete</i>: Copyvio. If there ever was a copyvio, the article has been rewritten, and there is no longer any trace of the similar phrase or two that prompted the accusation. This reason clearly no longer applies.</p>
<p><i>Reason 3 to delete</i>: Subject is not sufficiently notable. Undecided.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> says: "Doesn't seem notable enough to me. How is this subject different from other journalists?"</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> says: "there is a degree of notability greater than the one of an average journalist."</li>
</ul>
<p>Opinions vary on this point. <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurence_Boyce_a99c.html" title="User:Laurence Boyce">Laurence Boyce</a> says "The English Wikipedia contains loads of articles for little known journalists," and contributor <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> says "John was mentioned by newspapers all over the United States and was interviewed on National Public Radio and ABC TV for his role in reporting on the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Myung_Moon_Coronation_bbf8.html" title="Sun Myung Moon Coronation">Sun Myung Moon Coronation</a> incident." Others do not find these arguments compelling, but much of the discussion above has become outdated because of improvements to the article.</p>
<p>The template above says "This is not a vote." But I have seen AfDs where lazy admins seemed to do nothing other than count up the votes (which are not supposed to be votes). Why do we have a tradition of putting our conclusion in the form of "Delete" or "Keep" in bold at the beginning of each entry? Shouldn't an admin deciding the outcome be required to check for changes to the article and read the entire discussion, looking for reasons rather than votes?</p>
<p>Since I have to go along with this questionable tradition, I will. I hope admins and others who comment on this page will <i>read</i>.</p>

<dd>OK, thank you for the effort. Nevertheless the identity of the user does not matter much in the case.
