<li><s><b>Delete</b> - It is not the world championships - It only applies to university students.

I am not the Matthew Vassar vandal; all I did was remove twice remove boxes that TrinityC invented, which were not in accordance with wikipedia rules. Syrthiss also advised TrinityC "against placing their own made up vandalism notice" on the article. TrinityC is the only person who has accused me of sockpuppetry and vandalism. Please do not make false accusations about me. Furthermore, I am not User:Wiki4Life, and I do not see how my three word vote is almost identical to Wiki4Life's. There are a number of 3-word votes that are identically worded, but they are not accused of sockpuppetry; the reason for this is that it's standard format for a vote.

<li><s><b>Comment</b>. I appreciate the work you've done, but I really think this article is hopeless. It's basically a very short interior design article, or perhaps graphic design, but as I alluded to above, <b>design</b> writ large has many, many disciplines, and many of them don't make any use of the "principles and elements" in the article. Software architecture doesn't; instructional design doesn't (much); computer architecture doesn't; antenna design doesn't... and so on. So this article isn't really about "design," and the things it describes certainly aren't "basic design tactics in every design discipline." What they are about is <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_design.html" title="Graphic design">graphic design</a>, and if you look there you see "elements of design" and "principles of design," in context and more complete. So, yeah, the article does have potential--you can see the potential fulfilled already on an preexisting page. This article is just a brief rehash of every graphic design textbook. So I think at best a redirect to <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_design.html" title="Graphic design">graphic design</a> is in order--this is a case of someone with a little bit of content to share creating an article without bothering to see if it already exists on Wikipedia. ‚Äî<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 03:29, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>, This article is a disappointment. The size of the userbase is not the issue, the issue regarding this article is the lack of importance in the history of IRC. If there is history, this information should be published and cited from credible sources. This article is also very short. It lacks content and only contains a brief discription of the network. Any established IRC network would have description, history, userbase, sample of popular channels, importance on the history of IRC, and how it impacted the IRC community. It could even include a map of the servers linked to the IRC network. One should also include details regarding the founder(s) and prominent IRCops. For example, DALnet and EFnet have both impacted and even excelled in spreading popularity of IRC to both experienced and novice Internet users. This article would be worth of keeping if it were expanded with more credible information. RB 02:13, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

Saying that the article is irrelevant or that any network does not "deserve" an article at all is, in fact, disrespectful in the way that it belittles the efforts of the network and it's members.

<li>Please elaborate. The only 'socks' appear to be the accounts that were registered on Feb. 13, 2006 with the distinct purpose of attempting to maliciously remove this article. i.e. <a href="../../../3/h/_/User%7E3H_af92.html" title="User:3H">3H</a> and RB.
<ul>
<li>I would like to point out the Anonymous user claming me to be a "sock" and all others who voted delete is in fact Santavez. (Just so you know Santavez, everyone can check the history to see that you posted that) He failed to sign his name to look like a different user. Admins can verify IPs for socks. <a href="../../../3/h/_/User%7E3H_af92.html" title="User:3H">3H</a> 15:45, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As a network administrator, I am counting on their ability to verify IP addresses. To claim that it is I that is the 'sock' to vote delete on an article I contributed to is, for lack of a better word, ludicrous and the claims are baseless. While not as frequent as some, I have been using my account to contribute and correct grammatical errors far beyond 13 Feb 06 and while this may appear hypocritical to an extent (and for that I apologize), it is inconsiderate to verbally barrage others in the name of 'self defense'. The best I can say is that I really wish it had never come to this in the first place and I am baffled by your motivations. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantavez_8252.html" title="User:Santavez">Santavez</a> 21:57, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> (Over the years there has been a concerted effort by some UFO researchers to recover UFO files from the Australian Government. Independent researchers like Bill Chalker spent years sifting through military files. In say this the Australian Disclosure Project article which is not posted on this site by the user: VUFORS and User: Auforn4u this version on this site is a misrepresentation of the true article held at the Disclosure web page. User: VUFORS and User: Auforn4u have kept up with their continual disruptions deleting all and every additional information posted to this page. They omit and disregarded the efforts of many Australian ufologists reverting and posting their own version of the Australian Disclosure Project and Australian Ufology History. User: VUFORS and User: Auforn4u are trying to create a biased and distorted version of Australian UFO History and do so with the blessing of you Wiki voters. If this is what Wiki is all about then one has to wonder if the information on the rest of the Wiki server is verifiable and truly helpful information.

<dd>Before my original deletion tag i checked Allmusic and read <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and still believe that he is not notable enough to be included here. JUST because you've released two albums doesn't infer notability. Like the IP poster above said...his albums were ranked 90,000th or lower on the Amazon.com website. Nobody had submitted reviews, I just returned from my local Best Buy, they had no album of his. Allmusic.com is very much like IMDB.com, i could submit my name to it and it would be included in a future update, its not reliable. What is more reliable is checking google...which brings FEW mentions of this "notable" rapper.

<p>Quite the contrary, it would appear you are the one who "HasNoClue." I made an effort to find information on this artist. I tried to find a cd at my local music store....nothing. Tried to find mention of him on reputable web-pages like billboard charts, or the like...nothing. If he's now signed with "Rap-a-Lot" records....great! When he's satisfied the criteria for inclusion here....which by the way is TWO albums released on a well known/major record label...then by all means...include him. The article as is reads as vanity and non-notable content. I'm also looking through ebay and don't see a $70.00 single for this artist anywhere...do you have a link for that? And please, leave your personal "weirdo" attacks out of here, or you'll be blocked from editing here. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 02:18, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Uh, Batman, the WP:MUSIC page clearly states that they only have to meet <i>one or more</i> of the qualifications. Are you suggesting that every musical artist on wikipedia has to have 2 albums on a major label? You're wrong. Secondly, I proved that his music is in demand enough to fetch 70 dollars per single (if you want to know why that is notable i suggest reading up on <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a>), I proved that he has had heavy rotation on radio stations, I proved that he's been reviewed by a major music mag, I proved that he is mentioned on numerous blogs, AND I proved that he has worked with extremely well-known artists like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Game_def0.html" title="The Game">The Game</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Wall_d364.html" title="Paul Wall">Paul Wall</a> (see the interview for that info). To the other guy, my guess is that I'm the only person defending notability 1. because the nomination is old, 2. because Wikipedia editors don't tend to be fans of the genre that he's in, and 3. because 90% of the people who vote on this stuff consider themselves 'deletionists' and take pride, for some ridiculous reason, in removing stuff that they haven't heard of or don't care about. And no, it's not the same guy, cryptic. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasNoClue_3d03.html" title="User:HasNoClue">HasNoClue</a> 05:42, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm confused. I put a prod tag on an article after I merged it with a better one. (The reason I did a prod instead of a redirect is that the title was non-standard and possibly ambiguous, and nothing linked to it. However, someone came along and changed it to a redirect saying the <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">WP:GFDL</a> required keeping the original after a merge. So what's story with this AfD regarding merge or delete and redirect? Was my editor wrong or am I missing something? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:10, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If we Merge we need to record the original authors so they can get credit, as required by the GFDL. This could probably actually be accomplished by copying the page history to the talk page of the new article, but keeping the old one as a redirect is the most thorough way. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 05:31, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you guys are missing the point. "Special Operations Group" is a laymans term for "SOCOM." There's nothing to merge as all the information contained in this article is already covered in-depth in the SOCOM article. Simply redirect the term "Special Operations Group" to the "SOCOM" article. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 18:54, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't think that a slang phrase used by some students to describe the bus that transports students between Wellesley College, Harvard University, and MIT is encyclopedic. Besides notability concerns, much of this (brief) article consists of original research: i.e., "It is widely shared perception among Harvard amd MIT male students that Wellesley students are eager to have sex because Wellesley is a females-only institution." -- as a Wellesley alum, I agree that this perception probably does exist among students, but I really can't see how this could be cited using an acceptable published source. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 03:12, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I will remove the offending language that implies original research. Although this seems to have a narrow reach, by standard measures of notability this qualifies. Do a google search -- you will find many, many results. Also, you will notice that I have cited this article rather extensively. One of those citations is from a national publication that published an entire article about issues of secuality at Wellesley and discussed the fuck truck. I did not post this as a joke or to be offensive. The fact is, if this was a post about, say, a faculty exchange program between the two schools that (for some reason) had been discussed in the national press and was extremely well known to essentially all students at both schools (I am a graduate of one of them), and thus was at least as encycopedic as a school fight song (we have an extensive list), there is no way that this would be up for deletion. The fact is, this discussion is occurring because someone is offended. But, of course, the fact that something causes offense makes it no less notable. Wikipedia should contain encyclopedic or not, and I have made it my mission to post challenging information (see my userpage for a discusson of what I am up to). Please focus on the notability of this post and not the fact that you may be offended by it or find it silly.<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 04:31, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I don't find this article offensive, and no one else who commented here said they found it offensive. One person said it was vulgar, but that's not the same thing as being offended by it. And yes, I would also probably AFD an article about a Harvard/Wellesley/MIT faculty exchange program.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Although offense has not been explicitly stated, I have to suspect that it underlies the attack on an article like this. Or if not offense, a general instinct to be hostile to entries that seem vulgar or humorous, which may be justified as such qualities are frequent touchstones of vandalism, but I think we all can acknowledge that whatever this is it is not vandalism. The fact remains, these are three institutions that have an extremely prominent role in our society. Perhaps that is why the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Lampoon_36b9.html" title="Harvard Lampoon">Harvard Lampoon</a>, the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Crimson_baff.html" title="Harvard Crimson">Harvard Crimson</a> and numerous dormitories at Harvard (see <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunster_House_222e.html" title="Dunster House">Dunster House</a>) have well established wikipedia presences while, having followed similar deletion debates, it seems that college humor magazines, newspapers, and dormitories are often challenged as non-notable. Also, may I ask again why college fight songs (see <a href="../../../f/o/r/For_Boston_bf9e.html" title="For Boston">For Boston</a>) have any place on Wikipedia when something like this entry, which has documented national notability does not? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 04:49, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Let's be clear; I was not calling into question your good faith in particular. I am just pointing out a pattern I have noticed -- provocative or "vulgar" articles seem to draw quite a bit more scrutiny than similarly notable non-provocative, non-vulgar articles. Also, my point about those articles is that they are notable, as evidenced by the long-term consensus regarding their existence that is apparent in that some have been up for a long time, these articles are frequently edited by experienced users and (as for the fight songs), new articles in the same category frequently pop up. Also, thank you for your excellent edits to this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I think merging it into <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellesley_College_7f40.html" title="Wellesley College">Wellesley College</a> is fine. It's a bus run by Wellesley, I'm not sure why there's any ambiguity about which school it's most relevant to. Also, if the article is kept, I would support renaming it to "Wellesley College Senate Bus" and creating redirects for "Fuck Truck" and "Senate Bus". Making "Fuck Truck" be the primary title for the article is rather POV, since it implies a primary purpose for the bus that not everyone would agree is its primary purpose. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 04:56, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: the problem with renaming is that this a case where the 'official' name is far, far less well known than the colloquial name (it certainly hasn't been mentioned in the national press), and thus the less notable name. Also, whatever form this article takes (including if it is merged into something else, although I remain opposed to it...I imagine that if we merge this into the Wellesley page there will be a natural revert war), the term 'fuck truck' and the sexual connotations of this service needs to be a part of that final form, as this role, though admittedly not the bus's only role, is what makes this service notable. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 05:06, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: True, we cannot predict the future. However, we are to the point here where there is no clear consensus for deletion. Many of the "Keeps" are from experienced users. I am sure that even you can admit that even if this article is not notable (and I believe that it is, just to be clear), that the numerous media references combined with the stature of the institutions means that this article is <i>at least</i> close to the grey area between notability and non-notability. Perhaps the difference between us is that I do tend to be inclusionist when it comes to wikipedia -- if something is in (or even near) this grey area I tend to lean towards keeping it. That said, acknowledging the expressed will of many experienced users and the fact that there is at least some ambiguity as to this article's notability, what will really be lost by erring on the side of inclusion and keeping what has become, largely through your own efforts, a quite well written and well researched article? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 03:41, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: But this is not merely local slang. It is slang that has been discussed in national and regional publications. It is slang that exists because of a basic issue facing single-sex college education. That is, although this term originated as local slang, its notability and ramifications have clearly (as shown by the multiple credible sources cited in this exceptionally well-cited article) transcended those origins. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 00:33, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I am a current student at Harvard and the term "fuck truck" is familiar to the majority of undergraduates (if not all). If you asked us where to catch the Senate Bus, you would only get confused stares. Additionally, the "fuck truck" is widely known amongst college students in the greater Boston area excluding Harvard and MIT and may be a good resource for people who want to learn where the term originated. If the information is incorrect or bias, then people will edit it. I'm new so I don't understand this whole "No original research" thing. It seems that many other entries at Wikipedia should be deleted if we strictly followed this rule. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPbui_2120.html" title="User:Pbui">Pbui</a> 03:52, 14 February 2006</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPbui_2120.html" title="User:Pbui">Pbui</a>, "many other entries at Wikipedia should be deleted if we followed this rule" is an argument for nominating those "other entries" for deletion (or for improving them so they don't contain original research), not for keeping an article that violates policies.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: In fact this evidence has been presented. Everyone who read the Roling Stone article -- that is, everyone who read an article in one of the highest-circulation national magazines, has heard of the "Fuck Truck". Either way, it is unclear to me why you are implying that the opionion of numerous experienced users who have voted to keep aren't enough to indicate no consensus for deletion and thus wrap up this debate just because arbitrary evidentiary standards you propose (eg unfamiliar outside of Mass, which doesn't seem like a particuarly useful line for notability since so many people are educated in Mass and fan out across out country and world) have not been met. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 04:11, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How many people read that Rolling Stone article and considered the Fuck Truck notable, and still remember it, I wonder? I can't get past "so what" about this: so a bus was nicknamed the "Fuck Truck," so what. Have any notable people begun relationships because of this bus? Any notable people conceived as a result of its runs? Sure, people educated in Mass. have gone on to live in other places, but how many would bother to mention the Fuck Truck in those other places? As buses go, it's no <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furthur.html" title="Furthur">Furthur</a>. One of the most notable buses, the <i>No. 2857</i> bus doesn't even have its own article. Will the "Fuck Truck" be in a museum someday, like those two?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Why delete and rewrite. Why not just rewrite? If I am not mistaken, this mention of other fuck trucks seems to debunk the notion, discussed above, that the fuck truck phenonenon is limited to Welleslty/MIT/Harvard.

<dd>No, now it went from not notable to not notable and also containing unverified information.

<dd>Umm..isn't constant improvement a mark of Wikipedia? Where else do we require that an article be 100% complete in order to be kept? Are the standards for avoiding deletion that strict? We did add need citation tags to these terms ...I am sure that the collaborative character of Wikipediua will lead to these references coming out of the woodwork...I may even track them down if I get a chance.

<dd>I don't think it's notable regardless of whether the term is used at one or five or twenty colleges, except for a slang dictionary. Lacking references for additional uses doesn't help its case for survival, and yet tracking them down doesn't strike me as particularly worthwhile. The usage seems more common in conjunction with porn sites or as someone else noted above, 1970s vans. And even including those things...I still just don't see how it's encyclopedic. Some people said add it to Urban Dictionary. Actually, it's already there <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fuck+truck" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fuck+truck" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fuck+truck</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 23:37, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> in defense of this entry, jeff winterberg has shown photos in the u.s., japan and europe. his book is distributed in the u.s., europe, asia and australia. apart from its artistic merit, his photos have documented some of the most influential and underrepresented music of the u.s. underground. many of these bands were formative precursors to modern styles such as grunge or emo or hardcore. stories featuring him and his photos have appeared in magazines such as tokion, the fader, visionaire, alternative press and vice among others. this entry should be saved due to the cultural significance of his photo work alone.

<p>This page is clearly an advertisement for the Times Square Church. The use of a first-person perspective, an unstructured format, business hours, and mailing address are clear indications that this article serves no purpose other than to advertise. The introduction to the article is a direct copy-and-paste from <a href="http://www.timessquarechurch.org/about/" class="external text" title="http://www.timessquarechurch.org/about/" rel="nofollow">this section</a> on the Time Square Church‚Äôs website.

I tagged the article requesting a complete rewrite. However, the page has been up for about 1¬Ω years, and there have only been 20 edits, which were all direct copy-and-pastes from the church's main webpage.

<li>Hi Avi,</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I understand what you're saying, both about non-notability and wikipedia purpose. Please be assured that the contribution was not intended as a hoax or any claim of authority, but your succint comment reminded me that wikipedia aims at authority and is not the right place to suggest a new term.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By way of explanation, it just seemed to me that oudentheism, 'no gods', describes something different from atheism 'without gods'. As I understand it the privative a- prefix in Greek means 'without', so atheism refers to those who are 'godless','without gods' or who 'have no gods' whereas oudentheism refers to the explicit premise or proposition that there are zero gods.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> A quite useful conceptual model presented in a manner that is both lucid and witty. While the term itself may be uncommon it evokes the increasingly common position many educated people find themselves in of trying to balance sincere attempts to address orientalist critiques of the western perception of the other and a respect for the values of pluralism with a dedication to the tenets of some of the more attractive facets of liberal humanism, many of which seem to be under direct assualt by, at the very least, a loud and vocal minority in the Ummah. Frankly if this is erased it is extremely likely that at some point in the future a far more offensive entry that covers similar ground with less skill will appear.<a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.132.html" title="User:152.163.100.132">152.163.100.132</a> 07:03, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No it wouldn't, because unlike those, Islamophobiaphobia is a real and somewhat common idea, while the others exist only in the realm of humor. Please argue on the merits of Islamophobiaphobia itself please, not on the basis of a slippery slope fallacy. Did Islamophobiaphobia exist as a term before this article? Yes it did. Was it a serious idea? Absolutely. What real basis is there to delete this article other than the fact that it appears to bother you? On the merits of the concept itself, you have failed to give anything substantive. <a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibigon_e00e.html" title="User:Bibigon">Bibigon</a> 16:18, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In fact, "homophobiaphobiaphobia" gets many times more hits than "Islamophobiaphobia", but we certainly don't need an article on it: it's a neologism that has not come into widespread use, and not every state of mind a person can have requires a made-up name and an encyclopedia article. If you really think the concept of Islamophobiaphobia deserves a mention, and if this is not all just a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> stunt, add a paragraph to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> mentioning the new usage.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It could be <b>merged</b> with Islamophobia, perhaps. But I don't see a slippery slope here. There is a phobophobia AKA phobiaphobia, although wikipedia doesn't have an entry for it (fear of phobias would seem to be an inconsequential hypocondria), but not phobophobophobia. Additionally, one finds some more hits on Google when searching not on "Islamophobophobia" or "Islamophobiaphobia" or "Islamophobia-phobia", but on "fear of Islamophobia," which amounts to the same thing. Actually, results from that search indicate there could be two kinds: people afraid of being called Islamophobes, but also people afraid of being victims of Islamophobia, although this is not addressed in the WP entry (similarly, one finds a homophobiaphobia). The latter (fear of being victims of Islamophobia) seems fairly notable in that a Guardian poll indicated 2/3 of Muslims in Britain were considering leaving because of their fear of islamophobia. There's also a Times article by Mick Hume that states <i>"fear of Islamophobia today is considerably stronger than the phenomenon itself."</i> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 17:31, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, it's something that could be merged into the Islamophobia article. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 03:15, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many of those references portray not only accusations of islamophobia but the reactions, often apologetic and cautiously conciliatory, to said claims despite their hostile and sometimes inherently threatening delivery.

<p>Possible promotion/vanity of private theory (but not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). This reads like something out of DSM IV, but there's nothing even close in DSM, and, oddly enough, most of the non-Wikipedia-mirror links seem to tie this term to the listed author in all of the "references", one Brian G. Gilmartin. Then I go to his(?) website, <a href="http://www.love-shy.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.love-shy.com/" rel="nofollow">love-shy.com</a>, which prominently links this Wikipedia article, and fails to offer any evidence that anyone but him has ever written anything about this condition.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that this isn't some (non-notable) psychologist's pet theory? Is the fact that it is published (the books aren't vanity press as far as I can tell) enough to make this notable even if it is?</p>

<p>I put a prod tag on this page, but it was removed, so I'm listing it here.

Rather than being an encyclopaedia article, this page throws together a bunch of storylines from different strips. Massive copy-editing would be necessary to make the prose navigable.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just for clarification, the Wikipedia article in question is about a supposed curse against the Lakers team for trading O'Neal. Most of the Google references mentioned above are about a supposed curse against stocks (that the market goes down) in years in which O'Neals team wins the NBA championship. The two 'curses' are entirely separate and unrelated. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 21:52, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Personally, I don't think it is that notable as Shaq says a number of catch phrases like this which aren't a that big of a deal. To me, "curse" implies a long term issue.

<p>Francolini is a gun engraver. The article has been proposed for deletion (i.e. {{prod}}ed) as "completely autobiographical, non encyclopedic". That it is autobiography is clear. However, there are a couple of claims of notability in the article, which may make it worthwhile for anyone interested in guns and gun collecting. A couple of Francolini's guns have been featured on the cover of magazines. Another one has been made for the Royal Armoury in London. He gets more than 3,000 Google hits, which seems quite a lot for someone in this probably rather specialized field. The question: is Francolini a notable person in his field? Is someone interested in cleaning up the article? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 10:00, 13 February 2006 (UTC) Added a few words for clarification. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 05:01, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, as with Roger, using profanity (even abbreviated) is not going to make you any allies. My point of view (and I abstained above and continue to abstain) is that even if the show 20 to 1 is notable that does not make individual episodes notable, especially when they consist solely of top 20 lists. For example, the VH1 show <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_Week_Ever_d443.html" title="Best Week Ever">Best Week Ever</a> gets an entry, but not separate articles for each episode. I would also like to point out that posting the weekly top 20 list verbatim may be a copyright violation. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:21, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't say you had anything to do with Roger but both of you were rather rude. Regarding copyright, I'm not trying to blackmail anyone. Copyright protects original creative output; Fair Use has to be a small proportion of the whole. Well, a top 20 list is just that. The question for an expert would be is the list itself protected or is the list a small enough part of the whole show to post here. As a test I signed up to have Dave Letterman's top 10 list e-mailed to me, and it carried a copyright notice. I'm sure someone more expert than I will post a definitive answer. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:45, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I forgot to mention is that while he has been added several times to May 29 and 1982, this information was not added to the article page itself. The specific claims mention about his "political" career have been removed, but now there is a claim that he "won first place in the Utah Multimedia Arts festival for 3d gaphics [sic] in April 2000", which seems to almost correct, but it happened in 2001 and it was a three-way tie <a href="http://www.uen.org/umaf/html/2001_winners.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uen.org/umaf/html/2001_winners.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. Perhaps he has become the target of some odd vandalism. There doesn't seem to be much beyond the fact that the books were published that can be verified.

<li>Am I missing the point? I thought I had grasped it rather well: the existence of other similar articles does not mean anything other than that they, too, may be candidates for removal or merging - depending of course on whether the judgment of theiur relative worth is objective. And I was being entirely serious: if you think they are less notable than this, please do go ahead an nominate them. Alternatively, if this group are notable, feel free to include citations to back it up. Right now the article describes them as a small phreaking group, and makes it clear that they were never widely known. Some of the hard data is uncertain (e.g. founding date), calling into question the verifiability of other parts, and much of the article is given to spamming the e-zine. In fact, pretty much the whole article is actually about an e-zine of which few people have heard. Seriously. If the subjects want it kept, fixing the article would be a much better way than recruiting meatpuppets (and I'm not saying you are, only that they are clearly in evidence here). Perhaps they could start by removing 95% of the links. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 21:48, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I think you are missing the point. Also, I didn't say that they are more or less notable than the other articles mentioned. Those articles are actually irrelevant to this discussion, as I'm sure you know. My point is that this article clearly needs work, but the PLA are sufficiently notable to not delete the article altogether. Of course, that's just my opinion. I agree that removing the majority of the links would be a good place to start in improving the article. However, your statement that "pretty much the whole article is actually about an e-zine of which few people have heard" is subjective. How do you know how many people have heard of it? I have no interest in debating this further. But what's wrong with the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat_Puppets_2e33.html" title="Meat Puppets">Meat Puppets</a>? I wish I was one of them.

<p>PLA is a significant site for phreak culture. This significance only increases over time as phreaks and phreaking fade from the popular memory, and are gradually replaced by other [more current] cultures. As an encyclopedic instrument, WP owes it's readership the preservation of this significant subcultural history. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.216.71.179 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.216.71.179_32b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.216.71.179">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Wikipedia has Zerg rushes. Wikipedia has lengthy articles of Starcraft strategy and the origins of every computer game known to man that DOESN'T MEAN A DAMNED THING.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. As many other articles, it could use some good references, but Bergling is a household name to anyone living in Sweden in the 1980s and early 1990s.

<li>I found this reference, "Northern exposure -- Stirling Silver by Ken Skinner," by Hal Hill, <i>Performing Arts &amp; Entertainment in Canada</i>. Fall 1995, Volume 29, Issue 4, page 38. (Review of recording on "Village Jazz" label, a live concert at Stirling Theatre in Stirling, Ontario in 1993), but given the date I think it must be the son.
