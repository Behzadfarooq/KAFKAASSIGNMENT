<li><b>Keep</b> Though the article quotes "forum posts", the "Forum Posts" contain the links and actual discussions that were taking place between Mr. Dorman and the online community which he deceived for his own personal monetary gain. Once exposed as a fraud he continued to post altered pics in an attempt to maintain credibility. The BB.com forums have over 100,000 registered members, many of which take the advice and buy the supplements of the "Fitness Experts". Mr. Dorman deserves to have his name posted up here as a warning against future schemes he may concoct. <code>SM</code></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Louis Dorman is wellknown in the bodybuilding community for his blatant use of doctored images for his own commercial enterprise. The claims made in the article clearly link to discussion on the Bodybuilding.com board. In addition, Louis Dorman himself admitted to doctoring pictures -- "highlighting and cropped" -- in the following post: <a href="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showpost.php?p=9912993&amp;postcount=223" class="external free" title="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showpost.php?p=9912993&amp;postcount=223" rel="nofollow">http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showpost.php?p=9912993&amp;postcount=223</a>.

<dd>I agree. Unfortunately, however, the only person guilty of "character assassination" is Louis Dorman himself. As the article's citations show, he is thoroughly guilty of what the article accuses him of. In fact, it was even accompanied by a public admission, which I attempted to discuss with Gtoomey in his <a href="../../../g/t/o/User_talk%7EGtoomey_8d47.html" title="User talk:Gtoomey">talk page</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> First off, everything presented in the wiki is true. It showed an original photo, it showed an altered photo, it said that Louis went to school for digital editing....it doesn't say *he* did it. It lets people make their own judgement, based on facts. As for not being relevant or important enough, that's crap. Fitness/health is a billion dollar industry and this guy was one of the most well respected 'success stories' ever. Countless people looked up to him; people have a right to know the truth. There is no reason for this not to be on wiki.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.53.177.193 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.53.177.193_41c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.53.177.193">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>I agree. I've also provided links showing that he was published. FLEX wasn't the only magazine to feature him. He was also in an assortment of other ones... including non-fitness related mags like FHM and MAXIM. 24.79.43.137 23:05, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, agreed. Unfortunately for some here, anything Bodybuilding-related is obscure and not of great relevance. For the hundreds of thousands that are interested -- this is highly relevant material. Especially since I have provided evidence showing the use of his advertisements in major magazines. Dorman's doctoring will surely be the subject of discussion at fitness expos in the near future. 24.79.43.137 23:09, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it is of such great relevance to the bodybuilding community, why aren't there any articles in such bodybuilding magazines about the controversy? <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 23:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We have three speedy tags and an AfD tag, this is getting out of hand. Personally, I think the AfD should run it's course, since "notability" is there and it's not a complete full frontal deprecation of the subject. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 23:50, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
