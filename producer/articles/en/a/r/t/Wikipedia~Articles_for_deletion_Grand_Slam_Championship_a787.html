<li><b>Delete</b> Disputed, no proper sources are found other than a mention in passing on a WWE website and an essay from a fan site.

<li><b>strong keep</b> I don't know much about this, but from the minimal sources available, this appears to be a valid term and a very important accomplishment of the sport.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've heard it referred to on WWE television plenty of times in the past, they pushed the term pretty hard when Shawn Michaels became the first "Grand Slam" champion so it's not like it's a made up thing. <a href="../../../m/p/j/User%7EMPJ-DK_0cbc.html" title="User:MPJ-DK">MPJ-DK</a> 06:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Even though WWE hasn't used the term in a long time, it doesn't mean we should get rid of it. For example, even though the old American Football League doesn't exist anymore, should we wipe that article out as well because they merged with the NFL?

<li><b>Delete</b> As pointed out in the article itself, the very term "Grand Slam" varies per the promotional needs of WWE. Shawn Michaels has been dubbed an achiever of the Grand Slam. Fine. Add that info briefly to his article. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 11:19, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Thats a pretty flawed logic. True, Shawn Michaels when he won the title was considered <i>the</i> Grand Slam Champion, since he was the only one to accomplish it. If he was the only one to win it, I would agree, merge it into Shawn Michaels article, but you can't since 6 or 7 (maybe 8 pending who's definition you would like to use) have accomplished this. Having a dispute on what definition it is (if we could agree on one definition) is no reason to delete the whole thing and say it never existed. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 21:13, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you can cite a reference from WWE themselves giving their current definition of what the "Grand Slam" is then I'll change my vote. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 12:14, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>DUH! That has been the situation there for over 4 months. No source doesn't equal deletion of article. We have definitions, but we can't agree on which ones. WWE hardly chimes in on things and fails to post things like that. Asking for a source by WWE doesn't work anyways since we don't usually like primary sources, we usually need secondary sources from a outside source. The issue is not if that it exists. The problem is that we can't agree on the correct definition. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 16:52, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Suriel1981, if the article relating to Grand Slam goes then all wrestler listed on this article will have to have all comments about the Grand Slam removed, because you can't "add that info briefly" to the wrestlers individual articles if the actual Grand Slam article no longer exists. If the Grand Slam article goes then all references to it must be purged as well, otherwise this will create an argument to re-do the Grand Slam Article. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenhusted_5fa7.html" title="User:Darrenhusted">Darrenhusted</a> 18:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why would the references have to go? A simple addition to an article saying something along the lines of <i>this title win meant that &lt;insert name&gt; had held every recognised title belt, an achievement referred to as the "Grand Slam"</i>.

<dd><b>Reply</b> I think in my comment I explained why all references would have to go, because there would be temptation to re-create the article to explain what a WWE Grand Slam is. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenhusted_5fa7.html" title="User:Darrenhusted">Darrenhusted</a> 14:20, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Read Shawn Michaels book. It states that during a meeting before he was set to win the IC Title, one of the producers spoke up and said that if they went through with the win, that would mean Shawn has won every title in the WWE. Vince then said that it was important and they needed a name for it. That was the birth of the Grand Slam Champion. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillswitch_Engage_cada.html" title="User:Killswitch Engage">User:Killswitch Engage</a></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> To me, this article and the Triple Crown article are too related to have one exist without the other. GS borrows heavily from TC, and if the TC article stays, this should too. Also, enough people have given enough sources to keep it. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnakinjmt_7c04.html" title="User:Anakinjmt">Anakinjmt</a> 07:24, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
