<p>Wikipedia isn't apparently 'indescriminate information', and this list is pretty much that. It would be near impossible to complete (there must be thousands of video games not released in the USA), especially as the criteria is so broad that stuff like Animal Forest (the Japanese version of Animal Crossing, which was released in the US on the Gamecube) or alterernative versions of games like Kingdom Hearts 2 - Final Mix are included. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 00:29, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - Professors and historians are not rock stars or cricket players. Obviously, not everyone would have heard of them. Unless someone gets down to study Tulu history or maybe Karnataka history they might not come across this author. But for someone who is a student of these less glamorous subjects, Prof. Gururaja Bhat is certainly notable. A quick search on books.google.com and worldcat.org can throw light on his notability. For example, a search on books.google.com reveals that Rama Jois has used P. Gururaja Bhat's books as references in his own books. Now did somebody say, "Who the hell is Rama Jois?". Well, Rama Jois was a Judge of the Supreme Court of India and later Governer of Chattisgarh. These are only the highest offices that he has held and needless to say he's held and holds several more. And where has he referred to P. Gururaja Bhat? Well in his book, "Legal and Constitutional History of India: Ancient, Judicial and Constitutional System" which is considered a most seminal and definitive work by students and scholars of the subject. Go to books.google.com, search for this book and then search the book for "gururaja bhat". If a Supreme Court judge who is himself a respected historian can refer to another author, then by implication, the other author is certainly no quack! btw, the book that M.Rama Jois has referred to is Gururaja Bhat's "Tuluva history and culture". Now that notability has been established, do a speedy keep and mark it as a stub. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarvagnya_de49.html" title="User talk:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 22:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> before we remove it, can someone please explain to us why this should have a Unicode character in the first place? Sajdah redirects to Sujed, the Muslim practice of prostration in prayer, which does not seem relevant. Just what is "House of Sajed"? and why whould it have a character? Taking a wild guess, is it analogous to the conventional symbol for Sign of the Cross in Catholic prayer-books, indicating where one should make the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sign_of_the_cross.html" title="Sign of the cross">sign of the cross</a>-(a symbol which by the way is not used in that article) -- but why should it be "<i>house</i> of Sajdah"? <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 18:46, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or develop</b> I think the article should be kept. While it doesn't really qulaify for notability, I'm sure there's a lot to be said about the history of that character. I don't really think any typographical symbols have a lot to be said about, nontheless, there ought to be information available about them. There should be a mention or a description about that symbol somewhere in wikipedia, after all, if I crated this article in the first place, it's because I was intrested in knowing what that symbol was and I couldn't find it anywhere in wikipedia&#160;! So yeah, if it HAS to be deleted, please make sure it is mentionned somewhere in an article what this symbol is.

<p>Procedural listing, it was speedied without notification, which I disagree with, and hence restored it. However, I'm also not able to improve it beyond its present content, due to my lack of comprehension of the financial dailies and the like, although it *does* merit more as a large Australian corporate player - I created it as I was amazed it didn't have an article. The present version of the article is slightly better than the one that got speedied, but my main newspaper archive seems to have dropped AFR&#160;:(.

<li><b>Don't delete.</b> This video, along with many others, are an important lesson in how social media and networks like YouTube, MySpace, and even Wikipedia, among others work.

<li><b>Don't delete</b>. This is a good example of the power of new technologies. You Tube allows ordinary people with limited resources to produce a parody of works (SNL Dick in the Box) produced by multibillion dollar companies. Before the advent of such technologies, the likelyhood of such a parody succeeding would be non existent. This article documents the effect of technologies such as You Tube on the evolution of the media. --Dan 20:33, 25 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— Danbeck0208 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danbeck0208_e1b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danbeck0208">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

He has played at two national music festivals (Austin, TX's SXSW and Milwaukee, WI's Summerfest) of which musicians like Guster, John Mayer, Jamie Cullum, and Hanson have played at. He has played with major label artists such as <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Nathanson_a765.html" title="Matt Nathanson">Matt Nathanson</a> (March 30th, '07), <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_Radin_4801.html" title="Joshua Radin">Joshua Radin</a> (who is on the Grey's Anatomy soundtrack), <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandi_Thom_2feb.html" title="Sandi Thom">Sandi Thom</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schuyler_Fisk_5e10.html" title="Schuyler Fisk">Schuyler Fisk</a>, and This World Fair at more intimate settings and he has also played trumpet at Carnegie Hall. He has fused a new genre of music (Folk/Hop) which has started to spread among other indy artists. The person who wants to delete this article has simply not done their research (there are over 10,000 articles for the search "Ari Herstand" in quotes on Google, this may seem small, however, Herstand is the <b>only</b> "Ari Herstand" in the world). Though he is an independent artist, his vast number of performances at the aforementioned major venues as well the widespread acknowledgment of his success as a musician (every single <a href="http://myspace.com/ariherstand" class="external text" title="http://myspace.com/ariherstand" rel="nofollow">newspaper article</a> being positive) makes him a notable addition to Wikipedia. I can provide more evidence if needed for all of my above statements. In response to Akradecki: according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> he meets the <i>central criterion</i> of notability, namely, "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable." Your case is therefore completely null and void.<a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighOnYou_acc0.html" title="User:HighOnYou">HighOnYou</a> 07:24, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment/response</b> The problem here is that you don't seem to understand how things work at Wikipedia. You said "The person who wants to delete this article has simply not done their research", but our policies make it very clear that it is <i>your</i> responsibility to do the research, not the person nominating it for deletion. The burden of demonstrating notability is <i>up to you</i> when you write the article, and you didn't bother to put <i>any</i> of the above detailed information into the article. Notability is based on what's actually <i>in</i> the article, not on all the stuff you leave out. Re-write the article, detail what you've said here, back it with citations and I'll be happy to change my "delete" to a "keep". Again, and this is really important for you to understand, it's <i>your</i> job to do the research and properly document how the article's subject meets our notability criteria <i>within the article, not here</i>! <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 13:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I apologize that when I made the page I solely put links to newspaper articles on the bottom without incorporating their contents in citations. I will work on that, however, these facts are not made up and this page does not need to be put up for deletion because of a sloppy article. An unreferenced tag would suffice.

<li><b>Keep with Edits</b>: If citations can be made for the Summerfest concert and use of the artists music on the Real World, I would say that this musician has proven national credibility.

<p>I'm not really sure what this is; it's pretty confusing, but it seems to be some kind of vanity article presented as fiction, created by a user with the same name as the article. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 03:45, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think it's good that someone did a great job on making a fictional article. Whoever did this, also stated the names of the voice actors/actresses and developers. He/she also said to give them credit. I think it's very creative!

<li><b>Keep</b> - I see were you are coming from. He/she may have did some editing to an exsiting article, however, I do not know what addtional info was added to that existing article, so I cannot not personally call it non-sense, whoever did that. As of this debate in this created article, I can see some work put into it and he/she is not calling it his/her own. If you go to "references" section in the article, you can see the names of the real people that drew the fictional people and the voice actors/actress as well. Due to the information I see in the article stating to the public that this is all fictional and is trying to explain the detail about it to the best of his/hers ability, I would say, keep the article. Lets give this one a chance and see what happens once this debate is closed. Lets see if this person abuses his/hers privilege of making an fictional article, offical on this site to it's own category. But, hey, this is my personal comment regarding this. Many of you may see it differently than I. ChrisRB 06:18, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I mean, I can see this user has to be a big fan of FLCL. I give whoever credit on the possible time that was spent, but I can see why this should be deleted, or should it? I'm more of a computer guy, so I'm not good and making calls on this. I only go by My own personal actions. When was this article made anyways? I've been on this site before and I know what show Haruko is from, but the info provided on ths new article is not true? or is it? I guess I'll just have to search for sources to answer my question.

<li>I see. Now, I have another question. Lets say I'm doing a project that has been copyright by me, and I want to make an article about it. Can I do so without it be in the same shoes as this article I'm seeing now? I will not bug any of you anymore for such info, lol. As for the fictional deal, I see now. So this fictionl character maybe getting deleted due to the fact of it not being his own character profile and 2. Because this character is an FLCL character, yet different profile, it will be deleted casue of it. ChrisRB 07:02, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's generally frowned-upon to make an article about something you created because of the inherent <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a>. If what you made is famous enough to merit an article, someone else will eventually write one for you. And no, this article is up for deletion for reasons that have nothing to do with copyright or ownership. It's more because it is about a fictional creation that is not famous or influential in the grand scheme of things. FLCL gets an article because it is important and well-known. This actress-character is not. It seems shallow, I know, but that's how the policy works. Wikipedia is a big thing and there have to be some qualifications about what gets in, otherwise everybody and their imaginary friend would have an article, and it would be impossible to find any solid information. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 07:10, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, we use the ancient and honorable <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> provision of our Wikipediology to&#160;!vote in deletion discussions. Somehow, somehow most high school articles stay in the picture at the end of the discussion. Must be divine intervention. My <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_opinions_6a18.html" title="User:Noroton/opinions">humble essay</a> actually says something about that. When I get a little less busy, I hope to make a proposal about schools which I hope will bring around Wikipedia written policy to something closer to what Wikipedians actually want, or at least what we actually do (or maybe some fine Wikipedian will do it first). Then we can all bend down and worship <i>that</i> idol. Seriously, you make a good point, but <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is policy and maybe that's what allows practice to outpace policy writing.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> for the academic championship. There is no consensus at Wikipedia that high schools are or are not inherently notable, as evidenced by the fact that high school AfDs are closed as "no consensus", "keep" or "delete" on a case by case basis. This one has it. I think a school with an academic championship is more notable than one with a great basketball program, but this particular contest is only fought in 39 states, hence the weak in my keep. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 00:49, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak delete</b> Actually Noroton said it exactly: "most high school articles stay ." Most, but not all. I do not see how one can use the true statement that most stay in, to deduce that all stay in, or that all should. . What we should be trying to do is to find the guidelines on their merits so we don't have to start from the beginning each time, and all understand what clearly is and what clearly isn't, and only need to discuss the borderline ones. Saying that all should stay in (or out) makes it impossible to even discuss guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This one is borderline. The 2 championships might show some notability, except that they are not documented. they could be, I think. . The other Erie high school articles show that more content can often be found. I'll change to weak keep if there's any non-trivial 3rd party RS. GreatSchools is not a RS for notability: beyond recording the state Dept of Ed data, it "allows principals to add a great deal of additional information about curriculum, programs, activities, school vision and leadership." That is, it consists of directory data plus self-advertising. It is a convenient RS for the directory data, so as not to need finding the official state basic information. To list Central High School Official Website, Erie School District Profile of Central High, and Central High's main Web page at Great Schools Web site is one source, not three--and all of them good only for the directory information. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:40, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I appreciate that it does not satisfy the criteria in that the band has not released a studio album yet, but Havok himself has stated that the album should be released in the summer of 2007. At the very least, this should form part of the <a href="../../../a/f/i/AFI_%28band%29_12c4.html" title="AFI (band)">AFI</a> page, but then it will only need to be re-expanded when the album is released.</dd>

<dd>It's worth noting (per the suggestions under <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">AfD Wikietiquette</a>) that I am currently the primary author of the article (although I did not create it.)

<li><b>Agreed that article should be kept.</b> Blaqk Audio is signed to Interscope Records, as stated by the Administrator of the <a href="http://board.despairfaction.com" class="external text" title="http://board.despairfaction.com" rel="nofollow">Official AFI Message Board</a> and the Official AFI fanclub, <a href="http://www.despairfaction.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.despairfaction.com/" rel="nofollow">the Despair Faction</a>, meaning that an album will be released in due time. In addition to what Mnesimache has mentioned, this project has been predetermined and expected for quite some time, portraying its longevity. It has been hosted on <a href="http://www.vh1.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.vh1.com/" rel="nofollow">VH1.com</a>in <a href="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1477933/20030905/story.jhtml" class="external text" title="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1477933/20030905/story.jhtml" rel="nofollow">2003</a>, and again in <a href="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1485988/20040325/story.jhtml" class="external text" title="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1485988/20040325/story.jhtml" rel="nofollow">2004</a>, provided by MTV News. <a href="http://www.punknews.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.punknews.org/" rel="nofollow">Punknews.org</a> has also posted various updates on Blaqk Audio project, including mentions in <a href="http://www.punknews.org/article/7008" class="external text" title="http://www.punknews.org/article/7008" rel="nofollow">September 2003</a> (referring to an article in <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5935498/afi_go_electronic" class="external text" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5935498/afi_go_electronic" rel="nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>), <a href="http://www.punknews.org/article/22444" class="external text" title="http://www.punknews.org/article/22444" rel="nofollow">February 2007</a>, and again in <a href="http://www.punknews.org/article/22702" class="external text" title="http://www.punknews.org/article/22702" rel="nofollow">March 2007</a>. Furthermore, the project has been mentioned in various other printed magazines, including Alternative Press (June 2006 issue) and Guitar World (August 2006 issue). Regardless, even if it is decided that this article should be deleted, it will definitely be reposted once the CD is released and once the project is further noted by the media.

<li><b>Extremely Weak Keep</b> Records are available for purchase online, and artist has a current MySpace page and listing on Last.FM. Bio information on both sites is nearly identical to the WP entry (the MySpace page is a word for word copy). Brief review of genre albums (Happy Hardcore) reveals some use of tracks by this artist.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Valid topic - but ... probably not a valid nomination for deletion. The unverifiable bio info should be moved to the talk page until it is sourced correctly. Deletion means that no article for DJ Mystik should ever be written, which in this case is not right since this artist clearly does exist and appears on CDs for sale in North America, Korea and Europe, which meets WP notability standards - it IS verifiable that the artist exists (a quick check shows that even I have had about a dozen or so DJ Mystik tune remixes on my iPod for a few years) - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 11:12, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am under the opinion that as a TOPIC, <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Mystik_eada.html" title="DJ Mystik">DJ Mystik</a> is a valid Wikipedia article. As for the current entry - it has many fatal flaws. But that doesn't warrant an all-out ban on an article (which voting to delete effectively does). All of our issues can be remedied with a non-deletion route (always preferable in WIkipedia) by a CLEANUP in making the article a stub until some future editor has the ability and resources to flesh it out properly. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 18:15, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is interesting to note the timing of this AFD, in light of the current lawsuit by Harlan Ellison in large part over a TCJ interview. What a coincidence. <a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhinoracer_4df4.html" title="User:Rhinoracer">Rhinoracer</a> 21:00, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That said: <b>Weak Keep</b>. The Comics Journal is as close as comics have to a scholarly journal, and its interviews are a significant (arguably, renowned) part of that. Although I agree with many of the delete votes that the article in its current state is inappropriate, I can't help but feel that improving the article -- perhaps so that it is no longer a list -- is the direction to go with this one. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 00:41, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> If the consensus is that this shouldn't be an article, I would suggest that it become a Wikiproject Comics project page instead. It could be very useful to people looking for sources for comics-related articles. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 00:44, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s> <b>Comment</b> (see later comment) I really can see the value of this, but I can't see it fitting the format, guidelines, and policies that are in place. Even as a "Project protected reference/resource page" I can't see this fitting. If someone could point out a ref to the process/precedent for that type of page, I'll support moving this, but otherwise, it'll, reluctantly, need to go. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 01:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't know if there is an established process, as such, but there are existing pages in Wikipedia space devoted to helping people find sources for articles; <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENewspapers_and_magazines_request_service_a0a1.html" title="Wikipedia:Newspapers and magazines request service">Wikipedia:Newspapers and magazines request service</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResearch_resources_5936.html" title="Wikipedia:Research resources">Wikipedia:Research resources</a> come to mind.</dd>
<dd>Why would lack of precedent be a problem, anyway? Helping members do research for articles is an obviously useful thing for a Wikiproject to do. It helps the encyclopedia, so why not do it? <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 03:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>My main reason for wanting examples/precedent pointed out in this case is that I wouldn't want this being moved attacked as an attempt by editors to save a page they "like" that doesn't belong on Wiki.<br />
That being said, <b>Video games/Magazines</b> <i>is</i> a good example for moving this to a Comics sub-page. But in moving this a few other things would need to be addressed:
<ul>
<li>Page title. The title would need to be tweaked.</li>
<li>Layout. It needs to be converted from a bullet list to a table.</li>
<li>Information. While the subject and issue number are a good start, it should be like an expanded footnote/reference with the interviewer, month/year, and page(s). The title, if it's something other than "Interview wit..." should be there also.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That would also set it up for expansion to a list covering TCJ contents in general, if there is such a desire.<br />

<li><b>Bloody STRONG Keep</b>. This is useful to researchers. This is useful information. This is entirely in keeping with the point of Wikipedia. There is no better reason to delete given here than "I don't like it". You know what? Tough. This is an extension of the article on the Journal, and were it a category people would say listify. It's solid, sourced information that is utilised by scholars. It does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in any shape, manner or form. I would note the people who are trying to force their opinion through with the claim that it violates <i>Wikipedia_is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i> miss the vital point that policy makes, that <b>"there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries"</b>. The section even goes on to detail the only areas that have consensus, none of which this list meets. WP:NOT asks us to consider <b>what a reader would expect to find under the same heading in an encyclopedia</b>. I would suggest this article fits the bill. You don't personally happen to like it? Ignore it. Edit your style sheet to pretend it doesn't exist. But don't delete it. It's information which is of use. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:03, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Notable magazine and an academic source. The Journal is a respected, quality publication with a solid history in comics journalism and criticism, an its interview subjects (such as the likes of Robert Crumb, Harvey Kurtzman etc.) are definitely more notable than the list of people in Playboy. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterrestrial_c927.html" title="User:Counterrestrial">Counterrestrial</a> 06:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, it is useful but I think something needs doing with it as it stands. Possibly best discussed on the Comics Project talk page after this deletion is decided. (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 19:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>A few notes</b> - First, to the person who's accusing me of colluding with Harlan Ellison, rest assured that I have no knowledge of said suit. The lawsuit or lack of same has nothing to do with this nomination and the notion that a lawsuit could somehow be influenced by the existence or non-existence of a list of interview subjects is ludicrous. Second, I have explained the reason for the nomination, which is that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. That a number of people were interviewed by the same publication does not create the sort of association that would warrant an article. Compliance with <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, which is a guideline and not policy, is irrelevant if the list itself fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which is policy. Third, <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">It's useful</a> is an incredibly poor reason for keeping an article. All sorts of things that all sorts of people find useful get deleted off Wikipedia every day. Finally, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a> is also a horrible reason for keeping an article. If other articles which don't meet Wikipedia policy and guidelines exist, then the proper response to them is to deleted them, not to point to them in an attempt to save other non-compliant articles. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 12:48, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, "Is there any precedent for deleting such lists?" I'm all for setting a precedent if necessary, but I don't believe you've made any sort a case that this list fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, or that other similar lists fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.

<li>With all due respect, you could list off a <i>million</i> different list articles and none of them have any relevance to whether or not <i>this</i> article should be kept. However, I have in fact put a couple of the lists you posted up earlier for deletion. Do I have a <i>specific</i> precedent of a <i>specific</i> list of interviews in a <i>specific</i> magazine being deleted? No. But there are any number of precedents of poor list articles being deleted. I have no idea if other such lists of people interviewed in a particular magazine have been nominated for deletion. It strikes me as rather irrelevant whether or not such a similar deletion exists if <i>this</i> list is one that should be deleted. If you read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> you'll see that it bars lists of loosely associated topics.

<p>As per the sentence that describes the article: <i>This is a list of locations, characters, items, and other terms from the anime/manga series One Piece.</i> As I read through alot of the article, it appears to be just a dumping ground for anything One Piece related. A form of listcruft/fancruft in my opinion. Also: it should be noted, there is character and location (as well as plenty of other One Piece lists) on Wikipedia already. This list seems to be just repeating alot of information, that's listed elsewhere. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 08:25, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Keep</b>: Hmm... There are no characters here. No locations as such (maybe one or two noted). There are a lot of articles linked to this page. As for repeating info... Well I can ensure you a LOT of this is here as back up for those articles linked to here and in MOST cases the info is only here. It is here to save the other articles being clogged up with a TON of info that is little relevent to the article. Maybe it is list/fancruft but it is not a dumping ground. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 09:07, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Several reasons. Firstly, I'm not sure it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Secondly, it reads like an advert. Even the external links are advert-like.

<p>Hi. I'm the author of the article. I'm fairly new to Wiki, so forgive me if I don't understand everything. My Intention in posting it is to explain Nooalf in a succinct manner to people who don't want to spend the time reading the Nooalf website. It's also a matter of matching the style to the audience. You will immediately note that the website is not the usual scholarly desertation you would expect for such subjects.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong here: Wikipedia is supposed to be the ultimate Encyclopedia. More info and especially newer info than a paper encyclopedia could ever hope to contain. So is it not a good thing that people can get the basic facts about Nooalf here?</p>
<p>I will try to be brief in addressing the above comments:</p>
<p>No, it isn't the IPA. The IPA was made in an era when sound recording was not a practical matter for linguists. Today, transcribing the odd vocalizations of remote tribes is not neccassary, and the entire activity is probably near extinction. Although it is not intended to encompass all possible sounds of the human speach organs, Nooalf does provide ordinary people with a keyboard friendly means to write what they hear. It's based on English, which has more phonemes than most other languages, so it covers most languages fairly well. Plus, sticking to it's basic philosophy, more letters must be added to if needed.</p>
<p>The use of the term 'Unsourcable' seems to imply that something must become widespread before inclusion in Wiki. If somebody searches 'nooalf' I think they would probably want to get the info from the world's foremost authority. Judging from my samplings of the fantastic width, breadth and depth of the information contained in Wiki, you don't require the imprimature of degreed scholars for everything.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you reference the Dvorak keyboard. However, Nooalf is typable on all ordinary keyboards in either the QWERTY layout or Dvorak.</p>
<p>About Wikifying the article. I would appreciate it if you could add it to the appropriate catagories and lists.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>, per Iridescenti, I looked at some web pages written in Nooalf, reminds me of my daughter's IM chats. =<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilling_sparrows_c660.html" title="User:Killing sparrows">killing sparrows</a> 04:30, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've read the guidelines for articles to be included in Wiki and can see how Nooalf could fail on the source requirements. Although Noo alf is discussed in many places on the web and the chart is available from at least 1 other source, there is no real paper coverage that I know of. I don't know how much leeway you have in your decisions, but maybe you could take a few days to consider this. Maybe listen to Closer To The Heart by Rush. But, Merge and redirect is OK by me.````JO 753</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The reason I brought up IPA is because it is widely used, and has been for a long time. It doesn't matter if you think nooalf is a great invention, what matters is that no one's written about it, making it not only non-notable, but also unverifiable. Merging novel original concepts into another article is not a good option. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 11:15, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Opinion</b> Upon further reading of Wiki guidlines, I can see that there is a problem with how to consider notability and sourcability. The definitions become unusable when the subject is obscure. This is pretty much the case with any current English spelling reform effort. Since the entire field of endevour has never been very well known, newer attempts, no matter how well known in the spelling reform community, have virtually no media coverage. The only 3 organizations in this field are the Simplified Spelling Society, the American Literacy Council and the Saundspel discussion group.</li>
</ul>
<p>I first researched spelling reform on the internet in 1999 to see what was already in existence. Joining the Saundspel group and getting critiques from the other reformers is currently the highest level of peer review you can find on this subject. You may be able to find archived discussions from 1999 thru 2001 about Nooalf. (I don't seem to be able to do anything with Yahoo. If you forget your password and secret answer, you're screwed!) Also, you could check with Joe Little at ALC. ````JO 753 3-30-2007</p>

<li>Sorry am not familiar with the protocol for leaving messages here. I do not believe there is a conflict of interest here - although it HAS been written by a member of the club, there is no advertising or information that would make it biased. Although there are few, if any at all, secondary sources available for this club, it is certainly one of the very few mahjong clubs in university campuses worldwide. As stated in the article, mahjong is commonly seen to be an underground activity, and the aim of the club is to bring it into the open where it is less associated with gambling and more as an intelligent, interesting activity. --Twenty_something <a href="../../../t/w/e/User_talk%7ETwenty_something_a3c3.html" title="User talk:Twenty something">(talk)</a> 10:48, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>One of the things I didn't understand was why this club was considered a non notable organisation, when other clubs that exist in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_University_of_Western_Australia_e7e4.html" title="The University of Western Australia">The University of Western Australia</a> were considered notable clubs - not to say that they shouldn't exist, but just out of curiousity - perhaps I could then structure the article like that. --Twenty_something <a href="../../../t/w/e/User_talk%7ETwenty_something_a3c3.html" title="User talk:Twenty something">(talk)</a> 10:50, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>: I'll try to address all three of your main points. First of all, in <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> it states "<i>you should avoid or exercise great caution when editing articles related to you, your organization,...</i>". The entire article can be viewed as an advertisement to increase membership in your club. In addition, listing yourself in the "Committee" names can be viewed as self-aggrandizement. Secondly, you state "there are few, if any at all, secondary sources available for this club", which almost automatically implies that it is not notable enough for inclusion. In <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, it states "<i>A topic is generally notable if it has been the subject of coverage that is independent of the subject, reliable, and attributable.</i>" If your club were notable, there'd be numerous newspaper and magazine stories about it, but there are none and so your club is not notable either. The article thus fails to meet the official policy (<a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), which state '"<i>Articles should contain only material that has been published by reliable sources.</i>" Third of all, you wonder why your club was targeted for deletion versus all the other UWA clubs. Please see <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>, which although not a policy or guideline, states "<i>The presence of similar articles does not necessarily validate the existence of other articles, and may instead point to the possibility that those articles also ought to be deleted.</i>" It is likely that all non-notable clubs at UWA will show up here at AfD in time, and you can help improve Wikipedia by nominating for deletion any other club articles which you are aware of and which fail to meet the notability criteria. I hope this clarifies why the UWA Mahjong Club article is likely to fail this AfD and be deleted. It is simply not notable enough for inclusion in WP, unless you are able to find reliable secondary sources which discuss it. Thanks. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeattle_Skier_c9bc.html" title="User:Seattle Skier">Seattle Skier</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeattle_Skier_72b9.html" title="User talk:Seattle Skier">(talk)</a> 13:04, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Most of those mentioned at University of Western Australia Student Clubs are redlinks or links to some other entity of the same name, or links to disambiguation pages. But following you pointing out the notability - or lack thereof - I have visited the links and added requests for additional references where appropriate.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 01:01, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's one more UWA club article which isn't on that list: UWA Martial Arts Club. This one fits the non-notability criteria for speedy deletion <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a> (as do all of these clubs, really), so I have reluctantly added a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-club_c995.html" title="Template:Db-club">db-club</a>}} tag to it. The list itself (University of Western Australia Student Clubs) is a strong candidate for deletion, or merging into the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Western_Australia_b313.html" title="University of Western Australia">University of Western Australia</a> article. I really find no joy in this, since I'm much more of an inclusionist than a deletionist, but we have to draw the line somewhere. WP is not the place to host extra, highly-Google-visible websites for these clubs. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeattle_Skier_c9bc.html" title="User:Seattle Skier">Seattle Skier</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeattle_Skier_72b9.html" title="User talk:Seattle Skier">(talk)</a> 01:43, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>: Perhaps you are right that COI is too strong a term to use for a student club. Yet the article falls solidly within the guideline listed at <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html#Self-promotion" title="WP:COI">WP:COI#Self-promotion</a>, since it is certainly meant to increase exposure for the club and perhaps also to drum up membership.

<li>The cast and crew areas are actually vetted by someone else before they're updated, and they <i>are</i> independent.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Quite an awful movie, but that's not a valid reason. I am not convinced by the redlink thing. If you take movies by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bresson_afb4.html" title="Robert Bresson">Robert Bresson</a>, for instance, who was using amateurs as actors at the end of his career (see <i><a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouchette.html" title="Mouchette">Mouchette</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancelot_du_Lac_%28film%29_a4fc.html" title="Lancelot du Lac (film)">Lancelot du Lac</a></i> for instance), you will have redlinks everywhere too.

<li><b>Keep</b> - notable film. The nominator defining it as "soft porn" is a POV judgement call. It wasn't at all. I agree not every film can be listed, but this one has a cult following and includes cast members such as Landon Hall and Sara Suzanne Brown who are quite prolific in the 1980s-1980s B-movie industry. I'm also pretty certain this film was issued or distributed by a major company, however the new version of IMDb doesn't appear to list this information anymore. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:44, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>—for once I find myself in full agreement with badlydrawnjeff. I struggled a bit with this, and my first inclination was to say delete, but I think there's sufficient evidence that it has achieved at least a minor cult status. The fact that it was mentioned in the obituary, the fact that a band is named after it, regular appearances on television (including, apparently, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Up_All_Night_495c.html" title="USA Up All Night">USA Up All Night</a>, international distribution, <a href="../../../n/e/r/Neriah_Davis_6be9.html" title="Neriah Davis">Neriah Davis</a>'s first film; all of this adds up to sufficient notability, IMO. <i>On-line</i> references do seem a bit weak (although the existence of the same-named band makes searching difficult), but that argument leads to a "recentism" bias. I see enough to make me confident that there are reliable sources to be found, even if Google has trouble finding them. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 00:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This war has never happened and is only hypothetical. Even the Israeli-Lebanon War was not classified as a war until nearly weeks into the 2006 conflcit. No attempt has been made to create a Iran War page even though that as recevied much mroe attention and is more likely. In addition the only edits to this page have been made by radical conservatives, and the enitre page seems to promoting a view point. --Stalin1942 00:18, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. About four fifths of article consists of books and sources relating to the subject, while the article itself says not much more than that there have been speculations over a US-China war after the Cold War. That is too thin a basis for an article, an article needs some description of the subject matter.

I agree with you that we don't delete stubs for being stubs, but I felt that the revision I described above was not even a stub, but a mere collection of literature with no "body" of encyclopedic content. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:47, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I think World War III is a considerably more encyclopedic topic than this one.--<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 15:25, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>And one has <b>three</b> quoted references, all taken in turn from <b>one</b> book. The other has many dozens. Therefore one is a delete, and the other is a keep. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 15:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because someone can't be bothered to actually get the refernces into the article, even though they are certainly out there on the Web, is not a valid reason to delete. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 15:42, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Again, lack of content in a valid encyclopedic concept is a reason for <i>expansion</i>, not deletion. The cites are well-out there - <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> returns 48 hits for "Sino-American War" (in quotes) while <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> returns 23 for the same term.

<li>I don't quite agree, and as I said, I would need to see <b>evidence</b> rather than argument before I would change my mind. As it stands it is a delete I'm afraid. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 16:05, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, it does seem to be sourceable. I am concerned that this is going to open the floodgates for hypothetical wars between X and Y, as long as a handful of people have commented on them. This would not just include wars of the future, but past hypothetical wars which never happened, including alternate versions of real wars, if they started earlier or later. Reliably sourced speculation probably extends to all manner of subjects, not just wars. I note that commercial products which have not been confirmed by their manufacturer, particularly video games, are almost never allowed to have articles, even if there is 'reliable' speculation about them; Gears of War 2, for example. The extent to which we want Wikipedia to have articles about hypothetical things is a question which goes beyond this AfD. I sympathise with Guinnog's view; it's easy to see this as being against the spirit of the policy, if not the letter. Finally, this article will probably end up as a grab-bag of pop culture refs, like the <a href="../../../w/w/3/WW3_0695.html" title="WW3">WW3</a> article. We should revisit this in a year; perhaps the policies will have been made more specific.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 17:59, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> If such a possible war has been noted in reliable sources, then it is notable enough for an article. Just as the U.S had plans 100 year ago for war with Canada Mexico Japan, and Britain, I am confident that official and think-tank planners are making analyses of another possible China-America War (see<a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Relief_Expedition_a14c.html" title="China Relief Expedition">China Relief Expedition</a> for the U.S. invasion of China in 1900). But this article is more of a memo about how an article could be written from the sources cited. It does not discuss more causes for such a war than Taiwan, ignoring conflict over oil, and ignoring competition for markets for goods. It does not discuss the relative military strengths and vulnerabilities of the two parties, or their alliances, Janes publications should be cited. The relative manpower and the relative military spending should be discussed. The U.S has what? 5% of the world's population and about 50% of the military spending? With China loaning us all the money? And manufacturing an increasing portion of the high tech components? And soon to demand more food and oil? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:27, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Because of a rise in hostility between the United States and Venezuela, should editors assume that the rationale articulated by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> for keeping <i>this</i> article would equally be applied to a Venezuelan-American War article? What about an Iranian-Israeli war article? It is very possible, and commonly speculated by authors and pundits that those two nations may come to nuclear action against each other in the future (should Iran acquire nuclear weapons). Perhaps an article over the possibility of a future military conflict between Ecuador and Peru, styled the Ecuadorian-Peruvian War? Ecuador and Peru have had loud squabbles over their shared border for years. I can understand both sides of the discussion here, but I'm not sure that keeping this article is the right way to approach it. Don't articles such as these create a precedent that implies that any event that could possibly occur in the future should warrant a Wikipedia article, provided that a few authors provided their opinions on paper? No disrespect whatsoever intended here, and I would enjoy any responses.

<li><b>comment</b> It might really help to change the name, to something like "Possible future Sino-American War." . There are zero books about the war. "Thinking about China and War", "The Coming Conflict with China" , "Hegemon: China's Plan to Domnate Asia and the World.", "China Threat" These are all books about speculations concerning a possible future war. To use the present title is an unjustified confusion of fact and fiction. I don't see the point of deciding on the basis of our own opinions about what will or will not happen, but on the usual basis of RS. None use the term in the title. Even the ones that seem to expect it don't use the term in the title. Even the posts on google don't use the term in the title except for a single discussion forum. With the present title,</li>

<li>Original research by Wikipedia editors is <i>where the information has not been published anywhere else before</i>. Since even you are not denying that someone <i>elsewhere</i> has published their own notes about this hypothesized conflict, these notes are not original research. The article as it stands now is nothing more that a summary of what writers of certain published articles have articulated about this possible conflict. Anyone with access to the listed publications, or a database like JSTOR and Factiva, can verify that none of the editors of the article have inserted non-published thought into it. Combining "thesis" that have already been published elsewhere into one article is not original research; to say otherwise is a distortion of NOR. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 18:56, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am nominating this for deletion because the page is un-sourced, culturally biased, poorly written and not relevant to wikipedia as it is a very minor subsection to yearbooks as a whole and does not meet notability criteria. The use of a question as a categorisation on the page to then comprise a list, this is not productive pros that wikipedia aspires too. I think far too much work is required for this page to be salvaged and the notability of the subject as a stand alone is unjustified.--<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJjamesj_a8ac.html" title="User:Jjamesj">Jjamesj</a> 13:59, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Regarding notability, at the time of Arabella Kennedy's death, John F. Kennedy was a U.S. Senator, not the President. There was probably a small article or two in the local (D.C. and Boston) papers, or possibly not at all (privacy). The death certainly was not national news, and there almost certainly was never any subsequent article that was primarily about Arabella. In short, this is an <i>incident</i> in the lives of JFK and Jackie, and it is already included in those articles. -- <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;"><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></font> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">(♫♫)</a> 22:21, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Heh okay dude, don't worry. I wasn't trying to persuade you (or anyone) to vote one way or the other, I was just writing that info so people can quickly/easily see his biggest achievements, and decide whether he's notable or not. I don't have anything to gain from the article being there one way or the other, nor does the author; so if people decide that Wikipedia is better off without the article, then cool. The last thing I want to do is argue about whether Peacock is lying or not, I have better things to do. -<a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilbertoSilvaFan_0d3c.html" title="User:GilbertoSilvaFan">GilbertoSilvaFan</a> 01:44, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For what it's worth, I don't really see myself as much of anything besides a dude who likes to write and has had the great fortune of being read. There's the FarkTV thing, but that's not really worth pointing me out specifically. If I stay on Wiki, cool - it's an honor that <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilbertoSilvaFan_0d3c.html" title="User:GilbertoSilvaFan">GilbertoSilvaFan</a> thought enough of me to actually write this thing. Admittedly, the bulk of the work I actually do isn't directly related to Mentally Incontinent, so I hope you won't take just that one site into condiseration to determine my "worth" or whatever. I will say that things are starting to pick up career-wise for me, and that I'm working hard to get a bit more out there and make a bigger name. But since I had to even say "Working hard to get a bit more out there," that very fact means I'm not out there yet. So, either way. I'm not going to have any hurt feelings, because really, last week I wasn't on Wikipedia... Just because I am this week, it won't make next week much different for me if I'm not on Wikipedia again&#160;:) --Joethepeacock 23:33, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The nominator admits no such thing! Yes please do a Google search. There's nothing more than a few thousand hits on Campbell. He has a few obscure pop medicine publications, some of them electronic, some of them not much more substantial than pamphlets. As far as I can tell, he's virtually unknown within his field and completely unknown outside of it. He doesn't seem to be cited by anyone as far as I can determine. The very definition of a minor figure in alternative healthcare. If anyone is curious about how WP is being gamed by a small group that is trying to remove balanced articles that show homeopathy in a neutral light and replace them with articles about homeopathy's critics (eg. Anthony Campbell) they should absolutely read <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_George_Vithoulkas_%28Second_nomination%29_30b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Vithoulkas (Second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Vithoulkas (Second nomination)</a>. Compare the information provided to support Vithoulkas' inclusion in WP and compare it with the Campbell. Notice that it's the same people voting to get rid of one and add the other. Nominating Campbell for deletion has nothing to do with making a point, anyone can see in two minutes on Google that he is, at best, a minor figure. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 19:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment.</b> I clean-up a lot of disambiguation pages, but this dab page is problematic. The page's purpose is namely to help people disambiguate "Greatest Hits" albums. After I had cleaned up this page per <a href="../../../d/a/b/MoS%7EDAB_c126.html" title="MoS:DAB">MoS:DAB</a> and went for the disambiguation of pages under <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Greatest_Hits_f5e7.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Greatest Hits">Special:Whatlinkshere/Greatest_Hits</a>, I noticed pretty fast that this dab page was NO help and that more and more to-disambiguate GH albums (non-existant yet) of rather less notable artists showed up and should also be included on the dab page now. Out of curiosity, I checked <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllpages_Greatest_Hits_163d.html" title="Special:Allpages/Greatest Hits">Special:Allpages/Greatest_Hits</a> (a index page that lists all existing wikipedia articles starting with the letters "Greatest_Hits"), and that list was enormous. I am nominating this dab page not to get it deleted in the first place but to gain consensus whether it should be trimmed or to get to know more ways to make the dab page more helpful for disambiguation purposes. Because as it stands now, it doesn't fulfill its purpose and makes disambiguation even harder. (See also <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreatest_Hits_d940.html#Cleanup" title="Talk:Greatest Hits">Talk:Greatest Hits#Cleanup</a>.) – <a href="../../../s/g/e/User%7ESgeureka_bf87.html" title="User:Sgeureka">sgeureka</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/g/e/User_talk%7ESgeureka_c299.html" title="User talk:Sgeureka">t</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sgeureka_5456.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sgeureka">c</a></sup> 15:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Compilations are useful as a introduction to artists...that being said, this article is unhelpful as is, just "Greatest Hits of X", "Greatest Hits of Y"...it needs to be better organized, by genre or...time, or something. My vote is <b>keep (conditional on cleanup)</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakerforever_a413.html" title="User:Jakerforever">Jakerforever</a> 16:58, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> as violating <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. Gathering all albums together just because the artist or the record label happens to put the words "Greatest Hits" in the title, with no regard to the mishmash of artists or genres, is untenable. Not every "greatest hits" album is called "Greatest Hits" (c.f. Madonna's <i>The Immaculate Collection</i> or Cyndi Lauper's <i>Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some</i>) and not every album called "Greatest Hits" is necessarily a greatest hits album. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:04, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> As you can see in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreatest_Hits_d940.html" title="Talk:Greatest Hits">Talk:Greatest Hits</a>, there <i>is</i> a strict rule to only list those albums that have the name "Greatest Hits" (i.e. no "Best Of" albums etc.) For many albums with the same name (e.g. <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shine.html" title="Shine">Shine</a>), the dab pages are manageable. It's just that almost every notable artist will have a greatest hits album (see the unrelated page <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_hits.html" title="Greatest hits">greatest hits</a>) at some point, and chances are high that the album will be called "Greatest Hits", so that's where it becomes unmanageable to provide further disambiguation. – <a href="../../../s/g/e/User%7ESgeureka_bf87.html" title="User:Sgeureka">sgeureka</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/g/e/User_talk%7ESgeureka_c299.html" title="User talk:Sgeureka">t</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sgeureka_5456.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sgeureka">c</a></sup> 17:27, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further comment</b> - we have an extensive categorization scheme in place for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompilation_albums_b92a.html" title="Category:Compilation albums">compilation albums</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Category%7EGreatest_hits_albums_f512.html" title="Category:Greatest hits albums">greatest hits albums</a>. While lists are not automatically supplanted by categories, in this instance the category will be much more useful than a massive list. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:31, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as unmaintainable. Or maybe redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compilation_album.html" title="Compilation album">Compilation album</a>? <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshach_109b.html" title="User:Meshach">meshach</a> 21:52, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This seems needlessly tangled, to me. My suggestion would be to <b>merge</b> the articles in chief <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compilation_album.html" title="Compilation album">compilation album</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_hits.html" title="Greatest hits">greatest hits</a>; merge the two categories at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompilation_albums_b92a.html" title="Category:Compilation albums">Category:Compilation albums</a>; and merge this with any other related lists at List of compilation albums. Until such time as all of these things can be achieved, I'd recommend that we <b>keep</b> this provisionally. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 22:38, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, but (a) it doesn't help <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_pages_with_links_2ad7.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links">DAB editors</a> such as me, and (b) it is not complete, up-to-date and never will be whereas e.g. <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllpages_Greatest_Hits_163d.html" title="Special:Allpages/Greatest Hits">Special:Allpages/Greatest_Hits</a> is. As it is now, the dab page has 127 individual entries. <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllpages_Greatest_Hits_163d.html" title="Special:Allpages/Greatest Hits">Special:Allpages/Greatest_Hits</a> lists 312 entries for GH albums (unfortunately including a couple of redirects and some unwanted GH albums that are called something like GH Live etc.) that should actually all be included on a good dab page. All the yet non-existant GH album articles whose artists have a wiki article should also be listed on a good dab page, so that would make (guessing here) 400 entries, maybe even much more in a couple of years. After more thought on this matter, what about this <b>proposal: Delete</b> content of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_Hits_e4a2.html" title="Greatest Hits">Greatest Hits</a> dab page, <b>redirect</b> that page to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_hits.html" title="Greatest hits">greatest hits</a>, and <b>change dab link</b> on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_hits.html" title="Greatest hits">greatest hits</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllpages_Greatest_Hits_163d.html" title="Special:Allpages/Greatest Hits">Special:Allpages/Greatest_Hits</a>. – <a href="../../../s/g/e/User%7ESgeureka_bf87.html" title="User:Sgeureka">sgeureka</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/g/e/User_talk%7ESgeureka_c299.html" title="User talk:Sgeureka">t</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sgeureka_5456.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sgeureka">c</a></sup> 13:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This organization is not notable.

It was obviously created to promote this organization and not for the sake of an encyclopedia entry. The User who created this article simply registered for one day to edit the page of the founder of this organization and to create this page and made no edits afterwards: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aztap" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aztap" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, which makes one believe that this User was working on behalf of the organization itself.

<dd>Most of those <b>minor</b> hits are Azerbaijani pages. This organization is not notable enough for a Wikipedia article and was obviously created for promotional purposes. Secondly, your comment about Iran is pure speculation and should not influence any vote in anyway. Also, we are all anonymous here on Wikipedia, this user simply created a one day account so he could promote this organization, one which he could possibly be working for.

<li>I don’t think that the info about irredentist movement in Iranian Azerbaijan should be suppressed in Wikipedia. Regardless of what you think about this organization, the reader has a right to know about it.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This is hilarious! You present a blog and say it can be used as a source to write this article? And the article from the UNHCR says nothing about the organization, it mentions it once. <b>How do you expect us to write an article on an organization such as this, when it isnt even notable enough for other third party reliable sources to have already written about it?</b> There is no information that can be found (and I searched) that can be used to write this article. Again, the users voting <i>Keep</i> are obviously not taking into account any of these factors. Furthermore, this users <b>personal attack</b> that says the only reason this article was put up for deletion is because we are part of a "Pro-Iranian circle that tries to suppress information" is ludicrous, as there are many articles that "Pro-Iranian circles" may not like on Wikipedia, such as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Iran_21d6.html" title="Human rights in Iran">Human rights in Iran</a>, along with other anti Iranian seperatist and terrorist groups.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 19:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> that is, I think we found at least two non-azerbaijani sources, which mention this group, one is <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>'s UNHCR site<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/home/RSDCOI/3df4be444.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unhcr.org/home/RSDCOI/3df4be444.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>, and another one is this openly anti-azerbaijani pamphlet of one pseudo-scholar<a href="http://www.rozanehmagazine.com/NoveDec05/PARTIIAzar.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rozanehmagazine.com/NoveDec05/PARTIIAzar.html" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>.thus, at least we have one third party source(UN) and also one source from opposite direction. so why to delete? this organization is not a hoax.If UN can rely upon them, then why not wikipedia? <a href="../../../e/l/s/User%7EElsanaturk_57d3.html" title="User:Elsanaturk">Elsanaturk</a> 21:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> My comments that pro-Iranian circles try to suppress information about this organization is not related to Wikipedia users per se. It is general comment about Iranian government policy and those who supports it. If you take it personally then it is your bussiness. And obviously, even if you, me or someone else don't like article as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Iran_21d6.html" title="Human rights in Iran">Human rights in Iran</a>, nothing can be done about that. It is notable fact. Actually, many countries has problem with that, including US and others. Here, in Wikipedia our role - editors - to give as much as possible accurate and verifiable information. Definitely, if such notable organization like UNHCR mentions the organization in question - then it is accurate. And there is a nubmer of links in Azeri language Google about this organization, for example <a href="http://bizimasr.media-az.com/arxiv_2002/yanvar/17/ic.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bizimasr.media-az.com/arxiv_2002/yanvar/17/ic.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>, <a href="http://www.voanews.com/azerbaijani/archive/2006-09/2006-09-16-voa6.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.voanews.com/azerbaijani/archive/2006-09/2006-09-16-voa6.cfm" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>, and article in Azeri Wikipeida about it <a href="http://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCney_Az%C9%99rbaycan_Milli_Oyan%C4%B1%C5%9F_H%C9%99r%C9%99kat%C4%B1" class="external autonumber" title="http://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCney_Az%C9%99rbaycan_Milli_Oyan%C4%B1%C5%9F_H%C9%99r%C9%99kat%C4%B1" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 22:09, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like I said before, the UNHCR mentions it once, thats it (further showing that it is not notable organization). And you said it right when you said that <i>our role - editors - to give as much as possible accurate and verifiable information.</i>, exactly, by that basis, this article must be deleted, as there are no third party reliable sources that can be used to create such an article. And please, do not use an Azeri Google search to try and show notability, this is English Wikipedia. The article you posted from Azeri Wikipedia is about GAMOH, not this SANLM! Are you trying to trick people now?<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 22:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> It already has a wiki entry: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANAM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANAM" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>]. Why create two!? Looks like a one man organization made for ethnic provocation (dismayed to see it was Baku based). Many false and baseless claims too, like Azerbaijan extends to Khuzestan or Western Azerbaijan which has large number of Kurds is all Azeri or .. etc or Bahmanyar ibn Marzaban who was a Iranian Zoroastrian student of Avicenna predating turkification of the region as a Turkic person(I guess Bahmanyar needs an article)). If this article stays of course all these points should be responded to as well. There are some Iranian based organizations in Iran called "Irani-e-Shomali" (Northern Iran) who also claim the territory of the republic of Azerbaijan. I am wondering what the limits are and if these organizations can get their own wiki article? I do not think think any of these organizations are noticeable enough to be mentioned in Wikipedia. In fact, anyone can create a small one man or few man organizations and then state their political goals. An organization should have at least some weight and be mentioned like the Tamil Tigers or PKK. Also I note that the user who created this article commited a major violation of Wikipedia rule by erasing the delete votes of some users. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSouth_Azerbaijan_National_Liberation_Movement&amp;diff=117937506&amp;oldid=117937360" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSouth_Azerbaijan_National_Liberation_Movement&amp;diff=117937506&amp;oldid=117937360" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>.

<li><b>comment</b> Google search becomes more relevant when the right keywords are entered, such as the URL of their website or proper name, including in Azerbaijani language. The name itself is too long for most Western or otherwise journalists to reproduce, so most would go by an abbriviation or just the name of the leader or main spokesman of the organization. None of the organizations are really Baku-based (Chehregani can't even visit Azerbaijan, or Turkey, without being asked to leave), but they have of course chapters there, with regular press contact. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">adil</a> 05:53, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> criteria are derived from results of past AfD discussions which shows that precedants have been set.

<dd>I never claimed that it was vanity. Also, the fact that there are less "notable" pornstars on Wikipedia is a bad reason to keep an article. Also, things change, AfD is not strictly based on precedent. It also says <i>usually</i> notable, not <i>always</i> notable. The only point in her favor as far as notability is concerned is that she's prolific?

<li><b>Delete</b> Number of films in a genre <i>can</i> contribute to a porn star's prolificness, and certainly more so than the Google test, which on its own is unquestionably invalid, but it does speak to both the size of an entertainer's fanbase/following (see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) and the prolificness of their work and can be used <i>in conjunction with</i> more valid criteria of either <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to make a determination of whether they have a significant following and/or are prolific in any genre. This actress doesn't even seem to be prolific in porn <i>in general</i>, or anything else for that matter, as Googling her gets under 400 hits. I get more relevant hits if I Google <i>my</i> name (real name, not WP name), and I'm not notable enough for a WP article. I can't find anything about this actress other than her IMDB (and similar) profiles and some minor mentions/inclusions on spammish porn sites. She doesn't even have a website of her own. While even that is not an immediate grounds for inclusion/exclusion, again, it is a piece of evidence that needs to be looked at as a part of a whole. All of the sources in this article are IMDB (or similar) and while such sites may be used as sources <i>in conjunction with</i> other <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">reliable sources</a>, including the actress' own website, if she has one, as this is an article about a person and would be considered a primary source provided the information is neutral, and preferably at least one third-party reliable source, IMDB-ish sites <i>alone</i> are not acceptable as reliable sources.<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 18:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The reason she has low Google hits is that there are numourous variations of her name. 'Mia Bangg' comes up with over 200,000 hits. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 20:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's still significantly less than most (if not all) of the other AfDs in which I voted keep. I searched the variation you suggested on Google and still came up with anything that could be considered a reliable source. Even what appears to be her official website provides no information so as to be used as an acceptable primary source. If you can expand and appropriately reference this article with sources that I have overlooked, please do. I never vote in an AfD without first seeing if there's something I can do to "save" the article in question (unless of course it obviously appears to be crap or otherwise inappropriate for WP). I am not at all unopposed to changing my position on an AfD if the article is improved to acceptable standards.

<p>The last time I checked, Wikipedia was an encyclopedia, not an almanac or a collection of statistics or budget revenues or expenses.

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>incorporating elements of</i> doesn't necessarily mean <i>is</i>. When it says it <i>incorporating elements of</i> an almanac, it probably refers to the fact we do have some statistics (sports related on player pages, population related on cities, other things) but they are usually incorporated into the encyclopedic content. When I said we're "not an almanac", I mean we're not literally an almanac. Like we don't have whole pages or topics that deal with the historical day to day prices or stocks, the temperature in a year, random sports statistics (like season by season standings), or things like that (the just numbers things). -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><small>(<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_ER_5b7b.html" title="User:Royalguard11/ER">Review Me!</a>)</small> 02:44, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, we have hundreds, if not thousands, of season-by-season articles for sports teams and leagues, and a very strong prcecident supporting their existence.

<dd>I just wanted to note that I've added a whole bunch of references to the super forms and their abilities as mentioned in various guides from down in my parents' basement. Yes Virginia, I've been playing Sonic games since the Genesis days. The dusty library down fhsds reflects this. Sadly, not all the guides had useful information - thanks for nothing, BradyGames, on your 'SuperSONIC Tips' guide. Anyway, this should help quell the "original research" issue by and large, although I still don't have anything to cite for Blaze's section. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishop2_a372.html" title="User:Bishop2">Bishop2</a> 18:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(With a few exceptions in the Trivia section) These kinds of comparisons are permissable under WP:NOR, so long as they don't advance a position. (e.g. that Sonic 3 is the best Sonic game for being Super Sonic, etc.) It's no different than having a basic mathematical conversion for numerical facts: it's a basic, logical deduction that can be easily verified.

<dd>From personal experience, the Prima strategy guide from Sonic Adventure 2 Battle (the GameCube conversion) uses it. However, that's not nearly as valuable as the original game using it, obviously. I mean, what's more valuable - if some critic says something happens in a movie, like the notoriously inaccurate (yet well-read and well-written) reviews of Roger Ebert, or if it ACTUALLY HAPPENS? Obviously the latter is the resource to be cited. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishop2_a372.html" title="User:Bishop2">Bishop2</a> 05:18, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah..but then we have the issue that 9 times out of ten these strategy guides and gaming websites publish inaccurate data in comparison to the games themselves. I mean come on..."Gold Sonic"? Nothing short of sheer ignorance of the subject would make one think that Sonic turns into "Gold Sonic". Yet, the latter is apparently a better source than in game screenshots, and commentary by the creators calling it "Super Sonic". You know...this is about the same level as those two dudes who insist on the whole "Rouge is 17" thing, even though that has been clearly shown to be a typo XD. That's the problem with these "secondary sources". They're fine and all, but they often don't know what the hell they're talking about. Need I bring up "Dark Sonic"?

<li><b>Reply</b> - It's a large part of most Sonic games that can no longer be confined to a single character. The fact is that it has now become a mechanism which is effectively distributed to almost every playable character that shows up in the Sonic fiction. Spreading this out to each individual bio would mean that readers would have to look at (and search) 8+ separate articles to get the same information that is presented here.

<li>I'm still not seeing it any more than just a powerup. I counter-example with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a>. Super Mario has been a big part in each Mario game, but it just redirects to Mario, and the other game articles describe his powerup abilities. Also, if I understand correctly, they aren't <i>that</i> big - in my first Sonic game, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Rush_5781.html" title="Sonic Rush">Sonic Rush</a>, I don't ever remember needing to transform.

<li>No super forms in Sonic Rush? Apparently you never actually beat the game. You transform for the final boss fight after beating both story paths.

<li>The difference is that Super Mario is just a simple, ordinary powerup in the Mario series, whereas the Super [Sonic/Knuckles/Tails/etc.] powerup is often times a significant plot element. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 01:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Indeed. From an out of universe standpoint, super transformation has become a staple deus ex machina in the series. It's rare to <i>not</i> see some character go super in some way. In fact, it's only happened in <i>two</i> releases since Sonic R way back in 1997.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmastergalvatron_cec6.html" title="User:Grandmastergalvatron">GrandMasterGalvatron</a> 01:47, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This article has gone from cherrypicking the games themselves to cherrypicking strategy guides, to describe the game a way works with no possibility for any analysis of or insight on same, with any conclusions made or implied not present in the original works.

<dd>You're really going to need to explain your current problem with the article. All concerns have been addressed. No longer are there any original conclusions drawn - everything is purely factual info. Game guides are used solely to provide an outside, non-primary source for the appearances and abilities gained by the super forms, which is all that the article currently described. Anything that resembles gameplay tips have been removed because this isn't GameFAQs. We are now simply describing what a super transformation is and how the various forms function. Originally, you said that if the article was given hard non-primary citations and didn't have any original research, you wouldn't put it up for AfD. Well, that's now the case. This is now a pure, factual, fully cited article about a consistent phenomenon occurring within the Sonic the Hedgehog universe, and its existence is still based around keeping length down on other articles that are already running long - it would take some time to explain the full nature of super transformations and how they affect each character in each of the individual character articles, after all. So really, what specifically is the problem you currently have? --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishop2_a372.html" title="User:Bishop2">Bishop2</a> 21:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. I agree with you, Extraordinary Machine, it's completely made up. Although I did hear it on the radio here in Australia, I never heard it being released as a single. The chart positions are quite obviously made up; I look at the UK, US and Australian charts every week. No such single have I seen on any of these charts. The video screenshot is faked; it could be any old screenshot. I have also never heard of Jack Johnson being in the non-existent video, and it never premiered on <i><a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_Hits_%28Australian_TV_series%29_8b61.html" title="Video Hits (Australian TV series)">Video Hits</a></i>, I watch that too.

<li>309A was a state road; 66 is apparently a major historic road. I've written a few articles about <a href="../../../v/i/r/Category%7EVirginia_secondary_state_highways_d8c5.html" title="Category:Virginia secondary state highways">secondary state highways in Virginia</a>, which would be county routes in most states, but I'd vote to delete many of them, since residential streets in unincorporated areas are secondary state highways. 4164 looks more major that that, but it's not clear how much more major. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 04:50, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>A line must be drawn somewhere</b>. So, hypothetically, a street a block long with no structures on it is automatically notable because it happens to be a county road, one of thousands in a state? I do not find that to be a sustainable policy. If we keep trying to assert notability of everything that has ever been paved, I think the majority of WP will tire of this and nearly all road articles will be lost as a result. --<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 05:21, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No personal opinion</b> on this article. Just to clarify the "precedent" to the extent which it exists. As NE2 said, 309A in Florida is a special case – there are several Florida state roads that were decommissioned and became county highways. (I don't believe this is one of those.) Apparently Dutchess CR 66 has some historical significance, but to be honest I think the main reason it was kept is because it faced the backlash of a couple of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> nominations by <a href="../../../e/d/e/User%7EEdeans_e140.html" title="User:Edeans">User:Edeans</a>.

<li>I'm going to disagree with the idea that all county roads are inherently notable. Maybe County State-Aid Highway 1 (Hennepin County, Minnesota) is notable because it's an old road that connected <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Snelling_8493.html" title="Fort Snelling">Fort Snelling</a> to <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakopee%2C_Minnesota_ab86.html" title="Shakopee, Minnesota">Shakopee, Minnesota</a>, but County State-Aid Highway 2 (Hennepin County, Minnesota) is just an arterial street in Minneapolis. The question is: Where do we draw the line of notability? I'm having trouble believing that anything below a state's primary highway system is inherently notable.

<li>POV fork. The article is not much more than a copy-paste job from numerous other articles (themselves very dubious and biased against Hindus) like <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism_in_India_5712.html" title="Fascism in India">Fascism in India</a>,<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Aryans_ff63.html" title="Indigenous Aryans">Indigenous Aryans</a>,<a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Search_of_the_Cradle_of_Civilization_4ffc.html" title="In Search of the Cradle of Civilization">In Search of the Cradle of Civilization</a>,<a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_Invasion_theory_9aa9.html" title="Aryan Invasion theory">Aryan Invasion theory</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_Migration_3d48.html" title="Indo-Aryan Migration">Indo-Aryan Migration</a> made by <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> with an agenda of silencing criticisms of old theories by evocations of <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwins_Law_a23f.html" title="Godwins Law">Godwins Law</a>.</li>
<li>The article was created immediately after <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_Log_2007_March_21_9440.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2007 March 21">Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_21</a> was filed,demonstrating an attempt to conflate and confuse readers by collecting numerous quotes and arguments and assembling them into an <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> piece.</li>
<li>Filled with factual inaccuracies. For instance, the article(s) implicitly claim that Hindus universally endorse the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Aryans_ff63.html" title="Indigenous Aryans">Indigenous Aryans</a> theory, which is demonstrably false, as <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savarkar.html" title="Savarkar">Savarkar</a> was a vocal proponent of the opposite <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_Invasion_Theory_cee2.html" title="Aryan Invasion Theory">Aryan Invasion Theory</a> (see Savarkars book "Hindutva" Page108, for instance)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/l/Selection_bias.html" title="Selection bias">Selection bias</a>. It states the opinions and allegations of controversial scholars (see <a href="http://www.swaveda.com/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=58&amp;PHPSESSID=719c056e8bea5142011849aa43d963c3" class="external text" title="http://www.swaveda.com/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=58&amp;PHPSESSID=719c056e8bea5142011849aa43d963c3" rel="nofollow">this</a> regarding Meera Nanda's perorations, as well as <a href="http://www.swaveda.com/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=54" class="external text" title="http://www.swaveda.com/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=54" rel="nofollow">this</a> article) as factual, and selectively quotes references to make extremely offensive remarks against Hindus in an attempt to foster hatred against them.In particular, claims of <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_Race_350a.html" title="Aryan Race">Aryan Race</a> evocation are entirely false (as <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> in this context is not perceive as a "race" but a class of nobility)</li>
<li>It is an attempt to evoke <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwins_Law_a23f.html" title="Godwins Law">Godwins Law</a> and make an attack page against Hindus and Hindutva (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Indigenous_Aryan_Theory_8e02.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Indigenous Aryan Theory">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Indigenous_Aryan_Theory</a>) with the epithet of "Hindus are Nazis" based on cherry-picking quotes from the works of <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golwalkar.html" title="Golwalkar">Golwalkar</a>, despite the fact that the Hindutva movement <a href="../../../n/e/o/Talk%7ENeo-fascism_and_religion_1aae.html#Allegations" title="Talk:Neo-fascism and religion">disowned those works a long time ago</a> as shown by the posts of an ex-wikipedian who was a wiipedia administrator (User:Babub).</li>
<li>Overall, it is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a> and numerous other policies</li>

<li>The article(s) attack certain publication groups (such as VOI and VOD without any references to explicitly support such allegations). The rationale for this can be found at WP:V and WP:BLP inasmuch as WP:BLP can be expanded to include existent organizations.

<dd>what can I say&#160;:) even the nominator is a sock for edit-warfare. Still, this longer statement by our resident sock artist might be useful to guess at his identity. Of course this article was created under pressure and harassment from our Hindutva troll(s) and is far from finished. <i>Scholarly</i> references (not blogs) that dispel the "pseudoscience" allegations are most welcome.

<dd>The fact that you need to attack users with baseless accusations to argue your case bolsters the grounds for deletion. I am not a sockpuppet if that's all you have to discredit me. In any case, since accusations against VOI constitute institutional BLP violation, that is an important issue that effects wikipedia's credibility, and the accused can be involved if need be. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdsmight_81ba.html" title="User:Birdsmight">Birdsmight</a> 21:55, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My nomination is hardly "throwing my weight around". I read the Afd instruction page and followed it. This is merely a tactic to silence this matter as I detailed above.

<dd>Claim #3 is not at all false. The article says that Savarkar put forth the IAT theory. THAT is a demostrably false claim as, I quote from Savarkar's book:"the Aryans who settled in India at the dawn of history already formed a nation, now embodied in the Hindus". So he supported the opposite of IAT, in resonance with so-called "mainstream" opinion of AIT. In addition, claim #5 is not made by me, but by a longtime (now left) wikipeia administrator (like Dbachmann). This administrator has supplie sources to assert his claim as well. If you feel that it is "irrelevant" or "patently false" then I can try to contact him so that he may argue his case better. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdsmight_81ba.html" title="User:Birdsmight">Birdsmight</a> 22:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Regarding the article being sketchy and having potential to get increased, it tells me that the opinion is not coming from people who know anything about this subject. There are always people who want to sell you something by relating it to science. It does not mean we go on creating "XYZ pseudoscience" article on wikipedia. There is hardly any advertisement for skin/hair care which is scientific, but we don't have an article for it.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The term Hindutva was coined by Indian nationalist Veer Savarkar to mean “The “essence of being a Hindu”. He used the term in a positive sense, and to this day the term carries decidedly positive connotations for hundreds of millions of people sympathizing with Hindu hopes and aspirations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The word is broadly analogous to “Jewish” or “Islamic”, which mean Jew-ness or Muslim-ness respectively. You just have to ask yourself if Wikipedia will allow articles like Jewish propaganda or Islamic propaganda in itself. If not, then this article will have to go.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The distinction between the words Hinduism and Hindutva is tenuous at best. It has been perpetuated by some known anti-Hindu persons and organization to be able to bad-mouth Hindu religion while still being able make a farcical claim at secularism. To the millions of readers from India, this page is just a glaring example of blatant defamation of their religion. This article violates the spirit of Wikipedia while hiding behind a façade of play on words. I don’t believe for a moment that this page was not created out of spite. I invite everybody to judge for themselves if the article was born of hate or not. Anarya 04:10, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as an attack page, and certainly without any redirects. This criticism could be merged as appropriate into the actual article pages on the various subjects (actually, it is there on all of them already). Whatever one might think of some of the hypotheses discussed, it would still not be right to use WP to express those personal views--and certainly not in an article deliberately so oriented and so titled. This is the very model of a POV fork, of the most blatant kind. (Subtler POV forks use subtler titles).

<li><b>keep</b> - The article documents to the award that is given to the best high school boy's basketball player in the state of Michigan, as voted on by media throughout the state. The fact that the award is not for a professional sport does not matter, as there are thousands of articles about college and high school sports and awards on Wikipedia. The article is also on a noteworthy subject as it is describing a 26-year old award that thousands of high school boy's basketball players strive for each winter.

<dd>A new editor, Drahmel, just cleaned up the article and cited an <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising_Age_d7fd.html" title="Advertising Age">Advertising Age</a> article, however I found no mention of The Search Agency at the linked page. If the Search Agency is just <i>listed as an entry</i> in the top 20 of what are mostly smaller companies, that won't establish notability. However, if, Ad Age, a major publication, wrote up a profile and it's more than a couple of sentences, that could tip the balance. I've asked Drahmel to add his/her 2 cents here if she/he wants to. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<li><b>Erm.</b> They have two records - but one is five tracks, self-published. But the other is on a real (albeit small and local) label, <a href="http://www.luckymadison.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.luckymadison.com/" rel="nofollow">Lucky Madison</a> records. They <i>do</i> have an entry at allmusic.com - bit it's blank (except for listing the records). The article notes that "An upcoming tour in November will take them to Washington, Idaho, Minnesota, Missouri, Arizona, and California." That would be November 2006 I think, so... has this tour occurred? And does this qualify as "a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country"? It's not really <i>national</i>... but then, the USA is a <i>big</i> nation, the area covered would be good chunk of Western Europe, especially when you note that Missouri is included. Reviews? They only list for their only record, in an entity called <i>CD Baby</i> (Nov 2005), whatever that is... they're on the bubble, but sliding off I guess...

<li><b>Keep</b> This term has an appropriate place in the lexicon relating to the preparation of cocktails. There does appear a necessity to describe preparation which is essentially a hybrid between "neat" and "on the rocks".66.108.0.129 19:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have heard this term used independently of its originators twice in the last two weeks. It was especially gratifying for me as I was in attendance on the evening of its genesis. Ironically, it took place at Gin Lane in Lower Manhattanand the depiction of events is spot on. As for its place in the popular lexicon, in the 6 months since this incident it has clearly demonstrated both the foothold(some bicoastal types were involved) and irreverence necessary to have some staying power. As for its place on Wikipedia, terms like "who's your daddy" are an important part of the site's forward thinking, popular flavor. My admittedly biased vote, is to keep it on.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Andrewmeany (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andrewmeany_8217.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andrewmeany">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>Not-notable professor. Probably an autobio (I mean, who else would throw in info about the name of his kids (!) and of <i>forthcoming</i> (!!) publications?).

<li><b>comment</b> similarly with Supreme Court justices. writing decisions is just the nature of their work. Let us hear the last of this nonsensical argument. Further, a surprising number of unambiguously notable people give the names of their spouses and children. We usually let that stay in. Almost all academics I know include accepted papers as forthcoming in their cv's--and Gely includes the journal name, so we know they're accepted. --The most austere journal editorial policies permit this. We usually trim publications lists to the most cited, and we would here, , but it doesn't reflect adversely on their notability. Those academic who publish less than the average in terms of numbers and citations are not notable; those who publish decidedly more generally are considered notable. We do not require the Fields medal, or its equivalents. (But I haven't looked closely at the record here yet, so I'm not giving a&#160;!vote right now.) <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:54, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Hmmmm... I don't think I made my point so clear so let me give it another shot. I am most certainly not saying that having been published disqualifies him from being notable. But because of their work academics do publish and do so quite a lot. They are also often cited, yes even the average professor. And so publications is a pretty bad measure to understand the notability of academics. Actually, to stick with the judges' comparison: every judge on any court writes decisions and these decisions are routinely cited by other judges. Yet this gives us no clue as to whether or not this particular judge is "notable". A supreme court judge is notable not because he writes decisions that are then cited by other legal experts. He's notable because, well, he's on the supreme court! Unless we have sources whose primary subject is Rafael Gely and the importance of his body of work, I see no way we can <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribute</a> the material included in the article to a solid source. As for the names of his children, I thought it was pretty clear I was not holding this against the notability of the man... I'm just saying that there are good reasons to believe that this is either an autobiography or a bio written by someone who does not have a critical distance to the subject. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 06:54, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>WP:AUTO does not mean we never accept such articles- what it means is that other people can usually do this better than the subject, so when the subject does it we look at them closely to make sure they are sourced and well-balanced . They all end up rewritten, just as other articles do; many good bio articles have started this way. A personal website is accepted as an RS for personal details; the official cv on a university site is accepted for degrees and so on, though they can be and generally are checked. But obviously there must be something objective besides that, and citation indexes do nicely. Opinion is also needed, and in the academic world the form of review is the tenured appointment. The people who prove ATT are the peers who cite him, and the peers who peer-review him for grants and appointments. They are the experts, they decide. We just record. It would greatly facilitate our work here if if other fields of human endeavor had such accessible measures. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:50, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would disagree with you idea that only inactive academics publish a lot. It is all dependent upon your field of research. Some work that is highly notable will take a long time to develop and not many publications will occur during this time. Also due to patents and such, publication can be with held for a lengthly time until the idea is fully protected. - <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurious_Gregor_ba7f.html" title="User:Curious Gregor">Curious Gregor</a> - Synthesis for all 11:54, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, this article quotes some sources such as the NYT, but careful observation will bear that they are secondary/tertiary sources, not primary sources. They are generally media coverage (and negative coverage at that), concerning a book.</li>
<li>The only primary source is a C.A. Tripp, who is not a historian and is strongly contested within the academic community (as the article itself points out.) Thusly, more length is spent within the article <i>disputing</i> the thesis than verifying it.</li>
<li>The sections that are not a direct reference to C.A. Tripp's book are unreferenced accounts of Lincoln's past, thus classifies as original research.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="../../../r/e/d/WP%7EREDFLAG_c5bc.html" title="WP:REDFLAG">WP:REDFLAG</a> requires that "Exceptional claims require exceptional sources." <b>For this rather extraordinary claim, we have only ONE primary source, who isn't an historian.</b></li>

Like I said, I'd like to see this merged into the "<a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Oblivion_fcbc.html" title="Characters of Oblivion">Characters of Oblivion</a>" article, but, if deleting it becomes the consensus, that is fine by me. ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit' me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 23:52, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I am familiar with KoTN, and I would acknowledge that there is significantly less material and backstory regarding Umaril and Pelinal Whitestrake.
