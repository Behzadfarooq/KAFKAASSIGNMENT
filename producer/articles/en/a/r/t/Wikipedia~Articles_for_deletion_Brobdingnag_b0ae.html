<p>Nothing on this page that isn't in the Gulliver's Travels article. No potential for expansion.

<li>~~smacks head~~ I was going to nominate this for deletion, then realized it should be redirected, but somehow failed to realize that I could redirect it myself. Done. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Burley_88c3.html" title="User:Scott Burley">Scott</a> 07:10, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course, you should have discussed it first on the relevant talk page? Did you? I am absolutely appalled at the process undertaken here. I was strongly in favour of keeping this article and I have been denied the opportunity of a vote?<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 08:49, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not at all. The page is still there in the history. Revert it and lets discuss it on the talk page. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Burley_88c3.html" title="User:Scott Burley">Scott</a> 10:39, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The article describing the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brobdingnag.html" title="Brobdingnag">Brobdingnag</a> is the second book of <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gullivers_Travels_2666.html" title="Gullivers Travels">Gullivers Travels</a> which is a highly notable book and studied in schools throughout the world. It is analogous to deleting <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Two_Towers_%28book%29_7a3a.html" title="The Two Towers (book)">The Two Towers (book)</a> and redirecting it to the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>. The whole point of having wikilinks is to be able to look at connected facts at seperate articles allowing readers to look at articles containing more information. The Brobdingnag is an important part of Gullivers Travels which warrants further discussion in its own article. Brobdingnag. I have discovered that this article has been redirected to Gullivers Travels before the expiration of the vote. I am <b>absolutely appalled</b> that this unilateral decision was taken one day into the vfd process. What is the point of having a process where everybody votes over the worthiness of articles if people decide to unilaterally redirect one day into the process? Is there are process to appeal the redirection of this article?<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 08:46, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you don't agree with a redirect you can just revert it yourself (follow the link back). That's why redirection don't need to be brought to VfD. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:08, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strong keep. We have dedicated articles on dozens of fictitious literary places and this is probably more important than the majority of them.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 23:17, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. OK nobody has voted for deletion, and the submitter has admitted that he was wrong. Can we remove this listing now? <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 06:06, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Swift's aim in "Gulliver" was to write political satire, not to create a fictional universe; that is why the argument that there are <i>n</i> articles dedicated to other fictional places doesn't pull. There is nothing here that wouldn't fit into <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulliver%27s_travels.html" title="Gulliver's travels">Gulliver's travels</a> (if it isn't already there), and no potential for expansion here. - <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 10:13, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The nature of Swift's motivation as a writer is irrelevant. Any person seeking data on the subject of fictitious lands in literature should reasonably expect to find Brobdingnag, Lilliput and Utopia listed alongside Mordor, Narnia and the Looking Glass world.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:07, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The motivation gives an idea about the intended scale of the fictional universe. <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narnia.html" title="Narnia">Narnia</a> <i>is</i> the fictional place in which the seven novels of the Narnia-cycle are set, and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordor.html" title="Mordor">Mordor</a> does not reduplicate what is said in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-Earth_4e64.html" title="Middle-Earth">Middle-Earth</a> article. It might be incorporated after an extensive re-write, though, and we could get rid of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angband.html" title="Angband">Angband</a>, too. I can't see how the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brobdingnag.html" title="Brobdingnag">Brobdingnag</a> entry could ever grow beyond what it is now. - <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 09:12, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're missing the point. It is necessary to retain separate articles for all <i>important</i> fictional countries in order that the fictional countries category is appropriately comprehensive a cross-reference source. As culturally and historically significant examples it is imperative that Swift's inventions be included therein. Their lack would represent a significant and misleasing oversight. The length of the article itself, Swift's motivations as a writer and the number of stories he set in invented country X or Y are not relevant at all.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 11:54, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am just less concerned about the "List of fictional places" than I am about duplicated entries. In case of duplicated entries one (the better) tends to grow and the other tends remain stagnant and of poorer quality. Until the underlying issue with the Wikimedia software (that redirects can't appear in categories) is resolved, maybe we should exercise some restraint and redirect manually. - <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 15:42, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> On the merit of it sometimes being used on its own, without reference to the book. For instance, it was the name of one of the earliest <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanzine.html" title="Fanzine">fanzines</a> for playing <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy_%28game%29.html" title="Diplomacy (game)">Diplomacy</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Play_by_mail_game.html" title="Play by mail game">by mail</a> <a href="http://www.badpets.net/Diplomacy/AtoZ/EF.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.badpets.net/Diplomacy/AtoZ/EF.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, that created the "Brobdingnag rating system" used for scoring players. While this specific piece of information may or may not be encyclopedic (feel free to include it if you like), it goes to show that the term has come to wider use and might be a useful article in itself. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 01:40, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Regardless of Pilatus's assertions, this article certainly could grow well beyond what it is now. With entire articles written on minor characters and places from all sorts of sci-fi and the like there is no reason why there should not be an article on Brobdingnag, particluarly as it's much more significant and well-known than something like <a href="../../../e/r/e/Eregion.html" title="Eregion">Eregion</a>. Keep and give it time to grow. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:47, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm leaning toward <b>keep and expand</b>, especially since the term has morphed into a real adjective over the years. - Lucky 6.9 00:02, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Weak <b>Keep</b>, needs expansion. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 02:35, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Brobdingnag has room for expansion. (Sorry, I just couldn't resist.) <a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxl_2118.html" title="User:Axl">Axl</a> 11:59, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
