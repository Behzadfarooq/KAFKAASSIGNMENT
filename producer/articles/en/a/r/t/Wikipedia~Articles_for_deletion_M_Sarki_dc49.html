<p>In rebuttal: M Sarki's book ZIMBLE ZAMBLE ZUMBLE (ISBN: 0595250920) was published in a limited-edition-handmade edition by elimae books of Dallas, TX. A paperback trade edition was published by Author's Choice Press. Authors Choice Press offers an important service to writers whose books have gone out-of-print. They are a subsidy of I-Universe.</p>
<p>M Sarki's book LITTLE WAR MACHINE (ISBN: 0972332979) was published in a paperback trade edition by Ravenna Press out of Edmonds, Washington.</p>
<p>M Sarki's MEWL HOUSE (ISBN# 0-9770377-1-1) was published in a limited-handmade edition by Rogue Literary Society.</p>
<p>A poet cannot be listed in Poets and Writers if the journals and book publishers do not check out. M Sarki is listed in Poets and Writers. Perhaps this person accusing M Sarki of being a vanity writer has some bone to pick with the poet.</p>
<p>To say that M Sarki is not a notable poet would tell me that this person does not know poetry, nor the movers in it.</p>

<li>If these personal (and idiotic) attacks are what Wikipedia is about, then Sarki won't want to be a part of this anyway. To think it may be you two people who decide whether Sarki is a notable poet, or not, seems ludicrous. Better to be gone than be a part of this. It is hoped Wikipedia's people can see through your pointless attacks and check the real poet out. Nobody is votestuffing, simply trying to learn the system here and defend a simply factual encyclopedic entry.Roguebooks 14:01, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> we appreciate the referencing done in the article. Nobody is attacking the article, we're trying to come to an impartial conclusion on whether it is notable enough to be a Wikipedia entry. The books clearly exist but they all are with small publishers with limited distibution (out-of-print, paperback trade edition, limited-handmade edition). Nomination for a prize is some claim to notability - how prestigious is the prize and what's the status of the nominator? Nobody has bone to pick with Mr Sarki. I do have some reservations about this being a promotional campaign by Roguebooks. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How can the M Sarki main page be misconstrued as "promotional" when all it states are the facts? If you research and read what many others have said about Sarki you could come to the conclusion that there is some merit here to the claims on the "articles for deletion" page that Sarki is in fact "notable". The mere fact that Lish is involved with the poet ought to tell you something, unless you are not familiar with <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Lish_6da6.html" title="Gordon Lish">Gordon Lish</a>, and then there is absolutely no reason for your remarks to be merited. There are many writers out there who wish not to be involved with big publishers. There are some writers who do not care about money, nor do they care about rubbing elbows with their ilk. This page on M Sarki is only offered as a link to persons interested in finding out more about the poet. It certainly is not about prestige. It is certainly not about self-promotion. For what? It is becoming all too clear that this Wikipedia is a community of something other than what it claims to be. Roguebooks 21:42, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thanks for that link. As I read it, any small press can make up to 6 nominations annually. For some small presses that'd be pretty much their annual output. Thousands of writers have received an award so I'm not sure that even receiving an award (let alone merely being nominated for one) would represent widespread notability. But it's certainly a step in that direction! Note that, as far as I can see, Sarki is an interesting poet and one who probably deserves wider recognition but the nature of Wikipedia is to record the already famous rather than the deserving. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a></dd>

<li><b>More notes:</b> The critic B. Renner wrote this piece for <i>elimae</i> about M Sarki. On that page there is also a piece by <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Lish_6da6.html" title="Gordon Lish">Gordon Lish</a> about Sarki and how he compares him to the great American poet <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace_Stevens_4848.html" title="Wallace Stevens">Wallace Stevens</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://elimae.com/books/sarki/praise.html" class="external text" title="http://elimae.com/books/sarki/praise.html" rel="nofollow">"If the poems in Zimble Zamble Zumble [elimae books, 2000</a> had been previously published in The Paris Review or The New Yorker, M Sarki would by now have been hailed as a marvelous home-grown successor to Charles Simic and the book itself offered by Knopf or Farrar Straus. But the poems have instead appeared mostly in online magazines, such as elimae and 5_Trope, and Sarki is virtually unknown. Which may be just as well, for the time being, because the comparison to Simic would be misleading and maybe even harmful. For one thing Sarki's poems owe more to the not quite Dadaist tendencies of Wallace Stevens than to European surrealism; for another, Simic would give his third eye to write poems as wonderful and delicious as the best of these. I frequently have no idea what Sarki is talking "about," but his language both astonishes and amuses me. Zimble Zamble Zumble gives more pleasure than the last dozen Pulitzer Prize winners all together."</p>
<p>--B. Renner]</p>
<p><b>One other thing:</b> The <b>Pushcart Prize</b> allows six nominees from each approved publication (journal), of which there can be as many as twelve issues or one per quarter. That means there can be as many as hundreds of pieces to choose from in each journal to literally thousands. (There was one poem nominated of Sarki's out of <i>who-knows-how-many</i> others.) Obviously this person discounting the Pushcart Prize nomination does not know what he/she is talking about. It is a fine, and very prestigious academy. It is a disservice to all writers to discount it. Roguebooks 18:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Sarki once emailed me a quote that shifted something inside me, almost violently. I liked the feeling. I'd felt it before, and I hope I'll feel it again. I emailed back to him and said, “That's beautiful, Sark, but what the hell does it mean?” He emailed back and admitted he had no good idea what it meant, but he said he thought it had something to do with getting the words wrong. Which didn't actually clarify much for me, but made me love Sarki even more.&gt;&gt;&gt;The Danforth Review</li>

<li><b><s>Delete or</s>Keep with major rewrite</b> Notability not established. Also, the article is lacking details. Is his first name "M" or is "M Sarki" an assumed identifier like "Prince?" Where and when was he born and raised? What cultural influences and other factors led him to write what he wrote? Did he attend college? There is only a reference to someone's "tutelage." Consider if the "John Keats" article were as lacking in details as this one. Include more to establish notoreity and provide some info about the person. Whether his poems make sense to a self appointed Wikipedia article reader/deleter is irrelevant.Edited to add: "Woodshed" is awesome.
