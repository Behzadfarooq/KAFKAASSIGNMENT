<p>If one looks at this proposed article for deletion it is very well written and done in a manual style fitting Wikipedia, however I don't see this as a strong point as to why this article should stay. There already exists an article where Dartmouth fraternities and sororities are described. (<a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_Greek_organizations_1a1b.html" title="Dartmouth College Greek organizations">Dartmouth College Greek organizations</a>). So why is there a need to have a seperate article for each fraternity chapter? It seems like an overkill. Granted, these chapters are old and notable but then again there are quite literally hundreds if not thousands of chapters of any national fraternity which bear the same characteristic. What's to prevent the floodgates from opening and have many individuals use Wikipedia as some <i>de facto</i> free web service such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.com.html" title="Geocities.com">geocities.com</a> to advertise their greek chapters?</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related pages because of the same reason listed above:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../k/a/p/Kappa_Kappa_Kappa_ef40.html" title="Kappa Kappa Kappa">Kappa Kappa Kappa</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi_Tau_c98d.html" title="Phi Tau">Phi Tau</a><br />

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The references you describe are to individual chapters of national fraternities. However, these are local fraternities without association to any national organization. They also all have significance to the campus. Phi Tau was the first coed house and one of the early fraternities on campus. Kappa Kappa Kappa was even the second local fraternity in the nation. --<sub>└</sub><i><sup><a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith120bh_b04a.html" title="User:Smith120bh">Smith120bh</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../s/m/i/User_talk%7ESmith120bh_4622.html" title="User talk:Smith120bh">TALK</a></sub></i> <sup>┐</sup> 03:46, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with Smith120bh. The arguments against the pages you reference are that they are chapters of national organizations. The same cannot be said of Phi Tau, Kappa Kappa Kappa, or Alpha Chi Alpha. They are indeed old and notable, as Dysepsion has already conceded, but he is in error when he suggests that there are hundreds or thousands of chapters bearing the same characteristic. They are unique. Tri-Kap is the 2nd oldest fraternity in the country. Phi Tau was the first coed fraternity at Dartmouth College, all the more notable given the initial acrimony when the College first integrated. Given that the primary argument for deletion was based on the erroneous presumption that these articles refer to one chapter out of hundreds or more, when in fact, these are unique organizations, I ask that the articles on Phi Tau, Kappa Kappa Kappa, and Alpha Chi Alpha be kept. --Jedsa 04:16, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. What I don't understand is why are there seperate articles for these fraternities when one describes them already exists? (<a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_Greek_organizations_1a1b.html" title="Dartmouth College Greek organizations">Dartmouth College Greek organizations</a>). Also, is the fact that they are "local" the only saving characteristic to keep these articles? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">Dysepsion</a> (<a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dysepsion_97cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dysepsion">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the cited AfD's were all local chapters of national fraternities, and so could be merged with the national. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Phi_Delta_Alpha_76d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Phi Delta Alpha">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Phi Delta Alpha</a> was an article small enough to be merged with the list of fraternities, but these articles are more complete and well written. As far as notability goes, where do you draw the line? I know from experience that each of these houses are known by at least hundreds of students at the school, and thousands of alumni. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi_Tau_c98d.html" title="Phi Tau">Phi Tau</a> (I should disclose that I am an alum of Phi Tau) has been written about in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>, as Milque and Cookies is a unique tradition among fraternities, hosts dozens to maybe a hundred <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thru-hiker.html" title="Thru-hiker">thru-hikers</a> on the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalachian_Trail_bbbc.html" title="Appalachian Trail">Appalachian Trail</a> each year and has been written about in hiking magazines because of it, and has several notable alumni (I will research and provide citations in the morning). — <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambda_b633.html" title="User:Lambda">λ</a> 09:59, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> For one thing, it's bad form to nominate three separate (and arguably unrelated) articles for deletion in one vote. As others have noted, the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi_Tau_c98d.html" title="Phi Tau">Phi Tau</a> article, for example, is not about a local chapter of a national fraternity, but an independent organization that has its own unique history. In fact, the history section is a very notable component of this article, as it documents the fraternity's decision to break away from the national fraternity organization over the issue of segregation. I don't think that could be adequately rolled into a sentence or two in a larger article. The fact that these articles get a paragraph or two summary mention in another article is no more a reason for their deletion than, say, deleting <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_Brazil_d4a0.html" title="Religion in Brazil">Religion in Brazil</a> would be justified because religion is mentioned in a paragraph or two of the main article about <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.--<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKharker_c115.html" title="User:Kharker">Kharker</a> 15:40, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with several of the above comments regarding the fact that this is a unique and local fraternity, as opposed to a national fraternity with dozens or hundreds of chapters. In addition, one should consider the history and interesting name as facts that add to its value. 23:25, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with many of the statements above concerning the uniqueness of local chapter history and individuality. It is important to keep in mind that unlike chapters of national fraternities, local houses are all individually autonomous organizations with networks of alumni that have been accumulating for decades. Each house is individually responsable for uniqiue social, campus, and community service initiatives. To merge these articles (not to mention delete them), would be a misrepresentation of the Dartmouth greek system and the greek system as a whole. 18:30, 8 February 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Most of the above make a good point, but I see no reason not to allow a unique, individual house its own page. Though the metaphor is not entirely correct, it would be like deleting an individual church and just lumping it into the "Church" category. If it is, indeed, a truly unique environment, let it stay.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- Alpha Chi deserves it's own page. it's a local fraternity and it's sweet. keep it please.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with Smith120bh-- there is NO national chapter of Alpha Chi Alpha. It is a very unique house with it's own history; much of the information unique to this organization would have no place under the general Dartmouth Greek organizations entry. Alpha Chi Alpha has been written up in the New York Times magazine for its history and tradition. --<a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZach_Mayer_b556.html" title="User:Zach Mayer">Zach Mayer</a></li>
