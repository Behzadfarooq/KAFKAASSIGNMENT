<li>This article has a name which gives a clue to its troubles. If it had been called "Autism (Incidence)" or "Autism (Incidence and reporting)" then it could have been a discussion on a sub-topic of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a>. As it is, it is a brawl, hath little of structure or consensus and is not - looking at the long history in the talk page - getting better over time. There is actually a topic worth writing an article about, but that isn't the topic and this isn't the article, and it never will become that from here. <b>Delete</b>, and start from scratch, and get someone to volunteer to write it who is noted for NPOV, before the rest of the editing process gets going. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 22:49, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Analysis</b> I lack a metric for "stability". Would it be reasonable to say that a stable article has few edits recently, and those simple additions? <b>Fail</b>. Would it be reasonable to say that a stable article will probably not have had POV tags applied for much, ideally any, and none of its recent history? <b>Not a pass</b>. Would it be reasonable to say that there is something about the Talk page of a stable article which is different in quality, and possibly in quantity from an unstable article's talk page? <b>Subjective judgement</b> there - one has to look at it.

<dd>I see no possible explanation for the edit with summary as above and explanation given here other than as I said, Ombudsman edited my comment. In the same edit he added "comment" to Leifern's ... comment ... which I can't see any reason for any of us to object to, except on principle, but he also removed the quotes which I felt it necessary to add, half an hour before that edit. I am unable to understand how "virtually the same moment" and an edit conflict resulting in a simple cut and paste could account for this single individual instance, <b>but</b>... if it did then a more reasonable response would be along the lines of "I'm very sorry I inadvertently copied your previous omment over your current one". That is not the meaning offered as explanation. Out of band, would anyone care to join in an RFC that Ombudsman be enjoined from ever editing any comment by anyone else again?

<dd>Rubbish. The minor refactoring simply prefaced <b>comment</b> and an extra indent to distinguish two contrasting comments that looked like they were running together. Leaving a tab open for a half hour and then re-examining is hardly unusual; the inadvertant removal of extraneous and not easily noticed noticed formatting is not a molehill that an average editor would try to build a mountain with.

Ombudsman removed, as I wrote above, quotation marks from my comment. "followed" is different from followed, particularly when it is pointing out that the order of events is the opposite of what was suggested. It is perfectly clear from the edit history, and Ombudsman begins to look as though he is not asking for help finding it, but rather lying about having made that alteration. I repeat, that <b>in several other afd discussions, Ombudsman has altered comments by other editors.</b> This is not regarded as generally acceptable.

<dd>Midgley, you throw around accusations of policies and rules but have nothing to back up these accusations with. Autism/incidence was written just around the time this article was nominated for deletion, and I don't think it's a coincidence - you cited it yourself in the opening hours of this nomination. There is absolutely nothing to substantiate your assertion that I "own" all of autism. I too have expressed reservations about the title of the article, but the remedy for that is that we rename/move it. The article you want to delete is full of source citations, goes to great lengths to outline the controversy, and presents both sides of the controversy fairly. I find your assertion that you have a slight, impersonal, and entirely netural point of view laughable. I would like to propose that if this article is deleted, then you'll join me in nominating <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationist.html" title="Anti-vaccinationist">Anti-vaccinationist</a> for deletion, which has all the cited shortcomings in this article, and then some.

<li><b>Keep</b> The following peer reviewed papers demonstrate there is such a thing as an "autism epidemic" even if the allopathic lobby on Wikipedia want to suppress all reference to it. Such a term has a place in Wikipedia as an article in its own right. If people want to refer to the "autism epidemic" this page is needed for them to see what it is all about.</li>

<dl>
<dd>It is accepted that autism is at epidemic levels in the USA [Increases in Identified Cases of Autism Spectrum Disorders: Trudy Steuernagel, Kent State University JOURNAL OF DISABILITY POLICY STUDIES VOL. 16/NO. 3/2005 138].</dd>
<dd>The Steuernagel paper very early on quotes the AAP "there is no disputing the fact that autism now affects a significant number of people in this country (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001)" and refers throughout to autism as epidemic. The paper commences by quoting Time magazine on the issue because it has become so important with so many Americans now seriously affected. Also early on the paper states "The purpose of this article is to make a contribution to the development of policies to address the autism epidemic". This paper is all the more significant because it is sceptical of the autism/vaccines/mercury neuro-toxin connection.</dd>
<dd>This paper says in no uncertain terms "Autism is NOW a big problem. What the hell are we going to do about it?" and sets out to address the policy to be adopted to what it refers throughout as the autism epidemic. And it does so whilst acknowledging what is becoming a rear-guard fight to downplay the problem by the medical profession (the seeming overseers of the epidemic, if, as many believe, it is caused by vaccinations). It is also scholarly, well-read and evidence-based, quoting evidence and other authority for the proposition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And here is a Pediatrics paper on the same broad point:-</dd>
<dd><b>National Autism Prevalence Trends From United States Special Education Data</b> Craig J. Newschaffer, PhD*, Matthew D. Falb, MHS* and James G. Gurney, PhD - Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland Divisions of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota - PEDIATRICS Vol. 115 No. 3 March 2005, pp. e277-e282 (doi:10.1542/peds.2004-1958.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The authors say:-
<dl>
<dd><i>The drastic increase in the prevalence of the autism classification presents a major challenge to the nationâ€™s special education service systems and is one that has already triggered responses from federal, state, and local agencies.32</i></dd>
<dd>"It has been suggested that increased substitution of autism for mental retardation3 and/or language impairment27 diagnoses might be accounting for some of the apparent increase in autism prevalence. If this substitution occurred with special education classifications, then increases in autism prevalence with subsequent birth cohorts would be accompanied by decreases in mental retardation and/or speech/language impairment prevalences. As shown in Fig 1, mental retardation prevalence shows no birth cohort effect; in other words, there is no suggestion that prevalence is decreasing (or increasing) among younger cohorts. The cohort curves overlap to reproduce faithfully the shape of a cross-sectional curve of prevalence according to age (curve not shown). Trends with age are as expected for mental retardation, with prevalence increasing steadily through age 8 and then leveling."</dd>
<dd>"Similarly, the curves for speech/language impairment indicate no cohort differences. The patterns with respect to age are as expected. At young ages, speech/language impairment prevalence is many times higher than that of autism; however, prevalence decreases dramatically from age 7 to age 17 years. The decrease in the prevalence of speech and language impairment is likely a result of children losing this disability category classification, which is expected to occur to a greater extent for this category (ie, in cases of articulation disorders and dysfluency that resolve with time), compared with the other categories."</dd>
<dd>"The curves for other health impairments are notable for 2 reasons, ie, because this is the disability classification that typically includes children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and because there are strong cohort differences. Prevalence is higher for successive birth cohorts, with the greatest annual increases occurring between the 1980 and 1984 birth cohorts. Within cohorts, the prevalence of other health impairments increases sharply through 11 years of age, with the rate of increase gradually decreasing in successive years."</dd>

For the avoidance of doubt let me say that at least until this evening* there was not one word in <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28Incidence%29_a6eb.html" title="Autism (Incidence)">Autism (Incidence)</a> which did not get there by being left behind when the rest of a copy of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">Autism epidemic</a> was deleted from around it. The description of the risen incidence of autism as <i>epidemic</i> (adj.) has been in there from the start, and is as much as you need really, why take a page over a word when you can put numbers in instead and let people know what the incidecen is? Even if the deletion was over-enthusiastic (and I think the reverse is true, that I was too conservative in not throwing out stuff that should be, fortunately collaboration has followed and improved it) there is nothing actually different to merge in. It is in fact a fork, although it is the sort of fork that involves picking out one topic from a collection in an article, and discarding all the others in order to leave a focussed and leaner article. <b>Replacing</b> the epidemic article with the article on incidence - viewed as a candidate rewrite for it from the start along with its renaming - has always been a perfectly good possibility, if people want to do it, but they are two separate articles at present, this is an rfa on one of them on its merits, and we may well get the cahnce to debate an rfa on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28Incidence%29_a6eb.html" title="Autism (Incidence)">Autism (Incidence)</a> any moment now.

As in wikipedia's own article <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemic.html" title="Epidemic">Epidemic</a>'s definition: <i>a disease that appears as new cases in a given human population, during a given period, at a rate that substantially exceeds what is "expected",</i> and notes: <i>Defining an epidemic can be subjective, depending in part on what is "expected"</i>. So stating that autism is an epidemic is "subjective" (1 in 86, to 1 in 150, figures seem quoted in article, which at approx 1% seems to me significant, but not an epidemic). No one can dispute that autism has an incidence, nor that this incidence has increased since autism was first described. <b>Autism incidence</b> is perhaps a little bland and <b>Autism incidence debate</b> is perhaps more literally what the article covers; i.e. both measured rates and discussion/disagreements over their interpretation &amp; significance. I think a merger into <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> would be quite wrong - that article is already quite long and is better as an introduction to the topic and related issues. <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> quite rightly already directs to sub-topics that expand on individual themes, e.g. <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">Autistic spectrum</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html" title="Autism therapies">Autism therapies</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_community.html" title="Autistic community">Autistic community</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_savant.html" title="Autistic savant">autistic savant</a>, so why not to incidence&#160;? Issues of incidence are critically important, especially with how concerns have been raised over whether the introducion of some vaccines is partially contributable. The topic is too large to include in one Autism article and has too much interesting info on rates in different countries. However all that information by area makes for a very long list - would reformating some of the smaller entries into a table (or least a bulleted list) rather than the padded paragraphs separated by sub-section headers, neaten the article&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:05, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly rename, or add redirect, for Epidemiology of Autism, per JFW. This article can help keep a massive load of speculation off of the autism article and yet allow exploration and development of the reasoning and data, pro &amp; con, about various possible causes of the "explosion". Clearly "a work in progress," I think this AfD topic is of large public concern and should be kept. Generally, I would prefer a more concise and focused main Autism article anyway by having this separate article. I also view the alternate late starter, Autism (incidence), coupled with an AfD request, an ugly form of POV pushing. --66.58.130.26 13:06, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But of _what_ point of view? I can see why the epidemic article and various others have languished, if any attempt to produce a large improvement receives such hostility. I do not think that making those edits in place would have met with appreciation either, so they had to be somewhere else. If someone thinks that <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28Incidence%29_a6eb.html" title="Autism (Incidence)">autism (Incidence)</a> should be in a different namespace then they should put it there.

<dd>A *calm*, serious discussion in the article that compares and contrasts disputed facts, interpretations and speculations about a high stakes, ill defined area where an authoritative answer is way premature. Spirited, tedious, even annoyed talk pages are likely. Need dialogue without the total breakdowns that have continuely occurred over outside doubts about the compelling net benefits of vaccines &amp; public policy, as some previous editors here will recall. In Autism (Incidence), the hypotheses of causation (list of causation topics still incomlete?) are deleted en masse - I think they should remain, be discussed and edited at length until some kind of NPOV construction and agreement is reached, even if the article looks bimodal/bipolar in some places ("agreed disagreement") Even if the autism count is a combination of artifacts and fads.

<dd>I don't think this is a good idea. Since autism is not a disease, and epidemiology implies a disease is present, the whole concept is incorrect and POV.

<p><b>Additional comment</b> On reflection, I see possible merit to two specialty articles under a stable Autism parent article, one article a hard quantitative and definitions article (epidemiology or incidence of...), the other article more directly addressing individually listed social concerns, hypotheses, speculation, politics and policy trends ("epidemic"). The definitional effects of naming are important here - epidemiology and incidence don't quite have the scope right for "epidemic". One recurring point is that Autism (incidence) is consistent with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AContent_forking" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AContent_forking" rel="nofollow">POV fork</a>. There may be significant utility in two complementary (ahem, even if antagonistic) articles: one a "straight" discussion of definitions and epidemiogy/incidence of autism, the other "epidemic" article including the implications and hypotheses of causation - sliced, diced and utterly minced.</p>
<p>I think this latter "epidemic" article is important beyond the ever lurking (and clashing) medical controversies and public policy questions. Of course the "epidemic" part presumes a real nonzero rise in incidence but the subject is also a reflection of the unanswered questions and doubts in the public mind. Rather than simple stern denials or silence, cumulative address of questions/fears properly deposed, analyzed, weighted, cited and balanced is a more informative, useful way. On an individual level, there are a lot of issues that ordinary citizens/parents want to see discussed in real time with some detail. They are not looking for mere repetition of what government position has been adopted, often with varying degrees of ex cathedra stmts, "official science" or finally some accurately detailed article (oops) after multigenerational studies, if ever. I think the technical, actuarial article would suffer less dilution and edit warring while the ongoing speculative subtopics could be better addressed, individually with more reassuring detail, on a cumulative basis in an "epidemic" article. Can this be abused? Yes, of course - the forking issue. But it actually addresses two overlapping audiences with much different objectives and might avoid some of the vitriolic confrontation in a struggle for priority from different perspectives. "Is too" - "is not" arguments often involve multiple factors and (as yet) unknown facts/data that turn out differently anyway (i.e. 5% is the economic rise of superior programmers rather than 5% vaccine damage, vice versa or both, with 20% - 80% definitional and xx% "we still simply don't know"). <b>Perhaps evolving two articles</b> is a better way forward. After my initial pique with Adrian, I may be validating his article, too. <b>Epidemiology of autism</b> for solid definitional and data issues; <b>autism "epidemic"</b>, hopefully better renamed, to track hypotheses, fears, speculation, trends, policies as the story evolves. (I already voted, above) --66.58.130.26 04:54, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to disagree to this idea. This would be a one-sided POV fork in that case. If people allow a speculative article of an autism epidemic, which has been described as OR, it also must allow the existence of The Neanderthal theory of the autism spectrum. The latter article enjoys just as much support among autistics as the vaccine / toxin / epidemic view enjoys among parents. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:26, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

About half of the epidemic article is already covered (albeit with a different slant) on <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_autism.html" title="Causes of autism">Causes of autism</a>. I don't agree with the idea of having one article for the scientific/medical-establishment and one for the others. The article you seem to desire, with its "deposed, analyzed, weighted" would necessarily contain original research. Wikipedia is not the place for investigative journalism. People come to an encyclopedia for the established facts, not speculation or opinion.
