<li>I went through most of them and found them to be thorough and encyclopedic. If we're given a laundry list it's perfectly reasonable to base a judgment on the worthwhile majority of articles.

<li>Alansohn- Reliable sources and verifiability are not the issues <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">notability is</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaview_Square_Mall_628b.html" title="Seaview Square Mall">Seaview Square Mall</a> has verifiable sources, but does not show evidence of notability. A couple of citations of local newspaper articles does not prove notability. If you want this article to remain, its notability you have to prove, not verifiability. <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 18:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>He already did. It's called <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. And to answer your question, no, I don't think any of these defunct malls deserve an article.

<li>OK, let's look at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which specifies that <b>"A company or corporation is notable if it meets any of the following criteria: 1) The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself. * This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles..."</b>. Just as an example for one article, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaview_Square_Mall_628b.html" title="Seaview Square Mall">Seaview Square Mall</a> references two articles: 1. "Upscale development fills commercial corridor", Asbury Park Press, October 20, 2005 and 2. "For a while, plenty of parking at mall", Asbury Park Press, January 18, 2001. Both newspaper articles detail the malls efforts to repurpose itself from an indoor mall to an outdoor facility. QED. This sample article is indicative of a pattern of notable articles being deleted. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:35, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Malls listed are also notable for their localities and do not necessarily need to be representative of a more worldwide or national view.

I predict right now that this discussion will end in a no consensus keep, because a whole set of malls, which should be dealt with individually, addressing whether each one satisfies the WP:CORP criteria on its individual merits, have been nominated en masse. Some malls are notable. Some malls are not. Applying the WP:CORP criteria to each mall individually, on its merits, <i>with editors doing the necessary research on each subject</i>, determines which are which. A blanket nomination will not. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> now, then go after them individually on their individual merits.

<li><b>Comment</b> I feel for the nominator - you're damned if you nominate separately, and damned if you nominate together. Group nominations have long been acceptable, as stated in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_list_multiple_related_pages_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for Deletion</a> itself. In this instance, there is nothing wrong with the grouping as presented. In such circumstances, I find doing separate nominations leads to inconsistent results. Given that this is not a vote, the closing admin can take into consideration any comments that support retaining any of the nominated articles (if the discussion makes it clear that any of the articles are worth keeping) while deleting the balance. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:08, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep All</b>. Just because it's not <i>your</i> history doesn't mean it has no relevance; I agree with Seicer that many of these malls have great local value and relevance, even in their current "dead" state. Additionally, deletion of these malls will disrupt the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Dead_Malls_d0d2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Dead Malls">Dead Malls WikiProject</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> em all. Bulk nominations should only occur when the nominator has taken care to ensure that none of the articles nominated meets relevant policy guidelines.

<li><b>Procedural Keep All</b> This is not how multiple-nominations should occur. These articles share nothing more than a superficial commonality; they are all shopping malls. Some of them appear to be notable, and thus keepable articles. Others appear non-notable, and thus deletable articles. Someone should comb through these, pick out the deletable articles, and renominate ONLY those specifically, and each should have an individual nomination. Again, there is NO WAY TO ACT on this as a group as each article has its own qualities that make it either keepable or deletable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 05:39, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

On the other hand, as an example of bad design, and poor planning decisions, plus its major redesign into a more popular shopping center, that should make it at least minimally notable. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 12:32, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per Seicer and BlankVerse. The nominator should also proposed <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_defunct_shopping_malls.html" title="List of defunct shopping malls">List of defunct shopping malls</a>, which is a part of a WikiProject for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> I suppose this is the inevitable consequence of the "all <i>foo</i> are notable" school of thought. I have just deleted probably around 50 articles on malls operated by a single ocmpany, the vast majority of whihc were created in alphabetical order by a single account. Wikipedia is not a directory, folks. Especially not a directory of dead shopping malls. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 00:06, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> With this AfD fast on its way failing it looks like we will need to recreate the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossroads_Mall_7c82.html" title="Crossroads Mall">Crossroads Mall</a> article that was the subject of a speedy delete while this AfD was already in progress. There seems to have been nothing essentially different with the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossroads_Mall_7c82.html" title="Crossroads Mall">Crossroads Mall</a> article and the others that still exist, including a relevant source about plans for the mall. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:55, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: To add, <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexington_Mall_e12a.html" title="Lexington Mall">Lexington Mall</a> is no longer specific to the mall property but to the economic development that will ensue. Saul Properties has been in discussions for redevelopment, and the article would be excellent in detailing out this. This further proves that this "blanket delete" is not only in appropriate, but its clear the request was put in with little forethought and was hastily put together. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 02:51, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think I'm going to endorse the concerns of people opposed to this kind of mass-nomination. Especially since it seems there is another one put out later. I wonder if malls are becoming the new schools? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:44, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>South Sqaure Mall: Merge info into newer mall article and make a redirect</b>. In the SS Mall case, a newer mall basically ran the old mall out of business. Therefore, I think the little info that's on the South Square Mall article should be merged into the newer mall, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streets_at_Southpoint_9cb9.html" title="Streets at Southpoint">Streets at Southpoint</a>'s article. Then the old South Square Mall article can be either deleted or made as a redirect to Streets at Southpoint. As for the other malls, I don't really care. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGooday.1_70f1.html" title="User:Gooday.1">TinMan</a> 22:11, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It seems that <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossroads_Mall_7c82.html" title="Crossroads Mall">Crossroads Mall</a> has been speedied, under criterion G11 (spam), which essentially knocks it out of contention. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 02:40, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: These need to be taken on a case-by-case basis. I ask that this AfD be closed and that a discussion ensue on each talk page of each mall for nomination for deletion. A blanket case is not appropriate for all of these. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 02:43, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to me that this is pretty similar to the school situation - is every school in existence intrinsically notable? What about schools that no longer exist? What about random buildings? The Smith Building in downtown Townsville USA. 100 people work in it every day; it is a major aspect of Townsville's "skyline" and a figure in its recent history; everyone in the Townsville metro area drives by it whenever they're en route from the courthouse to the town green. It is part of Townsville's psyche. Notable? Why not? I can personally attest that at least two of these malls are major elements of the local psyche. I know that's silly, but maybe it's better to be overly inclusive and then hash things out on a more specific basis than "these are just defunct malls, let's axe 'em all."<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 02:48, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Once notable, always notable. A mall that was notable when it was operating does not cease to be notable after it is demolished. Given enough time and resources, including an index to the relevant local newspaper, almost every mall can be demonstrated to pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Even without those resources, the mall articles should be kept as a part of history, in the same way that we would keep an article on a 17th-century Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. -- <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 17:32, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> since becoming defunct does not bring with it a loss of notability.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. All of these malls are interesting to read about. Is Wikipedia somehow low on space? If not, why is this even being discussed?Freddyboy</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Typing in "mallcruft" and walking away from the keyboard isn't a convincing argument for deletion. Many of these articles meet the relevant policy guidelines, so this blanket nomination is disruptive at best, regardless of whether or not it was made in good faith. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 08:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
