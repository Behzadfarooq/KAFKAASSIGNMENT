<p>Non-Notable internet meme that is restricted to only one website - maybe a mention on the fark article, but not here. <b><a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGod_of_War_d84c.html" title="User:God of War">God</a> <font face="Symbol">Ω</font> <a href="../../../g/o/d/User_talk%7EGod_of_War_27ba.html" title="User talk:God of War">War</a></b> 01:14, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The meme is spreading throughout the internet, I too have seen Ric's photo in several other places and have had to refer people to the page about him here so they'll quit asking about him elsewhere. MSchlaf</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I've seen Ric mentioned in other places, and the information here helped me figure out the cliche</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Is it lonely up there in your tower? Honestly, what harm is being done by having this article here? None. Someone else mentioned that Wiki is often the only source of obscure information. This is one of those pieces. There are many, many other articles here that are more worthless.

<li><b>Delete</b> I read FARK and remember the first Ric Romero topic. Yes, he's been mentioned a few times since then, but it's a pretty minor meme even within FARK and absolutely no impact whatsoever on anything outside FARK.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Like Ric Romero said "Anyone with a computer can become their own publisher on the internet." While he was refering to blogging, WP is a type of encyclopedia. WP may not be a blog, but it did however state the facts of Ric Romero. It told of his early years up to the point that he became a cliché. I'm certain there are more sites than this one that state the same facts as WP and I feel that deleting this would prove nothing. WP has only published the facts of Ric Romero. It isn't the writer's opinion that he is a cliché. It is only a statement that reveals the truth and reveals the reason of his internet popularity. IMO, the only thing hurting the fact that he is refered as a cliché is the popularity of WP. It won't go unnoticed if it's deleted. Society will still refer to him as a cliché.--Ellis d 09:03, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a notable consumer reporter for KABC-TV.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia has plenty of articles on local radio and television stations and the like; until we agree to delete all of them or create a specific standard regarding them, we should not simply delete those that come to Wikipedians' attentions.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. I think Ric Romero might as well have a Wikipedia with its main focus being on his job and life and a sidenote how he became popular on the internet. There are plenty of obscure stub articles out there that seem ridiculous. But then, I agree that if you keep this page, it could mean people making the argument that a Jameth page is justified. I disagree that there "isn't enough here to justify an article." There's much less elsewhere and there are no discussion deletions for them. (I actually contribute to Wiki.

<li>Ric Romero is a tv personality in LA, a considerably large market. His basic information should be left in, as there are many people of the same or less notability who still warrant an entry in Wikipedia. Perhaps this discussion should be centered on whether or not to keep the "fark.com" references in, as that portion appears to be an inside joke among users of only one website. However, it is setting a frightening president of censorship if the non-disputed facts concerning a tv personality are deleted because of prejudice against a website like "fark.com" that has adopted him as a mascot. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGallup_f8e5.html" title="User:Gallup">Gallup</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/l/User_talk%7EGallup_29fb.html" title="User talk:Gallup">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gallup_6779.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gallup">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - He's a TV personality which makes him notable. He may not be an important person (opinion) but the fact is that his name gets thrown around all over, so people will end up here looking for information on him. I don't think we need a full-blown biography and family history, but a few tidbits of info and his picture (and why he's so often mentioned) would suffice. I don't know the guy, and it doesn't look like I'd like him, but I think for the purpose of spreading knowledge [of any kind] it should stay. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostalker_d602.html" title="User:Ghostalker">Ghostalker</a> 17:13, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As someone else said, the fact that we're arguing over this surely means this article should stay by default. Besides, this is censorship from people who can't take a joke, which is on one level what this is and another is the fact that this is a real person. If we're going to be completely anal about what constitutes a valid article, we should delete every article about fictional characters and dead people.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- This is a second comment but I wanted to add several points. First, in my job as a researcher for one of the Big Four search engines, memes like this become popular page hits due to news stories or even Saturday Night Live. Wikipedia would be my first stop, if I were trying to evaluate a search for 'Ric Romero Obvious'. It is most authoritative, has the largest number of editors and is the most-likely to have the underground/cultural interpretation. Second, my Wikipedia sweatshirt says "Edit this page" and it comes closest to the spirit of Wikipedia, not "Delete this page". But maybe someone sent me the wrong sweatshirt. Third, being an Internet resource edited by Internet users is what defines Wikipedia -- this is not a resource edited by perfesseurs for the hoi polloi, as is Encyclopedia Britannica. That editors even believe this is Romero/meme page is an issue is an indication that they neither understand the users nor the donors to this site. ACzernek</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> Although Ric Romero has been an internet meme for a short time, you can't justify it's deletion because he's not as popular as Ha Ha Guy or the Icy Hot Stuntaz, both of which have articles on Wiki. Unless you plan on deleting all internet memes, it's better that the article be retained. Oftentimes Wiki is the only source for finding out information on very obscure subjects.

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b> - Ric Romero IS a known television personality in Los Angeles, so at the very least he should have his own Wikipedia article. However, I dunno if the Fark.com stuff is relevent, unless he's in on the joke too. Maybe if more about Ric's personal information and other non-Fark.com sources were added, the Fark.com stuff can remain? ... Something else to consider: Just because Fark.com is a web community, it doesn't mean anything that only Fark.com users would know shouldn't be on Wikipedia. I mean, how many farkers are out there versus any community of people (including nation states, towns, cities, etc), and how much more is known about smaller communities of people and not about Fark? Is some Turkey Festival that gathers 10,000 people in Bugfart, Wisconsin more important than a Fark cliche where 100,000 people are in on the joke? - <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick15_f3ed.html" title="User:Nick15">Nick15</a> 20:46, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>.

As has been stated elsewhere, there are plenty of local news celebrities that have wikipedia articles - the only reason you are against this one is because the fact that he has gained MORE notoriety than other people because he's associated with an internet meme.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I use Wikipedia regularly, and much of what I use it for is to find out what an inside joke is referring to. I suspect that many others use this site for the same reason. If this was an inside joke on a much smaller forum, like "Option J" on Baseball Think Factory", I would be in favor of deletion -- particularly because BTF has its own wiki, but FARK is a massively popular site, and consequently I would expect that there would be a high level of interest in knowing the backstory of an in-joke.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Even without the Fark.com references, Mr. Romero is someone is someone seen regularily by millions. And if his article is to go, then a significant fraction of Wikipedia needs to follow him into deletion. There are certainly articles on memes that don't have any non-Internet fame. Heck, WP has articles on minor aspects of minor past TV shows. And besides, it was usually to find out what all the Romero references were. Though I will grant that if his fame was completely limited to Fark WP's mention of Romero should have been limited WP article(s) about Fark. But as I said, that is not the case.

Might as well keep him even without the Fark.com reference. --<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_What_Where_Nguyen_Why_874b.html" title="User:Who What Where Nguyen Why">Who What Where Nguyen Why</a> 01:01, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I don't see why not. If he's famous enough to have a television spot, why is he not famous enough to be on Wikipedia? Just trim the section about the Fark cliché. Snakeyeswin 23:45, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Neutral</b> JordanLund 04:22, 17 April 2006 (UTC) It's simple enough to monitor bandwidth and hits. If the page is generating sufficient interest and hits are up then it doesn't matter if it's a Fark generated Internet Meme or not. Enough people are interested in the page to keep it around. If the hits drop off then delete it under a "not enough readership" reason. If it's truly limited to Fark traffic and everyone on Fark already knows who Ric Romero is then it won't generate enough traffic to keep.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as a regular television personality i'd have to say he barely squeeks by WP:BIO... the fact he's also go t a rather large meme following on fark doesnt hurt either. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 05:11, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I remember splitting Ric off from the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">Fark.com</a> entry because there seemed to be need (and public interest in him) to separate his bio content and his FARK notoriety into a separate entry, away from the FARK page clutter. As long as the content in Ric's entry is factual and verifiable (and not too opinionated), it certainly meets the content guidelines for a separate entry and therefore should be kept. Surely more meat and potatoes content should be added, making the Fark stuff less prominent / more trimmable, but I don't have that knowledge me-self.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> He had his 15 minutes fame so more than 10 people know him. The wiki article is weak though (poorly written and has a lot of useless cross links like "october").
