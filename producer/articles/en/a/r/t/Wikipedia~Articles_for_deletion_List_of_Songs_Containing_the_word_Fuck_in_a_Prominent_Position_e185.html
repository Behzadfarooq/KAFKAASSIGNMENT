<li><b>Comment</b> "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia." I would argue a collection of songs containing an unremarkable word is precisely an "indiscriminate collection of items of information", in violation of "Wikipedia is first and foremost an online encyclopedia." The door is opened to other lists of songs, containing other unremarkable words, ad infinitum. If you cannot see that (or if you can see that, but could not care less) then you need to re-read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Incidentally, the primary source nature of the list (it appears no one verifiable has catalogued these songs per some or all of the list criteria, allowing WP editors to then cite them as a verifiable member of this list) also helps it fail <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Violation of any one of these policies is grounds for deletion. Multiple failures such as this make it an open-and-shut case. If you want to continue to debate this, you will have to explain to me how it does not fail every single one of these policies first. Because fail them it surely does. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 18:59, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

(Say, I've heard of a lot of sexual positions, but the "prominent position" is new to me...) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:36, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> since there is no evidence that the inclusion of the word fuck in songs is an encyclopaedic topic, and the word "prominent" is subjective.

<li><b>Comment</b> When <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Carlin_f409.html" title="George Carlin">George Carlin</a> or the Family Media Guide creates a list of songs containing "fuck", there may be grounds for writing an article citing them, per <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_dirty_words.html" title="Seven dirty words">Seven dirty words</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_ordered_by_uses_of_the_word__fuck__d887.html" title="List of films ordered by uses of the word &quot;fuck&quot;">List of films ordered by uses of the word "fuck"</a>. The "commercial and legal ramifications" of "fuck" are unremarkable on their own - the "ramifications" talked about are fairly minor in reality, they are crucially not restricted to use of this one word, and besides, JJay alleges that it's the use of "fuck" "in titles" that has significance - if that's so, why on earth is this article being mealy-mouthed about "prominent positions"? Maybe thirty years ago this would have been an exciting and edgy topic, but today, I personally find it rather tame and crufty - "juvenile" even, FWIW. Aside from my POV, I note no one has yet explained how this article successfully passes the WP policies that I cited above (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>A7, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>).

<li>George Carlin and the Family Media Guide may not be in the song list business, but the RIAA is and has been for some time with their parental advisory label (and fuck is a part of that). You may not believe that the "commercial and legal" ramifications of the word fuck are "remarkable", and you might have been right, except that the word "fuck" can lead to FCC and FTC investigations (ask Bono) and get your album banned at Wal-Mart. That is far from minor considering that Wal-Mart is the biggest retailer in the United States. You have claimed above that fuck is an "unremarkable" word. That is seemingly belied by our long <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a> article and associated category: Category:Fuck. If you want to argue that this fails Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information that is your business, but this article does not come close to any of the specific clauses (travel guide, memorial, genealogy, aphorisms, etc.). Basing your reasoning on the line: <i>That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia</i> is also not a particularly compelling argument: (i) it is a generic argument that can be applied indiscriminately to any article up for deletion; (ii) the three AfD discussions involving the cinema list have already proven the viability of the subject. I won't address your comment on "edgy and exciting" or "tame and crufty" since I don't believe that those sort of subjective judgements have any bearing on inclusion of reference material. Lastly, I do not see any conflict with WP:V or WP:NOR. The song titles are listed on the albums. The albums are available through commercial sites and are reviewed. Are you really suggesting that editors can not confirm that <a href="../../../a/m/e/America%2C_Fuck_Yeah_e6a5.html" title="America, Fuck Yeah">America, Fuck Yeah</a> is really called America Fuck Yeah? If that is the case, perhaps you would like to add a fact tag to the title of the America, Fuck Yeah article. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:33, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Titles" - you keep mentioning "titles". And yet this article is not concerning itself with "titles" is it? How about a new article name - List of Albums Banned by Walmart? Assuming you can cite either Walmart or a reliable commentator that the albums were indeed banned, then that might be a viable topic. Or List of Albums with a Parental Advisory Sticker on the Front? As long as evidence is brought forth, even that might work. But please don't confuse albums with mere songs. This article is about songs, and does not mention or seek to address RIAA guidelines, Walmart practices, or anything else of substance whatsoever. You seem to suggest my criticisms are wholly "subjective", yet you do not acknowledge that your own arguments here are completely subjective also, and fail to engage with the WP policies cited. Don't ask me "are you suggesting...?"-type questions (you already said you dismiss subjective views, so why would you care what I'm "suggesting"?). Instead, cite the policies and explain exactly how this article complies. You seem to misunderstand (and pretty much ignore, in fact) <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> in relation to this article. Please explain how this article complies with its requirements: i.e., that this article constitutes a tertiary source and not original research. Where are the reliable source citations, as explicitly required by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> whether you recognise them as a formal requirement or not? A lot of this discussion consists of setting up straw-men. Address the policies and this article, not rhetorical questions and other WP articles. It will help a lot. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 17:54, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Starting with my very first post much higher on this page, I indicated that the article could evolve and the title could change. That requires editing, which takes time. Certainly longer than the 26 minute window given to the author before it was tagged for speedy deletion. Therefore, considering the almost immediate deletion tagging and repeated removal of edits by the AfD nominator, I hardly think that it is fair to complain about what the article "seeks to address". Despite your refusal to answer my question, I will point out again that the article does not violate any of the specific clauses of WP:NOT. You apparently agree with me since you have not, despite repeated requests, indicated a specific clause. I commented above on WP:V and WP:NOR. I do not see how either is contravened by listing songs that have the word fuck in their titles. Other aspects of the list should be sourced, just like with any other article. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:41, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for your comments. To summarise your view, if this article had a different title and different contents, you believe it may pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I dare say you are 100% correct. It would be a totally different article. I therefore don't see why deletion of this one is opposed, since you seem to agree that its title and contents intrinsically fail those policies. You dismissed my citation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>A7 as "subjective" above. This being the case, I really have no desire to discuss that point any further - your own dismissal of it is "subjective" to my mind, so round and round that goes without any conclusion in sight.

<li>I suggest you reread my comments. The only time I used the word "subjective" in our discussion was in the following line: <i>I won't address your comment on "edgy and exciting" or "tame and crufty" since I don't believe that those sort of subjective judgements have any bearing on inclusion of reference material.</i> I will be happy to withdraw that comment if "edgy and exciting" or "tame and crufty" are actually in the WP:NOT policy. In fact, I "dismissed" your citation of WP:NOT by stating that it was not a "particularly compelling argument". It will remain uncompelling until you cite a specific clause in the WP:NOT criteria. Those criteria are there for a reason, essentially because the policy is specific rather than elastic. Other than that, I will say that your summary of my "views" was an excellent demonstration of your "subjectivity". --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:30, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, yes, whereas your outright dismissal of my argument as "not a particularly compelling" one represents a rigorous application of objective truths and logic, I suppose? Ho hum.

<dd>You don't seem to handle disagreement very well, do you? "Not particularly compelling" is very different from an outright dismissal...and once again, I never said you applied "subjectivity" regarding WP:V or WP:NOR. I would appreciate it if you stopped trying to put words in my mouth. I have already commented on WP:V and WP:NOR multiple times above, such as when I wrote: <i>I do not see how either is contravened by listing songs that have the word fuck in their titles. Other aspects of the list should be sourced, just like with any other article.</i> Otherwise, I fail to see why you object to a change of title and/or content regarding this article. It is a frequent outcome on AFD that editing changes are suggested for nominated articles (merge or redirect are other possible outcomes). I have defended this article because I think the concept is valid and feasible within existing policy and guidelines.

<p>One suggestion: maybe instead of arguing whether the article is valid we could just change the guidelines to make it work? No one said the main criteria (appears in chorus, song title etc.) couldn't be changed. --68.227.185.195 18:00, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem here isn't just changing the criteria to make them work. As I see it, this article violates <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> ("Lists should always include <i>unambiguous statements</i> of membership criteria based on <i>definitions made by reputable sources</i>") and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (without a reputable source, everything on that page is original research). Unless an outside study can be found along the lines of "songs with prominent usage of 'fuck'" (and a quick search didn't find anything along those lines), the criteria (and this article in full) can't be modified in any way that satisfies WP policy. At best, we could delete the article and start over as "List of songs ordered by usage of 'fuck'"--<i>IF</i> an outside study by a reputable source has been done on <i>that</i> (which again, I'm not finding yet). Otherwise, this article will always <b>inherently</b> violate WP policy. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 18:30, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Another point: "prominent" is not one of the criteria for adding to the list, it is merely in the title for lack of a better word and because if the title consisted of the actually criteria it would be long and awkward. --Lord mortekai 18:22, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You just contradicted yourself. You say the problem isn't changing criteria, then say that the criteria are ambiguous. If you feel they are ambiguous, change them. --Lord mortekai 18:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think, with respect, this misses one of the points of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Whether or not what Lord mortekai says is true, we cannot "easily verify" whether songs <i>not</i> on the list have the word "fuck" <i>more</i> prominently positioned than the ones arbitrarily selected by the editors of this article for inclusion. Without a reliable source or sources whom we can trust to select the songs based on prominence beforehand, we are left with inherent <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> failure (as HumbleGod notes above) through the unsourced song selections made by editors, and we are left with the (obvious) <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> failure too, because no one can cite a single source for any of these editor choices. Rather than say "you can tell it should be on the list from the title", etc., I would like to know how we can tell there aren't other songs better suited for the list than these chosen ones. The only way we could be sure of that, would be by following <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and making this article into a tertiary source, which currently it is not. Nothing - as HumbleGod says - is going to change this problem without some bona fide reliable sources for this list.
