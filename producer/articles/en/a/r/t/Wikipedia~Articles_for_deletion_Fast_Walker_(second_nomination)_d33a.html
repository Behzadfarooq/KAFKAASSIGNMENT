<p><b>Delete</b> It has been over a month. The article has not improved. It is still one massive quote, with the rest being heavily based on another web page. It still doesn't satisfactorily meet WP:V, as there are no credible sources given (the only semi-credible source is the Discovery channel documentary, but their criteria for inclusion is incredibly lax nowadays). All sources that can be found reference the Discovery channel documentary. It violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for those reasons, though it may also fail to establish notability. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 00:16, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>As it currently stands there is not enough about this published anywhere reputable to possible satisfy WP:V. Mentioning something once in a <i>Discovery</i> documentary about UFOs is not quite good enough for me, if there is nothing else on this available. If everything dubious and unverifiable was removed, it would be a stub of an entry ("<i>Fast Walker</i> is the name given to an object by UFO watchers which they claim to be travelling at high speed towards Earth, and the nature of which to this day has remained unidentified. The UFO theorists claim that the object was detected in 1984 by a U.S. Defense satellite used to normally detect military threats heading towards the U.S.A, but unfortunately we have no way of verifying this claim at all. In fact, this entire article is based on one fringe website which itself looks like a second-hand account of a short segment of a <i>Discovery</i> episode on UFOs, taken out of context.") The entire "mystery" of it exists because there is a complete dearth of knowledge available, which I think is a good sign that it is not notable or verfiable enough for WP. <b>Delete, or stub-ify</b>. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:50, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>One other comment: I can't conceive of a way of writing this in a NPOV style <i>without</i> doing original research, owing to the lack of material on it available.

<li><b>Comment</b> it's been more than a month without verification. This despite another AfD, and despite much Googling. I would try to keep it if it was verified first.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The only change since the last AfD was a single spelling correction.

<li><b>Very Weak keep</b> A fascinating story; unfortunately, the only good references I've been able to find are from "unexplained mysteries" types of sites and whatnot. I found <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/prisyura1/dsp.html" class="external text" title="http://members.fortunecity.com/prisyura1/dsp.html" rel="nofollow">this old copy of an Omni article</a>, a magazine I loved as a kid though now I'm not sure how reliable of a source it would be considered. However, I did a Google search on "site:gov fastwalker" and found an official-looking Word document with the following quote:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>1. How do we integrate Hotwalker, Jaywalker, Fastwalker, Skywalker worldwide test range monitoring, and space infrastructure attack characterization capabilities?</i></dd>
<dd><i>2. How do we perform IR multi-stage correlation, sensor cross-cueing in the Space Surveillance Network, and multi-source fusion of space tracks using IR and radar?</i></dd>
<dd>I also found <a href="http://www.mors.org/publications/abstracts/72nd_abs.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.mors.org/publications/abstracts/72nd_abs.pdf" rel="nofollow">this pdf document</a> that mentions the same terms in a similar context. This suggests that "fastwalker" is indeed a term used in military space surveillance, and perhaps not invented by UFO buffs. However, for the article to qualify as a "keep," I think we'd have to remove the unverified account of the UFO incident (or at the very least mention that the sources are dubious). Unfortunately, that wouldn't leave much of an article. <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a> <a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 21:17, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, right, it would pretty much just leave a dicdef or "technical manual" style page. I already said my concerns with the Omni article in the other thread: Omni got to the point where they were putting in various crazed theories every month without much in the way of editorial review or skepticism. This one seems fairly minor and not to have gained the public eye, based on the low number of Google hits (above). Doesn't count as a Reliable Source either. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 21:46, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
