<dd>The suggestion is good, only I would recommend teritorial, rather than temporal disambiguation: Kingdom of Kurdistan (Sulaymaniyah) and Kingdom of Kurdistan (Palu), because the time way may misleadingly say that it was one and the same, only at different time periods. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 19:24, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I really think perhaps a merge in to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a> may be better (a recent suggestion below).

<li>Please aloow me to respectfully disagree. "History of Kurds" is a big topic, with potentially a very big article. "Kingdom of Kurdistan" is a small but a separate topic. It is in wikipedia tradition to create separate articles by cutting fdrom big ones, not vice versa. The statement "can't grow" is also probably made in polemic haste. I am sure that in due time Allah will guide a Kurdish editor to expand the article. I am not an expert in this historic time and place, so I added only some basic details, but in fact I've already seen much more in the internet. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 19:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> no need for this poor quality article when <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a> exists and is a high quality article. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am afraid this opinion is made with poor judgement. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a>, as good as it is, does not say a <b>single</b> word about the topic you want to delete. And this is reasonable: such a general topic cannot be contained in a single article. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a> must be a broad overview, with details scattered in subpages. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 19:17, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My judgement is based on the following: - there exists an article called <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a> and in this article is a section called <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html#Modern_History_of_the_Kurds" title="History of the Kurds">History_of_the_Kurds#Modern_History_of_the_Kurds</a> with a link to a main article called Modern history of the Kurds which is currently redlinked. The section in question covers the period 1828-present day. There currently isn't any reference to the two items of information in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Kurdistan_6a34.html" title="Kingdom of Kurdistan">Kingdom of Kurdistan</a> which are an attempt at independence from the British mandate which did not last long and an attempt at independence from Turkey which did not last long. These two pieces of information are part of the modern history of the Kurds and should be referenced there. An article about independence struggles in Kurdistan would have more than just two basic pieces of information and would not be called Kingdom of Kurdistan. There should in my view be an article on the modern history of Kurdistan and at most, the information presented in Kingdom of Kurdistan would be a small section within that. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 19:32, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The key words in your kind reply are "redlinked" and "should", which only confirm my opinion that the nomination for deletion was a bit of misunderstanding. You just don't delete information from wikipedia just because it should be a part of the article which <b>does not exist</b> yet. I am not in a position to evaluate the validity of the term "Kingdom of Kurdistan"; I may understand the position that if someone proclaims himself King, this does not necessarily mean that there is a "Kingdom". But this is a different issue, and again, you just <b>don't</b> delete a correct and significant information from wikipedia. We already have an article about <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Mahabad_bbfb.html" title="Republic of Mahabad">Republic of Mahabad</a>, which was just as shortlived. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 22:19, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmm.... <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Mahabad_bbfb.html" title="Republic of Mahabad">Republic of Mahabad</a> was also called kingdom of kurdistan... I for one am confused in this flood of 3 kingdoms with identical titles. Even a disambiguation page would be hard to create. Since all 3 of the kingdoms existed/ceased to exist repetively in the same time period. It is perfectly fine to explain this under a "modern hostory of kurds" rather than pathetic individual articles that cannot grow beyond stubs. Each article can hardly fill a stub.
<ul>
<li>Where was the RoM called the Kingdom of Kurdistan? Well, disambig pages are for clearing up confusion (ambiguity)!&#160;:) Again your baseless assertions that the articles can "hardly fit a stub", please prove this or refrain from reiterating it. We have huge articles on demonstrations that only lasted one day, so to say that a country or rebellion that lasted in one case 2 years and in another a number of months can't fill an article is pure propaganda. - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 09:19, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> the nomination was not a misunderstanding, when I nominated the article for deletion there was only two lines of information.

<li>Reading your all last replies I regret to reiterate that it is a misunderstanding.

<li>There is lots of problems with the content as well. Those few issues mentioned in it which qualify as historical studies must be merged into another article. For the most part, in line with others in favor of deleting the article, I think the article is simply a fabrication of history, portraying rebellions as though they were states.
