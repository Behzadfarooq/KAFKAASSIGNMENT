<li><b>Comment</b> Blogs are never a reliable source except as to what that person said. I don't think Source Watch is reliable, either, but I'm not going to delete it. Appearing on CSPAN, <i>if verified</i>, is reasonable evidence of notability, so I'd change my&#160;!vote to <b>weak keep</b> if that were confirmed, and he was actually a speaker, rather than being one of a number of interviewees. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:03, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Good point. Searching all the CSPAN websites I know of (c-span.org, www.c-spanstore.org, www.booknotes.org, www.booktv.org and www.q-and-a.org) for "Michael Rivero" got zero matches. I googled for “<tt>+"Michael Rivero" +5/15/2003</tt>” and lots of similar search strings, without finding any more mentions of a CSPAN appearance. If there was one, it's well hidden, unlike everything else about Rivero (including his repulsive anti-semetism — checking the Google hits was <i>not</i> fun). It now seems very unlikely to me that he was interviewed on CSPAN. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">(talk)</a></small> 09:22, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I found links to three different blogs, all of whom despise Rivero, who mention that he was interviewed on CSPAN in May od 2003 (15 May?) by Bill Herbert. See here: <a href="http://www.damianpenny.com/archived/000012.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.damianpenny.com/archived/000012.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:-wbBafmHxYkJ:mckinneysucks.blogspot.com/2003_05_01_mckinneysucks_archive.html+CSPAN+rivero+may+2003&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:-wbBafmHxYkJ:mckinneysucks.blogspot.com/2003_05_01_mckinneysucks_archive.html+CSPAN+rivero+may+2003&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>,<a href="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:pozRAjW28D4J:cointelprotool.blogspot.com/2003_05_01_cointelprotool_archive.html+CSPAN+rivero+herbert+2003+may&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=34" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:pozRAjW28D4J:cointelprotool.blogspot.com/2003_05_01_cointelprotool_archive.html+CSPAN+rivero+herbert+2003+may&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=34" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. These are not fans, so they have no interest in making him seem more important than he is. I think that should suffice in establishing that the program actually took place.

<ul>
<li>Yeah, I found those. Bill Herbert is the blogger at two of those blogs, not the interviewer. The third blog post is just asking "Is Bill Herbert pulling our leg?". Mr Herbert says that CSPAN broadcast <i>footage</i> of Rivero making claims. He does not say that CSPAN <i>interviewed</i> Rivero. Being shown in a report is a lot smaller claim to notability than being interviewed. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">(talk)</a></small> 00:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Thanks for pointing that out. I hadn't noticed that Bill Herbert was the author of two of three posts mentioned there. Still, the point stands that he was sure enough of having seen Rivero on CSPAN that he repeated it on two different blogs an he is no fan. So why say ithappened if it did not? Still, I am trying to locate a more authoritative source. Maybe writing to CSPAN themselves will help. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 14:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> An impressive resume, but not an indicator of notability. If he had received major media attention based off of his work on these, or an industry award, perhaps. There are far more notable effects artists who do not have articles. In fact, while <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_A._Baker_1253.html" title="Richard A.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with Rosicrurian - science fiction movies employ large teams of visual effects people, these people make important contributions to the movie to be sure but they arn't necessarily big contributions (I remember hearing that on the Star Wars prequels visual effects guys were responsible for 2 seconds of film a week). The visual effects supervisor may be notable, but an animator is no more notable than a casting supervisor or a gaffer or any of the zillions of other people whose names you see in the credits. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 17:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Makes sense and I don't believe you're applying an unfair standard either. Checking some history, I'm suprised "Whatreallyhappened.com" was deleted as advertisement, when other comparable entries exist (not arguing that one today though). On topic, a search of his name and his production company "Home Baked Entertainment" reveals claims of awards: <i>Mr. Rivero's awards credits include gold, silver, and bronze medals from the New York International Film Festivals, two Clios in graphics, the Cable Car award at the San Francisco Film Festival, an emmy nomination, and gold &amp; silver Hugos.</i>,<a href="http://www.wwmpc.com/The%20WWMPC%20Management.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wwmpc.com/The%20WWMPC%20Management.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and the Hawaii Student Film Festival site notes him as "award winning"<a href="http://www.hawaiistudentfilmfestival.org/HSFFGroup_files/VISION/PROS.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hawaiistudentfilmfestival.org/HSFFGroup_files/VISION/PROS.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, but I've been unable to verify a single one from another source. Clio site, IMDB, even the Hugo Award site which lists every (major?) award for the last 60 years doesn't have his name on it, that I could find anyway. Interesting. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></b></a> 11:32, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Interesting that you're having trouble verifying his awards - maybe he's overstating his role on his website and it was the film or the team he was part of that won the award. More generally I'd say that an award itself doesn't necessarily prove notability. In academia a Nobel Prize guarantees notability but does a <a href="../../../g/u/g/Guggenheim_Fellowship_322b.html" title="Guggenheim Fellowship">Guggenheim Fellowship</a>?

<li><b>Weak keep</b>The three sources cited above might be sufficient to establish notability, depending on whether they are more than passing references. Whatever they say about him could and should be cited in the article. His coauthorship of a book on graphics programming and multiple movie credits in his IMDB entry are also valid towards notability. If those other factors establish notability, then it is legit to mention other things that might be mentioned in any biography, like his politics or his hobbies or whatever conspiracy theories he might have.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:18, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

If he were to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards, it would more likely be for his industry work which, as is currently written in the article, is close but not quite enough.

<li>To be fair, he includes Christians in his definition of "Zionists" as well...basically, his definition would be anyone who (he feels) is deliberately trying to bring about the end times and therefore be raptured (with "Zion" being another name for paradise). Given some of the USA and Israel's actions recently (especially Israel's attack against Lebanon for the actions of a private organization who even Lebanon officially does not approve of), I'm not surprised Rivero believes that way. -<a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmiOfBrie_6b47.html" title="User:EmiOfBrie">EmiOfBrie</a> 17:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline and not Wikipedia policy. It notes that the entire concept of notability is a contentious one, and specifically says that any person who meets one of the criteria listed can be considered notable. Further, it notes in bold that even if they fail to fit any one of categories listed, that the list is not an exclusionary one. The guideline is there to help improve the NPOV and quality of articles written, and NOT to be used to raise the bar selectively against those with whose views we disagree so as to delete entries. Rivero's website www.whatreallyhappened.com has already been up for deletion twice, and was deleted on the second attempt after a very contentious debate. No doubt articles will be written on him again since he does have a cult-like following in some quarters, and constitutes part of an online phenomenon that is notable to anyone with any familiarity with alternative news sites. It would be a shame if this entry were to be deleted simply because some people find what he writes about to be beyond the pale. An online encyclopedia should make use of its unique tools and assets to challenge and expand the notion of notability, rather than work to shrink our sphere our knowledge by upholding dogmatic orthodoxies. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 14:25, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The article is about Michael Rivero and why is he notable, and it is includes the website he runs which has received mainstream media attention. While the website may not be a reliable source for other articles, it is a certainly relevant source for the article on Rivero and his website. Not to include information from the website when it is part of what is under discussion in the article is just weird. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 12:12, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
