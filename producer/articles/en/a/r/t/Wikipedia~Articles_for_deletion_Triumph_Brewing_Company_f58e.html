<li><b>Delete</b> this is a vanity page made by the owner/former owner of the company. It violates the WP:COMPANY with flying colours ("1.The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself."). Its products also fail the following requirement: "1. The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." The subject does not package its products, so they are only available locally (two locations near each other). Having a page for this company is no different than having a page for a local bakery. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 17:51, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, this place didn't win "national brewery of the year" either. I accept your point about the original author. The fact that it is basically local and does not distribute its products outside of a very limited geographic area would, if it were truly notable, not diminish it. However, since this place is not notable, it just makes it even worse. And my personal involvement: I am trying to improve the beer articles here. This, in my view, detracts from them by telling users: hey, we don't really have any standards here -- we'll write up anybody, whether they have contributed something meaningful to beer or brewing or not. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 18:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I really think that you are misunderstanding the fundamental issue of notability. "Contributing something meaningful" to a field is only one way to measure notability. "Being noticed" for good <i>or for ill</i> is another way. Google results are plentiful, the local profile seems high. In any case, the standards are enforced by consensus, not by one editor such as yourself. Take it from me -- you win some, you lose some, don't lose sleep over it. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:07, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I did a Google on "Triumph Brewery". I came up with 774 hits. In the first three pages, most were announcements by bands that they are playing there or announcements by local groups that they are having a meeting there. I also found this "unbiased" review of it by a civilian: <a href="http://www.chowhound.com/topics/337750" class="external free" title="http://www.chowhound.com/topics/337750" rel="nofollow">http://www.chowhound.com/topics/337750</a>. For comparison, I would recommend that you do the same thing for "Gordon Biersch", another brewpub. I came up with 299,000 hits. So, 775 vs. 299,000 -- doesn't that say something? You might also want to look at <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Biersch_d732.html" title="Gordon Biersch">Gordon_Biersch</a> here. Please notice that in "References" they have four <b>articles</b> and zero reviews. That is what I (and Wikipedia?) mean by "multiple non-trivial published works".</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure if you're being disingenuous or pulling a fast one here. The name isn't "Triumph Brewery", it's "Triumph Brewing Company", which garners <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=triumph.brewing.company" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=triumph.brewing.company" rel="nofollow">28,500 Google results</a>. You're also disingenous to call Gordon Biersch "another brewpub". It's a brewpub <i>chain</i> with <a href="http://www.gordonbiersch.com/restaurants/index.php?pg=location" class="external text" title="http://www.gordonbiersch.com/restaurants/index.php?pg=location" rel="nofollow">stores in twelve states</a>. As for your assertion that a review fails the "non-trivial published work" criterion, if that were the case it would be in the guideline. Reviews are used to buttress notability all the time -- explicitly so, in the case of artistic works. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 17:31, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>reply</b> Another reply to <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a>. The AfD process is a vetting process to establish evidence to decide whether the article should be kept. Any relevent references that point to the notability of this subject SHOULD BE added to the article in question. The AfD notice clearly states that the article can, and should, continue to be improved during this discussion, and any new additions can and should influence our decisions here. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 06:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I thought this process was to discuss whether the article was worth keeping, not how to improve it. As is probably pretty obvious, I am pretty new to Wikipedia (and pretty shocked at how bad many of the beer articles are!) and the article was clearly in violation of NPOV when I first read it. OK. Now I understand a little more. Now I know about the WG:COMPANY policy. As I said below, adding links to restaurant reviews of a restaurant does not in any way that I understand full-fill the requirement of "multiple non-trivial published works." The fact that there are three reviews in 11 years and that two of the three are less than positive in their opinion also speaks against the notability. Or is just the fact that a restaurant is reviewed enough to meet that requirement? I certainly hope not! <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 18:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An article is brought to AFD because an editor has a question about whether it fits. There is no requirement that the article be frozen forever -- in fact, an article being improved by its time on AFD is a very common consequence. In either case, by removal or improvement, Wikipedia benefits. Don't get overly concerned with process. As for "reviewed enough", yes, that is the requirement. We don't do it on the basis of whether the reviews were positive or negative. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:07, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Exactly what has this brewpub done of any significance that warrants an entry in an ecyclopedia? If this merits a page, then so does every other brewery in the world. Is that the purpose of an encylclopedia, to be a list of all breweries? Would an old fashioned paper work like the Encyclopedia Brittanica have devoted space to a small brewery like this? No, it wouldn't. Neither should wikipedia, if it wants to be taken seriously.Patto1ro 18:44, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>This year there were 69 classes at the GABF, with three medals awarded in each class. That's more than 200 medals for this year alone. Does every brewery that has ever won one of these medals deserve an encyclopedia page? Over 10 years how many breweries will that be? Exactly who outside of an incredibly limted area has ever heard of/been able to try the beers of this brewpub? Oh, they have 3 pubs and are expanding to four. Well that makes them a real force in the brewing world. Having an encyclopedia entry for these people is a complete joke and makes wikipedia look ridiculous.

<dd>There really isn't any need for sarcasm. I had never heard of this brewpub before this AFD, but a cursory Google search told me that <i>this one is notable</i>.

<li>If you don't mind, I will answer you here. The award they "won" are from the Great American Beer Festival. If you look at their site (GABF), you will see that Anheuser-Busch, Coors, Miller, etc. win silver and gold medals almost every year -- far more, in fact, than Triumph brewpub. In only 2005, for example, Anheuser-Busch "won" three golds, one silver and one bronze. If you know beer, you know that these companies produce what is essentially industrial swill. OK, maybe others may think it is just "bad", but the point is how can they win so many medals? I have heard from multiple American beer lovers that it is because they "sponsor" the festival and/or the organisation and the medals are awarded to them as a quid pro quo. After "buying" these medals they proudly proclaim on their site that they have won "prestigous" awards: <a href="http://www.anheuser-busch.com/press_room/2005/A-B_Honored_GABF100305.html" class="external free" title="http://www.anheuser-busch.com/press_room/2005/A-B_Honored_GABF100305.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anheuser-busch.com/press_room/2005/A-B_Honored_GABF100305.html</a>. So, what exactly is the significance of a medal from the GABF if you can "buy" it? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 18:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, assuming, for the sake of discussion, that they are awarding prizes based on sponsorship, you don't really expect them to announce this anywhere, do you? And, it's not just them -- the awards mean income to quite a few companies and it just doesn't seem to be in anyone's interest to publish openly what I've written. But, you only have to look at the facts: an organisation founded to benefit craft brewers is now awarding more medals to Anheuser-Busch than to any of the craft brewers!

If there is similarly V/RS compliant criticism of the awards, I suggest you add it to the GABF article. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 17:31, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I think you are all overlooking here is that this is a brewpub/restaurant. It is in the nature of restaurants that they will be reviewed by local media -- virtually without exception. So, showing that a particular restaurant has been reviewed is pretty meaningless -- getting bad reviews, OTOH, would be meaningful, but in a different way. What would show notability is that an <b>article</b> has been written about the restaurant -- that they have taken a new and/or different approach or that that they have done something that is perhaps in another way meaningful. There is still not a single article that provides this brewpub with "notability" -- a requirement at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 18:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As stated above, there is no such requirement. Reviews are independent, third-party sources and sufficient to establish notability. You want notability to mean something like "national prominence", but it isn't. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 17:31, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, no. If every restaurant gets reviewed, as I noted, what makes one restaurant notable over another, especially if it did not receive very good reviews?<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 16:51, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This quote, if verifiable (there's no supporting citation), would clearly get it notability in my book: "In 1993 Governor James Florio signed into law a bill legalizing brewpubs in the State of New Jersey, and the original operating name 'Victory Brewing Company' was chosen to commemorate <i>the successful legalization campaign organized and funded by Triumph's founders</i>" (emphasis added). Combine that with coverage in Philadelphia Magazine, and it passes muster at WP:COMPANY. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 02:43, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>My mistake. Apparently, I was confusing a citable page with an uncitable page.
