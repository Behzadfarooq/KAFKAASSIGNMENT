<p>Delete as completely idiosyncratic non-topic. We have no article on the <b>topic</b> of Channel 20 TV stations in the United States because being assigned to channel 20 tells you nothing intrinsic about the nature of the station. if someone had written a meaningful, sourced, encyclopedic article on "channel 20 TV stations in the United States" this list could be a section within the article. But there is no such article, because this is not an encyclopedic topic. This should be a category, not an article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:40, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just noticed that most of these lists include <i>cable channel assignments</i> mixed in with <i>broadcast channel assignments</i> without any indication of which is which, which makes it quite an intriguing intellectual puzzle to devise any plausible use for the list. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:53, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Regarding the phrase <b>most of</b>, for those that aren't, can't you just edit them so that they are?? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 02:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what you're asking, but... the articles on channels 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 say they include broadcast stations only; 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 say they include broadcast and cable; 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 are simply lists without explanation other than the title; 19 and 20 simply repeat the title without explaining whether a "channel 20 television station" means broadcast or cable channel. I am not sure how anyone could "just" edit them without individually checking every station on the list. It could be argued that the lists which only include broadcast stations are slightly more useful than the others because have some use in determining whether there is a possibility of the stations interfering with each other, but a category would do just as well. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:12, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete all</b> per nomination. These stations on each list have no significant connection with each other. For two stations in different cities to be on the same channel would only be meaningful if viewers were to carry their television sets from one city to another without being willing to change the channel on their sets when they arrive. By contrast, stations in the same geographical area have the same potential viewership, and stations with the same network affiliation broadcast many of the same programs as each other. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:14, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Someone added lists to the dis-ambiguation pages <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_2.html" title="Channel 2">Channel 2</a> through <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_6_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Channel 6 (disambiguation)">Channel 6</a>, and when I saw the lists, I moved them to list titles.</li>
<li>Later, I was hoping channels 10 through 13 were going to be created similarly, and 10 11 and 13 were created, and finally I created 12, letting CoolKatt number 99999 know it. Later, CoolKatt number 99999 started UHF. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 02:33, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I was the one who created the lists on the Channel 2-5 and 7-9 dab articles. They seem more "in place" there in my opinion - I meant it for someone in, for instance, Atlanta, who wanted info on <a href="../../../w/s/b/WSB-TV_f5c8.html" title="WSB-TV">WSB-TV</a>, and who would blindly type in "channel 2", to get a link to the article. It was only meant to be a dab list, which also explains why stations that used their cable channel in their branding were on the list (i.e. <a href="../../../w/z/v/WZVN_cbe0.html" title="WZVN">WZVN</a> would be referred to in the community more as "channel 7" than "channel 26"). As a "list" article rather than a dab page it seems less useful. I have no opinion on the deletions of the articles as they are now (hell, I'd even lean towards delete if forced to choose), but would support a merge back into the "Channel x" articles. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 02:57, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, based on your comment, if you think it makes sense to have lists at simply <b>Channel X</b> titles, it makes sense to have <b>List of channel X TV stations in the United States</b> re-direct, doesn't it?? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 02:59, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> including cable channels on some of these makes them spectacularly not useful.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. I helped add to one of them and would hate to see work lost.

<li>You're missing the point. Lists of stations in states or markets, or of network affiliates, are more notable because the bond between those stations is stronger (competition and being "sister stations" respectively) than just being on a random channel. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 21:25, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The difference is that a list of stations by affiliation or market means a lot more than just listing them by channel number. Would you call a list of stations with female news anchors whose last name begins with S "still a list of TV stations"? We've got to draw the line somewhere. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 15:44, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
