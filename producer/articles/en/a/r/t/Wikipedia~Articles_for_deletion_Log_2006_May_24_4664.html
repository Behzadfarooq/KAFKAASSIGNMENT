<p>As the author of this article, I did not intend it to be a Pulitzer winning biography, but this artist has been in Puerto Rican spotlight for many years, she is not a full scale celebrity even by Puerto Rican standarts ( those standarts are very high at the moment with artists like, Daddy Yankee, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Benicio Del Toro, Roselyn Sanches ect. ). My primary language is not english pardon my inproper usage of some words and syntax mistakes. The image is a scan from a weekly magazine this current issue is out of regulation and is about 7 years old, if another image is needed I can provide an original photography, which is purely free of any comercial attachment. Deciding if this artist is notable seems purely subjective, I had the impression this was frowned upon in this project. I did not copy paste this, most of this information I gather from magazines I currently own. My writing is being harshly scrutinized and there are many grammar errors in the posts critizising mine, I do expect we are all adults, and I can take critizism of my grammar, and syntax but there are better ways to come across without making mockering of my composition. Thank you for your time.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> If Googling something is a fair barometer for such an obviously respectable place like Wikipedia, then I die laughing. Anyways, while you're at it, try Googling "the ticket" which is the radio station that Dan McDowell broadcasts from. Hell, simply google "ticket" and see what you get. Also, email him at dan@theticket.com and ask him how his daughter pronounces the word "clock" because numerous times now, he has related over the airwaves of this broad land that his very young daughter prounounces the word "clock" as "cock". You guys have no clue what your'e talking about, and if you had any objectivity whatsoever you'd know that Dan McDowell is a prominent radio host in the fifth largest radio market in the United States. --Monosylab1k 05:55, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The free speech case is widely cited and is hardly obscure, and the nature of Grex as a creative community forum was critical in broadening the plaintiffs from groups which could be dismissed (at least politically) as primarily concerned with sex. Moreover, tens of thousands of users have participated in Grex as a free public access Unix system, a very unusual resource. The Well developed from the exactly the same software, and some of the people and ideas surrounding Grex and its predecessor, but the Well and Grex developed in significantly different directions based on a different emphasis in first principles. <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKestenbaum_5f93.html" title="User:Kestenbaum">Kestenbaum</a> 20:12, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>See Talk:Gabe Zander for all the pertinent research...This appears to be an article about a pretty non-notable musician. Zander's only chance at meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is that he's the co-founder (a claim I've not found <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFIABLE_87e0.html" title="WP:VERIFIABLE">verified</a>) of a barely-notable band, the Oi! Scouts, and he's been featured in a single article for <i>Nashville Scene</i> (which presented him as a street artist trying to break into the scene). No discography found other than 1 demo. I think the Oi!

<li><b>Comment</b> - the church is quite historic (as is the building too). What makes a church article notable or non-notable? Can people think about this before you just say delete? (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 13:27, 28 May 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li><i>How</i> is it noteworthy/historic? What separates it from the hundreds and thousands of other churches in Australia? Did something historically of note happen there? Does its hierarchy include people who have been noted in Australian national media? That's how you can start asserting notability. It's easily to say that "******* is the second largest Chinese Christian church in (choose country besides China)," but that in itself doesn't make it notable, I'm afraid. More is needed in the article. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 21:33, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>,There is no official policy on notability.

This topic does not satisfy any of the what wikipedia is not; Crystal ball is reserved for the removal of articles which speak exclusively of future events, this is an event in progress. A Google search for "man law" gives 3 of the top 10 on this subject (none wikipedia). <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 15:42, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think I disagree that it has achieved that sort of notability, and I doubt that it will. It's not even a "Make 7up Yours" at this point (which doesn't have an article). I'm not sure where the criteria for a notable advertising campaign worthy of an encyclopedia article is, but I don't believe this comes close. A google search on a not-notable topic will necessarily return results that refer to it, so I'm not sure what that proves. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 18:16, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Current ad campaign, may be remembered, may not. We remember Supds and Joe and the beef lady long after the fact.

<li><b>Keep</b>, There doesn't seem to be a need to delete it. The information is accurate (within the realm of the commercial), and verifiable. While the long-term relevance of the campaign may be in question, its existence is not. As long as the article is factual who's to say what others should or should not be able to look up on an encyclopedia where the content is entirely user supplied? Jedi697b 04:39, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - There should probably be a waiting period for articles about commercials, as its hard to tell which advertising campaigns are "important" until after the fact. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 04:45, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Wikipedia is and should be a place where people can go to find answers to their questions. After seeing the commercials on TV, I went to the man laws website to find out who these people were. The site provided some information, but not enough for me to identify those people outside of my experience. The Wikipedia entry provides further information on these people's identities that is not readily available and collected anywhere else. Thus deletion of this article effectively deprives would-be seekers of information of an easy avenue to the answers they seek. This is the purpose of Wikipedia. With no compelling argument in favor of deletion, any deletion discussion should wait until this topic has *left* popular culture (should it do so), not while it is of legitimate interest. This commercial series is unique in that it begs investigation and participation, a characteristic uncommon in advertising. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 12:53, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

People tend to come here for... anything. There is plenty of useless facts filling the wikipedia, but they are only useless until you actually want to know it. There is nothing to distinguish this from say the history of my car.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.185.165.200 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.185.165.200_e76d.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.185.165.200">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> After watching the commercial I felt the need to find more information, and wikipedia had not only the website linking to the main site but also notable information.

<li><b>Comment</b> I see lots of claims of notability, without anything to substantiate it, except perhaps Kershner's notation of news articles. Whether news articles about ad campaigns are unusual and thus establish notability, I'm not sure. (Personally I don't care for this ad campaign or any <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pale_lager.html" title="Pale lager">fizzy yellow beer</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_beer.html" title="Light beer">lite fizzy yellow beer</a>, but if notability really were established I wouldn't let that stand in the way of changing my recommendation.) <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 23:06, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Per the unreliable google test: "Man Laws" gave 3 of the top 10 five days ago, now it gives 8 of the top 10. The Man Laws website has received thousands of submitted man laws and has approved just over a hundred of them <a href="http://www.manlaws.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.manlaws.com" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. This interaction with the fans of the commercials is demonstrative of yet another reason why this article has continued merit. What separates this commercial series from the rest of the pack, granting notability and merit includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>An ensemble cast of celebrities appealing to a wide demographic.</li>
<li>Interactivity with the audience through the '<a href="../../../w/a/t/Watercooler_show.html" title="Watercooler show">watercooler</a>' concept as well as the official website.</li>
<li>A dissociation from the product akin to the <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco_Bell_chihuahua_7a06.html" title="Taco Bell chihuahua">Taco Bell chihuahua</a>, the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budweiser_Frogs_d296.html" title="Budweiser Frogs">Budweiser Frogs</a>, the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energizer_Bunny_00c5.html" title="Energizer Bunny">Energizer Bunny</a> and the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburglar.html" title="Hamburglar">Hamburglar</a>.</li>

<li><b>Query</b> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a>, in what way does this article not satisfy the definition of notable?: "A topic has notability if it is known outside a narrow interest group or constituency". Quite clearly, the commercial series prevalance on TV with a substantive 'cast', coupled with cast members on late night talk shows, news articles, blog activity and watercooler behavior establishes a wide interest group. As this is my first AfD, I am not sufficiently familiar with the Wikipedia usage of notability as a criteria to be certain that my interpretation equates that of the community as a whole. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 19:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> i know several offenders of manlaws, and to me it is a very emotional subject.--Mattfoley 01:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> AFAIK blog activity counts for little or nothing and I'm not sure what watercooler activity you're referring to. Users posting in the AfD that they discuss this commercial at the watercooler definitely doesn't count for anything. A newspaper article in which it is reported that there is a lot of watercooler talk about this campaign might count for something (though I would suspect a slow news day and a lazy reporter working from a Miller Lite press release). Celebrities in a commercial is not unusual. The late night talk show appearances and news articles might be getting somewhere, as I wrote above, but again I'm not so sure that's unusual for a commercial either. There are any number of longer-running commercial campaigns that I can think of that don't have articles: Make 7 Up Yours, 1-800-CALL-ATT, the Old Navy Commercials, etc. (and which I'm not sure should have articles either) which to some degree makes me think this one shouldn't either. Can it be proven to be exceptionally popular (or unpopular), can it be proven to have been exceptionally successful (or unsuccessful), has it won any awards, has it been spoofed, etc.? An article for Tastes Great, Less Filling would make sense, since that campaign's notability can be easily established. Man Law, however: not now and not anytime soon, I suspect. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 22:35, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for the explanation. Obviously we have material disagreements on the notability of this topic, but your comments lead me to a better understanding of your perspective on the matter and the usage of the term notable within the Wikipedia community. My primary contention on the difference between the ad campaigns you cite and this one is that this satisfies both a dissociation of product (similar to the other Wikipedia articles cited previously) and interactivity (create / talk about man laws). These two characteristics cause the audience to have questions and comments about the commercial series and not the product. The result of this is that Wikipedia can represent a place where information on the commercial can be collected and presented concisely and for which that information has a substantive audience, as demonstrated by the many 'keeps' noted above. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 01:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

My vote is <b>delete</b> solely on principle. I think the NYU article should have persisted since they were around before the USC sorority and it has the potential to be a useful article for women wanting to join sororities at NYU. Regardless, the NYU article was deleted on the grounds that the sorority was not notable on the national level. Likewise, the USC sorority is no more national than any other sorority or fraternity with just one chapter.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The main reason that search results within Google do not turn up very significantly more "hits" is that most of the medical literature on the web is available only through an https (secure protocol) or otherwise requires log-in with a password to access relevant articles. This is typical of professional medical literature on the web. Indeed the New England Journal of Medicine search result appears to have come up only because of a meta-tag embedded in that particular page. The relevant aritlce itself is not available without payment of a subscription fee and logging into the secured portion of their database... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 15:13, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So are you saying that if I went up to any doctor and asked them what Hickam's Dictum was a notable percentage of doctors should be able to tell me what it is? Notability has nothing to do with what it is, as say a balancing point for Occam's Razor. Notability would have to do in this case then, how notable it is within the medical community. How many people are at least familiar with what it is. While it may have been cited in three different journals, unless its actually notable inside the medical community it falls under only being notable to a small group, and according to wikipedia that qualifies as non-notable. As it is, from the google search its quite obvious the public at large likely has no idea what Hickam's Dictum is. I haven't seen the citations from the three journals, so I can't tell if they're major or minor citations, how often it was cited, and what the context for the citation was. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:46, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Reply: I am asserting that physicians as a class are increasingly aware of this term in professional discourse with one another. Yes, a very significant number of physicians will have heard of this principle today, and a competent physician will tend to immediately understand its significance in diagnostic methodology. The original statement, a combination of tongue-in-cheek with extreme seriousness, appears to be "People can have as many diseases as they <i>damn-well</i> please." It serves as a counterbalance to the standard concepts of Occam's razor and "Osler's rule" (commonly stated as "One disease to a patient", named after the late 19th Century physician <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Osler_1c34.html" title="William Osler">William Osler</a>)... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 19:26, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine then. All I was looking for was notability. When I asked for a source of notability on the article page, you removed the prod and told me to go through the deletion process which I did. Having never heard of this and with no real information or sign of notability resulting from google, it wouldn't be the first time someone tried to push a theory on here that wans't notable. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:43, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually then, thats a vote against notability. Its not a particular abstract theory. If people aren't referring to it by name and actually calling it that, then its not notable. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:47, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In fact Occam's razor and an extreme version called Osler's Rule (often casually stated as "one disease to a patient") are standard in the medical lexicon of the 20th Century. Occam's razor is an oft misunderstood principle, because it does <i>not</i> demand that every diagnosis be reduced to a single disease involving the simplest possible qualities and quantities. Rather, it demands <i>all</i> possible diagnoses (hypotheses) that explain all the symptoms be considered, shaving away any unnecessary elements in the hypothesis — which may well still leave multiple possible diagnoses remaining under consideration while investigating further. It is a conceptual <i>razor</i>, not a hatchet; but because of the extreme variants such as Osler's rule and other misunderstandings of the principle, counterbalancing principles such as Hickam's dictum have become necessary to keep excessive "reductionism" in check. The balance being: "As simple as possible (in keeping with all of the complexities of the situation), but no simpler than necessary to solve the problems". ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 15:12, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>JA: I said only that "I don't remember hearing [it] under this exact name", and though that may speak only to my memory, cog.sci folks can tell you that people in general are better at remembering the gist of information content than they are remembering the incidentals of a particular syntactic utterance. Plus, I know all sorts of heuristics and theorems and stuff that have different names in engineering or psychology than they do in mathematics. And then, of course, others have already testified to the eponymous Dr. Hickam being immortalized in reputable sources. If you review the pages on <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Ockham_3735.html" title="William of Ockham">William of Ockham</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/k/Ockham%27s_razor.html" title="Ockham's razor">Ockham's razor</a>, you will note that it is customary practice in this area to attribute a historical accumulation of interpretations, and even the sediment of subsequent syntax to the legendary harbinger of a distinctive idea, even when these glosses and not a small measure of pure shine have yet to be found among his or her works, but are only asserted to share its spirit. Funny though, I do remember the <i>damn well</i> part, and will insist on its being restored for the sake of idiomatic accuracy. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 11:16, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I am now concerned that OrangePeel is engaged in some deliberately disruptive editing. He has removed all comments on his talk page regarding a number of other problems his editing has generated. His edits, at least at first glance, seem to focus on recategorizing various articles that relate to erotica or commercial sexual activity. I don't know if he is actually causing real problems or not but perhaps an admin might want to take a look at the pattern of strange edits and stranger replies he has left on other user's pages.

<dd><b>Reply</b> The page certainly <i>is</i> quite different at this time. Looks like a disambiguation page.

<dd>As far as I know, it can not be a dab page since it is an article rather then a list of links to articles about the various forms of Full Service. I'd also add that if you look at the links to the articlem they are not about sex but mostly about broadcasting. I did not include broadcasting since I'm not sure what the term means in this case. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 23:33, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bogus sociological article about sex among the elderly. When asked for references to this neologism, response has been to put up a citation to scholarly journal -- as if sociologist would use a boy's junior-high phrase -- and to slap a "vandalism" warning on my talk page. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:32, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The phrase is used because that's what the elderly themselves use. The only thing I put on your talk page was a request to explain why my reference wasn't good enough.

<dd>I have already provided a scholarly, peer-reviewed source for the use of that phrase.

As well, searching Google for "Prune tang" will provide amble evidence of the phrase's use.</dd>
<dd>I never claimed your requesting verification was rude. However, the snide, sarcastic remarks you used to request verification was rude. The way you accused me of editing your talk page to add a vandalism warning was rude (since, afterall, placing something like that on the page of someone so obviously committed to fighting vandalism as yourself would be farcical). The way you abrasively refused to clarify why you had a problem with my reference was rude. The way you put the article on AfD right after I explained to you in polite, civil words exactly how the paper was relevant was rude. I'm very new to Wikipedia, and I feel you're unfairly bullying me. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBongout_63d7.html" title="User:Bongout">Bongout</a> 09:01, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Asking you to back up your bogus-sounding claim with actual evidence and bringing it to wider attention when you refuse: <i>very</i> nasty behavior, ennit? But if your claims about this article -- and this word -- are true, you ought to <i>welcome</i> the attention, where you can prove the veracity of your claims and show me up by actual demonstration (instead of off-topic complaining). I'm asking you to prove a claim: if that makes me rude, then that means you're dealing with an army of Grinches here, since simple verifiability is a bedrock principle of Wikipedia. Don't like it?

<li>It's oddly unsurprising that when I phone the University of Tirana (+355 4 228402), the lady there has no record of this journal.

<li>What's more surprising is that in your user page, where, by the way, you say you enjoy obscure topics, you make no mention of knowing Albanian. The University of Tirana is a big institution, and do you really expect a mere receptionist at a general inquiry number to know of every publication at the university? It's more likely that some combination of the following interfered: a) communications difficulties; b) ignorance; c) disinterest in helping a foreign national, Albania still being one of the most insular countries on the Continent; and d) unluckiness. I have a copy of the journal, so it does exist. If people are unable to contact the publisher, I am willing to mail the journal to someone trusted who will verify that it does indeed exist. However, I really don't think we will have to resort to that. I am confident the publisher can be contacted. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBongout_63d7.html" title="User:Bongout">Bongout</a> 10:56, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't speak Albanian: the person I spoke to spoke English (and, by the way, they don't deserve your series of cultural stereotypes - they were lovely).

<dd>I see you recommended deletion of ABC as well so you clearly have an agenda here. It was decided to keep that article so why are we having the same debate again? As I pointed out FORL clearly has significant influence in Parliament, having the patronage of at least 6 MPs. How many other pressure groups have this? Chances of success are high - several traditional counties have already been restored and FORL's aims were endorsed by the local government commission in 1994 (you clearly haven't read the article). <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELancsalot_6485.html" title="User:Lancsalot">Lancsalot</a> 09:23, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Got a better guideline? I'm open to suggestions. Here's the part that is relevant "<i>The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</i>". Now substitute "company" for "pressure group", and it works great. We can't follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policies, unless this requirement is met. We shouldn't delete all pressure group articles. We should delete all ones lacking potential for verifiability and neutrality. Now, you claimed "<i>It has widespread popular support and is frequently mentioned in the media</i>". Care to provide those sources in the article? If they exist, that should be easy for you to do. I'm not sure why you dislike <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>'s application. It's actually a stunningly low threshold to meet. No need for popularity, success, influence, fame, notoriety, or anything like that. Just substantive coverage from multiple independent reliable sources.

<dd>Multiple non-trivial published mentions? See above. Verifiability? This group certainly exist, and their views have been considered by decision-makers. Notability? They are certainly notable enough for the councils in question to consider, and this is the important measure of a pressure group's notability (but notwithstanding the media mentions above). Neutral point of view? That's a question for the article-writers; articles are not deleted because they are POV; they are discussed and re-written until they are NPOV.

<li>In that case we should keep it in some form. I'm bothered by the amount of effort that could involve. A version would be difficult because it is frankly not stable. I'd actually support reverting to Tearlach's original version, I don't think there is great improvement since. I do wonder if a change of title, so that this quackery is dealt with within the frame of an article on people who pay to have their bottoms washed out, what the colon actually does etc. Perhaps putting "fraud" in the title eg Mucoid plaque (health fraud) (or even Health fraud (mucoid plaque) might actually reduce the conceptual problem, and reduce the appearance of reality it gets via Google and answers.com and so on.

<li><b>Keep.</b> This "condition" is mentioned every night on multiple television networks via infomercials. The people perpetrating this lie are making it up in order to make a quick buck, and consumers need to have some source of truth. Wikipedia entries rate highly in search engines, and this article may educate some otherwise ignorant consumers. Not a real medical condition, but that doesn't stop the con-men trying to push their "colon cleansing" products. I can't watch late night TV without seeing this scam. Besides, we have seperate articles on phrenology, homeopathy, and dozens of other health scams.</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> If anyone else feels there is merit in it, please also consider adding Dataworks Plus to this nomination. Although it is not as blatant as the above, it still seems suspiciously like self-promotion, not to mention that it includes cross-promotion of Veripic as well.

<li><b>Comment 2:</b> While we're at it, <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Photo_Management_0f41.html" title="Digital Photo Management">Digital Photo Management</a> seems to be an article almost exclusively about SQL database storage of digital photos (needless to say, also mentioning Veripic along the way), whereas a <a href="http://www.google.co.za/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&amp;q=%22digital+photo+management%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.za/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&amp;q=%22digital+photo+management%22" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> of the term brings up more generic things like photo album software.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This hotel does exist. It is fairly old. It has, as far as I know, played an important role in the life of Melbourne. It needs someone who has access to sources in Melbourne and who knows what to look for to improve the article.

<dd>Update: I've added what little I know, but I don't have an encyclopaedic knowledge of Melbourne's older pubs. The Oxford is very popular and certainly notable in Melbourne; not in Young and Jackson's league but probably in the top ten.

<dd><i>From Talk:New Simplified Bible:</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I am requesting that this article is deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li>This article is, I believe, merely advertisment</li>
<li>Despite the large size, I believe that most of the content (always written without a signon) was by the author of the translation; if this were not the case I doubt that the article would even exist. There are many things which make me suspect that: edits always done anonymously, huge content on something really non-notable, the wikipedia edits usually contain "according to the author...", when I added a list of critiscims of the translation in the article the rebuttal appeared on the authors site and links were added to the rebuttals within the wikipedia article.</li>
<li>This translation (despite the author having laboured for many hours on it), is non-notable. It has never been published and never looks likely to be notable.</li>
<li>It was already deleted previously and has been recreated</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be thought that I have something against the translation since I have put a large amount of effort into the article describing why I believe the translation is a bad translation, but I fully support articles on <i>notable</i> bad translations, such as the Jehovah's Witness official translation, but I do <i>not</i> support articles on extremely <i>non-notable</i> translations, and whether it is a good or bad translation is irrelevant. In someways it makes me sad if my "criticisms of the translation" part of this article go (which I think is a good rebuttal of the translation errors made), but the real problem with this article is that it is just self-promotion. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrusselsshrek_6689.html" title="User:Brusselsshrek">Brusselsshrek</a> 11:02, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Don't know if there are any other notability guidelines for this, but it isn't like new electronically distributed Bible translations are threatening to fill the encyclopedia with translation-cruft.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As I mentioned in the introduction to this AfD request I did extensive work on this article during which I became highly suspicious that ALL the other content which was added anonymously was done by the author of the translation themself. It is difficult to convey to you without a great deal of work how just how much it seemed that I was writing some sort or information in the "Criticisms of the translation" section, and all of a sudden, under an anonymous edit, there would be a rebuttal written in an encyclopedic style of the type "According to the author...blah...blah...blah". An example of this sort of very suspicious style of editing:</li>

<li>If you think this is actually the author of the translation doing some self-promotion, then take a look at the further edits done at the same session by the anonymous 4.228.204.115 or for example the suspiciously similar IP address 4.228.204.206.</li>

<p>This article does not describe a traditional or widespread Buddhist practice, but is the invention of one person; it is unverifiable (all mentions on the web point back to this article) and there is no evidence that anyone actually uses it. This makes it a subject which is too trivial for Wikipedia. The username of the person who created this article is also verifiably linked to that of the stated author of the text <a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com/evachinoy" class="external autonumber" title="http://profiles.yahoo.com/evachinoy" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, suggesting that this is a vanity project.

<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
The only argument in this deletion debate was notability. Those in favour of deletion raised the argument that the article did not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (an argument made without qualification), and an argument that card players generally are not worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. Conversely, <a href="../../../i/d/a/User%7EIdahoEv_a81d.html" title="User:IdahoEv">IdahoEv</a> made a comprehensive argument about the subject's notability and prominence within his field.<br />
In my opinion, the "keep" argument was by far the most persuasive and outweighed the limited and weak arguments raised in favour of deletion.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Zvi was extremely well known for developing format-breaking decks that exploited card interactions; After having read a book on deck design circa 2001, he was for several years the <i>only</i> pro player of the game I could name from memory. His play and contributions probably affected the design of the game more than any other single player, as he demonstrated more than once how cards dismissed as <b>unplayable</b> were in fact game-dominating when correctly understood (one example discussed <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr5" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr5" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>).

<p>... for those who consider articles such as this merely "fanboyish", or don't consider the game to be a "sport".</p>
<p>Magic is played by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and played professionally by tens of thousands. The Magic professionnal world championship has been held annually since 1994. Individual events have prize purses over $200k, the Pro Tour's annual purse is $240k, and the top pros have lifetime winnings well in excess of $300k.</p>
<p>Magic has all the trappings of a smallish professional sport: thousands of professional players, television coverage, player sponsorships, large prize purses, an <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duelists%27_Convocation_International_a2b4.html" title="Duelists' Convocation International">international governing body</a>, trade publications in both print and electronic media, and a Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Magic should be considered the same as any other professional game/sport played for money, such as Chess, Poker, or Pool, and as such its important, famous, or influential players are eligible for inclusion. Given that many other games with professional competitions are treated like sports WRT <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (Wikipedia contains entire pages just for lists <a href="../../../g/o/_/Go_players.html" title="Go players">Go_players</a> and Poker Players, for example), Magic should be no different. It is certainly newer than many other professional games, and perhaps attracts types of players some would consider "fanboys", but those facts on their own shouldn't constitute a basis for not treating it seriously as a professional sport. I would also note that there is significant and growing overlap between professional Magic and professional Poker; a number of Magic's top players are also professional Poker players, including <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Keller_%28card_player%29_ac5b.html" title="Thomas Keller (card player)">Thomas Keller</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah_Boeken_4f90.html" title="Noah Boeken">Noah_Boeken</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Finkel_e67f.html" title="Jon Finkel">Jon_Finkel</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Williams_%28card_player%29_98ff.html" title="David Williams (card player)">David Williams</a></p>
<p>As an international game, players like Zvi are visible to a wider audience than the typical US college sports player.</p>
<p>Phrases like these (<i>"professional magic card player. I mean, really!"</i> and <i>"obscure non-notable fancruft"</i>) expose a fair amount of personal bias about what constitutes a legitimate sport.</p>
<p>Zvi in particular may not have won as much as some of the others, but was probably more influential on the game's evolution than any other single player. <a href="../../../i/d/a/User%7EIdahoEv_a81d.html" title="User:IdahoEv">IdahoEv</a> 18:51, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree that as written it is a memorial and not an encylopedia entry. For instance, "lovely" wife would have to go (although I have no doubt about that fact myself), as well as the many obit-like items. IOW, a major rewrite is needed to transform what is currenly an obit into a proper WP entry. But being a publisher, actor, WWII pilot and co-composer of a famous song sung by troops everywhere with a monument for the song, assuming all properly sourced, IMO merits a <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> entry, certainly under the "WP is not paper" policy. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:10, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Revert</b> to redirect. If the gun M21 is sometimes known as "Springfield M21" even mistakenly, it is worth a redirect. The target article should mention this. Now, if it <i>isn't</i> a remotely common term, then none of this holds. A search for "Springfield M21" returns a number of gun sales sites that appear to sell a gun looking an awful lot like the one at <a href="../../../m/2/1/M21_%28rifle%29.html" title="M21 (rifle)">M21 (rifle)</a>, so that would seem to support my point.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Aren't there any <s>gun nuts</s> firearms enthusiasts on wikipedia? After looking around wikipedia and the web, I will withdraw the nomination, in favor of some rewriting and disambiguation. It seems that the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield_Armory_01f8.html" title="Springfield Armory">Springfield Armory</a>, a US Gov't operation, manufactured the <a href="../../../m/1/4/M14_Rifle_3ac1.html" title="M14 Rifle">M14 Rifle</a>, which was converted to the <a href="../../../m/2/1/M21_%28rifle%29.html" title="M21 (rifle)">M21 (rifle)</a> by the Rock Island Arsenal in the 1960s. Meanwhile, a private gun manufacturer bought the Springfield name and now operates as <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield_Armory%2C_Inc._cb25.html" title="Springfield Armory, Inc.">Springfield Armory, Inc.</a> which does sell a model M21, although I can't tell if it is the same design and specs as the government model (I'm sure its at least close). I think there needs to be some disambiguation between models made by and for the military versus models made by the new private company for private use. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:55, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> (Note that they could be viewed as a competitor of my employer, I'd comment instead of voting delete, but I don't think that bias should count against a keep vote.) While the initial references to their notability in the last AfD were at the company's web site, the cited sources in the article are press articles. (The company site versions are not press releases, they are images of the cited articles.) At least the second appears to me to include research the company would not likely have included in its press releases. The first does look like a repackaged press release. As I said last AfD round in a comment, it appears to pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> point 1. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:15, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Later comment. I've tried more research. I'm not sure this can get beyond being a short stub other than by being built on the Arabic wikipedia and then translated to here. There just aren't many English language references to them, and most of those aren't good enough sources - either reprints of press releases or one line directory entries. It looks like most of their product releases are, or at least were 10 years ago, to make available in Arabic language versions of software widely available in English language versions.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. This is difficult, as the book does appear to be self-published and we routinely delete such works unless they are exceptional (usually self-publication indicates some problem persuading anyone <i>else</i> to publish it). However, the AfD for the book itself is not going to be a delete (I shall close it momentarily unless beaten to it) and this one is rather much on the edge of where we begin to consider deletion, particularly taking into account the preceding PROD/etc. So I think perhaps what should happen is a simple redirect to the book, which I will go and apply. This is an editorial decision, however, so it is reversible. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:49, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The closest thing to a truly verifiable claim of notability is his published book. Its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006RSUCC" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006RSUCC" rel="nofollow">Amazon listing</a> shows the publisher as Brooks D. Kubik himself, and the one and only used copy available is listed at almost a hundred bucks, suggesting that the print run was likely quite small. I've looked up self-published stuff on Amazon before and I'm often astonished by how many used copies there are. Although I'd be happy to be convinced otherwise, this looks like a self-published work with a very small print run, and so I vote to delete. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:12, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Though self-published as far as I know, the book is (still) fairly widely available from multiple sources on the web. For example: <a href="http://www.functionalhandstrength.com/Dinosaur_training.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.functionalhandstrength.com/Dinosaur_training.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>, <a href="http://www.atomicathletic.com/store/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=BK52" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atomicathletic.com/store/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=BK52" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>, <a href="http://www6.mailordercentral.com/ironmind/prodinfo.asp?number=1276" class="external autonumber" title="http://www6.mailordercentral.com/ironmind/prodinfo.asp?number=1276" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>. There are also a number of reviews of the book available on-line for those who look for them. Besides the book, Kubik has also been a regular contributor to several strength training publications (<i>Hardgainer</i>, <i>Milo</i>, <i>Iron Master</i>). <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 00:14, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per Dsreyn. Mr. Kubik does seem to be somewhat known in strength building circles as far as I can tell. I'm afraid of deleting him simply because he doesn't appear notable to people not in the field. His book and contributions to strength training publications ot me makes him pessibly worth keeping. But frankly, I'd feel more confortable if some weight training folks were voting on this. --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELendorien_d245.html" title="User:Lendorien">Lendorien</a> 01:54, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not sure exactly what kind of "weight training folks" you're looking for, but I count as one if you mean someone who's a serious weight trainer and reads some of the magazines (subscribe to <i>Milo</i>, subscribed to <i>Hardgainer</i> until it stopped publishing). <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 02:28, 26 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, what's the last time "Milo" had an article about Dinosaur Training in it, and what did it have to say about it? That's the sort of thing I'm getting at. Ditto the other magazines. Which magazines have him on the masthead as contributing editor? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 10:00, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as not meeting the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dinosaur_Training_fbc2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dinosaur Training">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dinosaur Training</a> for some miscellaneous Googling. I personally gave <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur_Training_93d9.html" title="Dinosaur Training">Dinosaur Training</a> itself a very weak "keep" vote, because Ironman magazine published a book on strength training with a substantial chapter by Kubik on dinosaur training, but one chapter in a print book by a "real" publisher plus one self-published out-of-print book does not add up to a notable author, and a handful of brief mentions by other strength training authors does not, IMHO, make him notable either. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:03, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: There is no valid reason to delete this article. The man is a widely enough published author, and has a following and affiliation with other authors and fitness websites on the internet. The sources of information are irrelevant, all claims are made reflecting the claims made by Kubik as opinion or statements of his practise by him, and not as facts. Furthermore, this is an article meant for expansion, and should be kept up for that purpose. All of you change your votes, they're ridiculous. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 21:29, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>; in my estimation fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think the following from <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a> is worth keeping in mind while voting:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>An article is "important" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true:</b></dd>
<dd><b>1. There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community).</b></dd>
<dd>Kubik may not have general appeal to the masses, but he is definitely well-known and of interest to those in the weight-training community. Seems like there's something wrong when there's room for an article on <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Methane_1b61.html" title="Mr. Methane">Mr. Methane</a> but not a legitimate, well-published writer like Kubik. <a href="../../../f/b/b/User%7EFbb_fan_c791.html" title="User:Fbb fan">fbb_fan</a> 00:06, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think a self-published book and a few magazine articles constitute a "well-published" author. Anyone can write and pay for a book to be printed up; there is no evidence that it ever sold any copies at all. The three magazines in which he is supposed to have published articles are not particularly well-known; I've never seen them at a newsstand or bookstore, even those that carry all sorts of body-building and fitness magazines. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 02:12, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's more than "a few magazine articles". He was a regular columnist (as in, every issue had an article by him) for Hardgainer for several years, before he broke away to start his own newsletter, and was also a regular columnist for Iron Master. I agree that these are not common newsstand magazines; that does not mean that they are unknown in the community (incidentally, that complaint could also be used to discredit the notability of people in academic fields who are widely published in academic journals). Regarding your statement about the book, "there is no evidence that it ever sold any copies at all", do you *really* think the companies that are still selling it (I posted links to three previously) have never sold a single copy? I found the following statement at <a href="http://www.functionalhandstrength.com/Dinosaur_training.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.functionalhandstrength.com/Dinosaur_training.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> (not Kubik's site), roughly halfway down the page:
<dl>
<dd>In 1998, Dinosaur Training became even bigger...literally. When it came time for the second printing, Brooks added two additional chapters.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So if there was a second printing, could we agree that it is quite likely that the first printing sold out? <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 02:33, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>, bordering on "No result". This is an AfD of the worst kind where two or three editors simply continue a debate they were already having without getting any much input from anyone else. This isn't helped at all by the descent into namecalling, bold and capitals at the end. This debate is not very useful for determining any kind of outcome, does not lean clearly in the direction of a delete, and anyway the previous AfD is much more sane and useful. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, there used to be an article on wikipedia for TheSmartMarks.com and it was since removed, presumably because it is a web site and that is all. It is not fair for a web site such as that to have its entry be removed from Wikipedia and this one to remain. TheSmartMarks reaches a FAR FAR FAR broader community as it is one of the most frequented message boards in the pop culture world. It even got its own official poker line recently (<a href="http://thesmartmarks.com/partypoker" class="external free" title="http://thesmartmarks.com/partypoker" rel="nofollow">http://thesmartmarks.com/partypoker</a>).

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Where's the articles for WrestlingObserver.com? PWTorch.com? The article itself is not exactly written from a neutral POV. It makes a small comment Lance Storm made out as if it was something that stirred up the entire <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a>, when in reality it was so minor the fact that its spotlighted is a joke. The day Lance Storm "goes to war" against DVDR (as is indicated by "DVDR vs. Lance Storm") is the day the Internet's existence should just end...</dd>

<dd>Even furthermore, SirFozzie, it is not fair for you to criticize me for trying to supposedly add comment after comment when just a few days ago you were editing my user page relentlessly to remove hostile comments you made a few weeks ago (such as "Don't know why I'm helping you since you decided since you weren't going to have your way with the article"---I've since reverted the page to the version it was before you removed those comments).</dd>

<dd>Again, I worked with you through several revisions on the talk pages of DVDVR and our talk pages to find a statement that would fit your request and reamin NPOV. The reason why I reverted my copying of how to list the article for deletion, is because if you look at the bottom of your talk page, the categories "Articles: Listed for Deletion"? Was trying to do you a favor because it was my fault that your page was so listed. If there are other such noteable communities.. why doesn't someone write them.. I'm not familiar enough with the sites to do it justice. (Resigning this since I can, thanks Bix) 24.62.82.234 20:45, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sir Fozzie - there are other notable communities (such as TSM) and someone did write an article on that but for some reason it was taken down. I also think that Kchase02 was right initially in that there isn't any evidence of any mainstream credibility for DVDR. <b>The point is that its not fair for one site's entry on Wikipedia to be removed while another one is still kept even though they have similar statistics.</b></p>
<p><b>The reason why I reverted my copying of how to list the article for deletion, is because if you look at the bottom of your talk page, the categories "Articles: Listed for Deletion"?</b> - That sentence doesn't make sense gramatically so I dunno what you mean. <a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB</a> 00:29, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: What constitutes "mainstream credibility"? There are many entries for independent wrestlers and promotions on Wikipedia which are less well known than DVDVR, should they be deleted as well?

<li><b>Comment</b> The mere FACT that Lance Storm has had a real life feud with this website because of its work-rate top 500 rankings should be more than adequate to show DVDVR belongs on Wiki. There are VERY obscure entries on VERY obscure artists, musicians, people etc that NO ONE outside their respective genre's would recognize, yet their articles stand. This whole AfD is the product of a few disgruntled users who were booted off the board, and whose names I will NOT mention here..though i will say one of them has a VERY uncivil remark on his User Page about DVDVR that Wiki, in its usual double-standard admin action theory, has YET to erase.</li>

<dd>How dare I? I dare because it's the truth. Remember this comment, you posted to my talk page? "Yes, we definitely do need to come to some kind of concensus or else we're gonna continue trading edits. It is not "unbias" to argue that the public perception of DVDR has drastically deteriorated over the past two years. Prominent message boards such as TheSmartMarks.com, CZWFans, ROHWrestling.com and many others have seen an influx of threads hating on DVDR. Just a few weeks ago there was a 2 or 3 page CZWFans thread where poster after poster after poster criticized the "Naziism" of the DVDR crew. Now obviously "naziism" is a stretch, but its not a stretch to say the general opinion of the board has very much changed for the negative as of late.

<p>First of all, the term seems like a neologism. It describs the competition between the next generation consoles, or perports to, but mostly it's just a comparison between them so far. Seems like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a how-to guide or soapbox.

<li><b>Delete</b>, unnecessary article with a bad title ('battle of the consoles' is not so much a neologism as a generic term applied to many generations of consoles).

<li><b>Delete</b> "Battle of the Consoles"? People called NES vs Master System (and SNES vs Megadrive) "console wars", IIRC, but that doesn't mean we need to call the article that because it wasn't widespread enough. Certainly not a new idea, but we're not in the business of pushing neologisms unless people <i>actually</i> use them all the time, and they're not referring to any specific consoles anyway, just the ordinary competition between the market leaders. Plus, the article is pretty awful as it stands, PoV-pushing and pretty silly arguments too ("GTA first"? "Halo 3"? <i>Oh please...</i>) Calling this "original research" will make crank scientists enraged to have their work compared to this. And the PS3 "info" bit looks and smells like a copyvio to boot. Please put this travesty out of its misery. It smelleth, truly, verily not of roses, but promoteth growth it not. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>The "bit of info on the PS3" belongs in another article, and the article itself offers a negligible amount of information. It is also riddled with an incredible amount of non-encyclopedic uses. Furthermore, "Battle of the consoles" fetches only 700 links on Google (although I believe this is a fairly widespread term, and almost all of the links on Google relate to this topic)--also, a copyrighted image.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 01:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:46, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nowhere in this article does it say what exactly BSS is. (Searching Wikipedia for BSS - perhaps Bishop Strachan School, in Toronto).

<li><b>Delete</b> He has a tv show/infomercial in the Bay Area, he's definitely not tall and handsome. He's short, fat, balding, and has downright freaky sideburns. Frequently dresses like the godfather gone bad. Is incredibly arrogant, he once bragged to an old lady that he had more money than her simply because she questioned one of his stock opinions. Most of what he says on the show is just copied from other news sources. His own advice is basic and amateurish, he once said buy air conditioning stocks because of global warming. Contradicts himself all the time, he says dont try to time the market but then he also says try to buy on dips and sell on spikes.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, this song appears to serve as a segue on the album. The transitionary piece may be notable as part of the structure to the whole album. Normally in favor of songs having their own articles, but would also not be opposed to seeing this one merged into the article for <a href="../../../1/0/%2C/10%2C000_Days_1ce8.html" title="10,000 Days">10,000 Days</a>.

<li><b>Response</b> - if it is only notable in context of the album as you say, it then seems best that any verifiable content should be moved over to the <a href="../../../1/0/%2C/10%2C000_Days_1ce8.html" title="10,000 Days">10,000 Days</a> article. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 00:55, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Absolutely not notable enough for its own article. It's not a hit single- in fact, it's an instrumental piece, so it will never be a single. The song has no other significance outside of the album, and as such, it doesn't need a separate page. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 01:16, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
