<li>Well, here we go again... my vote is <b>delete</b>. The article does not establish any notability for this school, a <i>very</i> small boarding school for elementary and middle school children. A grand total of 175 total and 71 unique Google hits for "Belhaven Hill School", so it doesn't seem as if many people know or care about it. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 00:15, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you follow your own rationale and apply the proposed notability guidelines given in the nomination, you will find that this school is notable. It makes no sense to assert that schools should be subject to notability criteria, and then not to apply the notability criteria that are actually right in front of one. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>When it comes to schools discussions, many editors appear to be stuck in a groove, repeating the same arguments again and again. A lot of these arguments are wrong. "All X schools are notable."/"All X schools are not notable." are both wrong. Notability is not a blanket. "This school seems notable/non-notable to me." is wrong. Notability is not a subjective judgement made by Wikipedia editors. "This school is unimportant."/"This school is important to its pupils." are wrong. Notability is neither fame nor importance.
<p>The new <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> proposal embodies the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a>, namely that the subject be the subject of multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the subject or its owners/creators. This is the notability criterion that first appeared in limited form in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> at least two years ago and that has been generalized to published works in all forms. In its general form it appeared in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and the effect has been to shift the focus of discussion of company articles. Two years ago editors would be giving their <i>personal opinions</i> of how "famous" or "well-known" or "important" a company is, or centring the discussion around the author of the article. Now, as a direct consequence of WP:CORP, editors far more often go looking for books, news articles, magazine feature articles, reports, and the like (i.e. sources), and are basing their rationales upon the extents and natures of those sources. <i>Finding, reading, and evaluating sources is the proper study of encyclopaedists.</i> It seems like a good idea for the schools debate to shift away from the "stuck record" arguments towards looking at sources, too. If WP:CORP did it for companies, WP:SCHOOL should do it for schools.</p>
<p>Therefore I am applying the proposed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria, in particular the primary criterion, to this school. Looking for non-trivial published works, I find, in amongst all of the mere directory entries like <a href="http://www.axcis.co.uk/18533.html" class="external text" title="http://www.axcis.co.uk/18533.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.schoolreviews.co.uk/school.php?s=578" class="external text" title="http://www.schoolreviews.co.uk/school.php?s=578" rel="nofollow">this one</a> (which is content-free!), and a few works whose source is the school itself, a lengthy published report by an inspectorate independent of the school, and a followup report, both cited above. The first is <i>definitely</i> not a mere directory entry, and it appears likely from its length that the second is not, either. The primary criterion is thus satisfied. <b>Keep</b>.</p>
<p>Notice that the above rationale does not rely upon fame, importance, significance, personal opinion of a Wikipedia editor, or blanket statements in either direction; but relies solely upon the primary notability criterion and looking at sources and what they contain. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just so you are aware, the reports you cited are from government inspections which take place from time to time for <i>all</i> Scottish schools. If they are deemed satisfactory evidence of the school's notability, then that means that all Scottish schools are <i>de facto</i> notable.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 03:20, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The first paragraph of the inspection says that it was part of a "sample" of primary schools, not that it was part of a global inspection of every primary school. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:20, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If this was a <b>random</b> sample, then it confers no special status on the school i.e. these schools are no more or less notable than any other Scottish schools. If it was not random, then the selection criteria are presumably published and become an input to the notability evaluation. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 12:18, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sampling in these inspections is not random, but is rather systematic so that over a time period each and every school is inspected, but in any given year a reasonable spread (primarily geographical) is chosen. See <a href="http://www.hmie.gov.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.hmie.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education</a>. If you look around that site you will find reports for pretty much every school. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 20:32, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete —</b> I'm not sure that an inspection report from the government makes a school any more notable, unless the criteria for ordering such reports are the same as WP's notability criteria (and I doubt this). <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 02:35, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as a directory entry.

Besides, you can probably find an inspection report on any school in Great Britain, as the inspection is probably required to make then. Hence, the would mean all schools should stay, which is not in the spirt of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. Moreover, I don't see this particular school meet any of the other criteria. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 02:59, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the school concerned exist for all schools in the U.K., then having articles on all schools in the U.K. is <i>very much</i> in the spirit of WP:SCHOOL. The spirit of WP:SCHOOL is having enough source information to construct more than a entry that would be a directory entry in a directory of schools. i.e. the spirit of WP:SCHOOL is <i>not to construct a directory of schools</i>. Read the introductory paragraphs of WP:SCHOOL and <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a>. It is clear that there is enough source material here to construct an article that is more than a directory entry in a directory of schools.

<ul>
<li>WP:CORP has the same primary criterion as WP:SCHOOL. It passes WP:SCHOOL, as described above, therefore it passes WP:CORP as well. Government inspection reports (or, at least, <i>these</i> government inspection reports — please <i>read</i> them) are non-trivial published works, the same as any other. Discounting sources simply because they are produced by government agencies is wrongheaded. Sources should be discounted either because they are unreliable (i.e. they come from the school itself) or because they are trivial (i.e. they constitute no more than simple directory entries). These sources are neither. (I gave examples of trivial sources that <i>are</i> discounted, for contrast.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:20, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's irrelevant. No-one is writing articles about the reports, or even attempting to make a directory of reports. This is an article about a school, not about a report.

<li>They <i>are</i> in the spirit of the guideline, as pointed out above. Please take the opportunity that is being handed to you to get off the "stuck record" arguments about "all X are notable/non-notable" that have bogged editors down for so long and concentrate upon finding, citing, and evaluating sources, <i>which is what we are supposed to be doing as encyclopaedists</i>. If you have objections to source material for an encyclopaedia article that are two detailed reports on the subject created and published by someone wholly independent of the subject, please state what those objections to the source material at hand are. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:27, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I can't recall that I've made in a notable/non-notable school argument for weeks. However, <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> is a notability guideline in whatever way you look at it, just like <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, ... Hence, if you feel that inspection reports are valid in establishing notability, then we should throw <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> out of the window now, forbid AfD'ing schools, and speedily close all currently running AfDs on schools, as you will be able to find an inspection report on every school currently in wikipedia and every school that will be added in the future. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 01:18, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also a question to Uncle G: have you actually read the Inspection reports? You simply can't base an encyclopedic article on them that goes beyond stub level: they simply state that the parents and inspection were satisified with the school performance a few years back. Moreover, the school was chosen at random as stated at the beginning of <a href="http://www.hmie.gov.uk/documents/inspection/5582636BelhavenHill(S&amp;Q).html" class="external text" title="http://www.hmie.gov.uk/documents/inspection/5582636BelhavenHill(S&amp;Q).html" rel="nofollow">this report</a>, which could imply that we have now to include a random sample of British schools based on erradic behavious of Her Majesty's school inspectors.

<li><b>Delete</b>: The school is irrelevant: the article establishes nothing except that one of the students has access to Wikipedia. The article cites no sources, it provides us with no history, no discussion of the school. The article is more about the headmaster than about the school, and yet that topic is a distraction. The potential article on this subject leads only to a possibility for putting this on the Requested Articles list. There are hundreds of thousands of <i>potential</i> articles, but we have to assess the one that has been written, and it fails our guidelines in this case. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:40, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I like the fact that we are striving to get more than "notable" involved, but applying criticisms of the subject of the article is limited. They will tell us only what could conceivably be written. Almost every day we have speedy deletions of sentence fragment "articles" under G1, even if they managed to pretend to be about something significant. Nor is this "clean up is no rationale for deletion" because this is not a question of cleaning up but rather a complete rewrite. Consider the speedy deletion criterion of A7: "makes no claim for notability." Again, it isn't "isn't notable" but "makes no claim": an article on a band that says "Talking Heads is a band that broke up in the '80's and they were really cool" would be an A7 candidate despite the fact that, of course, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talking_Heads_1ab7.html" title="Talking Heads">Talking Heads</a> was a seminal group. This particular article doesn't give us as reviewers much to work with. Now, we, as reviewers, can go off and do research on our own, but that has already put the onus on us to write the article.

<li><b>Question</b> So let me get this straight- it is being argued that all schools that are inspected (that is, every school in the UK), is notable because you can cite the inspection documents? I am not a crusader against schools entrys- if historical details/ unique method/ a particularly notable place in the community show that the school is more of note than just any school, then fine, let it be in wikipedia. But a report, whilst verifying the <i>existance</i> of the school, in no way verifies the <i>notability</i> of the school. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 20:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>There are <b>no</b> guidelines or policies about notability for schools, nor are there any general guidelines or policies on notability as a criterion for deletion.

There is not now, nor has there ever been any <i>need</i> for deletion on grounds of notability, and in many fields (math, science, engineering) it would be quickly recognised as inappropriate.

<li>Well, I know of articles that are deleted by consensus in other fields (e.g. football (soccer), where I'm a member of the wikiproject) purely on the grounds that the subject does not meet a pre-agreed and consistently applied standard of notability.

<dd><b>comment</b> Is verifiability the only criteria that determines whether something gets it own article? I can easily verify that I am alive. Does that make me eligible to have an article written on myself? No, it doesn't. I was under the impression that notability is a fairly important criteria when evaluating the existance of an article. Sure, a couple of sources do show that this school exists. It is verifiable. Does that make it important enough to warrant its own article? No. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> guidelines, although still a proposal, should be used to determine whether it should have its own article, and the sources that Uncle G cites I would consider to be <b>trivial</b> sources of Scottish schools. If every school must undergo an inspection and is listed on these reports, then following Uncle G's interpretation of the guidelines, all Scottish school's should have an article. What if the Scottish government did not have these documents posted online? Also, I am not familiar with the organization of Scottish schools, but are they run independently or does the Scottish government control them? It seems to me that a government agency that is responsible for regulation of Scottish Schools means that this agency is not completely independent of the article's subject. Are there any other non-trivial sources regarding this school? This thinking is not logical. It is obvious that this debate is still being discussed and consensus has not been met. Many still fail to see how this article meets the criteria.
