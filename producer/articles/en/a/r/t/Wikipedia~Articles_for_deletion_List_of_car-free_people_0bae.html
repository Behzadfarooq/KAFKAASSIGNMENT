<dd><b>Comment</b>: People on the list would be making the same choice as New Yorkers, they just have different motivations. It's also easier for famous people, as they are often wealthy enough to fly, be driven around or rent cars for short-term use, so they are not giving up much. Both groups have circumstances that allow them to not own a car, which is impossible or at least an enormous burden in many areas. Also, while most New Yorkers, and other people without cars, probably don't have a car for practical or economic reasons, it is likely that a significant percentage do not own a car for ethical reasons. It's also strange to pick a single issue like this. I don't see how it is much different from a list of people who recycle or compost, except that they are more widespread. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:11, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's not at all analagous to people who recycle, as recycling is not a deliberate departure from an ingrained social norm, whereas veganism is much more analagous (which is why I keep citing it) because, like choosing to live car-free, it is a lifestyle change that departs from a very dominant, entrenched culture and is arguably difficult (and therefore notable when accomplished) for that very reason. I believe <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_vegans.html" title="List of vegans">List of vegans</a> is a directly analagous precedent and if it is allowed to stay then List of car-free people should also be allowed. thoreaubred 07:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I started with the two very notable figures I knew for sure and had time to find sources for, and hoped that other people would expand the list in the future, as I would as well. I'm adding people as we speak. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_vegans.html" title="List of vegans">List of vegans</a> requires verifiability yet has steadily grown over time.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Since when are articles deleted based on empty speculation about whether they will be verifiable? Leave verification to the editors of the article. So far I've added five names to this list and used a solid source for each one, and held off adding any I'm pretty sure of but haven't yet found a source for. There are many articles about which one could make the speculation you're making, but that bridge should be crossed when it is come to, it should not be the basis for deleting an article. thoreaubred 06:51, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> And that is bad-faith rhetoric. How can you proclaim that an article's verifications will be based on empty speculation when every name added to the list so far has cited a reputable source, and when so many other lists of this kind exist and also contain verification by reputable sources? What is the point of making such slanderous declarations, such as that an article's verification "will be based on empty speculation", an empty statement that could be said about any and every article? Come on, stop being disingenuous and insulting anyone reading this discussion with such hollow rhetoric. thoreaubred 08:11, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Though the list in question is a list of people making a lifestyle choice, not a political one, there are lists on Wikipedia of notable people in countless political parties, philosophies, or movements, from Democrats to Fascists to Pacifists. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_belief.html" title="List of people by belief">List of people by belief</a> and the category Lists of People By Ideology which includes lists ranging from Neo-Nazis to Transhumanists to Ethcisits to Conscienscious Objectors.

<dd>Actually, "bad faith" would be misusing terms like "bad faith", divorcing it from its real meaning in an attempt to use it as a content-free insult. Bad faith would be the annoyingly common logical fallacy of taking legitimate but vaguely related articles -- lists regarding deep personal beliefs, philosophical underpinnings, and reasons for historical importance important to understanding the life stories of individuals -- and attempting to compare and align one's personal pet cause with them, a form of intellectual-burnishment-by-association (or perhaps cargo-cultism). Bad faith would be asking ludicrously broad and essentially unanswerable rhetorical questions to avoid confronting the obvious flaws raised by debate. Bad faith would be the general trend of trying to justify what amounts to propaganda with endless browbeating of anyone who opposes you. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 22:30, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your dishonest, hypocritical rhetoric is exasperating. People like you are the reason that serious people are abandoning Wikipedia every day, because they're tired of having to defend every new article against an onslaught of overzealous rule-fetishists wielding empty, shamelessly dishonest rhetoric and talking points like that which you have displayed. I give up, because trying to maintain a debate in the face of such dishonesty is too exhausting. I was wondering at what point I would finally give up on Wikipedia (like so many others) and I think this is it. (Not that your comments make up the bulk of those on this page, but they sum up the worst it, and the worst of the level of debate on Wikipedia in general.) thoreaubred 07:14, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, and the bad-faith hits just keep on coming! Bad faith would be the use of empty and hyperbolic adjectives to add meaning where there is none ("dishonest"? What have I lied about? "hypocritical"? Which of my principles -- stated or otherwise -- have I violated?). Bad faith would be making apocalyptic and unprovable statements about the consequences of, well, telling you that you're wrong. Bad faith would be ham-handed attempts at guilt-tripping. Bad faith would be the temper-tantruming of "do what I say or I'll take my ball and go home!" If the list in question demonstrates the level of contribution you'd bring to Wikipedia and if this AfD demonstrates the level of discourse you'd bring to discussions of edits -- well, Sunny Jim, I'd say, "Sorry, and don't let the doorknob bang you on the ass on the way out." --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:33, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This once-interesting site is becoming more and more over-moderated and ruled by mobs of groupthinkers who can't be bothered to actually listen to a logical argument if it conflicts with their preconceived fetish for misguided, bad-faith deletions and edits and any other applicable acts of belligerence based on misinterpretations of already inconsistent and contradictory policies and guidelines and other such rule-porn for failed librarians. It's gonna come to point where everyone who once took a serious interest in Wikipedia regards it as a joke and the only people left participating in it are the same gangs of heavy-handed overmoderators who dominate "discussions" like this one with blind regurgitations of weak, rhetorical wikilogisms like "listcruft" and "unmaintainable" and all the other fun little phrases with which you decorate this formidable e-fortress, all the while warning, in one of your many guidelines and policies, against neologisms. thoreaubred 08:58, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I live in the bucolic backwater of Tokyo, Japan: is that a "car-dominated society"? More to the point, however, is your telling use of the adjective "our": so which car-dominated society would that be, and why does your particular brand of provincialism trump the international focus of this encyclopedia? And where is the rationale for Wikipedia being some sort of engine of social change for "our" "car-dominated" society (however you're defining those two terms)? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:24, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

For my part, I am desperately unimpressed with the impassioned speeches about how we're a bunch of deletionist fascists for failing to see encyclopedic merit in a list that, as has accurately been pointed out, includes most of the people in the world, for reasons as disparate as economic, lifestyle choice, moral or simply that they're underage - <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakota_Fanning_ad4d.html" title="Dakota Fanning">Dakota Fanning</a> must be car-free, if you think about it. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 23:46, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> And I'm unimpressed (though perhaps not desperately) by people who put words in others' mouths, as you are the first person to mention "fascists". Perhaps you should look that word up. What I called people was heavy-handed overmoderators, mobs, gangs, groupthinkers, belligerent, misguided, failed librarians, rule-fetishists, and so on, as well as implying either illiteracy or simply a conscious choice not to bother reading the logical arguments that have already precluded many of their fallacious, disingenuous points. I never called anyone a fascist. thoreaubred 07:39, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

Therefore, being fed up and just about done with Wikipedia, I would rather have the satisfaction of violating its two reasonable policies than its 50 ridiculous ones (the latter is done effortlessly be being a serious, sincere user of the site; only the former can be done deliberately). As for your second comment, I don't make any "common error" (I'm so impressed with all the wikimavens around here talking about the "common errors" and "common fallacies" that must plague anyone who dares to disagree with <i>them</i>.) Actually, I base the <i>observation</i> (not presumption) that people aren't listening to my arguments on the fact that every so-called argument they offer up has already been precluded by mine. It's not that they're disagreeing with me--actually it's exactly that they're <i>not</i> disagreeing with me, as they are mindlessly repeating reasons that I have already demonstrated to be invalid. Disagreeing with me would require rebutting even one of the several strong arguments I've made for my case, and no one here has done that. Oh wait, why did I type all that, it's not like you're gonna bother <i>reading</i> it or giving it the slightest bit of thought, as I'm just making the <i>common error</i> of disagreeing with you. thoreaubred 10:31, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>So there are 6 'noteworthy people', out of the 6.5 billion in the world , who don't drive cars? Utter tosh! Even more laughable, out of this 6, 17% don't have an entry in Wikipedia, so are hardly 'noteworthy'. I rather suspect this article is trying to make a political point (&amp; a very parochial one at that, I note the 5 people with their own entries are all assocaited with the USA). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 07:45, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You should realize that anyone can edit articles at wikipedia. Therefore, in answer to your questions: (i) add more people to the list if you feel that six is not enough; (ii) remove entries for people you do not consider "noteworthy"; (iii) add non-American names in order to fight the cultural bias that you seem to sense in this list.
