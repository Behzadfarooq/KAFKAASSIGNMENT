<li><b>Blank and Rewrite</b>. The text is incorrect. According to several websites turned up through Google, Mithridaticum is a concotion made from dozens of different poisons designed to enhance the body's immunity to said poisons. I believe that competent research would make this a very interesting article. As it now stands, this seems like an advert for someone marketing something by the name of Mithridaticum. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=Mithridaticum&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;hl=en|Google" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=Mithridaticum&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;hl=en|Google" rel="nofollow">Google Book search on Mithridaticum</a> <a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArviragus_e034.html" title="User:Arviragus">Arviragus</a> 00:41, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Hold your horses guys, which ones of you spent time to research this? First of all I'd like to point out that this is a latin word. Second I'd like to point out that anything non-english is hard to come by on the internet, trust me. Third, don't jump to conclusions and assume good faith. Now to the important part, there's two significant sources I was able to find, one is from about.com (from those of you who dont know, about hires experts to write on subtopics), here's the link: <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_quiz_053100.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_quiz_053100.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Am I the only one who noticed the misspelling of "theorem" (which might explain the lack of Google hits)? Anyway, a Google search for "Two Kierkegaards" reveals one cite: <i>Philosophy Today</i> volume 16 (Winter 1972), pages 113-122. So it's not completely unheard of, although it certainly seems nonnotable enough to be deleted. I'm abstaining from the vote, though. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 19:09, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I tend to think this is a fairly well crafted hoax, as they seem to have chosen this phrase specifically in such a way that some superficially plausible Google results would turn up.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>: Non-notable band. Released a bunch of demos and EPs but only finally released a full-length in 2003 (the article says it's their debut).

<li>Just saw this little note. From my experience, if there's any semblance of a discography in an article - and there was a lengthy one full of EPs in this case - admins refuse to do a speedy saying there's an assertion of notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This band is nowhere close to an A7 speedy. The fact that everyone is voting that way demonstrates how misguided the criteria really is. Furthermore, those who claim a band needs to have won a grammy or had chart hits to merit an article are setting the bar at a level that goes well beyond the spirit of the band guidelines. Vote based on any standards you want, but the pack mentality displayed above is frankly scary and does a severe disservice to our music coverage here.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 15:52, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Take a look at <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/browseL.php?l=C" class="external free" title="http://www.metal-archives.com/browseL.php?l=C" rel="nofollow">http://www.metal-archives.com/browseL.php?l=C</a>. If we followed your criteria, every single one of those bands would be in Wikipedia! And that's just the ones starting with C! Do you seriously think it would fit Wikipedia standards to have almost <b>twenty</b> bands whose names relate to Cremation, <b>eight</b> bands named <i>Cabal</i>, etc., etc. (even <i>Chapel of Ghouls</i> is taken twice!)? Even die-hard black metal fans would start looking elsewhere for actual useful info. Recording studios aren't interested in them enough to make a full-length album, most heavy metal reviewers aren't interested in them enough to even listen to their EPs — but you expect the general Wikipedia public to be interested?! That type of reasoning is why CSD A7 had to be created in the first place. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:17, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Even "Cerberus" has eight bands listed including three just from the US. So, for every scary mythological figure, we'd have eight adjoining articles for some band that used it for a band name.

<li><b>Comment</b>. A Finnish band that has been around for this long, that has music available through Amazon and that headlined in at least seven countries in the last three months is not a speedy. Afd is there for a reason. It is not a formality and is meant to be a vehicle for achieving consensus. It provides a timeframe for editors who actually know something about the group (unlike anyone here) to add new info or improve the contents. Having a bunch of editors scream speedy A7 without providing any serious reasoning does nothing to reach consensus in this case and denigrates the entire process.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 16:36, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Their own website says "Our Debut album... will be released on spring 2006". That's all the "serious reasoning" necessary in my opinion. Even they admit they've never released an album. Hard to get less notable. My cousin from Maine released an album in 1982 so I guess I'll create an article for him. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:54, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Your opinion has been clear from the beginning. However, I reiterate, this is not a speedy. You proved that yourself when you checked their website. Had the article not asserted "notability" you would not have needed to check anything. Otherwise, while an upcoming album release is one factor in considering inclusion, the past history of your Maine cousin hardly seems relevant unless he/she is now a member of Archgoat. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:33, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't understand the question below. However, a quick check on newsbank shows the term has been in use for at least 6 years and is cited by major news organizations worldwide.

If you want, you can write a paragraph in the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellington.html" title="Wellington">Wellington</a> article about this term of endearment by the local conservatives. My home town of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver%2C_Washington_85bd.html" title="Vancouver, Washington">Vancouver, Washington</a> is called "The Couve" as a perjorative, but that doesn't merit an article. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Ruby</a> 03:41, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The term has plenty of circulation within New Zealand (not just by the "local conservatives" of Wellington), and is notable enough in its own right for an article, especially regarding its origins. "The Couve" isn't a neologism anyway - it's clearly an abbreviation of "Vancouver". If there were notable circumstances surrounding its origin or usage (like there are with Helengrad), then it would deserve an article.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - First off, the name exists and has been a notable feature of New Zealand political life, notable enough in my opinion to have a place in Wikipedia (so I did something about it, providing informative external links). Second off, check the page history: this page was created <i>after</i> Election Day - so this page was "obviously created" to influence voters who had already cast their votes over a month prior. Third off, if you have an issue with the political neutrality of the article, then edit it yourself and bring it into line with NPOV.

<li><b>Response from the publisher</b> From James Piggot, Admin of StupidChildren.com (the host site of "That Darn Chauncey")</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Hi&#160;!</dd>
<dd>We recieved a request yesterday from a fan, who asked if he could put up a Wiki article for us; we said sure. After reviewing the article, we saw it was marked for deletion, and thought we'd weigh in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, we would argue that "That Darn Chauncey" is NOT a "non-notable webcomic" TDC has appeared daily at StupidChildren.com for over a year and a half, with over 250 different episodes. It is true that our book has a "none" sales rank on Amazon, but if "Dragonfiend" had examined the Amazon listing more closely, he might have noticed that the book DOESN'T GO ONSALE until Feb. 14, 2006. We "did" have a pre-sale on our main site, and sold several hundred copies. We hope to do even better, after our public release in three weeks (at Wondercon)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for our Alexa rank, well, we don't think much of a ranking system that only counts people who have a certain toolbar installed (which is why we stopped advertising with AdBrite) Seriously, what does Alexa tell you&#160;? How many people read the comic, or how many comment on the message boards about unrelated things&#160;? We could do tons of things to get more "hits" (no message board for us) -- but we're not interested in inflating BS stats.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We prefer to go by our own internal stats; last year, we had over 200,000 unique visitors, with a significant return rate (we would note that the article stated TDC has having 100,000 readers a day; that is incorrect, and we have edited the article accordingly) I don't know why google doesn't show more hits linking to us. Right now, I can see links to three message boards today alone, which are talking about us; google doesn't show them, either. Furthermore, StupidChildren.com is not the subject of the article. TDC is, and I'd say that a webcomic with over 250 episodes, a regular readership, and an upcoming 112 page BOOK is not trivial (by comparison, RED MEAT has been in existence for ten years, and only has about 500 strips -- we'll have more this time next year)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, let's look at what Wikipedia says about "notable content"</dd>
<dd>1) "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." -- Just yesterday, our comic was mentioned in "Digital Strips" - a podcast which reviews webcomics (with over 100 shows) As we get closer to the release of our new book, we're hoping for significantly more press. Also, the cartoon has been mentioned on litterally hundreds of LiveJournals, MySpace accounts, Message Boards, etc.</dd>
<dd>2) "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." -- TDC has appeared in several issues of Zoinks! magazine, including the upcoming issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Among people that talk about webcomics, we "are" known, and getting better known all the time. One of the coolest things that occasionally happens to us is when someone sees the comic and says "Hey, I've that&#160;!"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having said all that, I personally don't care if we get deleted or not. I like Wikipedia; I use it all the time. I think we became "notable" when we came out with our first book (and got strangers to part with their hard-earned cash to buy it) We get press. We appear in print publications. People talk about us. I didn't write the article for Wiki, but I certainly don't think we should be deleted by people just because "they" don't like the comic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's not the criteria for Wikipedia, is it&#160;?</dd>
</dl>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Pete Ellis Dodge, Long Beach Freeway, Firestone exit, Southgate. (Sometimes it was Bellflower.) No one who ever heard this jingle, over the at least 30 years it's been running, ever forgot it; I'm certain that you could find several million people in the greater Los Angeles basin who could sing it for you. I'm inclined to find that degree of fame to be noteworthy. -Ikkyu2 06:53, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I originally thought to not list this for deletion, as you'll see by my disclaimer at the top of the page in question. I was thinking more along the lines of a rewrite, but as (aeropagitica) said, "it is very hard to pick any meaningful information out of the text." I agree, thus why I listed it for deletion. But if Last Malthusian is willing to rewrite the article, I'd probably be interested in unlisting it for deletion. — <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <small><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Talk to me!</a></small> 20:49, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Perhaps some of the Wikipedia users here could offer evidence why it is only "Google" search engine results that prove the authenticity of a particular cause. Are any of those here currently arguing for deletion familiar with any of the issues associated with this matter? On what basis do you feel your desire to delete this page is valid? Are any of you involved with the Cirque Intelligence Service? This page was created out of a desire to establish information for others about a legitimate organization. How can those unfamiliar with the security risks of Israel and of the desire to protect and encourage the rights of Quebec offer any sort of opinion on the matter. How in fact do any of the users contributing to this discussion feel empowered enough to make decision regarding this matter? Are you in fact francophones? Those of you that indicate that any desire to protect Israel or the rights of francophones as a 'hoax' is disturbing. 134.117.181.53 08:01, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - Seven Mile Road runs all the way across Detroit, through many different areas, and is not the identity of any distinct neighborhood.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have rewritten this and removed the references to a single act of violence that formed the bulk of the text.

<li>If this is kept it should probably be moved to Seven Mile Road with redirects from 7 Mile, 7 mile, and 7 Mile Road. <a href="../../../t/m/s/User%7ETMS63112_ebc1.html" title="User:TMS63112">TMS63112</a> 20:01, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article still refers to "the area" identified by Seven Mile Road. But there is no such "area" -- it slices completely across the city, through many different areas with wildly different characteristics. Yes, most of them are predominantly African American, but so is almost all of Detroit. It's like making a generalization about "the area" along the 39th parallel in the U.S., including Newark, Columbus, Kansas City, Denver, and San Francisco, and all the territory in between. It's hard to imagine any generalizations about that "area" that wouldn't apply pretty well to the U.S. as a whole.

<li>Yes, and it also extends into the western suburbs of Detroit, which are very different from the neighborhoods in Detroit that it cuts through. The artilce probably needs editing by someone more familiar with Detroit than I am (I've been there once) but I see how this could be a decent article, with links to the neighborhoods and suburbs that the road runs through. But I live 700 miles away and I know the road, so I consider it notable <a href="../../../t/m/s/User%7ETMS63112_ebc1.html" title="User:TMS63112">TMS63112</a> 16:24, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sure, I can see how it could be a decent article, assuming that other at least equally noteworthy streets typically have articles. I haven't looked yet, but what about, say, Woodward Avenue or Brush Street in Detroit? Beale Street in Memphis? Peachtree Street in Atlanta? State Street or "The Magnificent Mile" in Chicago? Fifth Avenue in NYC? Summit Boulevard in St. Paul? Bourbon Street in New Orleans? Each of those have a lot of cultural/historical significance, mentioned in book titles, song lyrics, known to people who have never been to those cities, etc. <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKestenbaum_5f93.html" title="User:Kestenbaum">Kestenbaum</a> 21:37, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my view, the A7 expansion has worked out quite well. AFD is no longer crawling with garage band stubs. However, in this case I'm certainly guilty of taking a poorly written stub at face value.

It doesn't hurt a thing for people to be able to see these acts on AfD - it invariably helps improve the articles to reach notability.

<dd>I certainly see your point and by no means do I think there's no risk of human error. But would it not be nice if all users (authors) would take the time to look at the policies and guidelines relating to their subjects before they post articles? That would definitely help eliminate most of the bad taggings. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 17:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I said in my RfA that I would be extremely conservative in deleting per nn-band; I always double check, at the very least on allmusic and Amazon, and I think I might have deleted maybe one or two, and those beyond any shadow of doubt. I have untagged as including an assertion of notability far more than I have myself tagged as nn-band. Not everyone is so careful, partly because we trust people to do a check before tagging. But in the end if a band is speedied because of a really bad article which completely fails to let on how important they are, it's really not that big a deal - someone will be along soon with a better one. Of course, that does rely on admins checking db-repost carefully to make sure the content really is similar, and where it is not, untagging. That mop comes with a long stick with which to beat us. Ah well. But in the end, nn-band is a <i>good</i> thing. We really were getting garage bands at the rate of dozens a day sometimes. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 23:04, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course, when you have an AfD template and a CSD template, it's not easy to see what was deleted so we can make sure the article is an improvement, even in an initial stub size. God forbid we have to go through a deletion process to see if perhaps the people creating garage band articles were not aware of our notability standards, and if the community can actually clean them up. A bit snappy at the newbies, perhaps? I don't know, but when an article like this (and it's not the first and won't be the last) is tagged nn-band incorrectly, the chances of losing the article without many people knowing are greater, and hurts the WP as a result. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 13:28, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Losing a potentially legitimate article that way is unfortunate, but as JzG noted, a truly notable subject will find its way back. I think that's a pretty fair assumption. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 14:43, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And that we're to the point where we can say "Hey, let's speedy notable articles if we can't gleam notability at a glance, because they'll just come back anyway" shows that we're in a sadder state here than we might be willing to admit. If we spent less time attempting to speedy articles that might be nn and took that time to establish notability, we'd probably be better off, but I'm in a clear minority on that one. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 14:47, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not how I meant it at all - now you've lost me. I for one do not feel that carefree about it, despite my error in judgement on this one. I can see where you're coming from on this, but speedy deletion is a necessary "evil", if you will. Unless you think going through piles of garbage in AFD, or during a random article browse, is a good thing. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 15:30, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's why I recognize I'm in the minority - I see it as a very good thing for the encyclopedia. It's doubled as a sort of article review in many cases, and that only improves the encyclopedia. Speedying articles willy-nilly because they don't appear to be notable at first glance and because it's easier to throw a tag on than research it isn't an "evil" we should be accepting.

If it's something that looks more notable than it should be, is it difficult to take a few seconds and hop on Google to verify the articles, and perhaps actually add to them. The A7 expansion encourages lazy voting and denies those of us who might actually want to improve the article an opportunity to work with an already-established article as opposed to starting from scratch and possibly having someone speedy the recreation again out of turn.

<p>Sorry about deleting the deletion comment, I was filling the followup while the comment was added.

<p>Even ignoring the POV title, this list is a hopeless stub. There are only 5 Communist states in the world right now, and the likelihood that The Revolution will suddenly erupt and create a hundred more is rather slim.

<p>- This is not slang. If I wrote an article called <b>blow job</b>, this is slang for fellatio. There is no proper term for a sperm burp. If you know of a proper term for sperm burp, please share it, and I will gladly rewrite. - In defense of neologism, I would point out there are lots of subjects and terms on Wikipedia that fall under this category. At what point do we judge the <b>newness</b> of a term to no longer be <b>new</b>? - Personal opinions about the character and suitability are not descriminating factors in deletion. There are many articles on Wikipedia that could be offensive to people. - I did consider merging this article into burp, but I felt it should be kept seperate because of its sexual nature.</p>

<li>He's the head of the largest studio of the largest independet videogame company in the US. He's written million plus selling games, and made substantial contributions to the craft of games. The bio is pretty short, but it is not innaccurate.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I did a little bit of research on this one, and it seems like Mr. Mika and <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backbone_Entertainment_059d.html" title="Backbone Entertainment">Backbone Entertainment</a> are very much on the way up. However, this guy is the head of a studio of a division of a company who's <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_9_Entertainment_85d5.html" title="Foundation 9 Entertainment">own page</a> kind of admits that it's far from the biggest thing in video games. (I'm a moderate fan of video games and I'd never heard of "Foundation 9 Entertainment".)

<dd>Alright, allow me to rephrase. Let me just make it clear that I am <b>not</b> proposing to delete <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campus_14.html" title="Campus 14">Campus 14</a>. What I want to know is whether people have a general objection to articles about bar crawls, as <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> and others have said above, or whether it is something specific to the <a href="../../../o/t/l/Otley_Run_3bf0.html" title="Otley Run">Otley Run</a>, that merits it being deleted. I do not believe that the % of "trivia" content is a valid reason for deleting an article; the test for inclusion should be whether the article has <i>potential</i> to be encyclopaedic. This is what I would like to ascertain. Lan3y 00:39, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ahh, sorry I misunderstood. Well, I guess my position's already clear - I think these entries can be encyclopaedic. I think the notability or otherwise of something like this is a matter of POV. For those interested in drink culture in different towns it could be notable, for interested in student culture in Leeds it could be notable. For a pensioner in New York, it's not likely to be notable! <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamse_7b30.html" title="User:Jamse">Jamse</a> 01:14, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>The Otley Run exists and has a reputation among British students as one of the best pub crawls in Britain. It has been mentioned by the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/articles/2005/12/05/student_diaries_william_200512_feature.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/articles/2005/12/05/student_diaries_william_200512_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>. I have added <a href="http://www.interstudent.co.uk/displayarticle507.html" class="external text" title="http://www.interstudent.co.uk/displayarticle507.html" rel="nofollow">a link</a> to the main Pub Crawl page which provides a decent article. There are 870 hits on Google for the Otley Run. I am unclear on the reasons for deletion, unless there is a concern here for saving space. This is not a Pub Crawl that someone has invented and placed on Wiki; it is a famous Pub Crawl. Should the listing be changed from Deletion to Cleanup? I am new here so am unsure of the reasons for article deletion. I have read the deletion policy, but fail to see that this article qualifies for deletion, though can see a reason for Cleanup. Unless a stronger explanation can be given for deletion then I vote to keep. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 21:46, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

If we're going to delete this article then <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campus_14.html" title="Campus 14">Campus 14</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_Pub_Crawl_692c.html" title="Monopoly Pub Crawl">Monopoly Pub Crawl</a> should be deleted aswell. So to save the article, it should be expanded to include as much info as the other pub crawl pages, and also cleaned up (trivia section removed or reduced?) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarry_m_4eeb.html" title="User:Barry m">Barry m</a> 18:27, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, Expand &amp; Clean-up</b> - Im one of the people who edited this article and had created the Trivia section. I am quite a newbie to wikipedia and I believe the Otley Run article should be kept because it is such a coherent part of student culture in Leeds. I am a student myself in Leeds and it has always been a popular excursion. However I agree the article should be tidied up and also expanded to include history of this crawl. Alternatively it could possibly be merged with a possible article on the <a href="../../../a/6/6/A660_road.html" title="A660 road">A660 road</a> if this article were to be made in the future considering that the majority of public houses on this route lie adjacent to this road.--Wrh1973 19:49, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm actually going to list a bunch of Orbitercruft here... someone's gone to the trouble of making an article for every ship and place in the game, even the ones that exist in real life, and those for which there's really nothing encyclopedia-worthy to be said beyond inclusion in a list in the main article. We can't have articles for every fictional thing, so I'm going to be listing most of Category:Orbiter_(sim) and redirecting them all to a single main entry for orbiter stuff. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 10:00, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Before you go through the trouble, I can already tell the result: merge and keep redirects (because it is required under GFDL). So, <i>I think</i> you can just go ahead and merge all crufts.

I tagged three as speedy (those aren't here) because they were only external links, but the two API articles are just a couple of sentences each. It's kind of sad to see that someone put so much work into these, but this info just belongs in the manual or on a site specific to the game.

<li><b>Keep</b> there is a need for it, the wxBasic language is extremly usefull and easy to learn and when coupled with the SDL library it creates a powerfull MULTIPLATFORM engine (the main use of this is for creation of games, and the MULTIPLATFORM is a major improvment on wxBasic) the language also includes a IDE for devlopment that works on macos, linux and windows. This is a MAJOR improvment on wxBasic and it does need to be a new language. I have fixed the problem with creating subpages, by hosting the examples on my website. <a href="../../../r/4/0/User%7ER4000_304f.html" title="User:R4000">R4000</a> 22:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I nominated this article because firstly it contains unverified and frankly untruthful claims. That is to say, in many places it makes either misleading statements, or deliberately misinterprets facts to reflect a biased theme.</dd>
<dd>e.g "<i>In China, it is generally used to describe supremacist or ethnocentric versions of Chinese nationalism focused upon the Han Chinese identity.</i>" - the terms for "Han chauvinism", whether in English or Chinese (大汉族主义, 汉本位) are not in wide use in China. In fact, etymologically, it is clear that the phrase 汉本位 is of Japanese origin.</dd>
<dd>an example of deliberate misinterpretation: "<i>"Dongyi" – term for Asians living in Manchuria, Korea, and Japan.</i>" The word "Dongyi" is a historical term meaning "barbarians of the east", and was used exclusively to refer to those peoples who lived in Eastern <i>China</i> in ancient times, who were not subject to the rule of the king or emperor. The deliberate misinterpretation can be evidenced from the fact that this <i>Chinese phrase</i> had to be explained with a <i>Japanese</i> reference.</dd>
<dd>Finally, the statement "<i>In Taiwan, Han chauvinism refers to the tendency among the</i> right-wing <i>political elite...</i>" is clearly designed to cast aspersions on pro-reunification segments of Taiwanese politics. As anyone who is familiar with the topic will know, the pro-reunification segments are <i>not</i> the "right-wing" of the political scene in Taiwan. If anyone is "right-wing", it is the ultra nationalist pro-independence parties.</dd>
<dd>I seriously suspect that the whole concept of "Han Chauvinism" was an invention of Japanese militarism or some similar movement. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> 12:12, 25 January 2006 (UTC</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> If it is a term, perhaps rewriting the article to eleminate these negative attributes would be a better way of going about things? Is it not worth a try at least? I dont support the article either way, i just think its better to at least try to get the article to be better if there is any truth behind it. (Sumple, without being mean, when you say things such as <b>an invention of Japanese militarism</b> , you do come across a bit biased and racist.

<dd>Thanks for pointing that out. I just meant that whoever came up with this term wasn't entirely neutral. I went over the top with that comment. Apologies. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> 13:01, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I didn't like the terms "supremacist", "right-wing" and "elite" so having fixed those, this article can stay. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Ruby</a> 14:25, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Google Scholar turns up <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=han+chauvinism" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=han+chauvinism" rel="nofollow">866 hits</a> for the term. It is certainly a valid article. What it needs is better sources and citations, not deletion. The "Dongyi" term is cited (in fact, the it's the only part of the article that's cited). This article needs improvement, and those Google Scholar links are a good starting place. —thames 16:24, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Cheers. I'll obey the majority rule&#160;:D I still have a problem with some of those terms though.

<p>Person is utterly nonnotable. Has a job, for which he apparently has done nothing noteworthy. Wrote some amateur reviews for a TV show. After the notability tag was on article for a while and a discussion about it was attempted on the talk page, still nothing. Someone who wrote most of this article created the vanity article Kurt Beyer Films, which was a recreation of the Kurt beyer films article that was deleted as vanity a while back, I believe the newer one was speedied. This just looks like vanity, and the major contributor says he's a friend of the guy... Perhaps if it's up for deletion somebody can try to come up with real justification for keeping it instead of removing the notability tag as "vandalism". If not, then it should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 13:39, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> So how is an "online Sci Fi critic" notable for an encyclopedia? You need to find an actual <i>reason</i> the person is notable, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards. Until you can do that there's no reason to keep this. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 15:18, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I agree that he does not meet the tests of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, unless you stretch some of them. However, I stand by my decision as Mr. Lynch has been extremely influential in the Star Trek universe, through both fans and producers/writers that have read his work. Unfortunately, I concede that there are relatively few concrete references currently to support this point. I'm still leaning toward a soft keep, despite the guideline. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 15:38, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Kurt Beyer Films plays into it because that was a vanity piece created in bad faith to put an article back in after it was already deleted as nonnotable vanity, and the person contributed to this article and seemed to be doing the same thing here. <i>"Not taking into account new arguments presented on the discussion page"</i> is false, I read your comments and found them wholly lacking. <i>"solely judging the article on a single case of vandalism"</i> is also extremely inaccurate, as that's not the sole thing I was judging on, which is readily apparent from my comments.

<li><b>Comment</b> I did not personally attack you; in your original nomination for deletion you did indeed claim that there were no real arguments for keeping it made, and inferred that one act of vandalism on this article means that the whole article is vandalism. There were quite a few arguments made; even if you believe they were wholly lacking, others might not. We are all civil people here, and by no means did I mean to offend you in any way or accuse you of anything. However, in your accusations of "new" users who have been registered for nearly a month, with no connection to this page, and created before this page was even brought into question, and arguing with other editor's decisions, as well as in instances on the discussion page, it appears as though you are taking personal offense to the existence of this article, for one reason or another. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlypanam_f023.html" title="User:Flypanam">Flypanam</a> 22:48, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

First, that Mr. Lynch was a regular reviewer/colunmist for <i><a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Zone_ff84.html" title="TV Zone">TV Zone</a></i> magazine, for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Second, that he was a writer for the trivia video game <i>Star Trek: The Video Game</i>. (It's a Star Trek-themed <i>You Don't Know Jack</i>-style game.) And finally, that he wrote the forward to the nonfiction book <i>Net Trek</i>. The third is of debatable merit, but the combination of the first two seems to satisfy the guideline. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 14:19, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Something in here <i>might</i> be notable, but we need details, and it needs to be verified. I'm not happy that his claims to have written for the magazine and book have been put into the article solely on the claims of the individual himself, largely because we've had problems in the past with people lying about sources during deletion votes and getting people to vote keep, only to find out the information was wrong later. I am not accusing him of this, but simply saying this has been a real problem here in the past. More importantly, these things still aren't quite the notability level necessary in my mind... Forward of a book is pretty short, and isn't really an author... he's listed as an "additional writer" of trivia along with a list of other people, and we don't normally have articles for trivia writers... a reviewer for a magazine typically also isn't at the same level as an article author. The TV Zone thing <i>may</i> be notable if he was a <i>featured</i> reviewer... i.e. someone whose name ran at the top of a review column on a regular basis, not anonymously and not as one of a rotating staff of reviewers. It depends upon how high profile it was. Even there, it's still not really quite up to the necessary level in my mind, though.</dd>
<dd>Anyone voting based upon the TV Zone claims would probably be best served waiting for the evidence of the exact nature of the reviews in TV Zone to be gathered and verified... of course that is really can only be a suggestion, and people showing up to vote can vote based upon what they see now.<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 14:59, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> With respect to your comment about the forward (which, I admit, I haven't confirmed yet-- Amazon wants $103 for a copy used!), I disagree with you completely. Being asked to write a forward to a book is an indication of notability, not the reverse. Although it is, as you put it, "short", the point isn't the writing of it but rather that the publisher and the author felt that this person was notable enough that having him contribute some small part to the book would be an advantage. (Increase sales, credibility, etc.) So, I stand by (once verified) that being an important indicator of <i>notability</i>, per our standards. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 01:33, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, as <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> pointed out via his citations, Lynch's work with TV Zone further expands his audience and justifies this article's existance. Sure he may not be notable to everyone, but those he has written for hold him in high regard and respect what he has done. I firmly believe that deleting this article would be a blow to media reviewers everywhere and would undermine the credibility of Wikipedia by virtue of restricting information to those who desire it. --<a href="../../../y/o/y/User%7EYoyaDiata_04ca.html" title="User:YoyaDiata">YoyaDiata</a> 21:43, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just reading what I see at <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclaim%21.html" title="Exclaim!">Exclaim!</a>. Apparently, that's incorrect? And that web site has 571 records just for bands that start with the letter R! I refuse to believe that every one of the thousands of bands on that website have been "prominently featured" (as stipulated in <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>) in that magazine. A one-paragraph album review doesn't qualify as "prominently featured" if you ask me. You could fit 10 or 15 of those on one page of a magazine I bet.

<li>It does appear that <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclaim%21.html" title="Exclaim!">Exclaim!</a> needs some work, as it certainly doesn't reflect what the site says. As for your accusation of my "total misinterpretation," I consider album reviews to be a prominent feature - not all bands, even more notable ones, get reviews - and that's with my trying to keep its notability within the flawed <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guideline.

<p>Neologism. Original research. Article has no verifiable content. It survived VfD in October 2004, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Oxenfez_%28old%29_de8e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Oxenfez (old)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Oxenfez (old)</a>. Vote was: one delete, one unexplained "keep," and one "keep" on the grounds that "regardless of its name, other users have reported having heard of this game, albeit perhaps in a different form." However, Wikipedia users do not qualify as verifiable sources. No improvements in article since October 2004; no edits at all other than vandalism ("Goose is gay" and "Goose is twelve") and categorization. No response to my request for citations a week ago. Hundreds of Google hits, but all apparently copies of the Wikipedia article. Are we serious about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>? If so, this article should go.

<p>Not encylopaedic. It says itself that it 'is not be regarded as an article in it self, rather as an extension to several existing biographical articles'.

<p>This is a how-to guide describing a pre-<a href="../../../g/c/s/GCSE_097d.html" title="GCSE">GCSE</a> level science experiment that doesn't even work! It has been tagged for cleanup since July (and hasn't received much attention). <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enot.html" title="Wp:not">Wikipedia is not a how-to guide</a>. If the experiment worked then I think it would fit well in a science textbook (which AIUI is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>' raison d'être) and I'd be proposing a transwiki to there, but as it is I don't see the point. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 16:04, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>At the risk of looking like someone who didn't do his homework -- I wrote <a href="../../../z/h/e/Zhen_Luo_f1ed.html" title="Zhen Luo">Zhen Luo</a> after this article already existed, and they refer to the same person. Why I think this article should be <b>deleted</b> (rather than merged) is because it contains inaccurate information, being overly based on fiction rather than historical accounts; further, there is not a single historical account that I see that refers to her as Zhen Ji -- there were many other ways that she's referred to other than Zhen Luo, but there was none that used this particular title. It was also poorly linked from other articles (a major reason why I missed in the first place when I wrote the "competing" article). I would not be completely opposed to a merge, but I don't think there's much, if anything, to be saved from this article. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 16:48, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and add links to Zhen Luo article. What we have here is a case of overlap between 3 different content areas: Chinese history as it is actually happened, the fictionalizations in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and the use of Three Kingdoms characters in videogames and other media. Users who are interested in the characters as derived from the books and featured in games and other media may have interests that diverge from those of historical scholars, so I believe separate articles with links to each other are highly appropriate. Move Dynasty Warriors material from Zhen Luo article to Zhen Ji article to differentiate between historical information and Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel and subsequent uses of the characters.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_Kidwell_b545.html" title="User:Ben Kidwell">Ben Kidwell</a> 22:16, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep it.</b> I agree with Ben. I think that the fact that the name Zhen Ji has reached greater masses in the youth parameters should say something about the matter in its own right. In fact, I did a little bit of research myself. The "Ji" behind the "Zhen" word actually siginifies "Empress". It does not mean that her name is "Zhen Ji" altogether, but undeniably, this is the name that most people know this character of the novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by.

<dd>"Ji" (姬) does not signify "empress." It is one of the possible titles for an imperial consort who is not an empress -- but is thoroughly inaccurate in this case since she was never given that title. Later on, after her son <a href="../../../c/a/o/Cao_Rui_946e.html" title="Cao Rui">Cao Rui</a> became emperor, he did posthumously honor her as an empress -- but that's "Huanghou" (皇后), not Ji. She was, in fact, while alive, never actually given any title except as Cao Pi's original wife during his tenure as <a href="../../../c/a/o/Cao_Cao_7dd3.html" title="Cao Cao">Cao Cao</a>'s heir -- and therefore was simply referred to as "Furen" (夫人, "lady"). Again, she's never referred in historical resources as "Zhen Ji." She's been referred to as "Zhen Fu" (甄宓, apparently an alternative name), "Zhen Furen" ("Lady Zhen"), and "Zhen Huanghou" (Empress Zhen, although that is a posthumous title since she was never empress while alive), but not Zhen Ji. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 18:25, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> the article was not created by me, but extended. The original article was not for deletion Wikimkii 02:06, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Just a note from someone familiar with the ZX Spectrum's history - Jonathan Smith is indeed one of the better known programmers on this platform, with his work generally known for its high quality. Sales from programs he wrote were certainly in the hundreds of thousands. If Jeff Minter, Matthew Smith, Mike Follin and numerous others have articles, Jonathan Smith certainly deserves one. -- AA, from world of spectrum forums <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.72.143.113 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.72.143.113.html" title="User talk:70.72.143.113">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.72.143.113_984e.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.72.143.113">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>: Jonathan Smith is one of the better known programmers for the Spectrum: Green Beret, Cobra and Batman: The Caped Crusader (all written by Smith) are generally considered to be better games for the Spectrum, both technically and playability-wise.

<li><b>comment</b> None of the arguments you stated justify the keeping of this article. If the subject isn't worthy of encyclopedic value then the subject doesn't deserve to be listed in an encyclopedia. It doesn't matter how well written the article is or how many pretty pictures it has. It also doesn't matter the number of activities a certain person is involved in or if that person had an esporadic appearance in television. What matters is notability and it seems you weren't able to prove that the article's subject had any relevant merit to be covered in an encyclopedia. Regarding the google search tip, if I ran a simple, straight forward google test on my nickname I get more hits than your convoluted google test. Moreover, I can run a google test similar to yours (lots of inclusive logic) to prove that I am connected to the pope. Therefore your google test proves nothing more than that the article's subject is indeed very obscure and irrelevant. Last, your "avoid groupthink" jab at wikipedians shows that not only you know that the article deserves to be deleted but that you are irrationally defending the maintaining of an article which is completely void of encyclopedic merit.

<li>I'm the article creator, and I admit I was of two minds about creating it, but decided it WAS encyclopedic. I have leaned extensively on this site for articles I've created here already, (<a href="../../../c/o/r/Coraopolis_Bridge_c273.html" title="Coraopolis Bridge">Coraopolis Bridge</a> for one) and plan to do so more in future. Personally, I don't think it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> per se (having had a hand in some of the discussion there) although it does fail the numbers tests (something I highlighted in the article itself). Here's the question for you delete voters: Where should this site be described? Is there somewhere in wikipediaspace for documenting reference sites? <a href="../../../h/a/e/HAER_a7c5.html" title="HAER">HAER</a> has an article in articlespace. This is like HAER, except that it's more focused, and has deeper coverage in a certain geography. Documenting this site is not a way to make it more notable, it's a way to improve research here. <b>Keep</b> unless you can answer that question (where should it go if not in articlespace) satisfactorily. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 19:06, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe the refactoring was incorrect but I'm not going to get into a revert war over it. However the points made in it are important, and people commenting on this reference work, as well as the closing admin, should take them into account, in particular the point about <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> not necessarily applying in this case since the encyclopedic nature of this site is not measurable using those guidelines. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 00:17, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also beleive moving the talk out of here was wrong. The whole point of this page is for discusion, much more so than voting. A closing admin should review the discussion as much as the votes. For instance, the topic of a move should be here, so that if there's a delete result, the closing admin is aware that there's a desire to move the contenets outside of article space. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 07:58, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think currently the mentions of this site, are not sufficient to warrant an article. The reason is, we don't have sufficient reliable information to make substantial article on the topic. It will either remain a stub, or it will be repeat POV of the site itself. If future publications write about this site (in a substantial manner), then I would support an article.

<li>Elaborating on this vote... just because it's a key, important reference to an article, or a set of articles, doesn't necessarily mean that it's encyclopedic.

The article is a mess right now, but once this nomination is closed and no-one's trying to prove a point anymore we can rewrite it into a perfectly good (if short) article about a perfectly good (if mildly obscure) reference source. And besides, this is clearly not linkspam.

<p><b>Delete</b>. The term is a neologism coined by the article's original author. Googling for the term reveals that it is used almost exclusively by said author, usually as a penname or in reference to himself. Even if the term were widespread, there's not much to say about it except that it means 'biodivisity preservationist'. The article is linked to from a list of environmental topics, but nothing else. <a href="../../../d/e/h/User%7EDeh_f3ad.html" title="User:Deh">Deh</a> 20:07, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>They might've, but with the US's federal structure there are usually a few stops between one's college days and landing a national political post. It's not usually seen as something having a direct impact (that is, unless you're talking about Abramoff and his ilk, but they're a rather special case) -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesquire_8265.html" title="User talk:Thesquire">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesquire_ea24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesquire">contribs</a>)</small> 03:48, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can easily recognize the English situation in what I know from Sweden, where student societies (political and others) play a significant role in the education and networking of future politicians and other Important People. That things are different in the US may have to do with the political structure, as you say, but I wonder if the American division between college and graduate school may not also play a part. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 07:29, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

In that case the whole Dance Studios category should be deleted then as well due to the fact that this category was the only reason I added this article in the first place.

<li>It would be unfair to delete this listing if The other dance studios and Dance groups and organizations are not. Maybe this listing should go to cleanup?
<ul>
<li>the question is why this studio is better than a Pizza Hut right beside it? If you can demonstrate the notability of the studio, then the vote will change. Did the studio owners/instructors win major national dance competitions? Was the studio covered in major press? I suggest other voters hint to other possivilitis to improve the article. Right now it reads as an advert. Wikipedia in a free encyclopedia, not a free promoter. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:16, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The difference is that Pizza Hut has resturants and is known all over the world. That is what notability means.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Per my vote at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hull_University_Labour_Club_38f7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hull University Labour Club">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hull University Labour Club</a>, should all clubs/groups that these people have been affiliated with get an article simply because they happened to be affiliated with it? The nature of universities means there's a pretty good chance that any club that's been around for a few decades is going to have at least one notable alumni. I don't think this counts as grounds for inclusion. If the group itself is notable for something, not just the later fame of its alumni, then I think there's a case. Alternatively, if alumni of the club have made statements indicating the club was influential in their later fame (and we can cite such claims), then I think there's a case. Failing this, we could potentially have every club and group that <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> has been a member of simply because he happened to have been in it before he was famous. The metric here needs to be what has the <i>organization</i> done to be famous in its own right rather than just ridding on the coat tails of the later fame of its alumni? Compare to <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_bones.html" title="Skull and bones">Skull and bones</a> which has plenty of notable people from it, but has also frequently been the subject of news stories. It's notable in its own right, not just from the later fame of its alumni. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 23:07, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>This was speedied as an 'nn club'. But it is certainly not a speedy - I've undeleted and sending here for completeness. University political societies are the breeding grounds for British politicians, and often mentioned in their bios. It is not just that famous people attended these, but that their political affliliations and often allegiences were formed in these places. They are at least as notable as schools and minor bands (which we keep). Hull itself boasts the current UK deputy Prime Minister, a deputy leader of the labour party (and previous Chancellor of the Exchequer) plus three other MP's (and that is just from the article).

<li><b>Delete</b> I speedy deleted it earlier. My reasoning was working it backwards; should all clubs/groups that these people have been affiliated with get an article simply because they happened to be affiliated with it? The nature of universities means there's a pretty good chance that any club that's been around for a few decades is going to have at least one notable alumni. I don't think this counts as grounds for inclusion. If the group itself is notable for something, not just the later fame of its alumni, then I think there's a case. But, I don't see anything like that in this article. The article claims it is "well known...for it's rebellious nature", attended a rally, and did some campaigning. Google test on this article's subject shows 9 hits. I don't see anything here that strikes me as being notable. Compare to <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a> which has notable alumni but has also frequently been in the press, especially in the last couple of years. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 22:46, 25 January 2006 (UTC) Addendum: <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

Based on the criteria that a group is notable because it has notable alumni, should we have an article on his Cub Scout den? What about a biography on his den mother? It's like saying an article on a place where Lincoln slept is notable because Lincoln slept there. I don't believe association is sufficient for notability, unless that association is somehow influential to the person's later fame/notability. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 23:14, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you quote it properly, it says "well known among Labour Students", not just "well known..." as you paraphrased. The main argument is that Oxford and Cambridge uni Lab clubs have one. Either we should all be allowed one or no one should.</li>
<li>Durin, that is a valid opinion, although I think it is wrong. But it was not valid to speedy this! A7 requires 'no assertion of notability' and even a borderline assertion requires an AfD. Two deputy PMs is certainly an assertion of notability (most school articles would die for such notable alumni) --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 22:51, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Abuse is a bit strong of a word. Did I make an error? Perhaps. Abuse? That implies conscious, reasoned knowledge that I was violating A7. That did not happen. Let's ratchet back the rhetoric, ok? As for them being known as being rebellious, how about a cite for such a claim? Failing that cite, that's potentially POV. Though I grant that a speedy might have been premature, I fully stand by my vote. And yes, I do think similar organizations shouldn't have an article unless the organization is notable for reasons other than the later fame of their alumni. Alternatively, if the alumni reference the organization as a major reason for their later fame, then that could be sufficient. But, no such claims have been made here that I see. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 22:59, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was a bit tricky, but I'll try closing this now. (Closing the first AFD debate was much easier, when there was a clear keep consensus.) On raw vote count there is not a real consensus for outright deletion, and the main objection has been that Wikipedia is not a memorial. I <i>believe</i> that the objection is to the list of names in the article. However, the article has a lead section which describes the recovery of bodies and treatment of the wounded, material which is not really covered by the "memorial" argument. I will therefore call this a <b>merge</b> of the lead section only to the "casualties" section of <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_July_2005_London_bombings_2280.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">7 July 2005 London bombings</a>, and redirect there. The list of names will be dropped, but I'll add the BBC News link to the main article as well. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:34, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't say anything about lists of casualties. It says "memorials". Whether lists of casualties are considered memorials depends mostly on their context, IMO. And I don't think in this case the context has anything to do with "honoring" anyone, thus I don't see this being a memorial. Of course as long as the policy is ambigiously worded, it will solely be a matter of opinion. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 00:42, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In the Kent State article the victims are mentioned within the text to help further explain the incident (that being said, I think the articles on the victims could be merged back in), while in this example it's just a list of names thrown together.

<p>None of this film studio's projects are listed on IMDB. This is a vanity article, written by one of the founders of this outfit. <a href="../../../e/a/e/User%7EEaefremov_7b22.html" title="User:Eaefremov">eae</a> 08:12, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

What I had typed here first (I erased my pervious entry on this page) was a reason why this page shouldn't be deleted. I don't really care though. Just delete it if you want. I mean, it's pretty relevant, if these guys get any bigger then they'll be as important to Alvin as Nolan Ryan once was (he moved apparently). Also, just because they're not listed on IMDB doesn't mean they're not important or anything, just go watch Student Film: The Movie on video.google.com and you'll see. <a href="../../../o/t/a/User%7EOtakupunkX_9c3f.html" title="User:OtakupunkX">OtakupunkX</a> 14:53, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>When these guys (which includes OtakupunkX, who founded the studio and created the article) get any bigger, someone else will notice and write an article. As it stands, there is nothing about S3 Films that warrants a Wikipedia article. Also, IMDB is considered the basic way of checking whether a film is notable. <a href="../../../e/a/e/User%7EEaefremov_7b22.html" title="User:Eaefremov">eae</a> 21:15, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So, if somebody else wrote the article and something by S3 Films popped up on IMDB, would it be considered notable then? There are a lot of movies that aren't on IMDB, like, say, anything by X-Strike Studios. IMDB mainly just shows movies that got a commercial release somewhere. Nothing by S3 Films has gotten a commercial release because they release everything for free online via video.google.com, Google's video hosting service.<a href="../../../o/t/a/User%7EOtakupunkX_9c3f.html" title="User:OtakupunkX">OtakupunkX</a> 15:29, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When someone unaffiliated with the studio writes an article, that article will be notable by definition. Please refer to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. I believe the Definition section is relevant to the S3 Films article. <a href="../../../e/a/e/User%7EEaefremov_7b22.html" title="User:Eaefremov">eae</a> 19:16, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What's the difference whether someone affiliated with the studio or not writes the article? Chances are someone in the studio will have a hand in the article anyway to make sure the information's not totally bogus. <a href="../../../o/t/a/User%7EOtakupunkX_9c3f.html" title="User:OtakupunkX">OtakupunkX</a> 14:26, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The difference is that articles written by the subject of that article himself do not conform to Wikipedia guidelines about <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>. <a href="../../../e/a/e/User%7EEaefremov_7b22.html" title="User:Eaefremov">eae</a> 19:45, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just having child pornography in your home (including on your computer) is illegal in most countries. You don't even have to watch it. This article, as per its title, is good for only one thing: finding child pornography. If it does what it says it does, this is illegal content since its ONLY use is leading people where they are not allowed to go. One consequence of having this article (unlike an article e.g. *describing* child pornography) <b>will</b> be that in Europe (where ISPs are/will be required to log and archive all Internet traffic that passes through their network) law enforcement officers will be able to access IP numbers and personal details of anyone visiting this specific article. And Wikipedia will have to report all the IP numbers visiting that page on first (official/legal) request in the US. Also, it's just a matter of time until this reaches the media and creates another media debacle. (I am not discounting the possibility that the article does NOT do what it says, in which case it would be completely useless.) <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 10:23, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm aware that the list could, and probably will, be used illegally, which isn't our problem. It could also be argued that half of our street names for drugs are only useful in buying drugs on the street, which is also quite illegal, but again, not our problem.

The redirecting articles themselves are harmless (you can only find the terms if you know them already). The article per se is not a problem either. It's the combination that's problematic. OK, I've done my best - now it's up to y'all... <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 04:23, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>keep</b> I've seen a few articles on Wikipedia about people whom I would consider "non-notable". It is a questionable subject. Hovever, I believe that if there is any significant information at all in an article, it should be kept.

<li><s><b>keep</b></s> Since there is no other "Darren P. Grover" already in Wikipedia, then surely this is the most significant occurence of a "Darren P. Grover"?

<li><b>Delete</b> - The links on the article don't actually link to any information on this individual, making them useless.

<li><i>Comment</i>: I don't see how contributions to other articles are relevant - we're only talking about this particular article. I don't think it makes comments any less valid, which other articles someone has contributed to. The reason I edited this article was because I was trying to improve the validity of it, no other reason. <i>I did not create the article</i>. If it is deleted, so be it; I was simply expressing my opinion, which is the whole point of this discussion, and I don't see how my opinion is any less valid than anyone else's. If it turns out that other people's opinions are considered to have more weight than mine, then that defies the whole purpose of this type of encyclopedia - it becomes subjective as opposed to objective, and thereby loses its purpose. Also, the fact that I typed "keep" twice is irrelevant; <i>I don't consider it a double vote</i> - one person has one vote, no matter how many times they state their opinion. realvictory 23:16, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>Also, the fact that I typed "keep" twice is irrelevant</i> It's completely relevant: you put your THREE (not two) "keep"s in bold, and you did NOT sign any of them, giving the appearance of three separate votes. Also, Wikipedia is not democracy: voting is a convenience for the admins who close out the discussion, to give them an immediate sense of the general direction of the discussion. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:50, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> It's relevant because decisions are made the wikipedia community. Those who sign up purely for one article (or look like they may be a second account of somebody trying to protect an article about himself) don't get the same weight as those who have demonstrated their interest in the project in general. There's nothing subjective about that. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 23:37, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i>: If someone "looks like" they don't care, and you base a decision on that, then that is being subjective - there is no proof. If someone is taken more seriously than another person because they signed up earlier than the other person, then that is being subjective. Taking someone less seriously because they haven't edited as many articles isn't fair. I could go away and edit as as many articles as I like, but when I came back, it would have made no difference to the credibility of this particular article. This is a discussion about <i>this particular article</i>. However, even if it was about a user as opposed to an article, voting against someone because they've edited no articles yet would mean that they would never get to edit articles, because no one would let them. It's about this particular article, and why <i>this particular article</i> is worth keeping or deleting. It's not about whether or not a user has been signed up for a long time, or whether or not a user has edited other articles. I think that the deletion of this article by voting is censoring information based on opinion. What is important is facts about this article, not about whether people like the article or not, not about whether people like the editors or not. realvictory 15:30, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Comment</i>: I DID NOT vote three times. I DID NOT type "keep" three times. I voted ONCE and I typed "keep" twice. The comments I made have my signature by them. I SIGNED MY OWN NAME next to my articles since I was asked to - I don't think you can complain about that. I HAVE ONE USER NAME. I find it offensive that anyone could believe that I might think that having two user names makes a difference. I can't make you believe me, but blaming someone without proof is wrong. More than one person can edit an article, without having created the article. The reason I voted "keep" was because it was MY OPINION. This is completely legitimate; please don't blame me for doing things I didn't, making mistakes which I corrected, or especially simply because you disagree with me. None of that is logical or fair. realvictory 15:42, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> OK, so you're saying the voting doesn't really mean anything, what really matters are the reason for the vote - so why has nobody given a VALID and COMPLETE reason as to why they believe the article in question should be removed?

<li><b>Comment:</b> Many people have given a valid and complete reason: this is an unverifiable biography of a non-notable individual which to all involved (excpet for the contributor and his friends) seems like little more than a vanity article. That good enough?</li>

<p>It is perfectly verifiable, check any of the references given, and you will see full evidence. The person is well-noted, and is worthy of note in Wikipedia. Just because some people are unaware of notable Britons, does not mean they are not notable. Ukpcdaz 02:25, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The seaturtle.org site seems completely superfluous. The awards site does not seem to list winners from any year beyond 2005. Lastly, your personal webpage is NOT a reliable source. Perhaps you should stop referring to yourself in the third person, since it appears that the domain darrengrover.co.uk is hosted at ukpcdaz.atspace.com. Anything else to say Darren?<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 02:52, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you please put your username after comments, please Ukpcdaz 02:40, 28 January 2006 (UTC) Seaturtle.org will tell anyone that looks that Darren Grover is a registered sea turtle volunteer. The awards site does give historic winners, should you care to look. Additionally, a simple search on google will clear this matter further, since it was covered by national press. Moreover, My running a website for someone does not make me that person - otherwise, as a freelance web designer - I would be a LOT of people. Ukpcdaz 02:43, 28 January 2006 (UTC) Why do you wish so hard to remove a single page from the internet that causes you no harm? The page gives truthful statements about a noteable person, I don't see what is wrong with that. If everytime someone puts a new article on wikipedia, that a few people haven't heard of, so they try to delete it, there is NO point in wikipedia as it will be filled with only what a few people want/know, which will mean it will expand, but only in one direction. Ukpcdaz 02:46, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>On your website it says that I can contact Darren Grover at ukpcdaz@hotmail.com. Anything else? <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 02:52, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes the article no less true. Whilst you were on the site, did you care to note how many visitors it has had today? Last time I saw, it was 1007. 1007 visitors in one day, to a site of someone who is non-notable?Ukpcdaz 02:59, 28 January 2006 (UTC) Moreover, it does not say you can contact Darren Grover at that address. Ukpcdaz 03:05, 28 January 2006 (UTC) I can pass messages onto Darren Grover, that is all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nope, I didn't see that anywhere. Not to mention, since you and Helzagood (who although a friend of Darren's doesn't know any of the other contributors) have both LIED significantly here you don't have a lot of credibility. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 03:07, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Who has lied? Is it not feasible that someone can know Darren but not everyone else that might have heard of him? I doubt any celebrity can recall by name everyone that knows them, and nor could their fans recall all other fans. Nobody has lied, except you, to yourself - you can't admit that as you don't know of someone, they might be important. Ukpcdaz 03:12, 28 January 2006 (UTC) Additionally, Helzagood said she knew Darren, that does not imply friendship, get your facts right, before ATTACKING other users.</p>
<ul>
<li>When did Helzagood ever mention that she was a she? It seems you do know her. I am sure that there are plenty of people on wikipedia who are notable, but who I don't know of. You have simply listed nothing that makes you notable enough for an encyclopedia article. It's nothing personal, most people aren't notable. There's no need to act indignant or get angry. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 03:21, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Regrettably I am nominating this for AfD, though I do find it to be hilarious.

<li><s><b>Delete and BJAODN</b></s>. <s>I especially like the encyclopedic tone in which the song is initially discussed. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrazyCaley_d294.html" title="User:KrazyCaley">KrazyCaley</a> 23:49, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</s> <b>Keep</b>. Well. I honestly thought that one was either made up or of minor, non-notable importance. Still think it's a bit weird, but hey, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> censored for the protection of minors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I did not post this as a joke. This is a real song. It seems every kid in my elementary school was singing it. Moreover, my colleagues in college and graduate school (who hail from around the country) have consistently been familiar with it. OK, I know the sources are sketchy and one may argue that this does not belong in an encyclopedia. But lets be honest -- we all know that there is a genre of humorous songs (frequently children's songs and frequently plays on the tunes of existing songs) that are a widely known part of our collective cosnciousness. These are encyclopedic, though they may not appear in conventional sources -- large parts of the youth of any country knows such songs, for goodness sake. I know I am not an experienced poster (under this name), but please consider my rationales. Thanks <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also please see my additons, which cite a specific reference and discuss the fact this song, like many in it genre, has frequently variable lyrics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, recommend check for copyvio. This song was on published and distributed recordings (I've heard it in different jukeboxes), but I don't know whether it was new then, or owned or public-domain before then. Not significant enough for a WP article or BJAODN even if not copyvio. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:00, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> -- what is so unencyclopedic about this? This is a fairly well known song (above poster seems to be familiar-- the fact that he heard it on a jukebox speaks to noteriety (and by the way I removed the lyrics if that is a copy-vio issue)). Plenty of songs have pages on wikipedia, some better known than others. Is it because this song is (or tries to be) humorous that you have such problems with this article? Sure, this will never be an extremely long article but, as stated, it is a verifiably (by this very discussion) well known song. What is the problem, guys? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../2A/d/r/User%7E_drew_2c46.html" title="User:*drew">*drew</a> 05:13, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So I suppose I should propose deletion for every other well-known song that has a Wikipedia page? 72.150.108.181</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Young American. There are a lot of well-known children's songs like this that could have decent articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Mehlberg_a895.html" title="User:John Mehlberg">John Mehlberg</a>. This is a traditional song of which the earliest known date is 1927. I have revised this article and have included references to printed and recorded examples of this song with variant texts. Oh, it is OK to have the LYRICS as they are traditional.

<li><b>Keep</b> --- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a>. This song seems to be well known (I, for one, have known about it since I was a little kid) and the article is now much better referenced than in earlier versions. Also, I agree with above that there is definitely a genre of songs of this ilk, many of which could have worthwhile entries -- everyone seems to know these songs but hardly anyone knows there origins / history / variations...wikipedia could be agreat vehicle for making that information available.</li>
