<p>What is going on here? This is really silly. So the page is created. A few hours later an anonymous user sends the page to AfD as their _first_ Edit. While I am honestly working to gather sources and justify this guys inclusion, more anonymous users with <b>No Edit History</b> play havoc with his page. There is vandalism, reports of copy-vio, and all manner of general harrassment, for no stated reason. I spend more time undoing the vandalism than contributing (See Old AfD). Finally and experiened editor with over 5000 edits (<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian.html" title="Adrian">Adrian</a>) notes what is happening and removes the article from AfD in keeping with Wiki Consensus (See old AfD). That is reversed <b>by an anonymous user with no Edit History</b>, for no reason I can see, and we are back at AfD. Anonymous vandalism continues and finally the site has to be semi-protected by admins because of all the abuse by users with <b>no edit history</b>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captain Barrett</a> 16:51, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sigh. Well, one way or another this is the messiest AfD I have seen in a long time. It now seems to require an admin to dedicate his time to watching over it so it doesn't degenerate as before and presently contains no delete opinions. Can we not finally put this one to rest? I cannot see a delete concensus ever being reached. And the procedural issues have utterly failed to gain any interest at AN/I. We seem to have all wasted a lot of time due to an unknown quantity of IP editors. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 17:42, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is only messy in that there are some new individuals who clearly don't quite get what is going on, and alot of people blathering on about procedure rather than discussing the merits of the article.

<p>The involved IP editors - including the nominator - were all blocked yesterday for being verified open proxy users. I noticed them doing similar stuff elsewhere. Probably one single editor hopping Tor Nodes to vote-stack. Obviously this is not acceptable behaviour, especially when someone is editing from a proxy to evade a block. - <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> 18:35, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If I was given the time I could find better sources. But because this page has been consistantly attacked since it's creation I have not had the opportunity. I could get his birth or death certificate, I could find his obit in the paper, there _is_ more. However, I also have a life. I am also not, nor have I ever been a member of the OTO. It seems very probable that Ebony is _so notable_ that people are actively trying to stop the creation of his wiki, permenantly. There is no other reason for all this drama that I can see. The only way to be objective is to leave the page open and submit for AfD again in a few months. Killing this page immediatly makes no wiki sense. If it is this easy to close a new Wiki, wiki is in trouble. Closing it now only feeds whatever forces are trying so vigilantly to squash this. You may be loosing a very important opportunity. 128.114.238.174 22:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)(Captain Barrett)</li>

Ebony actually held title in the OTO as Secretary General (Webster held no title), why are you not concerned with how notable Ebony was in his own community?

<dd>Hmm, speaking of double standards, I haven't seen you speak up to keep Sam's article. He's got nearly 20 pages of coverage in a book published by Harper. He's mentioned in books published by University of South Carolina Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, has written as much or more than Ebony, been a founder of two orders, etc. From a notability point-of-view, he's at least as notable as Ebony. I myself am thinking about giving Ebony a chance, but am waiting to see whether you are going to support Sam's article or not. <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhabs_66a6.html" title="User:Khabs">Khabs</a> 01:51, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ah, seems you don't know what "notable" means in the context of Wikipedia. It is objective, not subjective. It simply means that:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The article asserts some specific reason(s) for notability, and</li>
<li>The are reliable sources <i>independent</i> of the subject that back up that claim of notability.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>That being the case, all you have to do is
<ol>
<li>Read the article to see if it asserts notability, and</li>
<li>if so, check the sources and see if they appear to be published by a reputable publisher not connected directly to the subject.</li>

<dd>I don't know about DGG's motivation, and I prefer not to speculate since it's easy enough to judge things in relation to <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">the five pillars</a>. From what I've seen of how things work here, the only way to really get anywhere is to look at <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">the five pillars</a> since those are the standards everyone here has in mind and questioning the character of contributors tends to get nowhere other than adding animosity to the community. I do think you have a point about relative notability CB. A sports star will necessarily have more sources on average than, say, a cryptozoologist. However, it can't be forgotten that one of the main purposes of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability criteria</a> is to ensure that an article has enough third-party sources to build a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article. Even if someone is the CEO of a corporation, you can't make a good, reliable and accurate article on them if there aren't enough proper sources. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackhorkheimer_f07f.html" title="User:Jackhorkheimer">Jackhorkheimer</a> 06:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
