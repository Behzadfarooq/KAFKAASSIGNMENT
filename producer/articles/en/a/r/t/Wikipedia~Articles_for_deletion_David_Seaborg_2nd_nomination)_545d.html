<p>I'm renominating this page for deletion. This is the second nomination; the page was first nominated on January 22, 2006. The result of the debate was keep. The archive of the debate is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_Seaborg_9be4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Seaborg">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why it deserves to be renominated so soon:</strong> Many people voted keep out of concern that the nomination was bad faith and a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>. The previous nominator nominated 18 biographies of people in category:atheists for deletion after his own articles on Christians were nominated. I count 8 "keep" votes in the original debate that cited "bad faith nomination" as a reason. Hopefully, this time we can debate the merits of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Why it deserves to be deleted:</strong> Besides being the son of a Nobel laureate - hardly an accomplishment - this person hasnt done anything notable. Hes the president of an organization not notable enough to have a wikipedia page. And he has <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22david+seabog%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22david+seabog%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">a little more than 400</a> google hits. <b>Delete</b>--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 02:15, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><strong>Comment:</strong> he shook President Johnson's hand once; Ameritrade didnt want to let him bid on google and someone wrote up an article about it; published an academic paper; and gave a speech at an atheist convention. As for Who's Who, I admit it weakens my case, but it lists "110,000 of the nation's most noteworthy people" and "31,000 brand new listings" each year. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 04:12, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To delve further into that vein, he's also listed in Who's Who in Science and Engineering, and Who's Who of Emerging Leaders in America. I do see your objections -- he's not a household name by any stretch, but he's good at what he does, and respected within a notable community.

<dd>Well, I confess I am not sure of his importance as an "emerging leader" - you may be right about that. Nevertheless, as far as science in engineering, google scholar records <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=author%3A%22d+seaborg%22&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=author%3A%22d+seaborg%22&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1" rel="nofollow">2 publications, 5 citations</a> which definitely rules out his importance as a scientist/engineer. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 04:40, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd say it's a bit extreme to say that this "rules out" his importance -- it weakens his notability as a published scholar, but that's not the only facet of this individual. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Lamo_094a.html" title="User:Adrian Lamo">Adrian Lamo</a> · <a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdrian_Lamo_87da.html" title="User talk:Adrian Lamo"><small>(talk)</small></a> · <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Adrian_Lamo_7380.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Adrian Lamo">(mail)</a></small> · 22:01, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree - I meant only that it rules out his notability as a scientist/engineer. You are right to point out that the google scholar result does not rule out potential notability as something else, i.e. as an environmentalist. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 22:28, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> family relations don't confer notability. His only other claim to fame is the "World Rainforest Foundation", "Greater Lafayette Open Space Fund", et al., which apparently can't meet their fundraising goals. In my opinion, that falls short of notability on simple precedent; Wikipedia does not have articles about other people who have started mre successful charitable organizations (Dan West of Heifers International or William Cunningham of Focus Hope for example).

While the article's value to the encyclopedia is almost negligible, it's not entirely valueless. The lack of existence of articles on the organizations is of little value to our discussion unless those organizations were deleted persuant to an AfD. Non-existence is different than being propertly deleted. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 22:55, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. When this much rationalization has to go into why it should be kept, then it's usually because it really shouldn't be. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 22:57, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: There's just not enough information in the published record to write something substantial about him, that isn't him remembering his dad. (I say this as someone who tried to come up with more information, but couldn't.) <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 06:47, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I have more scientific publications than him (he has only <i>one</i> fide ISI's Web of Science), and have raised more money for environmental groups in which I'm an officer than he has (also, I've shaken hands with Al Gore;)), and I'm certainly not notable. This is not anti-science bias: notable scientists may tend to have fewer Google hits, but they have numerous and/or high quality publications. Being the son of someone notable isn't enough.--<a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayerG_a4be.html" title="User:MayerG">MayerG</a> 15:14, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
