<p>Highly inappropriate user page. GRider is making a deliberate attempt to subvert the VfD process, by contacting dozens of people whom he believes would agree with him, and asking them to vote. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=50&amp;offset=50&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=&amp;target=GRider" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=50&amp;offset=50&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=&amp;target=GRider" rel="nofollow">check his contrib log</a>. This is very similar to those cases where an article on an internet forum is put up for deletion, and people on that forum are asked to come here to vote. I should point out that an <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html#GRider" title="WP:RFAr">Arbitration process</a> is underway against GRider for his abuse of VfD and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">abusing WP to make a point</a>.</p>
<p>To establish a consensus on a group of articles, one should put them up in a <i>public place</i> (such as RfC, a WikiProject, or policy consensus on VfD). What is being done here is the opposite - not finding a consensus, but trying to out-shout the other party. He is also unilaterally removing opposing opinions from this page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:GRider/Schoolwatch&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11524200" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:GRider/Schoolwatch&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11524200" rel="nofollow">diff here</a>).</p>

<li>I agree with some points of the complaint against GRider ,but I feel this falls within the bounds of the acceptable. It's on his own user page, and while there are limits, I don't find this all that objectionable. Why, indeed, should he be prevented from notifying people who might be interested in a particular vote but don't follow vfd? I quote from <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You can also use your user page to help you use Wikipedia more effectively: so you can use it to list "to do" information, work in progress, reminders, useful links, and so forth. It's also good for experimenting with markup (a personal Wikipedia:Sandbox).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another use is to let people know about your activities and opinions on Wikipedia. So you might include current plans, a journal of recent activities on Wikipedia, and your opinions on how certain Wikipedia articles or policies should be changed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>GRider, whatever my opinions of his methods, has every right to his user page, within the wide boundaries we've set as a community, and I don't see what he's doing as all that inappropriate. There's a big difference between inviting people to spam and inviting established editors to make their voices known. <b>Keep</b> this page. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 09:31, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, I can't agree there. There's a big difference between putting something on your userpage to tell people what you're doing, and actively engaging in ballot-stuffing, which is the only purpose these two pages can hope to serve, particularly when you look at "what links here" on the Schoolwatch page and find that it's been spammed to other users' talk pages in a deliberate attempt to get a sympathetic hearing for each case. You might want to check the wikipolitical stance of each of those members that have received a message on their talk page pointing to this. Precedent in the past has been to <b>delete</b> material which interferes with or attempts to get around VfD, so I see no exception in this case. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 11:57, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Meelar has a point, however there is a difference here. When an article of &lt;foo&gt; is nominated, it would make sense to alert some fans of &lt;foo&gt; because <i>they can explain</i> why the article should be kept. But GRider does not get people to explain something, he gets people who simply vote as he does. I know that high schools are a controversial issue, but this is not the way to resolve it, as it only encourages factionalism. Next thing you know the other faction will be similarly gathering votes to 'balance' it, and the result would only be that VfD gets even fuller than it is already. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 14:11, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I regard this Vfd as an attempt to get around the Vfd process by restricting discussions and votes to hardcore vfd users. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 12:20, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Discount vote as user is involved in said jury-rigging. It is not an attempt to restrict discussions. It is an attempt to stop one user from flooding VfD with users with a specific agenda to keep anything and everything, even beyond the point of common sense. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 13:08, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>You've been approached by GRider for his crusade, and by all accounts it looks like you've taken the bait. How do we know this vote is independent, and not a result of being motivated into action? In the latter case, your vote would essentially be a vote by GRider, by proxy. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 13:30, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So motivation is now banned from VFD? One cannot even mention a vote to other users?

<li><b>Keep</b>. The argument that this page amounts to vote-stacking is nonsense, since deletionists can just as easily keep it on their watchlists as keepers can. If it is actively maintained it is a useful resource for anyone interested in the issue.

<li><b>Extreme keep</b>. This has gone way too far... This entire nomination is invalid and should be delisted immediately. There is nothing wrong in the slightest with someone publishing a list of articles to be improved upon within their own <b>personal namespace</b>. The argument that making such an improvement list is an attempt at vote stacking is a logical fallacy: deletionists can place it on their watchlist too, just as Zero points out. As much as I would like to assume good faith, it seems as if this listing is nothing short of an attempt at revenge by a small minority, and that's a shame. <b>Inclusionism is not a crime.</b> —<a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadman1_76e9.html" title="User talk:Radman1"><i>talk</i></a>) 16:02, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> this is no more invalid than a list of schools on the Inclusionist page on Meta! I strongly resent this being listed on VfD.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm not a big fan of people acting as a self-appointed party whip to get votes in order on a topic, but it is not a blatant violation of any policy. I admit I've been tempted to do the same at times, particularly when a worthless article is a single vote from deletion, but I have refrained. If GRider wants to then there's not much anyone can do. At times I've asked users to add their comments to discussions, which I think is perfectly fine, and this is only a bit beyond that. In any case, I've seen similar things on others user pages, without issue made. As a final note, I do find it rather poor to insist other's votes not be counted because they were solicited by GRider. I'm sure many would have voted to keep either way. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:41, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as VFD has no jurisdiction over userspace. If you have a dispute with a user, take it to RFC or arbitration. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 16:47, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Strong <b>Keep</b>. There are really two separate questions this VFD raises:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) <i>Should Wikipedia have a formal policy against informing like-minded voters of the existence of VFDs?</i>
<dl>
<dd>I would say "No." Because VFDs are not simple majority votes, it is technically not possible to stack the vote. If GRider's "Colleagues" raise intelligent valid points on a VFD page, their voices should be heard. And if they don't, admins are free to ignore them in reaching a decision.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps more importantly, I believe that the ethos of Wikipedia is inherently pro-information, rather than anti-information. I object to many of GRiders other actions--but in this particular case, he is simply providing information to people he believes may be interested in it. If you disapprove of the results, I'd encourage you to find a response that increases the spread of information (EG, noting possible bias of contributors in VFD; encouraging people with your views to participate in VFDs) rather than decreases it (by attempting to hamper GRider's efforts to communicate with other Wikipedians.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(2)<i>In the absense of such a policy, should a VFD be used to forcibly remove parts of a userpage?</i>
<dl>
<dd>I would say "No" in the strongest possible terms. Tampering with a user's personal page should be done only in the most severe cases, and it seems self-evident that a rule must exist before violation of it can be considered severe.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<li>Comment: I think this nomination ignore the fact that it's perfectly legitimate to improve articles while on Vfd, and the sooner that happens the better for the article's prospects. I'm not sure how many of the "colleagues" have actually worked on schol articles under threat, but I certainly have, and I'd work on more if they weren't going be deleted anyway. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:10, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Editors should be welcome to keep lists of articles in their user spaces. There is certainly a valid concern that GRider pushes the bounds of acceptable behaviour on VfD (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_GRider_bd65.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/GRider">RfC1</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_GRider2_1383.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/GRider2">RfC2</a>, <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">RfAr</a>) but I can't really argue with his right to maintain a personal list of articles. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a> 18:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Futile. Besides the above, almost all of which is valid anyway, deletion would do nothing to prevent GRider from continuing to <s>spam</s> post lists of schools on vfd to scores of user talk pages. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 18:30, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While I am reluctant to mess with people's user space, we wouldn't tolerate such obvious vote stacking coming from a message board or another website, so we are hypocrites if we tolerate it here. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:42, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>reluctant <b>Keep</b>. While I am strongly against the notion of vote garnering, I do not believe these pages in and of themselves should be deleted. Vote garnering is bad because it sets a bad precedent. I could find a bunch of people who think that all pokemon articles should be deleted, and then notify them whenever one is nominated. You can say that vfd isn't a majority vote rules situation, but the number of votes one way or another still influenecs the outcome. There is nothing wrong with the existance of these pages. It is the way GRider uses them that is wrong. As such, mention this in his RfC and keep. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 19:09, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

Any school nomination gets a number of axiomatic votes (e.g. <i>keep, school</i> and <i>delete, school</i>) and several have turned into shouting matches. <b>Would it be possible</b> to establish a consensus on this, rather than to keep repeating this almost daily? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 21:56, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sounds good to me... though I think the schools thing is really a proxy for the battle on the notability. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 22:17, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Reluctant <b>Keep</b>. It's user space, the notion of deleting these pages strikes me as a little too far-fetched. Nevertheless, I'd like to make clear that I consider this a perfectly legit nomination. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_wikipedia_is_not_6c3e.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_democracy" title="Wikipedia:What wikipedia is not">Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_democracy</a>: vote stacking is absolutely repproachable, contradicts the consensus driven approach that is the core of Wikipedia's philosophy, and should be avoided, even if it targets other editors. Gathering people to vote Keep or Delete is not the proper way to settle this dispute over the notability of schools. I've been constantly concerned these last few days that VfD might eventually become the battlefield between inclusionists and deletionists, and not a place for arguments and discussion. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">Vlad</font><font color="#989ACC">M</font><font color="#0000C0">V</font></a> <font color="#6F078D">٭</font> <sup><a href="../../../v/m/v/User_talk%7EVmv_5a55.html" title="User talk:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">talk</font></a></sup> 04:44, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If it's not a personal attack or harassment in some way you can put it on your user page. The only way a user's page should be deleted is for the offensive username criteria, clear harassment or an arbcom judgment. However, this does show why simple vote-counting on VfD is probably a bad idea (thought I admit I don't have a better). <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 10:03, 2005 Mar 27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><s><b>mild keep</b></s>. This is a separate issue to the spamming (which I am totally against). I am not in favour of an automatic keep (or delete) for schools - it should be a vote on the individual article. To try and provide balance I have this page on my watchlist, and have mentioned it on a couple of VfDs, and I've also placed a link to it at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Deletionist_Wikipedians" class="extiw" title="m:Association_of_Deletionist_Wikipedians">m:Association of Deletionist Wikipedians</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 10:55, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>After further consideration, including GRider's behaviour elsewhere, others comments on this page, and the comments on several school deletion articles currently ongoing, I am changing my vote to <b>strong delete</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 01:55, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Can someone tell me why we won't accept this kind of behaviour from message boards, but we will accept it here? Anyone care to say why someone going to a message board outside and soliciting comment from sympathetic users is different from someone soliciting comment from sympathetic users on WP? Ultimately, sending this message out to "deletionists" as well as "inclusionists" (I don't particularly like to use those terms, I prefer to think of them as "people not using their common sense" and "people without any common sense" respectively) doesn't do any better, because it attracts <i>more</i> users with an agenda, and does even worse to drown out the valid reasoning that normally goes on here. If this user page isn't deleted, then we can never delete another school article again, <i>regardless</i> of any policy that is formed, simply because the debate will be filled with sympathetic users with an agenda to push. If someone can put school articles beyond deletion, what's to say they can't get less worthy things a permanent place here by securing sympathetic hearings in the same way? For once, we have a case where the <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> is not a fallacy, because <i>we're seeing it for real in front of us</i>. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 14:05, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Besides the actual act of voting, how is filling a discussion with people with an agenda to push any different from getting them out to vote? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 17:09, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure I follow your line of argument here. If one pushes the matters far enough, every vote is biased and thus compromised with an agenda. If you're stating there's no sense in discussing when people have an agenda, I take you to imply there's no sense in discussing anything on VfD, and it all comes down to tallying votes. I strongly reject this idea. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">Vlad</font><font color="#989ACC">M</font><font color="#0000C0">V</font></a> <font color="#6F078D">٭</font> <sup><a href="../../../v/m/v/User_talk%7EVmv_5a55.html" title="User talk:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">talk</font></a></sup> 20:14, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideally VfD should only be used in cases where precedent and policy do not adequately cover whether to keep/delete a borderline article. In practice however the same old nomination-types keep coming again and again, and they're hardly fertile soil for novel discussions and arguments unfortunately. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 17:23, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why don't we start a policy discussion on banning vote garnering. I'd support it. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 19:09, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ditto. We need some way of making sure each article is judged fairly, on its merits, and not on blanket beliefs. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 20:35, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You mean, like the blanket belief that schools are not notable? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 23:19, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I at least don't have such a belief. I beleive that not all schools are notable, and those that are need to show in their article why they are. In other words, I maintain that schools must do the same as any other type of article has to do. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 23:37, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think there <i>is</i> such a blanket belief. Nobody (to my knowledge) has claimed that <i>"no schools are notable"</i>. The debate is between <i>"some schools"</i> are notable, and <i>"all schools"</i> are notable. Not that that makes it any easier. Maybe staring a <i>WikiSchools</i> project would be the solution. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:44, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Phrasing the debate in those terms suggests that "non-notability" is a well-understood, well-defined acceptable reason for deletion in the first place. All polls on the issue have agreed that "notability" is very problematic (although more progress has been made in defining notability for schools - BEEFSTEW). <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 09:28, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Funny thing is that nobody really objects to the 'band inclusion guidelines' or the 'biography inclusion guidelines' - both of which boil down to notability. As one of the most often words used in voting here, notability (or lack thereof) is a <i>de facto</i> deletion criterion. It is, of course, not well-defined, but the same applies to several other VfD criteria. But aside from this, much information given in high school articles is not <i>verifiable</i>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:05, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a legitimate user subpage, and this VFD is simply harassment. I would like to see this, issue brought to a policy discussion, but until then, it <i>is not policy</i> that organization on votes is prohibited, and I don't like seeing it treated as such. --<a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL33tminion_371f.html" title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a> <small>|</small> <a href="../../../l/3/3/User_talk%7EL33tminion_b015.html" title="User talk:L33tminion">(talk)</a> 01:20, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not harassment, it is a valid concern. "Inappropriate user page" is still a valid deletion criterion. The fact that consensus disagrees with me about this article doesn't make it bad faith. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:28, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> userpages. What you do on your own userpage should be your own business provided it's not a basis for a personal attack, criminal activity or subverting the VfD process.

<li>Keep, user pages that are obviously related to work on Wikipedia. It's not like GRider is abusing user space as a free hosting service. And these pages don't contain personal attacks, recreations of deleted articles, or any other potential policy violations. If some kind of problem results from him using the "Colleagues" page to distort votes, that can be addressed in his current arbitration case, but the issue would be with GRider's conduct, not the existence of the page itself. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 13:00, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
