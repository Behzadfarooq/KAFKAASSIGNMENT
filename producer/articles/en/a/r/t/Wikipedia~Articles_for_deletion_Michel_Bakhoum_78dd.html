<p>"Keep"....It is an honor to state that the great professor Dr. Michel Bakhoum is a world renowned leader that had great and unlimited influence on the lives of a significant number of engineering students, professional engineers, professors, and researchers. His successful students are all over the world. His books, publications, and landmark designed projects are the testimony of the great achievements this great man had all over the country of Egypt. It is a great honor to state that I am one of thousands of his students. [N. Grace, Professor and Chairman, Civil Engineering Department, Director, Center for Innovative Materials Research, Lawrence Tech University, USA]</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> — although it would be good to have an article on Michel Bakhoum, we cannot have this kind of article. The article began as copyvio, but the article's creator kept trying to remove the tags. What we have now is a boring CV. If someone can create an article about Bakhoum that hasn't been copied from somewhere and consists of full sentences of good biographical information, we can keep the article. Otherwise, delete. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 19:28, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Copyvio of the late professor's apparently reasonably popular english language textbook, including listing his major professional society memberships. The original copyvio article establishes that Bakhoum meets <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> notability, under several categories. The current article does not, but there is a difference between "Doesn't meet" and "Article doesn't currently show how they meet". Subject just has to be notable. Is the current article a CV, or just weak? It does not appear to contain the earlier CV quotes from the book.

<p>I see the article as a very interesting article and it has imporoved a lot and should be kept. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.114.58.8 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.114.58.8_19a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.114.58.8">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><s>*<b>Keep</b></s>:Although Egypt has a very long and ancient history of great architecture, its present has very few scientists and engineers. Dr. Prof. Michel Bakhoum was one of the few present engineers who highly contributed to the current Egyptian engineering. He was not only a great and genius engineer but also a great Professor, who taught as mentioned in the article more than ten thousand civil engineers. His designs and teachings has greatly affected the urban development of the city of Cairo and many other cities in Egypt. I believe the article should be kept to inform young students all over the world about his great achievements that are an incentive to each and everyone to achieve more in his/her career. I as a young Egyptian female engineer do not rely on what our ancient Egyptians did but value their mind and their great architecture as much as I value Dr. Michel Bakhoum, the teacher and model of thousands. People like him, who achieve and serve for all their lives are for all of us, young researchers, great examples. Therefore I, and my fellow young scientists and engineers, believe the article must be kept because Dr. Michel Bakhoum is not a forgotten history but a living influence. User:Dina Bakhoum</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I have changed my vote due to the revision of the article, I cannot help but be concerned about the contributions to the discussion and the article by what appear to be relatives of the subject (User:Dr. Mourad Michel Bakhoum/User:62.135.100.52 and User:Dina Bakhoum/User:62.114.58.8 in the AfD discussion, for example.) I do not disagree that Dr. Bakhoum is notable enough to warrant an article, but it seems that these two contributors, being relatives, present the possibility of not adhering to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I do understand and appreciate your concern about our votes being relatives to the subject but I want to assure you that the reason for our votes is not because we are related to Michel Bakhoum, but because we believe he was an important Egyptian figure with great achievements. Michel Bakhoum is listed in wikipedia in the list of famous Egyptian people among other Egyptian architects. His contributions to Egyptian engineering are no less important than those of the recent architect Hassan Fathy or the ancient Egyptian architect Imhotep. As engineers and as Egyptians (not as relatives) we would like our votes to be considered as we believe that he is, as mentioned before, a living influence and not a forgotten history. <small>Dina Bakhoum</small></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Please, keep this article. It helps preserve the legacy of a great person who contributed a lot to the development of modern Egypt. I grew up in Cairo, Egypt and went to the school of engineering in Cairo University. Many of us regard him as the greatest civil engineer and one of the best professors of civil engineering in the 20th century in the middle east. I believe people who know about him can contribute to this article and eventually turn it into a first class biography. <small>George Jonaris</small></li>
