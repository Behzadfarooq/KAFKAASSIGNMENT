<p>Vote for Deletion again - If every 17 year old internet geek had an article on Wikipedia then there would be twice as many pages as there are now. Seriously - this guy in unknown to 99.9999% (approximately) of the world's population. Maybe his 'invention' deserves a stub, but I doubt he does. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 21:54, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Plural; Inventions. He's Lemon Demon, and the author of Potter Puppet Pals, and the Animutation starter. I didn't know all three of those were the same person before I read this. --70.161.205.157 00:38, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>. The problem with that arguement is that he isn't just any old internet geek - he created a form of media that became vastly popular across the internet. If he had made only one flash animation that was just like everyone elses', I would most certainly agree with you. However, this is not the case. DemonicB 03:44, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>. Cicierega has created a good amount of internet presence with animutations and Potter Puppet Pals, and has received even some radio show airplay with his band Lemon Demon. While he is obscure, he deserves an entry.</p>
<p>--- <b>Keep</b>. I found this article very useful when I was looking for information about several different flash animations. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERalphael_0eaf.html" title="User:Ralphael">Ralphael</a> 06:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I voted for this before, and i'll vote again. He's very well known to a large number of people in the U.S., and created a whole style of work in flash, not just a random video or two. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolgamer_596a.html" title="User:Coolgamer">Coolgamer</a> 22:27, Mar 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Potter Puppet Pals is known to at least 75% of my school! He's like an idol to us! He's given us a way to annoy the crap out of a horrible, mean teacher at our school without getting in trouble Neil rocks!</p>
<p><br />
He's notable enough if I can make a Potter Puppet Pals reference to a total stranger and have them go "You've seen that too?!" IzzyFerret 04:32, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is incredible about Wikipedia is that one can look up even the most obscure of topics, and have something come up. It has amazing, up to date information on so many different topics. This is the reason I choose Wikipedia over Encyclopedia Britannica. This article is where I first learned about Neil Cicierega, then finding his band Lemon Demon, which I loved. My belief is if even one person could possibly get something useful out of the article, it should not be deleted. --Aztennenbaum 19:58, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Some people are just being a little bitter, here. He is obviously talented and has reached a good deal of people. My friends and I can't seem to get enough of Potter Puppet Pals or the Ultimate Showdown. Absolutely keep. --JECardinale 23:09, 02 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>. Other than someone's (or several someone's) elitist attitude of what does or doesn't belong here, what real reason is there to delete this? The first place I came to look for info on Cicierega was Wikipedia, and was happy to find an article here. --<a href="../../../k/y/t/User%7EKythri_a03a.html" title="User:Kythri">Kythri</a> 03:45, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>. I don't think Cicierega is insignificant at all; he recently produced another very famous flash movie (Ultimate Showdown) and his popularity is only rising. Isn't Wikipedia for information, anyhow? <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenniru_032a.html" title="User:Tenniru">Tenniru</a> 02:53, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I beleive I have correctly shown the references for this article. or atleast, the part of it I mainly put up their. Hopefully that will be enough to make sure it is factual. if not, could someone double check the format? Also, I say this article definityl needs to stay since Neil has such a large following. just because not everyone has heard of him, doesnt mean that he is not important enough to put up. Besides, This one article is also serving as info for his works and his bands. Furthermore, I am a big hairy gay. --Buckinin 11:57, 31 January 2006</p>
