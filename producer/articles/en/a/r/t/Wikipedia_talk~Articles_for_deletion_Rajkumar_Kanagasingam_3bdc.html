<ul>
<li>The primary criterion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> only requires multiple, non-trivial mentions in appropriate sources. Although perhaps marginal, several of these references meet that criterion. Thus he is notable. As outlined in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">WP:N#Notability is not subjective</a>, editors are not required to judge his achievements, the media has done it for us. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 19:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm somewhat concerned that all the references for the Wikipedia article appear to come from either newspaper articles written by the subject of the WP article, or from unsigned newspaper articles in papers he wrote columns for, and that it's therefore not unreasonable to think he might have written those unsigned articles. I'm not sure how to apply the notability criteria in this case, which is why I'm not putting forward an opinion on the merits of the AFD. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastChanceToBe_b802.html" title="User:LastChanceToBe">LastChanceToBe</a> 20:07, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>URGENT COMMENT</b>: Please do not reformat this page again unless you discuss the reformatting on the talk page <b>first</b> and get the approval of the people whose comments you intend to move around. Twice, now, comments which were put in specific indentations by people who were intending to make a reply have been moved around incorrectly. I understand that the editors who did it were only trying to help, but such changes should be discussed first, since the changes were incorrect both times. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastChanceToBe_b802.html" title="User:LastChanceToBe">LastChanceToBe</a> 18:08, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First of all following <a href="../../../t/p/g/WP%7ETPG_5557.html" title="WP:TPG">WP:TPG</a> and keeping votes to their separate lines and replies correctly tabbed underneath them makes it a lot easier for the closing admin to see the votes, which is why I formatted it that way. And if you say any error in that things will have been much better off if you took the trouble to correct the formatting than simply reverting.

<dd>You didn't understand what I was saying. I'm saying that both of the reformats <b>put comments in the wrong place</b>. I had to revert, because if my comments were put in the wrong place then I must assume that it's possible that someone else's comments were put in the wrong place. Having seen that there was a serious error in reformatting, I wasn't going to go and try to correct it myself. I was going to put things back the way the original commenters had put things, and then state that discussion needed to happen about where people's comments belonged. And that's what's happening now in this talk page. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastChanceToBe_b802.html" title="User:LastChanceToBe">LastChanceToBe</a> 19:19, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Me and snowolfd4 was following the <a href="../../../t/p/g/WP%7ETPG_5557.html" title="WP:TPG">WP:TPG</a>. You are the one who messed it up buddy. If you found that one of you message was on the wrong place, what you had to do is fixing that(only that). Not simply reverting all. Since we are not mind readers how can we understand your feelings. You just said <i>"I had to revert, because if my comments were put in the wrong place"</i>. Even anyone who reading through will understand that you are commenting on Bakaman's vote.
