<li><b>Keep</b>, the book is very notable. The article itself should definitely be cleaned up to read more like an encyclopedia article, but not deleted. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 08:27, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The article sounds like the person just copied parts of the book word-for-word. I can't check myself at the moment since I don't have the book.

<li><b>Keep</b>, seminal work that needs an article. The summary, though, is ... pretty nerdy. As far as I can tell from Google Books (which blanks large chunks) this really is a conceptual summary, section by section. I'm pretty sure that isn't the best way to write an encyclopedia article about a book (it's more like a Cliff's Notes approach). I suggest excising it and rewriting it all in a handful of paragraphs. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe that since it's free and clear, a <b>transwiki</b> of the book summary to Wikisource would be one way to salvage this editor's obviously diligent work. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:33, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - OMG - How many assumptions can be cast without any knowledge!? I am actively writing the article. The book is 1. VERY noteworthy, 2. Difficult to decipher, as it is written in a very polemical style. I am summarizing the book, section by section, as a prelude to any better work that can be done later. If anyone thinks they can just sum up the work in one swoop, let them go ahead! I have read the book several times, and without first summarizing it <i>diligently</i> and systematically, it would be impossible to glean the actual argument from the forest of polemical debates which seem to permeate the book.</li>

<dd>I particularly resent being accused of copyright violation! Where? This is a summary, my own work, with minor quotes which are totally "fair use". <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamfreed_8ebe.html" title="User:Samfreed">Samfreed</a> 10:03, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please give us an indication as to <i>how many</i> quotes there are.

<dd>Let me put it this way, most of the quotes are from places where <i>Dreyfus himself</i> is quoting others, though not all. This is definitely fair use. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamfreed_8ebe.html" title="User:Samfreed">Samfreed</a> 14:00, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Samfreed, please take the questions about the article in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>, as this is not personal. You obviously have access to the book, others do not. The sheer volume of text in the article, and the way it is structured like a table of contents, should make any editor want to take a second look. In part this is because few articles about books in Wikipedia look anything like this -- that is, they are <i>articles about the book</i>, not articles summarizing the book. I would like you to consider that writing how the book was received and what sorts of criticism and influence it has had are more encyclopedic things to include than a blow-by-blow analysis of the arguments, particularly since that comes perilously close to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> (and thereby jeopardizes the existence of the article itself). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:57, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, you seem a much more experienced wikipedian than myself, so teach me. This is Dreyfus's most important work in the field of AI criticism.

<li><b>Keep</b> and tag for <b>Cleanup</b> - notability established, however article reads like a (lengthly) book report. Suggest editor(s) remove "work in progress" part to subpage, edit massively, citing sources, prior to attempting to integrate with article, or simply remove all that and add in little tiny well sourced bits. Should be article <i>about</i> book, with <i><b>brief</b></i> summary, not condensed version of book. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 16:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the article. The book seems notable to me; it meets the "heard of it before I read a Wikipedia article about it" test, and I'm fairly sure it's been discussed by Daniel Dennett. On the other hand, I suspect that portions of the text here might find a more worthwhile home in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence.html" title="Philosophy of artificial intelligence">philosophy of artificial intelligence</a> article. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:30, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> very notable book. Needs proper referencing and an overhaul, though. Quick advice to the author, you can work on articles in a subpage of your user page and release them when they are done in the future. - <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnas_Salloum_27fd.html" title="User:Anas Salloum"><font color="black"><b>Anas</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/a/User_talk%7EAnas_Salloum_76de.html" title="User talk:Anas Salloum"><font size="-4"><font color="DodgerBlue">Talk<b>?</b></font></font></a></sup> 16:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very notable book (see the statistics provided above by <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">User:Delirium</a> and <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">User:Dhartung</a>). However, it does need to be cleaned up and improved so that it is not a summary of the book (possibly transwiki to WikiSource but without deleting the article). Also, "appears to be at least arguably copyright violation" is no reason for deletion <i>unless</i> the copyright violation can be proven. At the least, the nom should have raised the issue on the talk page or contacted the primary author of the article. I could not find evidence of either action being taken. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:17, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Week Keep</b> A read the full article and alot of the book now. The author is paraprasing and is definatly not directly copying. The article needs a focus more on the book itself, and not on preaching the books message--155.144.251.120 21:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your efforts to understand are appreciated. I am writing this article - and as you, who read the book, can see - to even give a summary of what Dreyfus is trying to say, I need to first clean out an awful lot of polemics.
