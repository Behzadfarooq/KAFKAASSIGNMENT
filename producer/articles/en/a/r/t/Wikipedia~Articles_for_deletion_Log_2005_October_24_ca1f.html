<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've never heard of it either, but with hundreds of strips under their belt and a pretty decent sized <a href="http://www.jimburgessdesign.com/comics/fanart/" class="external text" title="http://www.jimburgessdesign.com/comics/fanart/" rel="nofollow">fanart</a> page it seems pretty notable to me. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 06:58, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Absolutely <b>Keep</b> - comic is on <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a>, a notable webcomics syndicate of which almost every other strip has an article. As a result, <a href="http://www.dayfreepress.com:81/network/ableandbaker/Able%20and%20Baker/short_ableandbaker2-a.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dayfreepress.com:81/network/ableandbaker/Able%20and%20Baker/short_ableandbaker2-a.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> appears as a sponsored link from both <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">Questionable Content</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Dinosaur_Comics_952e.html" title="Daily Dinosaur Comics">Daily Dinosaur Comics</a>. Furthermore, the editor of Dayfree was named as one of the 25 notable webcomics people in Comixpedia for 2004, and used his interview there to mention Able and Baker as a hot strip. Since Dayfree membership is by application, its membership in the syndicate constittues a jdugment of quality and notability from a highly important source. I also ask whoever closes this debate to glance at <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_Webcomics_0e1f.html" title="User:Snowspinner/Webcomics">User:Snowspinner/Webcomics</a> - I believe I have qualifications that make me a particular expert on webcomics and their notability, which might be taken as relevent in determining consensus. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 06:59, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b>. Does <i>sponsored link</i> mean advertizement, or something else? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 11:12, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In this case it means unpaid advertisement - the Dayfree strips all run an adbox that randomly serves up an ad for one of the other Dayfree strips. The adbox doesn't appear along with other ads on the site, but as part of the framing. It's probably best to go look at, say, <a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.questionablecontent.net" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - the box that says Dayfree Press? Periodically advertises Able and Baker. (The other ad in that section is for QC merchandise - the point being that an ad in that section is a different thing from the top banner ads, which are generally for unrelated things) <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 15:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Per above, though i dont think Snowspinners presented qualifications necessarily mean his <s>vote</s> opinion should weigh heavier. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War">The Minister of War</a> 09:55, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>And if this page were about votes, I would agree wholeheartedly, but I take the move away from calling it "votes" for deletion to mark a change in that. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 10:34, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The wording change was made to recognize this is about <i>consensus</i>, not voting. I don't know of any reason to believe it was to give greater weight to one user than another; opinions here are intended to be grounded in Wikipedia policy rather than expertise or anything else. (Generally, FYI, any view either way is counted, whether grounded in a specific policy or not, with the exception of apparent <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppets_c28f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppets">sockpuppets</a>.) -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 10:54, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>"consensus" beats actual expertise? That statement is, on the face of it, ridiculous - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 12:18, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Expertise beats consensus? Does that make any more sense? Agreed, its not a vote.

<ul>
<li>Expertise surely should beat people who know nothing about a topic but weigh in anyway. This isn't a "vote" - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 12:48, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This seems to me to be a very anti-Wikipedian notion, Mr. Gerard. All of us voting, I hope, have done our homework as best we can. I think the most important expertise to have is to be familiar with general Wikipedia standards for notability. Experts can provide <i>information</i>, but according to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#The_role_of_expert_editors" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research#The_role_of_expert_editors</a> they must provide sources! Nobody gives me a free pass when I write physics articles; I have to find sources both in and out of academia if someone feels like questioning what I write—and I've done so before. The problem here is that Snowspinner's primary source, Dayfree Press, wouldn't normally qualify as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable source</a> per Wikipedia policy. This not being a vote certainly does <i>not</i> mean it's a matter for experts only to decide! -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 16:01, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're applying a policy to a realm it was never meant to apply to, first of all - yes, it would be original research for me to go and start adding to Wikipedia articles, "In the view of Philip Sandifer, this webcomic is particularly important." It would not, of course, be original research for someone else to do so based on anything I were to publish on a given webcomic. But all of this is beside the point, because deletion debates are not article writing. It is absolutely not original research to consult with a subject expert on the importance of a topic to decide whether to write about it - it's a perfectly intuitive and obvious thing to do. Indeed, we consult with experts on a number of non-article writing matters in Wikipedia - Jimbo has done so in a debate regarding the creation of a separate Cantonese Wikipedia, for instance, and we have <a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">Template:Expert</a> for a reason. Second of all, you misunderstand what a reputable source is for - Dayfree's website is a perfectly reputable source for the matter of "What comics are in the Dayfree syndicate right now," and consulting it is not original research - primary sources are acceptable sources, although assembling them in "novel" ways is not. I do not find any novelty in asserting that Able and Baker is on a syndicate that it is on, however. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 16:44, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point is, I am not sure that presence on Dayfree is an indicator of notability—and you are effectively using it as a "source" to assert exactly this. I think this is a point of legitimate difference of opinion, which is why we are seeing well-thought-out views on both sides—but I don't see how expertise makes one view count more. I claim that expertise in a field, <i>in general</i>, might give the expert a distorted sense of its importance, so that expertise is actually <i>more</i> relevant for article-writing than AfD's! This, combined with the explicit statement on consensus in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, makes me pretty sure that "expert" views are not intended to count double. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 16:59, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And them my question becomes, on what grounds of knowledge do you say that Dayfree isn't notable? I mean, to be honest, I have doubts about the quality of your view, since I remember explaining yesterday the nature of the Modern Tales syndicate. But no, expert views shouldn't count double, because this whole notion of "counting" misses the point. To use an extreme pair of examples, as a closing admin, if I find a nomination with five votes of "Delete nn" and one vote of "Actually, as a subject expert, this is a really important article in the field," I will keep the article, assuming the subject expert claim is decently backed up. On the other hand, if I find an article with five keep votes, the first of which is a subject expert claim and the next four of which are "Keep, agree with X," and then a lone delete vote demonstrating copyvio, as a closing admin, I will delete. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:10, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Normally, again, you would cite some sort of <i>external</i> source to indicate Dayfree is notable; my concern is that most evidence you provide is somewhat circular, or confined within a set of webcomics that assert each others' notability. I shouldn't <i>have</i> to be an expert to understand evidence that something is notable; if it's that obscure, it doesn't seem such a good argument of notability to me. I believe that the action you propose for closing a debate would be inappropriate and inconsistent with Wikipedia precedent; admins (and everyone else) should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and not discount arguments of established users because they make a personal judgement about the "quality of [their] views." -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 17:40, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>However, I propose this as a compromise: your expertise, and arguments, seem to be swaying peoples' opinions to your side. That <i>is</i> part of consensus, and if that's how it goes then this is an AfD I don't mind "losing." I say again we should move forward on getting <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> up to snuff: I propose a set of criteria based on a list of syndicates and hosting services, along with awards and other critical attention, with Alexa used only as a backup. Maybe you could put a list of appropriate syndicates and hosting services on the discussion page, along with a bit about them, so we can put a new proposal together? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 17:40, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh - so you're looking for a link like <a href="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2011" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2011" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> where the founder of Dayfree is tagged as the 11th person in a list of 25 people in webcomics? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 18:06, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, that's the idea. And then we should discuss. My question is: does one person/host being notable mean that everyone associated with him is notable? It seems to be that, in general, a notable host may not make a notable webcomic—for example, <a href="../../../k/e/e/KeenSpace_d4c1.html" title="KeenSpace">KeenSpace</a> is clearly notable, but only some comics there are. It's not obvious, so we have to figure out how to decide. I think I'm likely to agree with you pretty substantially, but we really have to get these arguments ouf of AfD's. Guidelines will help a lot with that. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 18:14, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In this case, yes - Dayfree is editorially chosen, Keenspace is "anyone can join." So the notability is that the comic was specifically chosen by #11 on Comixpedia's 25 people in webcomics list for a syndicate. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 18:22, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I don't find "membership with Dayfree" a particularly moving argument for notability; after all, Dayfree is in and of itself borrowing notability (from comics like Questionable Content and Dinosaur Comics). That said, I've been trying to talk to the people on the A&amp;B forum to establish some other claim of notability, with some mixed success.<br />
For the record, deleting this article won't destroy it as a useful resource for webcomic fans or fans of the comic; this article is already on Comixpedia, and the fans of the webcomic already know about the Comixpedia entry. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 18:26, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The idea that the syndicate is drawing its notability from its member comics is strange, to say the least.

Its claim to fame is that the editors of Dayfree Press, one of the oldest webcomics syndicates, judged it to be a comic worth making part of their syndicate.

My reasons are much the same as Snowspinner's, but I'd like to add this: we're building the sum total of human knowledge here. If you want to look something up, it should be <b>here</b>--not the Comixpedia wiki, though that's a fine place; not the cast page for the comic, be it ever so finely crafted; it should be here, because only here do we have the freedoms and the effort to provide excellent encyclopedic information for webcomics. It'd be sad if a proposed notability rule got in the way of that. (Able and Baker, at 400 strips, hits my internal gut-feel for "big enough." In writing this, I wanted to know more about the comic, and Wikipedia is where I found the best information.) <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Taron_97ef.html" title="User:Philip Taron">Philip</a> 04:48, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I do not agree with the fact that being a member of Dayfree Press equals instant notability. The dayfree press is a comic collective, motivated towards the promotion of its comics. Just because <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a> is linked from a notable webcomic, or webcomic portal, doesn't mean that it is instantly notable. What about saying that every signed band for the most minor of record labels should have an article? What about every book/pamflet/flyer printed by the same publisher as the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> publisher? The only argument for keeping this, is that it belongs to a comic promotion syndicate. It has not on its own done anything notable, there is no in depth coverage from either the mainstream press or even the webcomic press. In the previous deletion debate, the only assertion of notability were the fan's chimes of, "It was mentioned one in passing by the Dayfree Press founder on comixPedia", and so far, that's still the only thing I see. Whereas say, Little Gamers, also on the Dayfree Press, I think is notable, because it appears in a national magazine, PC GAMER. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 17:53, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b> non-notable, as per brenneman and others. There is nothing in this article that would indicate notability -- the article explains only that this is a webcomic and it has characters. This webcomic is not award-winning, widely-read, critically-acclaimed, or in any other way notable enough for an encyclopedia entry. Alexa ranking of 1,116,269 is far too high for a web site to be considered notable. The artist's output (someone pointed to 400 comics) does not indicate notability when almost no one is reading those 400 comics. Further, not all members of notable comics groups are notable (just as there are non-notable actors in notable films, non-notable bands on notable record labels, etc.), and the notability of this comic syndicate is itself questionable, as per A Man In Black. Being almost-sorta mentioned in Comixpedia is not any indicator of notability; Comixpedia allows comics artists to post their own news and regularly writes about non-notable comics (See <a href="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1253&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1253&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0" rel="nofollow">L33t Pixels</a>, etc.) <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 18:22, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The page appears to have sources indicating notability. On issues of verifiability, and <i>objective</i> notability, personal opinion cannot be <i>expert</i> without sources. Anyone holding themselves out as <i>expert</i> should produce sources upon polite request. Consensus matters much than <i>expertise</i> because expertise is an imprecise term open to too much varying interpretation (especially in areas of pop-culture where objective certification) and <i>abuse</i> (by people claiming expertise without warrant.)

I also did the same for the dayfreepress, and it also is poorly known. This has been compared to a comic syndication medium, but really it appears just to be a glorified banner ad service from their mission statement.

It is widely read, thus any mistakes are very public. It has history, in that if it <i>had</i> a long series of mistakes to its name, we'd know. It has a <i>reputation</i> based upon both of these things, and thus to some degree is <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootstrapping.html" title="Bootstrapping">bootstrapped</a> by other reputable organisations.

<dd>And, while I'm not disputing your expertise, "common sense" dictates that if (for example) you were claiming that expertise without any supporting evidence I'd be disinclined to believe it. Despite the flurry of "Keep per Snowspinner" opinions voiced above, we've yet to see a single source cited <i>external to the webcomics world</i>. It shouldn't matter if it's "Neanderthal theory of the autism spectrum" or "Diesel Sweeties", we should be able to find reputable sources. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 12:06, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If it were "Neanderthal theory of the autism spectrum", we'd expect to find that our sources were those which normally cover Neanderthals and/or autism. I don't know what "Diesel Sweeties" is. Webcomics as a whole are a form of web culture that hasn't attracted much mainstream media attention, so they are a much more difficult to find authorities on because traditionally reliables sources haven't chosen to cover them much. Some degree of self-referentialism is to be expected, just as Reuters, AP, CNN, et. al. all reference each other. Cite the best references available in the article, and allow the reader to decide the reputability of them. Tag the article to indicate your lack of faith in the sources if you need to. But since it is a <u>web</u>comic, merely looking at the comic to verify its continued existence over a period of time, and seeing the public response to it satisfies some degree of verifiability. Inclusion in a known syndicate adds more. I think we have enough here primariliy because as long as they're working in an encyclopedic style, I prefer to offer other editors good faith in pursuit of their own interests, and see what develops. Snowspinner is clearly an editor working in good faith on encyclopedia articles that interest him. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 15:30, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's not actually the case. Academics have a thing called "peer review" which consists not only of discussions amongst themselves, but publishing in reputable (if not widely known) locations. If there do exist topics so obscure that only a handful of people know about them and that do not have a peer-review methodology, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia. I've said this above, but I'll say it again: that's what "no original research" says. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 09:46, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>, I can testify that Steve did not post this article. I did. I posted it because it needs to be defined. You may not like advertising, but advercasting will in fact become popular, if not in 2006 then definitely by 2007. This is not an ordinary advertising method. Advercasting has many advantages over traditional advertings, specifically the maven (see The Tipping Point) audience, thus it needs to be defined. Furthermore, there are a number of other links out there that discuss the term, such as lexblog.com and droxy.com. As mentioned above, I did in fact request the article then add it a few minutes later because I've never added a new article here before. It was not clear to me at first that I could simply create the article on my own. Like Steve said, if you think he created it to promote his site, then just remove the link and the reference to him.

<li><b>Comment As Response</b>. I would politely suggest that you read some of the foregoing comments. The issue with this article is not 'self-promotion' (as you appear to believe) but the fact that the descriptive term is a neologism and runs against Wiki policy. Additionally, and with the greatest respect, sir, you may *say* whatever you please. Nevertheless, you are *saying* it from an anonymous IP account rather than taking the trouble to register as a user.

<p>This article's reason for existence appears to be to resolve the confusion created by defining the chemical term <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_%28unit%29.html" title="Mole (unit)">mole (unit)</a> as the arbitrary "amount of substance" rather than a defined number of particles (<a href="../../../a/v/o/Avogadro%27s_number.html" title="Avogadro's number">Avogadro's number</a>). I have clarified the explanation in the mole article and see no reason anymore for the existence of this one.

<li>Make that a very strong keep, once I find out that after all <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a>'s blather above about how "I have clarified the explanation" I go to the <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avogadro%27s_number.html" title="Avogadro's number">Avogadro's number</a> article and the phrase "amount of substance" is curiously completely absent from that page, nowhere to be found at all. To compound the problem even more, after Blainster's last edit to the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_%28unit%29.html" title="Mole (unit)">mole (unit)</a> page, the only mention of "amount of substance" in that article was in the quoted CGPM definition, plus the category link at the bottom of the page. Not a whole lot of discussion about it there, either, obviously. Note that the metrologists use substance as a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_noun.html" title="Mass noun">mass noun</a> in this context; Blainster's uses it with definite or indefinite articles, treating it differently linguistically. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 19:58, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you for your gracious contribution, Gene. I have not touched the Avogadro's number article, which competently describes the subject by explaining that it is a <i>quantity</i>.

<p>This article reads like poorly written advertising. It makes grandiose claims regarding identity with the key personages of yoga history.

For someone that supposedly lived and played rugby in Australia, 1. he knows surprisingly little about the game, 2. didn't even have the basic gear at the first several practices, and 3. isn't very good at what parts of the game he does know. Unless you would like to read the very candid opinions of the rugby team (and other large groups of people that Ed has annoyed) I would say delete this entry and forbid Ed from ever accessing this site again. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.61.51.28 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.61.51.28_a2d6.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.61.51.28">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>I think he has done some reputable things deserving accolades and will get more. Even though he goes to state I still think he deserves an autobiographical entry up here. Is there another Ed Hula III that wants his information on instead of this one? Is Ed Hula III a contested definition? do ya'll spend your day looking for people's autobiographys to say they are pathetic delete them?

<p>We actually are not hackers at all, this is a site where we make custom mods which are legal and endorsed by Bungie (the creator of the game), we also use it as a forum to discuss our projects and life as it is.</p>
<p>The "vanity entries" were put up so that new members could find information on who they are talking with on the forums.</p>
<p>The reason you did not find any Alexa data is because we were recently forced to change servers, as you would know had you actually read the article itself. We are starting off from square one.</p>
<p>The site is up and running at www.hackhalo.org.</p>
<p>However, if you read what the homepage says you will see that you must click on the forums button which leads you to www.hackhalo.org/forums.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm the original poster (laptop just crashed, that's why I signed on as new today BTW), and yes, I'm new to Wiki (which is great, IMHO!) but I just posted several more links to references to house humping and related context. I'm a member of the Yahoo group, and yes, I know this is a true phenomenon (just ask my fiance). In England, maybe you have <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottaging.html" title="Cottaging">Cottaging</a> for gay folks, but that's no stranger a fetish than house humping, which seems to be primarily hetero, but not exclusively. I understand that the term itself is new, but based on our user group messages and other correspondence, this has been going on since the beginning of the hot real estate market about 5 years ago. Someone in our group said there's a movie that had a scene about it, but they called it "sexy swiping" which I think involves sex and stealing, so that's slightly different. Frankly, the CSI reference was new to me, but that only proves the point. Not sure how else to prove it to you unless you have an open house and invite us over. --St germain23 13:27, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. OK, points well taken and respected. Not sure if this counts as verifiability, but just last night, CNBC's evening news had a whole piece about that movie - I guess the name is Open House - and how one of the plot elements is people having sex in open houses. the reporter mentioned either house hunting, or house humping - it was hard to make out which. In any case, it verifies the phenomenon if not the terminology itself. I tracked down the film's page and they've got the clip up from CNBC. As the kids say, 'are we there yet?' --St germain23 13:27, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> in order to be considered factual, an article on Wikipedia needs to reference and demonstrate its facts in reliable third-party sources. These can be in the form of academic journals, (reputable) newspaper or magazine articles, books, and so forth - we call it <i>verifiability</i>. If we can't verify it, there's no proof that this actually exists, or that if it exists it is worth putting in an encyclopedia. There's often a strong reaction in Wikipedia to perceived advertising pages - that is, pages created solely to promote a company that is otherwise unexceptional - and I haven't seen anything to prove that this is otherwise. If you feel that other articles are the same (unverifiable advertising, that is), that is an argument to delete those articles also, not keep this one. Please indicate which articles you feel meet the same criteria! <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font><font color="black">iggurat</font></a> 23:37, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> great, I'm glad to hear it. If you <i>add</i> properly cited <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">references</a> to the publications (IEEE / technical sound good - anyone can be granted a patent) to the article I'm sure that will carry a lot of weight in the deletion discussion. If they're newsworthy, where have news items about them been published? We cannot merely take anyone's word that they've seen citations - we need to have the reference itself so that other people can check up on it. It's also worth noting that putting up three votes from one person is also frowned upon in Wikipedia, as it could be perceived as trying to subvert the voting/discussion process (something we call 'sockpuppeting'). <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font><font color="black">iggurat</font></a> 00:15, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Indeed, until today I had never heard of this language, and the number of ghits makes me suspect that it is completely unknown even within the conlanger community. As for other conlangs: there are indeed a fair amount of them, but keep in mind that they all have to meet certain requirements of notability. The article doesn't make it clear that it meets any of them. Besides, it's generally not taken well when people write articles about themselves or their own creations. Please take a look at the discussion at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConlangs_9d9c.html" title="Wikipedia:Conlangs">Wikipedia:Conlangs</a> to get an impression. Jeff, I strongly suggest that you move this page to the <a href="http://conlang.wikicities.com" class="external text" title="http://conlang.wikicities.com" rel="nofollow">Conlang wiki</a> and/or to your own userspace.

<li>Thank you for your respone, I shall move this article to langmaker and other such CL websites. Please note that upon recognition, This article will return to Wikipedia in a few weeks.

<li>Just checked out langmaker and LangMakerWin, very amateur programs (the basic template doesn't include numbers or words such as "you" and "I."), any other sites?

<li>Hang on, are you referring to the LangMaker software? But that's not what I mean! Langmaker is a conlang directory, by far the most extensive one on the Internet.

<li>I want to comment a few things. First of all, the Alexa ranking of the KiwiLyrics site is 1,404,594. Very very low. Second of all, many (if not all) the wikilinks to KiwiLyrics are contained in "external links" sections with the format "band lyrics at KiwiLyrics". A number of those entries were added by <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPankkake_4e5d.html" title="User:Pankkake">User:Pankkake</a>, or should I say <a href="http://www.kiwilyrics.com/User:Pankkake" class="external text" title="http://www.kiwilyrics.com/User:Pankkake" rel="nofollow">User:Pankkake</a>, today. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 22:02, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was renaming Kiwilyrics to KiwiLyrics when I saw the deletion notice. This site has over 170,000 songs (according to the homepage), and is the only one wiki-based lyrics site. Also, there is a more complete (OK, it's not difficult) <a href="../../../../de/k/i/w/KiwiLyrics_fe40.html" class="extiw" title="de:KiwiLyrics">deutsch</a> article. By the way, I'm also adding links to MusicBrainz (and there I link back to WP). - <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPankkake_4e5d.html" title="User:Pankkake">pankkake</a> 22:46, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Ok, so fur numerical purposes, the following are discounted:</p>
<ol>

<li>Wikipedian2005</li>
<li>Telestylo</li>
<li>Simonrexfan</li>
<li>Promisekeeper2005</li>
<li>Thearticulator</li>
<li>Shadow demon</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, Shard and Robin Johnson each have around 10 Wikipedia: space edits and I'm usually minded to numerically remove them too. Angr's actual vote is a little unclear, but given the current state of the list and the apparent lack of persuasion among other deleters (i.e. not referenced adequately for them), it sounds more like a delete. In any case, excluding <i>all</i> the names I mentioned so far, I get 25d-11k. Including them all I get 28d-11k (or 27d if Angr's a delete). Further, Brazilfantoo's Wikipedia: space edits are almost exclusively to this AfD and so I <i>could</i> discount on that basis. Given the considerable energy invested here by that editor, however, for the numerics they are counted, and it would be hard to give the debate a sound reading without taking account of what they say. Whichever way, we're numerically over two-thirds and there is lots of participation. So is there a good reason to raise the deletion threshold? Well, from reading the debate, it is illuminating that the list of 'references' that is cited twice are actually just <b>pictures</b> and to reach a factual conclusion from them <i>necessarily</i> demands interpretation. That has been demonstrated quite clearly here to fall below the standards of NPOV and NOR in the opinion of significantly many participants. The references in the article clearly haven't satisfied many people either, and they don't appear to actually deal with the individuals in the article, with one possible exception. Lacking that kind of verification, the list is evidently below WP:V too. It is also apparent that the deleters are not in the least, in a single case, persuaded by the keepers and so I do not think there has been a change of perception during the debate as sometmies happens. It is often telling when the first response to the nomination is <i>"invalid because I don't like the reason"</i>; you have to counter the reason, not put your fingers in your ears. I also have no time at all for the parts of the debate centering on accusations of wanton censorship: it's just such a bald assumption of bad-faith that it doesn't fly; and I know enough of Shreshth91 that I genuinely don't think s/he'd nominate any article for that reason alone. Short answer: I don't find any successfully formulated and defended reason to consider that something in the region of 70% or more is not a reasonable threshold as oftentimes used in AfD closures, and so the deletes have it. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:30, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Suggesting deletion on the grounds of either POV or nonsense are both spurious. Please give a proper reason why you think this article should be deleted. --DannyWilde 10:09, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this article should be kept, for the reasons I stated on the discussion page. First, the very first paragraph of the page about <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_size.html" title="Penis size">penis size</a> talks about the fact that penis size is important to men. Second, if there is going to be a page on Wikipedia about <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size_queen.html" title="Size queen">size queens</a>, then why not a page about the kind of men that the size queens would like? Third, this is not POV because some of these men have been featured in videos and/or movies that demonstrate that they are indeed well endowed; and this page is not truly whether these specific men <i>truly are</i> well endowed, but that they have become <i>famous for being</i> well endowed (the fact that we don't have any pictures of Milton Berle nude never intereferred with the fact that he became famous for being well endowed). Go look at the page on <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Berle_5435.html" title="Milton Berle">Milton Berle</a>; everyone who knows about him knows that he was famous for being well endowed, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Talk%7EMilton_Berle_be8b.html" title="Talk:Milton Berle">but no one felt they could mention that on the page about him because they didn't think it would be "proper."</a> This page gives them a place to mention something about Milton Berle that he was very, very famous for! Why is it proper to have a page about <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nude_celebrities_on_the_internet.html" title="Nude celebrities on the internet">nude celebrities on the internet</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size_queen.html" title="Size queen">size queens</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_size.html" title="Penis size">penis size</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_enlargement.html" title="Penis enlargement">penis enlargement</a>, and not a page on something that is often discussed in popular culture? If anyone can give me a good reason, then I'll vote for deletion. Until then, I say <b>keep</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> again. This discussion should not even be taking place. No valid reason to delete this article has been given. The article obviously is <b>not</b> point-of-view, and it is obviously <b>not</b> nonsense. I would vote to keep the article if I thought this was a genuine discussion, but the AfD nomination itself has not been justified at all and should probably be regarded as vandalism. Further, the AfD nomination was not properly carried out according to the Wikipedia procedure, and this article still is not showing up properly on the above page. --DannyWilde 11:29, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. By what criteria do you judge that it isn't appropriate for an encyclopedia? First of all, <a href="../../../f/a/m/Fame.html" title="Fame">fame</a> itself is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">Penis</a> is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_size.html" title="Penis size">Penis size</a> is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_enlargement.html" title="Penis enlargement">Penis enlargement</a> is encyclopedic. Lists of celebrities who fall into various categories is apparently an encyclopedic thing (because they're all over Wikipedia). So how is it "not encyclopedic" to combine all of the above into a list of men famous for being well endowed? This just boils down to your personal opinion. And while you're at it, please explain to me why a list of women who have had breast implants and who are <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size_queen.html" title="Size queen">size queens</a> is not encyclopedic either. -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrazilfantoo_7e98.html" title="User:Brazilfantoo">Brazilfantoo</a> 07:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: For the same reason that a list of tall actors isn't encyclopedic. It's trivial and arbitrary. However, these lists are even worse because they are based on rumor and conjecture. An encyclopedia needs verifiability. It's hard for a celebrity to hide the fact that he's 4'10", but if he says he has a footlong penis, he gets put in an encyclopedia for it, which is essentially the evidence given in some of the names on the list (Bill Maher, for one). Even the ones for which there is visual evidence, you're just going on "it looks big." It should be quantifiable. Also, it seems that some of the men were flaccid. That's a problem because some men don't get much bigger when they have an erection. The implant list has the same problem. For some it is easy to tell because their breasts have big scars and look like plastic bags full of water. For others, it is just going by "they appear to be large, and if a woman isn't fat, they couldn't be that big" or "she developed too fast" kind of thing. For the size queens, it comes down to trivia as well. How about a list of celebrities who like bunnies or chocolate? (oh god, I hope we don't have one of these). As for this information being in the biographies, I would say only if it is an important part of the person's notability, like Tommy Lee or Pamela Anderson. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:41, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> only if "well endowed" can be specifically defined in terms of inches and centimeters and if all entries are verifiable. In other words, no one can be listed just for being rumored to have a big dick. Also, the title must be adhered to: List of men <i>famous for being well endowed</i>. Milton Berle was famous, and he may have been well endowed, but he wasn't famous <i>for being</i> well endowed.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Milton Berle didn't become famous for his size, but his size WAS famous. It was talked about all the time, and it is discussed on the talk page of his Wikipedia page. Maybe the name of the page needs to be changed to something like, "Famous Men Who Are Known for Being Well Endowed" or something like that.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Several of the voters in this discussion have extremely short lists (in one case only two edits, in another only five) of "user contributions".

<li><b>Reply to comment</b>. User contributions may not necessarily affect judgement (even though their lack of experience may be unsettling) but the fact remains that all valid votes are counted, irrespective of number of contributuions. ALso, this list is POV because who gets to decide which of these men are famous for large endowments. For example, Milton Berle was famous and he may have had a large endowment, but he was not necessarily famous for it. Same is the case for Tommy Lee. Also, there aren't any sources or pics proving these claims. Most of the links are to blog sites holding discussions about these claims and nowhere is even one source stated.

<li>What you say about "equal votes for all" contradicts the official Wikipedia policy document on deletions. About POV, your opinion makes no sense; the same logic could be applied to any Wikipedia article at all. Who decides who is in the article is the editors of Wikipedia. As for verifiability, several of the claims, such as the ones about Tommy Lee, or Jimi Hendrix, in the document can be verified, and there are indeed pictures, so it is clearly not rumour mongering. --DannyWilde 07:25, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The topic of which man is well-endowed is quite common in my experience and obviously is a matter of interest to people. For example, <a href="../../../e/r/r/Errol_Flynn_9845.html" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a> was reputed to be so, and is described as being so (euphemistically) in <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Niven_f450.html" title="David Niven">David Niven</a>'s book "Bring on the Empty Horses". True or not, the story is famous. Even if the man is not well endowed in reality, as is said above to be the case for <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lee_1336.html" title="Tommy Lee">Tommy Lee</a>, surely the fact he is famous for being well-endowed but isn't really so is notable as well. I don't see the point of deleting entries because the man is proved not to be well endowed but is rumoured to be, or is rumoured to be. Very widespread rumours themselves are notable if referenced, whether true or not. --DannyWilde 14:44, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>I</i> keep saying "verifiably big" in response to others. If you want a definition of what "big" is, then read the page on <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_size.html" title="Penis size">penis size</a>. The more direct answer to your question is: the public decided who is "verifiably big". <a href="../../../v/h/1/VH1_84a4.html" title="VH1">VH1</a> has a special called "I Love the 90s." In that special, there was a man saying that <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lee_1336.html" title="Tommy Lee">Tommy Lee</a> was huge and a lot of black guys (this guy was black) were saying, "Oh, he's like us."

<li>On the contrary, the reasons you originally gave for deleting the article are spurious, so the motivation for the deletion is, presumably, censorship.

<li>But, if you hadn't noticed, this article is largely unverifiable and is rumormongering also. So censorship is not the reason for this AFD.

<ul>
<li>You seem to be implicitly admitting that the POV and nonsense arguments were invalid. That is some improvement in the quality of the discussion. As for verification, it is an important point, but that is more a matter for individual entries than an article-wide problem. I've added three entries, Jimi Hendrix, Errol Flynn, and Shunga. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> is clearly verifiable, since numerous Hendrix biographies mention the fact. Similarly for <a href="../../../e/r/r/Errol_Flynn_9845.html" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>, at the very least David Niven's book makes the claim. Similarly <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunga.html" title="Shunga">Shunga</a> have been displayed at art galleries, etc. and published many times. That deals with the three entries I've made to the article. The other two mythical entries similarly should be easy to verify from printed sources. As for the rest of it, some of them, such as Tommy Lee, appear to be wrong and should be removed from the article or put into a different section. --DannyWilde 14:25, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. This page is an inherently non-NPOV contruct. There is an attempt on the list to define neutral terms for inclusion: "<i>having a penis bigger than what statistics reveal to be average.</i>" I'm not precisely sure of the exact figure, but I believe at least one clinical study has found the average length to be around 5" (in USA). This means that a man with a penis 5.2" long is eligible for inclusion. However, would the page's editors agree? Further consideration should also make apparent that the list's stated inclusion criterion is quite absurd: it means that as long as a man has a penis that is longer than the average, he is eligible for listing, ie. 50% of males. The addition of "famous for" in the title is unhelpful, both due to the vagueness of "famous" (should we include a man with a penis 5" long who is famous for it in his remote village in Obscureland where all the other guys have 4"?) and also because most of the men on the list are <i>not</i> famous <u>for</u> having large penises. A comment was made that the solution to POV problems is not to delete but to edit. This is perfectly true, except when the construct is such that it <i>cannot be brought to NPOV</i>. We routinely delete problematic categories for exactly this reason, for example. To state it another way, it's the same reason List of uncool countries is a red-link.</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. This may be more obvious. How is the info being verified? Many of the Listees are "rumoured", "believed", or "said" to be "well-endowed", which is quite unacceptable for encyclopedic lists. There is a suggestion that videos are sufficient. They aren't, because A. most of the Listees have no video evidence, and if we delete them we'd have almost nothing, and B. it's untrue that videos would help, because of the WP:NPOV problems in 1. For example, the article claims that Tommy Lee is "famous for being well endowed [but] verifiably [isn't]". How do we make that decision neutrally? Was he acceptable per the alleged inclusion criterion of "bigger than average"? (ie. is he bigger than 5"?) If so, how was it decided that he would be labelled "verifiably not well-endowed"? Indeed, how was it decided what length defines "well-endowed"? If that length is X", would X-1" make the owner automatically "not well-endowed"?
<p>There are other WP:V concerns. Clinical studies always record the precise method measurement, and the state of the penis. How do we determine from the videos and images what the length actually is? Is it simply: "Oh... that's big. Ok, we can hereby claim that he's famous for being well-endowed?" That's not acceptable for an encyclopedia, IMHO.

<li>Some of those people clearly are in there because they made a lot of jokes about size, and there is no proof that they have any size at all. But, for example, if there was a page "comedians who make jokes about their oversized parts", what would be wrong with that in terms of bias? That is basically what is happening in that section. Also, some men actually are <b>famous for having large penises</b>. Errol Flynn &amp; Jimi Hendrix are good examples here, who fully meet the Wikipedia verifiability criteria. Also, the mythology section is actually worthwhile in itself, in my opinion; it is clearly a common theme in many cultures, and gathering a collection of mythological figures of this type is a valid exercise. As I stated before, I believe the basic motive for the delete votes is censorship, more than anything, and I feel that this censorship is what is not appropriate for an encyclopedia. --DannyWilde 14:24, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello Danny, thanks for your response. I must disagree. Hendrix and Flynn were not famous for their penises: Hendrix was an iconic pop musician, Flynn an early Hollywood star. They were famous—ie. people had and have an abiding interest in them—principally for those roles. They were not famous <i>on account of</i> their penises; that some people appear to care about their penises cannot be taken to mean that they were famous for them.

<li>As a matter of fact, my name isn't Danny. Anyway, you are incorrect, Hendrix and Flynn were both famous for being well-endowed. That may or may not be their principal claim to fame; however, the statement "famous for being well endowed" about Hendrix and Flynn is a <b>factually correct</b>, <b>neutral point of view</b>, and <b>verifiable</b>, statement. --DannyWilde 00:37, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello. I used Danny as a contraction for the username DannyWilde, not because I imagined it was your real name. As to your contentions, I'm afraid they continue to remain unconvincing. I suppose in response to your latest I could write about why, simply because David Niven wrote in a book about Errol Flynn's penis, the factual accuracy of the claim "Errol Flynn was famous for being well-endowed" is not, thereby, supported. Or I could say something about why, since "well-endowment" is an entirely subjective point-of-view, placing names (while explicitly excluding others with objectively very similar "endowments") under the List's title cannot be in concordance with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Or I could point out that the sole inclusion criterion—silly as it is—is simply being disregarded in favor of non-NPOV judgements such as <i>Tommy Lee... became famous for his large endowment... However, in reality the videos and photos of Lee do not show a notably above average size</i>, and <i>Simon Rex... is famous for his above-average endowment... However, in reality the videos and photos of Rex do not show a notably above average size</i>. But I suspect further discussion with you on this AFD is unlikely to be productive, DannyWilde.

<li>Problem is the list is not neutral, arguably cannot be neutral in its present form, and has very, very serious problems with verifiability and the WP:NOR policy. A good argument could also be made that the list is unencyclopedic, ie. not deserving of a page in a good encyclopedia. I agree that the issue of penis size can be treated encyclopedically—indeed, you could write a book on it—but that is not what this list is. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>20:33, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</i></li>

<li>There is no particular problem with verifiability. The Wikipedia criteria for verification require that there is a published source for the information, from a reputable publisher. The entries which cannot be verified can be removed, but, as I have already stated, several of the entries meet and exceed the "verifiability" criterion. The "no original research" really is unrelated, yet another attempt to tag the article with a "boo boo" word; "Delete, because it's a camembert", without thinking about what "original research" means; in other words, more name-calling, attaching labels like POV, nonsense, etc. etc. in an effort to censor the article. As I stated at the beginning of this discussion, no genuine policy reason to delete this article has been presented. --DannyWilde 02:10, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As has been previously pointed out, there are profound problems with verifiability. WP:V and WP:RS demand that the claim being made be verified by reference to reputable, independent publications. Claiming that R.Kelly, for example, is "Famous for being well endowed" requires a reference attesting to precisely that claim. A grainy screen shot of a sex video, with his penis completely covered, simply does not do that. Of course, <i>any</i> kind of image wouldn't: we cannot verify "<i>famous</i> <u>for</u> being 'well-endowed'", whatever that really means, with reference to an image. Note too the injunction in policy: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If an editor wishes to claim that an icon like Hendrix is famous <i>for</i> being 'well-endowed', rather than being famous as an iconic pop musician who happens to obtain the usual adolesecent attentions of a coterie of penis enthusiasts, evidence that shows precisely that should be provided. WP:NOR and WP:V, which are closely related, do apply. What's happening here is a few editors are making claims on that page sans evidence; instead they reference images from unreputable websites, and then <i>interpret</i> the images according to a POV, and claim this as evidence (see what's been happening with the Tommy Lee claim, for example). Looking at an image purportedly of Mr. Lee's genitals—just the image—and then claiming in the article that "in reality the... photos of Lee do not show a notably above average size" is a misrepresentation of the source, and suggests a poor understanding of how to use references.
<p>To get from [image] → [POV interpretation, eg. "<i>XYZ is <b>famous</b></i> for <i>a large penis but in fact his penis is not very large</i>"] is to</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>contravene NPOV,</li>
<li>contravene WP:V as the <i>claim</i> is unverified (read the claim and ask yourself how an image can substantiate it), and</li>
<li>probably contravene WP:NOR, because for this determination to be made not from a study or report or textual reference but from an image suggests these editors are making their own measurements and interpretations when deciding whether to include an entry (and how to word it).
<p>Incidentally, I second the call to close this AFD soon, as it is well past the standard 5 days. I hope we won't have to spend much more time discussing this trivial topic. I have felt ridiculous writing about this here, but soldiered on out of regard and concern for Wikipedia and the profound need to maintain encyclopedic standards for our project.

<li>"Silly list" has a grain of truth in it, but is that a valid criteria for deletion? For example List of famous bald people seems faintly silly to me; do you think it should be deleted? Or, since we have seen on this page an opinion that the word "famous" is a point of view word, should it be deleted for containing the word "famous"? Or, how about "bald"? Should we delete it because there is no standard definition of "bald", or should we insist on a verified maximum follicle count? The people saying the article is "unverifiable" or "point-of-view" or "nonsense" just don't know what the words they are using mean. The discussion on this page has not been much more convincing than "Delete it because it's an omelette". Once one type of "it's an omelette" name-calling has been dealt with, we move on to the next attempt to find any applicable tag to delete the article, "Delete it because it's a poached egg", etc. --DannyWilde 13:33, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. There are plenty of examples of unmaintainable lists. This is not one of them. This is very well-maintained with clear and strong guidelines for inclusion/exclusion and provides more useful information than a category.

<li>"I still find a postdoctoral fellow not notable"--<i>this isn't the basis for inclusion.</i> Would "I still find a non-PH.d not notable" be a valid criterion if Jim Wales was nominated? Would "I think people who enter but drop out of seminaries" make sense for Tom Cruise? No, obviously. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:56, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>How about "I find the idea of whittling down the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hipparcos.html" title="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> survey by <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallicity.html" title="Metallicity">metallicity</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectral_class.html" title="Spectral class">spectral class</a> etcetera to have a manageable list of star systems that could possibly harbor extraterrestrial life a boring project that does not establish a track record of notable research yet." To put "extraterrestrial life" into perspective, please note that it is often invoked by NASA to sell their research to the general public. The latest example: the Mars rovers. Planetary geology is genuinely exciting on its own, yet we see NASA put on the hype of "life on Mars" to make the project more palatable to the taxpayer or make the taxpayer pressure his Senator who might choose to spend his budget on pork projects instead. I'll get off the soapbox now, thanks for listening. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 00:24, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>So you agree that the postdoctoral fellow bit is not <i>in-itself a delete criterion?</i> Because it isn't, very obviously. The article does not reference NASA, extraterrestrial life, the Mars Rovers or any other attempt to "sell" exo-bio searches. We can agree to disagree on the rest of it. Whittling down <i>118 000 stars</i> does not establish a track record of notable research? Well, I disagree and if you follow the links in the article so, apparently, do others. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 00:42, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The interview cited in the article, which Tony mentions as well, plays heavily on extraterrestrial life. The purpose of the <a href="../../../h/a/b/HabCat_f5c2.html" title="HabCat">HabCat</a>, that Margaret has compiled, is <i>to find extraterrestrial life</i>. The criteria for <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetary_habitability.html" title="Planetary habitability">planetary habitability</a> are well estabished; the article Wikipedia has a section around what stars one might expect planets that support higher lifeforms. The rest are database searches. Yes, it really is that prosaic. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 01:06, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While admitting NASA is self-serving in who it touts, so what if the purpose of the HabCat is to find extraterrestrial life? She still gets first mention on the Sol Station habitability page and your basic Space daily, David Darling references etc. Also, having spent days on the page, I can tell you the criteria for <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetary_habitability.html" title="Planetary habitability">planetary habitability</a> are far from well-established. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 08:55, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>WTF do you qualify as exciting? Feminism in Milton? The anatomy of herbivorous dinosaurs?

<li>I guess what I'm trying to say is that having a few papers published isn't sufficient to warrant an article on oneself, publishing papers being the purpose of your everyday academic and such.

<li>If you say we're unencylopedic, then that defeats the whole purpose of this site. Newgrounds.com doesnt deserve to be in an encyclopedia, none of this stuff does, its just for fun, things you might not know about. Maybe you should realize that just because we don;t have 2000 hits on google, that we're still notable. We <b>are</b> one of the 5 "main" groups of ng, i think that counts for something.

<p>Patent nonsense: <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Sapo_aa0a.html" title="Mount Sapo">Mount Sapo</a> is about a "fictional mountain" that figures in no work of fiction, but is being used to justify curious and problematic edits of the article about <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap.html" title="Soap">soap</a>. FWIW <i>sapo</i> is just Latin for "soap." <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 18:34, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Update</b>. A Google search reveals that references to the supposed "Mount Sapo" are starting to pop up in various allegedly factual histories of soap, such as <a href="http://www.sdahq.org/cleaning/history/" class="external text" title="http://www.sdahq.org/cleaning/history/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.
<p>Mount Sapo is apparently a <b><a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a></b> of some sort, and it may be that the hoax may have originated on Wikipedia, and our article on soap is being used to propagate it in any case. <a href="http://soapnaturally.org/soaphistory.html" class="external text" title="http://soapnaturally.org/soaphistory.html" rel="nofollow">Patrizia Gardena</a>'s history of soap is much more in accordance with the facts. FWIW, Roman burnt <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrifice.html" title="Sacrifice">sacrifices</a> contained not enough fat to make much soap with, since the Romans burnt only the bones and inedible entrails, and sensibly kept the meat from sacrifices for themselves.</p>
<p>I am no longer sure what to do with this page, since the hoax appears to have spread to the outside world. I hope some kind of consensus can be reached, though. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:38, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Mount Sapo and the Soap article both state it's a legend. I can assure you that it's not a hoax that started on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrunnock_1109.html" title="User:Brunnock">Brunnock</a> 16:00, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At minimum, the Mount Sapo article needs to be made clearer about this. The text "Mount Sapo is a fictional place, used to substantiate a mythologic rewriting of the history of soap, which is often claimed to explain the origins of the name" makes it sound like it's talking about the history of soap on Wikipedia. This was no doubt the mistaken impression I got from first learning about "Mount Sapo" here, but it's one that others may share. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:31, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have substantially rewritten the article, to make it clearer that this is a circulating hoax, and explaining in more detail why it is implausible. I am going to leave the VfD up for now, just because I'm not 100% sure that everyone will want an article devoted to this sort of fakelore, but I am switching my vote somewhat reluctantly to <b>keep</b> now.</li>

<p><b>Opposed to deletion</b> I don't agree with the singular opinion above. This Order is well-known and has a website. There are at least 2000 members of the Order and approximately every 5 years a two volume set of hardcover books are produced settng out members' lineage. These are vital source books for genealogists world-wide.</p>

<p>I cannot see that it is an advertisement. What it does do is explain how people become members from a genealogical perspective.

<p>Who on earth do you think you are, you pompous prat, Mr.PhilipO? It is difficult to believe that the proprietors of Wikipedia allow such arrogance. But for your information (why should any of us have to prove anything to you?)

<p><b>No delete</b> Difficult to believe the hoo-ha here. Almost beyond belief. Seems like a few people with just a few hang-ups. (Tracey Crocker, I am told, is a man). The blurb is just a standard explanation of an established organisation, which, while based in the USA has members world-wide. It does not give "more of an idea of the organisation's lineage". What, exactly, is the problem here? I mean, do you people simply have nothing to do? 26th October 2005. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.122.95.171 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.122.95.171_6071.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.122.95.171">contribs</a>) 13:50, 26 October 2005.</small></p>

<li>Err.. are you suggesting that not one single article in Wikipedia has been copied from another encyclopaedia or book or website? I note that "Wikipedia is not a democracy". That certainly seems to be the case as there are several dictatorial people on various pages whose remarks CANNOT be contradicted. I came across this debate by accident but it is illuminating when it relates to such an uncontentious page with very little on it other than general information about a particular Order. As it appears that a couple of thousand people are members, surely then it should be noted by Wikipedia? I have also noted that "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", but surely thats just what an encyclopaedia (say, 'Britannia') is. People go to an encyclopaedia because they want information, however brief, on something. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch.html" title="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>

<li>My apologies. I am definitely nothing to do with the city in New Zealand! Its actually the name of my old college. I know a chap in Cambridgeshire who is a member of this Order. His Life membership number was over 2000. It is possible this figure may reflect the membership since day one rather than current levels. Its just seems to me that this is all a bit of a storm in a teacup. It is an existing organisation which people belong to, just like so many others. Now, if I had no knowledge of it and someone mentioned it to me I would look firstly at Wikipedia.</li>

<li><b>Leave them</b>. Both of these articles have been debated and edited to such an extent that it's become a source of immature behavior, including name calling.

I was under the impression that an encyclopedia should provide as much information as possible about every article. Fictional characters are highly debatable, of course, but I feel they have their uses just the same as every other article Wikipedia has to offer, which is to provide information to all interested parties.

However, until they have sold some records (they are "planning to release their second"), or have developed more of a press sensation, they remain off the radar screen of notability.<em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup></em> 04:19, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</s><em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup></em> 16:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><s><b>Comment</b>. Did you read what I wrote? Its not a delete based on politics. Its a delete vote based on the fact that they have not sold many records and have recorded one (on what label anyone?--they do not meet WP:music inclusion criteria for a band). Peddling inflammatory rhetoric can stir up the press a bit, granted. And obviously this article will be kept. But I would bet, based on the content of the article and the notability of this band right now, that a few years from now nobody will be reading this article or care about this band. If WP were a crystal ball, maybe we would know whether or not they are more than a news sensation in the Fall of 2005, soon to be forgotten. However WP is not a crystal ball.

<pre>
   McFADDEN: He had 6 million Jews executed.

   LYNX: I hardly believe there are even that many Jews alive back then.

</pre>
<pre>
   LYNX: Yeah, I think he did a lot -- he had a lot of good ideas."

<p>From this, the scene was cut to Ted Shaw, president of the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, who stated "It really breaks my heart to see those two young girls spewing out that kind of garbage,"</p>
<p>From this transcript, you can see that extra information which was not in the show has been added to the Wikipedia article, for whatever reason.

The fact that they are Nazis or "bad people" is no basis for deleting information on them; otherwise we'd be removing articles on Hitler, Stalin and a zillion other figures. The purpose of an encyclopedia is not to catalogue just the people and ideologies that are nice, but to serve as an information resource on bad things as well.

This [Prussian Blue article] although seen as morally reprehensible by many (myself included) should be kept - as it would be strange to only report the happy facts of life would it not?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It seems to me that the appropriate subject for an article is the girls' mother, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Gaede_a195.html" title="April Gaede">April Gaede</a>. She has a history in the "movement", she puts the girls onstage, she manages them, and it's safe to assume that she chooses the songs they perform. Also, while some hate music has some artistic merit -- I'd buy a <a href="../../../s/k/r/Skrewdriver.html" title="Skrewdriver">Skrewdriver</a> album if they weren't Nazis -- Prussian Blue is just terrible. It seems likely that they'll eventually fade away -- but their mother is here to stay. Therefore, I recommend that we write an article on Ms. gaede, and merge this in.

<dd>Nonsense. Their mother being (hypoteticaly) notable is not a reason to delete this article. <a href="../../../r/b/o/User%7ERbonvall_37e7.html" title="User:Rbonvall">rbonvall</a> 14:42, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I think it makes a lot of sense. Everyone is making the mistake that there's an event here -- as though Prussian Blue has written an original song, or sold 5000 albums, or ever played before a crowd larger than a few hundred people, at a venue more prominent than the county fair. Well, that hasn't happened. All that has happened is, an <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_902f.html" title="ABC">ABC</a> producer caught wind of Ms. gaede's underground promotional campaign, promising that Prussian Blue would someday (not now) be the icon of the white power movement, and pandemonium has ensued. Do you give put someone in an encyclopedia just because they appeared on TV once? Does it matter that the TV appearance was not for having accomplished anything, but just for being freakish? (No one's written an article on the Meat lady from the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Springer_Show_575a.html" title="Jerry Springer Show">Jerry Springer Show</a>, and she's been on TV more often, for more discrete events, than Lamb and Lynx.) That's the problem with the Prussian Blue article -- there's no <i>there</i> there.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, Ms. Gaede has managed to get her daughter's album -- a cover album might I add -- national exposure, due to a consistent promotional effort in her column on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Vanguard_9439.html" title="National Vanguard">National Vanguard</a> website. She picks the songs, she arranges the gigs, she promises a future where the white young men of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">America</a> are awakened to the destiny and responsibility of the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> people because Lamb and Lynx are hot. "Pretty white girls sing hate music" makes a good lead on TV, but to the extent that there's any story here, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Gaede_a195.html" title="April Gaede">April Gaede</a> is the story.</dd>
<dd>Hence, since Prussian Blue a) have no substantial following (they don't even have a record contract), b) have made no original contribution to music, the white power movement, or any other aspect of our culture, and c) don't even pick which songs they're going to cover, I recommend that the article be either deleted or reduced to a stub, and that the media circus of the last few days be documented in an article devoted to the ringmaster, Ms Gaede.

<ul>
<li>Yes. It lacks anything that would make it suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia, as is noted in the link above, is not an indiscriminate collection of information, and when people search for a topic within one, they are searching for encyclopedic things that fall within that topic. Someone who searches the Wikipedia database for beaches is looking for <i>encyclopedic</i> beaches, not a list of every beach that exists. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 03:16, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So before I look for a beach or a village in wikipedia, I have to first decide if it's encyclopedic or not? But how would I know? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:47, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it was possible to have easy rules that could be applied without interpretation, we wouldn't need AFD; but a simple rule of thumb is that if you can't think of any reason why a given thing would be in an enyclopedia beyond the fact that it's real, then it probably <i>doesn't</i> belong in an encyclopedia. Indeed, as noted above, policy specifically bars the use of realness, on its own, as a justification for inclusion. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 14:43, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The reason this beach should be in wikipedia is because people would want to be able to look it up. Wikipedia takes money for providing people with knowledge, not for depriving them of it. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 16:06, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, Wikipedia takes money to provide people with <i>encyclopedic</i> knowledge. That's an important distinction. A website that collects any and all random trivia or geographical data, no matter how minor, is <i>not an encyclopedia</i>. I understand your urge to try and collect all human knowledge in a single place, and you're certainly free to start a website yourself (or, if you prefer, start an atlas) to collect all unencyclopedic knowledge and fill in the gaps. That is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">not</a>, however, Wikipedia's goal. We are making an encyclopedia, not a factbook. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 23:55, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia takes money to provide people with the sum of human knowledge. If you want to remove knowledge that I want to look up, you should start your own project. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:40, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It does not. It takes money to provide people with an <i>encyclopedia</i>. Talk of the "sum of human knowledge" is purple prose, not policy. Our policy, in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, states that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, and that simple truth is not enough to warrent inclusion; there are true facts that do not belong here, and articles about real things that require deletion. If you want to challenge that fundimental policy and argue that all true facts belong in an encyclopedia, then you should do so on the approprate talk pages, not here. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 21:18, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So when wikipedia tells donors it's providing the sum of human knowledge, that means nothing? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:24, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Correct. Our goal is to create an encyclopedia. That goal is written on every page, and is the message at the heart of every one of our fundraisers; the fact that our founder may occasionally wax poetic at such events does not change our central nature. Everything that has gone into Wikipedia up until this point been devoted to the creation of an encyclopedia, and our most sacred trust is therefore to maintain encyclopedic standards. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 05:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see, the end justifies the means. But wikipedia relies on the assumption of good faith, if it doesn't act in good faith, how can it expect it from others? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 05:18, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand your point. Wikipedia's first and foremost promise to everyone who contributes to it--both to regular editors and to donors--is that creating an encyclopedia. This promise is repeated on every page and outlined in careful detail on policy pages such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>; it is the central guideline that unites everyone involved in the project. If you're asking whether that commitment to encyclopedic standards takes precidence, policywise, over our fundraising slogans, then the answer is can only be <i>yes.</i> It would be a poor repayment to our supporters if we abandoned our central goal at this late date. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 06:39, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You'll implying to donors you'll give them a comprehensive encyclopedia, and at the same time throwing out information they would expect to find in it. That seems like a pretty poor repayment. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 15:00, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i><b>There!</b></i> You admit, then, that that maintaining encyclopedic standards is an essential part of building an encyclopedia, and that we are duty-bound to keep content to what people would expect to find within such a work? In that case, we're almost done. All your earlier arguments are moot; they come down to the question you just begged over what our encyclopedia is and what we have decided people can expect from it. Luckily, we don't need to try and scry this from obscure statements by Jimbo or random fundraising slogans; we have a well-known, authorative, and near-universally accepted policy at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. This policy states, quite clearly and without room for interpretation, that the fact that something is 100% true does not automatically make it encyclopedic. I understand your concerns that this conflicts with some of our fundraising slogans, but at the moment it is policy, and governs all of our decisions on encyclopedic worth. If you want to take issue with it, or with our fundraising, then the approprate place is on its talk page or the village pump, not here. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 20:40, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It remains fact that you are denying people information they would hope to find in this encyclopedia, so your interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> conflicts with the morality of taking their money. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:14, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When Wikipedia takes money from people, it does not promise to fufill their every hope. Indeed, if their hopes are absurd or unreasonable, then they are doomed to be disappointed; and as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, the only things that people can reasonably hope to find in it are encyclopedic things. Fufilling unreasonable hopes at the cost of disappointing the far larger number of people who have contributed to Wikipedia with the hope of creating an encyclopedic work is plainly not the right or moral thing to do. Therefore, if you want to argue that this page or that page belongs in Wikipedia, you can only do so on grounds of encyclopedic merit. If you wish, you could argue that all true things have encyclopedic merit, but since policy plainly states otherwise, you would have to start that debate by attempting to change policy. All of your other arguments are bunk; in the end, they come down to what belongs/should be/is expected in an encyclopedia, which is the one issue, in your endless circling, that you still have not addressed. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 02:09, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK I'm confused, it seems like this would fit fine in an encyclopedia of West Seattle. I can reasonably expect to information on random colleges, cricket matches, Bible verses, Simpons episodes, pokemon characters, <i><a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_magazine.html" title="Slate magazine">Slate</a></i> journalists, and uninhabited villages in an encyclopedia, but not a beach used for diving. Please explain why the beach is absurd while these other things are not. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:33, 28 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We know, both from policy and from the definition of an enyclopedia, that encyclopedic worth exists, and that it is ultimately the sole criteria for inclusion in an encyclopedia. We also know, from policy, that simple truth is not enough to establish it here. Therefore, each article must assert, in some form or another, the encyclopedic worth of its topic. Of course, for many topics it is beyond queston; almost everything you listed, for instance, affects people on a vast scale, one clear sign of encyclopedic worth by anyone's estimation. Bible verses, Simpson episodes, and yes, even Pokemon characters and Slate journalists each play a role in the lives of millions of people daily. I'm not so sure that <i>every</i> cricket match or uninhabited village is encyclopedic; but widely-broadcast or otherwise major matches affect people on a similarly wide scale, while uninhabited villages were once inhabited, and may have left a mark on many people while they existed. Of course, this is only one scale of encyclopedic worth, not the only scale; but presuming that they don't get it simply for existing, I can't think of any argument that would extend encyclopedic worth to beaches as a general class. Some beaches might be encyclopedic, to be sure, and some people below have argued that this specific one is among them; but the argument I think I am hearing from <i>you</i> simply claims that all true things are enyclopedic. That argument, if you mean it, should be directed towards changing Wikipedia policy as a whole, not towards individual AfDs. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 08:29, 28 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're telling me that the encylopedic worth of a random Slate journalist or village is beyond question, but to even claim it for a notable geographic feature like a beach is absurd and unreasonable. Seems rather arbitrary and <i>ad hoc</i> to me, but obviously I am an absurd an unreasonable person like anyone else who would hope to be able to look up this up, I wonder how many we are. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:28, 29 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I'm telling you that claiming categorical encyclopedic worth for <i>all</i> beaches is unreasonable. Your typical river can have, along its length, hundreds or thousands of indistinguishable coves; a few miles of coastline can have countless more, with overlapping local names that come and go. Indeed, there are vast sections of coastline consisting of virtually nothing but such coves. Your average seaside tourist town will have dozens of major beaches and innumerable smaller ones, many known only to locals; any expensive beachfront home will naturally have its own private beach, often with its own name and a little wooden sign to distinguish it and keep out the neighbors. If you have an argument to make as to the encyclopedic worth of this individual beach, go ahead and make it; but comparing beaches such as the above to Slate journalists or once-inhabited villages is an insult to reputable journalists and departed villagers, respectively. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 10:34, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The essential content of this article is that there exists a cove near Seattle that is used for various types of diving, and has certain local peculiarities related to depth, slope, permitted diving areas, restrooms, food, and parking. None of this information is encyclopedic. Moreover, the existing information about this location (see the Google results above) will not produce an encyclopedic article. Thus, we are left with a choice between an article that does not discriminate between its subject and any other cove in the Seattle area, or an article built on original research.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Do not merge. This might be another contribution from the "soft drink vandal" who kept aggressively adding unsourced and POV-pushing articles about soft drink addiction, etc. some months ago. There's nothing to merge, as the article is basically content-free. "It is debatable whether soft drinks cause a chemical/physical addiction or whether the act of drinking soft drinks is habit forming" is simply an effort to insinuate a point of view without defending it. Note that this article can be used as a template for producing any number of equally useless articles, since <i>any</i> point of view can be stated as a definition and then said to be "debatable."

<li>That screenshot is not of the forum in question. Rather, it is of an official forum site later shut down. The messageboard in question is a fan-created site that does not meet inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the article itself admits that the old "AMB" messageboard had just a hundred or so more regular users than this fan board - which tends to suggest that the usercount number shown is massively inflated. Given that the screenshot itself displays "Most users ever online was 79 on Tue Mar 04, 2003 2:50 pm"... it is HIGHLY unlikely that there were actually 25,000 unique users. I frequent boards with around 2,300 unique users which have had 300+ users on simultaneously. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:29, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>, ok first off. StarryEyes.. his acne has nothing to do with the deletion of this article. Gazpacho, they are in the 10th grade and are already in the news paper and are popular all throughout Northern Virginia, such as of course King George, Fredericksburg, Westmoreland, Caroline, Spotsovania, and many other counties surrounding Fredericksburg. They have played at many different places such as The Big One V (won Player's Choice), The Loft, and Pickers Supply in downtown Fredericksburg. Holderca1, its pretty notable especially since 2 or 3 of those google hits are popular area Newspapers. The minister of war, he could creme you at bass anyday and how does that have to deal with deletion?? Not quite sure what nn means? not notable??. Come visit Fredericksburg and King George and ask any middle/highschool kid and most any young (20 - mid 30's) adults and they could name The Desert Highlife for you most likely. I didnt get to put much time into the article yet, considering the first attempt i made was cut off and placed with this stupid deletion thing. They also have a demo coming out in a few weeks/months. They have played with bands such as 816 and St. Diablo (who have few albums out already and played with The Desert Highlife). Most of these Delete posts are rubish (especially StarryEyes's post)<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucid._4aa0.html" title="User:Lucid.">Lucid</a> 19:50, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Review the section of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> on what makes a band notable. This band meets none of those requirments(If I am wrong on this, mention which one of the seven they have accomplished). Also, not sure what you searched for under Google. But none of the hits on my search were newspapers. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolderca1_0bcb.html" title="User:Holderca1">Holderca1</a> 20:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment Answered</b>. Try searching google for "the desert highlife free lance star" its about the 2nd one down. from there you can find a link to the freelancestar.com site, or if you wish, you can look through the other pages of results. Possibly number 6. Thats the mood of Fredericksburg and surrounding cities. Its pretty much an opinon thing but since you dont live their you cant possibly have an opinion. also it says on the page "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; conversely, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion.". So even if they dont classify they still dont need to be deleted. they are rising band with a good future. even a demo soon. why not give them a page?
<ul>
<li><b>Answer to comment answered</b>: Because millions of bands claim to be rising bands with good futures and end up nowhere. I wish them all the best but until they make an actual record on an actual label they are not notable. I do apologize for the "Clearasil" remark, it wasn't meant as a personal attack, it was just good-natured jest. Also, Lucid, in the future, please note that new votes in AFD go at the bottom, not at the top. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes">StarryEyes</a> 21:03, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Whats wrong with a high school student? it was published by a newspaper. Obviously it was edited and reviewed by the Free Lance Star to see if it was suitable or just plain bogus. Plus the student is from Brooke Point High School, a high school that none of the band members have ever visited or seen. On the 816 website it even says The Desert Highlife, player's choice meaning that out of all the bands, they were voted for the award.<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucid._4aa0.html" title="User:Lucid.">Lucid</a> 19:57, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, but gently. I admire their enthusiasm, and the fact that one of them was in the "Ultra Super Zombie Lords", which is a great name. Shame their website doesn't have any music on it. I have played the bass guitar, and I believe it is easily possible to be a 15-year-old veteran of the instrument. It only has four strings, after all. The article and the website remind me of Bryan Adams' "Summer of 69". the band will split up, they will get jobs, and eventually their instruments will end up in the attic or on eBay.

<li><b>Keep</b> Transportation in and around Richmond is more of a big deal than in many other cities. This is due to the location at the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_line.html" title="Fall line">fall line</a> on the James River, which both 1. makes the city a transport hub, and 2. presents extra complications, such as the many bridges over the river.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Transportation is a city or region wide thing and should be treated as such here. Articles on individual pieces of infrastructure, like roads, tend to ignore the purpose of why they exist (that is they focus on the experience of being on the road and things that are 50 meters on either side of it). Infrastructure was created and works as a system, not as a thousand unique pieces. This article is much better than dozens of articles, one for each road in Richmond. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 02:01, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Thirded. I have been a member of Something Awful for years and I can personally confirm that there was never any such thing as WDMA, or for that matter, BTB. This entire article is unencyclopedic science fiction. <a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 06:58, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Absolutely. WDMA has never existed, and absolutely no one has ever been banned from SA for mentioning its existence, or asking where da movies atted. 24.168.5.223 07:56, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&#160;:<b>1</b>. I agree that this is just too incredibly obscure to be worth mentioning (and I am a person who has pretty generous limits on what I consider to be incredibly obscure). The fact that a torrent tracker associated in some way with a semi-private web-based forum may have existed is far from sufficient to warrant entry in the Wikipedia. Just because something existed does not mean it's worth entering, in the same way that just because down the street on the corner there is a little ghetto-mart run by a Pakistani guy who sells beer and cigarettes does not mean that, defacto, he is a key and important part of my local neighborhood which is a subset of my community which is a subset of my part of town which is a subset of the city I live in, and should thus carefully be logged and documented. There are literally thousands of private trackers in existence right now, many with associated forums (and vice versa). Those that represent something more than just the fact that they exist are those which could be considered in an article related to the general phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>2</b>. Above is a comment or two from what I suspect are some SA forum members who are jokingly happy to see their tracker not mentioned or publicised. This brings up the points mentioned elsewhere that things of this nature can be notoriously difficult to verify. Knowing the SA memebrs, I would find it equally possible that they would get a kick out of creating a false history of the site for fun (I don't mean this insultingly: its the tendancy to do things like this that makes their site so much fun to read). So, all in all, its a vague thing compounded by vagueness on this count.</dd>
<dd><b>3</b>. On the other hand, we need to be reasonable when it comes to documenting web-based communities and things that arise from them. Simply put, huge and widespread things can happen on the web for which, a year later, little concrete information remains. The very ephemeral nature of data these days (particularly on things which are invisible to google caches and such) on the web means we have to not allow ourselves to fall into the trap of saying, in essance, "because you can't clearly and easily show information about something with sixty thousand people experienced but didn't leave too much of a trail about, it means it didn't happen."</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. RFD: The only reason why people are voting for deletion is because none of the data has been verified. Ergo, all that needs to be proven is the existence of the site and the previous existence of File Forums on the Something Awful Forums. The data is verifiable in several different ways: one, the existence of the WDMA site and the drama that happened that brought it down; two, Something Awful owner Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka's public acknowledgement of the existence of the file forums' previous existence to an audience at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana; three, screencaps of WDMA are readily available; and four, screencaps of the old Something Awful forums which used WDMA as a tracker are readily available.</li>

<dd>Incorrect. I am voting for deletion for other reasons as well (see my comments above).

<li><b>Comment</b> The "WDMA is a hoax/never existed" tinfoil bandwagon of anons (and some registered users) is some strange attempt to keep WDMA a "secret". Its existance was pretty tightly guarded (as well as one can do such things on the Internet) while it existed. As far as I know, it hasn't been resurrected, so I can only presume that the reason people are posting false information about it here is simply to troll wikipedians who are not familiar with the SA Forums / WDMA. I know I'm not the first to point this out, but I figure a signed comment from a registered user with an edit history will lend some credibility to the statement. As far as keep/delete, I'm ambivalent - WDMA was a big deal to the SA Forums, but precisely because of its secrecy it was never well-known or important to the Internet at large. I'd say its main claim to notability is keeping such a large-volume torrent site under the radar of the authorities for so long, but whether or not that's enough for Wikipedia is for others to decide. -- <a href="../../../t/y/l/User%7ETyler_McHenry_2cd2.html" title="User:Tyler McHenry">Tyler</a> 08:45, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Most articles in this "party"'s newsletter are signed by the same person (Michael Thorburn) with an occasional contribution by a Bill Foster, so it's basically a political newsletter operating out of a mailbox and not a political party in any recognizable sense of the word. Still, they have apparently been around since 1992 and their archive goes back some 8.5 years, so it's at least borderline notable. <a href="../../../a/h/a/User%7EAhasuerus_97b5.html" title="User:Ahasuerus">Ahasuerus</a> 00:32, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> some of these small left wing groups seem to be almost one man bands (or they'd all fit in a phonebox anyway), and don't stand in elections, however they can make a big noise, and also be involved in unions and actions, which is what makes them significant. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 16:18, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Notability can be hard to establish when it comes to very small political movements. I suppose that if they have a clearly documented track record of existence (a newsletter, brochures, books, address, etc) over multiple years, it's better to err on the side of caution and include them even though it may be a one man show with no influence on politics. It's a tough call, though, since I don't think that similar criteria would apply to, say, original research or fanfiction unless there was some other evidence of notability. <a href="../../../a/h/a/User%7EAhasuerus_97b5.html" title="User:Ahasuerus">Ahasuerus</a> 02:16, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
