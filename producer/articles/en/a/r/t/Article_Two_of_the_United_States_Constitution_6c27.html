<p>Section One provides that the executive power is vested in the President who may be chosen for a four-year term.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice-President_3111.html" title="Vice-President">Vice-President</a> chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:</i>[…]</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The President and Vice President are chosen by <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Electoral_College_5364.html" title="U.S. Electoral College">Electors</a> chosen as the state legislatures directly. The Constitution does not limit how a state may choose its electors, but in practice, at least since 1824, all states have chosen electors by popular vote. Each state may choose as many Electors as it has Representatives and Senators representing it in Congress. (Under the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_315b.html" title="Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-third Amendment</a>, the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_D.C._708d.html" title="Washington D.C.">District of Columbia</a> may also choose Electors.) No Senators, Representatives or federal officers may become Electors.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution_6c27.html" title="Edit section: Clause 3: Electors">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Clause 3: Electors</span></h3>
<p><i>(<b>Note:</b> This entire clause was replaced (albeit implicitly) by the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_0ff6.html" title="Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twelfth Amendment</a> in 1804.)</i></p>
<p>After they are appointed (in modern practice, by popular election), the electors meet in their respective states to cast ballots for the President and Vice President. Originally, each electors cast two votes for President; at least one of the individuals voted for had to be from a state different from the elector's. The individual with the greatest number of votes (if such a number represented a majority of electors) became President, and the runner-up became Vice President. (The Constitution did not require that the person elected Vice President be voted for by a majority of the electors.) In case of a tie, the House of Representatives could choose one of the tied candidates; if no person received a majority, then the House could again choose one of the five with the greatest number of votes. When the House voted, each state delegation cast one vote, and the vote of a majority of states was necessary to choose a President. If second-place candidates were tied, then the Senate broke the tie. A quorum of two-thirds applied in both Houses: at least one member from each of two-thirds of the states in the House of Representatives, and at least two-thirds of the Senators in the Senate. This procedure was followed in 1801 after the electoral vote produced a tie, and nearly resulted in a deadlock in the House.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_0ff6.html" title="Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twelfth Amendment</a> introduced a number of important changes to the procedure. Now, Electors do not cast two votes for President; rather, they cast one vote for President and another for Vice President. In case no Presidential candidate receives a majority, the House chooses from among the top three (not five, as was earlier the case). The Senate still chooses from those with the two highest figures if no Vice Presidential candidate receives a majority of electoral votes.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_born_citizen.html" title="Natural born citizen">natural born citizen</a> clause is a subject of debate. No law or court ruling has ever established the precise definition of a natural born citizen. It is generally agreed that a natural born citizen of the United States is any person born in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia. But most political scientists do not agree if this definition should also include persons born in United States overseas territories or persons born to United States citizens living abroad. To date, no such person has been nominated for President or Vice President by a major political party, although some serious candidates for nomination (most recently <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Romney_6248.html" title="George W.

<dl>
<dd><i>In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.</i></dd>

<p>The wording of this clause caused much controversy at the time it was first used. When <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Henry_Harrison_e87c.html" title="William Henry Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> died in office, a debate arose as to whether or not the Vice President actually becomes President, or if he would just inherit the powers, thus becoming an Acting President. Harrison's Vice President, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tyler_b85c.html" title="John Tyler">John Tyler</a>, believed that he had the right to become President. However, many Senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new election. Because the wording of the clause is so vague, it was impossible for either side to prove their point. Tyler ended up taking the Oath of Office and became President, setting a precedent that would be followed until the ratification of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_3f18.html" title="Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-fifth Amendment</a>. Tyler's precedent made it possible for Vice Presidents <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millard_Fillmore_5e1f.html" title="Millard Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_Arthur_e470.html" title="Chester Arthur">Chester Arthur</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_Roosevelt_286e.html" title="Teddy Roosevelt">Teddy Roosevelt</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_Coolidge_91e2.html" title="Calvin Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Truman_9c27.html" title="Harry Truman">Harry Truman</a>, and <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Johnson_a119.html" title="Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> to ascend to the Presidency.</p>
<p>Tyler's precedent established that if the President's office becomes vacant due to death, resignation or disqualification, the Vice President becomes President. The Congress may provide for a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_line_of_succession.html" title="Presidential line of succession">line of succession</a> beyond the Vice President; currently, it includes the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate and then Cabinet Secretaries.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_3f18.html" title="Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-fifth Amendment</a> explicitly states that when the Presidency is vacant, then the Vice President becomes President. This provision applied at the time <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a> succeeded to the Presidency. In case of a Vice Presidential vacancy, the Amendment permits the President to appoint, with the approval of both Houses of Congress a new Vice President. Furthermore, the Amendment provides that when the Vice President and Cabinet declare the President unable to discharge his duties, the Vice President becomes Acting President. The Amendment permits the President to take control back unless two-thirds of both Houses vote to sustain the findings of the Vice President and Cabinet.</p>
<p>Congress has invoked its power to legislate for "the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President"; the current <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession_245a.html" title="United States presidential line of succession">line of succession</a> is found in the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Succession_Act_9331.html" title="Presidential Succession Act">Presidential Succession Act</a>.</p>

</dl>
<p>The President is the military's Commander-in-Chief. The president is the highest ranking officer in the military. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution_de54.html" title="Article One of the United States Constitution">Article One</a>, however, provides that Congress, not the President, may <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Powers_Clause_0d0f.html" title="War Powers Clause">declare war</a>. Often, the President has deployed troops with Congressional authorization, but in the absence of an explicit declaration of war.</p>
<p>The President may require the "principal officer" of any executive department to tender his advice in writing. Thus, implicitly, the Constitution creates a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Cabinet_bc19.html" title="United States Cabinet">Cabinet</a> that includes the principal officers of the various departments.</p>
<p>The President, furthermore, may grant pardons or reprieves. Pardons may not be granted in cases of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a>. Originally, the pardon could be rejected by the convict. In <i>Biddle v.

It is a part of the Constitutional scheme. When granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed."</p>

<p>If two-thirds of Senators concur, he may ratify treaties.</p>
<p>The Constitution is silent, however, on the termination of treaties. The first abrogation of a treaty occurred in 1798, when Congress passed a law terminating a 1788 treaty with France. In the nineteenth century, several Presidents terminated treaties after Congress passed resolutions requesting the same. In 1854, however, President <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Pierce_eb91.html" title="Franklin Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> terminated a treaty with <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> with the consent of the Senate alone. A Senate committee ruled that it was correct procedure for the President to terminate treaties after being authorized by the Senate alone, and not the entire Congress. President Pierce's successors, however, returned to the former procedure of obtaining authorization from both Houses. Some Presidents have claimed to themselves the exclusive power of terminating treaties. <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, for instance, terminated a treaty without prior Congressional authorization, but Congress retroactively approved his decision at a later point. The first unambiguous case of a President terminating a treaty without authorization, granted prior to or after the termination, occurred when <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> terminated a treaty with the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> (<i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldwater_v._Carter_ec52.html" title="Goldwater v. Carter">Goldwater v. Carter</a></i>). For the first time, judicial determination was sought, but the effort proved futile: the Supreme Court could not find a majority agreeing on any particular principle, and therefore instructed the trial court to dismiss the case.</p>

<p>The President may also appoint judges, ambassadors, consuls, ministers and other officers with the advice and consent of the Senate. By law, however, Congress may allow the President, heads of executive departments, or the courts to appoint inferior officials.</p>
<p>The Senate has a long-standing practice of permitting motions to reconsider previous decisions. In 1931, the Senate granted advice and consent to the President on the appointment of a member of the Federal Power Commission. The officer in question was sworn in, but the Senate, under the guise of a motion to reconsider, rescinded the advice and consent. In the <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quo_warranto.html" title="Quo warranto">writ of quo warranto</a> proceedings that followed, the Supreme Court ruled that the Senate was not permitted to thus rescind advice and consent after the officer had been installed.</p>
<p>After the Senate grants advice and consent, however, the President is under no compulsion to commission the officer. It has not settled in the courts if the President has the prerogative to withhold a commission after having signed it.</p>
<p>The President also has the power to remove individuals from office. Congress has often sought to limit the President's power; during the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> Era, Congress passed the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenure_of_Office_Act_779a.html" title="Tenure of Office Act">Tenure of Office Act</a>, purportedly preventing Andrew Johnson from removing, without the advice and consent of the Senate, anyone appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. President Johnson ignored the Act, and was later impeached and acquitted. The constitutionality of the Act was not immediately settled. In <i><a href="../../../m/y/e/Myers_v._United_States_f825.html" title="Myers v. United States">Myers v. United States</a></i> (1926), however, the Supreme Court held that Congress could not thus limit the President's power to remove executive officers. Congress, however, may remove an officer "who occupies no place in the executive department and who exercises no part of the executive power." On the basis of this principle, the Supreme Court permitted Congress to remove officers of the Federal Trade Commission, which was adjudged to be an "administrative body [that] cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or eye of the executive." But if Congress by statute retains for itself the power to remove an officer, it may not clothe him with executive powers, for if it does so the individual in question becomes a part of the executive branch removable at the whim of the President.</p>

<p>The President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." Some Presidents have claimed the authority under this provision to impound money appropriated by Congress. President Jefferson, for example, delayed the expenditure of money appropriated for the purchase of gunboats for over a year. President <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> and his successors sometimes refused outright to expend appropriated money. The Supreme Court, however, has held impoundments without Congressional authorization unconstitutional.</p>
<p>It has also been asserted that the President's responsibility in the "faithful" execution of the laws entitles him to suspend the privilege of the <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habeas_corpus.html" title="Habeas corpus">writ of habeas corpus</a>. Article One provides that the privilege may not be suspended save during times of rebellion or invasion, but it does not specify who may suspend the privilege. Congress, the Supreme Court has ruled, may suspend the privilege if it deems it necessary. During the Civil War, President <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> suspended the privilege, but, due to the vehement opposition he faced, obtained congressional authorization for the same. Since then, the privilege of the writ has only been suspended upon the express authorization of Congress.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_v._Johnson_0b3b.html" title="Mississippi v. Johnson">Mississippi v. Johnson</a></i> (1867), the Supreme Court ruled that the judiciary may not restrain the President in the execution of laws. In the case, the Supreme Court refused to entertain a request for an injunction preventing President Andrew Johnson from executing the Reconstruction Acts, which were claimed to be unconstitutional. The Court found that "the Congress is the legislative department of the government; the President is the executive department. Neither can be restrained in its action by the judicial department; though the acts of both, when performed, are, in proper cases, subject to its cognizance." Thus, the courts cannot bar the passage of a law by Congress, though it may strike down such a law as unconstitutional. A similar construction applies to the executive branch.</p>

<p>Presidents have claimed the power to withhold information from the courts and Congress, but no clause of the Constitution speaks of such a power, and questions regarding this are contentious and undetermined. The Supreme Court has ruled that presidential communications are protected by a privilege that is "fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution." Executive privilege, however, is not absolute. In criminal cases, for example, the defendant can demand the revelation of exculpatory information in the possession of the government, but the government may choose to dismiss the charges instead of revealing the information.</p>
