<li><b>*Keep*</b> Why? From the guidelines; <i><b>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field:</b></i> Within his field of Macintosh support and development, this is absolutely the case - his book 'Essential Mac OS X Panther Server Administration', published by O'Reilly (<a href="../../../o/27/r/O%27Reilly_Media_64bd.html" title="O'Reilly Media">O'Reilly Media</a> of course being considered the quintessential and ultimate source for technical resources) was considered the "bible" and last word on the subject. While it's difficult to provide sources that verify with certainty that he was respected within the community (unless you join the lists he frequented and contributed to), he regularly assisted fellow Macintosh support and development professionals with technical issues and his contribution is vast, articulate, accurate and on the whole, unquestionable. His articles, posts to lists and multiple presentations, seminars and training sessions are most certainly widely recognized within his field and in many cases archived for future reference by the community.<br />

<li><b>Delete</b> unless it is of particular historical or other significance, it doesn't merit its own page. I would also recommend to the nominator a similar page, Paradise Day Spa and Bath House, which is essentially an ad despite its opening by the Mayor and assertions of historical importance. The problem is that there is simply nothing notable about this particular center which would merit inclusion in an encyclopaedia - see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> if you are not quite familiar with policies.

<li><b>Comments</b> Whether the page is well written is not in dispute here. What has been asserted is that the page breaches one or more official policies or conventions for the inclusion and removal of articles from Wikipedia. In some cases, the very premise of the article is in dispute, and no amount of quality improvements will save it. <strike>This is the case here, as the article is apparently about a non-notable student journalism group. It has an insufficient profile, fails a number of basic tests e.g. the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_Test_6be3.html" title="Wikipedia:Google Test">Google Test</a> and cites no sources other than its own website. Notability depends on who you talk to (I doubt you would find <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traveston_railway_station%2C_Queensland_826c.html" title="Traveston railway station, Queensland">infrequently served Australian railway stations</a> notable, but there are reasons for including them); however, there is a lower threshold for notability that this article has not met. Please don't take it personally, as you seem to be an interested editor who can contribute to other projects.</strike> Also, please don't remove prods without explanation. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 02:17, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and also delete Kyran Million</b> The singer's article asserts no notability aside from being in this band, and much of the article is an obvious hoax. The guy even lies about his own age <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=19479781" class="external autonumber" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=19479781" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. As far as the band's article... well, "Off Puente" gets only 53 TOTAL Google hits, and ZERO hits (besides MySpace pages and a LastFM page) are actually related to the band (other examples: "Our location is right off of Puente Avenue"; "A two-run homer hit off Puente"), which wouldn't really make sense for an artist on <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decaydance_Records_2b85.html" title="Decaydance Records">Decaydance Records</a>. The reasoning behind this is that they're <i>not</i> on this label, as claimed in the band's article; the band's <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=21500484" class="external text" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=21500484" rel="nofollow">own MySpace</a> confirms that they're unsigned. The band's web site <a href="http://www.offpuente.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.offpuente.com/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> is just a placeholder, which means it can't help to verify any claims made in the article. Some of the other claims (such as a YouTube video being downloaded 5.4 million times, when a YouTube search <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search=%22Off+Puente%22&amp;search_type=search_videos&amp;search=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://youtube.com/results?search=%22Off+Puente%22&amp;search_type=search_videos&amp;search=Search" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> brings up not a single result) are obviously garbage.

<li><b>Comment</b> As an editor/filmmaker, I can tell you that this is wicked an inverted image. I couldn't find an article on the topic, so we could just change the title and wording. I'd be more than happy to help. It's a wicked fun and cool thing to use. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 16:13, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> makes a good point: as a special effect used in many areas of the visual arts, one can imagine a decent article being written on this subject, simply by covering where and why it's been used. While what we have now is not such an article, it's no worse than many small stubs. The "dicdef" principle really applies only where there is no potential for expansion. This should either be kept, or if the subject is already covered in another article, it should be redirected there; but there is no good reason to delete it. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:13, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It may be better to discuss this as a section at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image_editing.html" title="Image editing">Image editing</a>. However, if we do keep it, we should probably rename it to Reverse image. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 01:55, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Sorry, I have to disagree with the interpretations of most editors who have weighed in above here. I don't think the point of the Reverse video article is a TV or movie effect; it's talking about what happens on a computer screen when you highlight text so that, for example, what had been black text on a white background becomes white text in a black box against a white background. (To see what I mean, click and drag with your mouse over just about any text on this page.) This effect has been around in computers for a long time and was even more common back in the days of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_computer_and_video_games.html" title="History of computer and video games">8-bit computers</a>, when it wasn't practical to have on-screen effects like italics and underlining, but it was possible to have the effect described in the article stand in for one of them. At the risk of suggesting how old I am, I used to use the <a href="../../../a/t/a/AtariWriter_a94c.html" title="AtariWriter">AtariWriter</a> word processing software which showed text on the screen in reverse video when that text was going to be underlined on paper. This is not a dicdef; it's a stub. <a href="../../../v/a/d/User%7EVadder_9569.html" title="User:Vadder">Vadder</a> 14:26, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>From time to time, I have come across articles with links to this page, which is written in a vainglorious fashion. Checking the "What links here", I went through the pages where it was listed and investigated whether it would be appropriate to link to a badly written article. The link was something copied and pasted in as it fell out of format with all other links in the "See also" sections of the various pages. Ignoring that aspect, it fell totally out of place when considering the content of the various articles (palaces, new construction, etc) and I thought it appropriate to remove the link case by case. Each case proved to necessitate the removal of the link. The article itself really should be deleted. It is unencyclopedic and even if expanded, it isn't a notable topic. The vague term "castle preservation" redirects to it, created by the creator of the Castles Society page himself. I consider the page to be an advertisement and Wikipedia is not an advertising agency. Some of the pages that formerly linked are below:</p>

<li>I suppose to me at least it's the maturity level of the students. High Schools are often a place where strong memories are formed; where the beginnings of a trade are learned, and they are typically larger institutions than primary/elementary schools—often graduating tens of thousands of students while they are in service. So I think there's a weak case for High Schools being called notable. I don't see one for primary/elementary schools, unless they're unique in some respect. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 15:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't buy the notion that any schools, high schools included, have automatic, inherited "notability" or worthiness for an article. One could make a reasonably logical argument though for the cultural importance of high schools in American/Canadian culture as pointed out by RJH. 30 years from now, people will still be attending High School Reunions... nobody formally gets together with the people they attended middle/jr high with. Also consider that HS is the first level of schooling that gives students some sort of usable certification of learning (i.e. a diploma). Of course IMO, having a hard cutoff for HS leads into the possibility of systemic/cultural bias as pointed out by Markb above. Of course to me, it is preferable to judge each article on it's actual merits rather than blanket "school = keep" or "school = delete".--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:01, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Exactly</b>.

<li>This was not "hashed" out. A discussion happened, and no decision was reached. This is very different from you running around making claims that precendents were set, and that schools are somehow inherently notable. The reason there is often no consensus on these votes is because you have an organised project to show up and block vote them into stalemate. However, I do appreciate your sincere concern over how I use my time though. I like to make a suggestion of my own. Maybe you should spend your time more productively, say, by not making false assertions about past discussions in order to mislead people planning to vote here?

<p>Second nomination, but first under new title. I argue that even if tech demos were applicable to be articles, consider this - it may be that this is a notable tech demo, but it is also another thing - a port. It is known that it is <i><a href="../../../y/o/s/Yoshi%27s_Story_5786.html" title="Yoshi's Story">Yoshi's Story</a></i>, and thusly, like any other port, should not be included as its own page.

The article should be deleted, as it is an obscure title that people will likely not visit. It does not need any more mention than on <i>Yoshi's Story'</i>s page. <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 02:40, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league... or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States."

<li><b>Comment</b> Those guidelines are ambiguously worded - is the college sports bit part of the amateur sports bit, or separate.

<li><b>Keep.</b> (But I would say that wouldn't I!) I added this because there was a poorly written paragraph on the Genesis page referring to "reverse Noise Gate" which I changed to the correct term "Gated Reverb" wikified &amp; then found out there wasn't a page for it. Created the page because it's one of <b>the</b> all time classic drum recording techniques, added a couple of categories, wandered off rationalising the categories on a number of other webpages related to sound recording techniques &amp; when I returned to Gated Reverb I found it was marked for deletion. Well, 10/10 for speed, 0/10 for actually GOOGLING, finding out it IS a legit technique &amp; then helping me by making some changes so it <b>does</b> meet quality standards. I've added a few links to other internet articles on the subject hopefully to pacify the "original research" nazi. I agree with Sandstein that it needs a cleanup but it's a really trivial matter to verify that this is not original research so let's untag it.

<dd>Point taken, no offense intended. Didn't see any advertisments myself on Google. Lots of references to things like "I am trying to create the gated reverb effect - used on many productions like Genesis and ..." The first article listed is to a reputable recording magazine (Sound On Sound) with the following Quote:- <i>Probably the simplest form of change you can add to reverb is to call up a gated setting. This has no natural counterpart, so the abrupt cessation of reverb at the end of the gate period attracts attention. Getting a <b>gated reverb</b> sound is usually just a matter of calling up a suitable preset or creating your own patch using the editing parameters in your effects, but it can help to keep in mind how the effect was originally engineered.</i></dd>

<dd><i>The gated effect was first applied to drums, and involved putting up ambience mics in a very live room to capture the reverb sound. These mics were then fed through a conventional stereo gate, which was externally keyed from the close mics on the drum kit. Setting a hold time of half a second or so, followed by a fast release time, causes the gate to allow only the first half second of reverb to pass though after each drum hit, before closing again. Figure 1 shows how gated drums can be created using the traditional method. A compressor was often used to maintain the level of the reverb, and this is shown in the illustration. The result is the gated drum sound that has become something of a cliché, though the effect doesn't have to become stale if you use it sparingly.</i></dd>

<dd>This isn't the place for the discussion but although Flanging is an exemplary article it would be very hard to do the same thing with Gated reverb as it's what I would call a "derived" effect (the result of chaining two effects one after the other) whereas Flanging is a particular type of delay effect. If you examine anything you're going to do to a sound it drops into one of two camps - alteration (probably not the right term) or delay. A distortion pedal basically hard clips the signal which is an easy example of altering the timbre whereas a 1 second digital delay is a clear example of the latter. Flanging is the result of a very short delay and the way I remember from my copy of "The Digital Delay Handbook" it goes 1-3ms = Phasing, 4-10ms = Flanging, then in through Chorusing &amp; ADT to slapback echo so maybe we need an article on the theory of signal processing that brings all of these primary &amp; secondary effects together &amp; more importantly is linked to by all of these articles. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanic_15ef.html" title="User:Megamanic">Megamanic</a> 08:10, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are there very many articles about individual games? I'm a big college sports fan, but I have a little problem with recaps of individual games other than maybe national title games. Even then, if we're talking basketball, there's an article on each year's <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_390c.html" title="2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">tournament itself</a>, so you don't really need a separate article about the game. (Also, please note that this article is about the women's basketball championship game, so it should probably be renamed if it is kept.) I will not oppose a speedy keep if there is otherwise overwhelming consensus for a keep ... I just think that individual game articles set a dangerous crufty precedent (as much as I hate that word). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:48, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

He is a very minor figure on the Far Right, famous for the amount of times he has created or been part of some organization, which then splits because of him or which he re-names or which he disbands. Are we going to include every minor figure in politics who gets one reference in one book? 213.122.78.162 22:38, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was unable to find prominent news reports or academic papers not associated with Ken Standfield, who is credited with creating the term(and who wrote the article).

<li><b>Comment</b> Intangible accounting is real, but not strongly associated with Ken Standfield. See, for example, <a href="http://www.iasplus.com/standard/ias38.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.iasplus.com/standard/ias38.htm" rel="nofollow">International Accounting Standard 38 - Intangible assets</a>. This is a hot issue in the accounting community, covering issues such as how to value development costs of computer software, but the article here seems to be about something else entirely. Standfield is trying to figure out how to deal with accounting for non-financial items. This is a real subject. See, for example, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention_economy.html" title="Attention economy">Attention economy</a>; you can run out of attention separately from money, because you can't buy time. But Standfield's take on this seems to be off in another direction. I'm not sure what to make of this. It seems to be a reuse of a known term for a new idea. There could be an article on this subject, but it will need a neutral party with accounting expertise to write it. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 06:40, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your citation matches my very foggy understanding of accounting. It says, for example, that assets can be valued only if "it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the enterprise; and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably." In other words, it is very clearly concerned with the <i>dollar value</i> of intangible assets, and their role in <b>financial</b> transactions, just like everything else in accounting. The article we're discussing talks about "non-financial transactions" and is, as you say, something completely different. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:40, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See Nagle's comment above, and mine. I don't think this article is a valid description of how intangibles are treated in standard accounting. That is, what is being called "intangible accounting" is <i>not</i> "standard accounting practices for intangibles." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:42, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> unless provided with good, verifiable source citations, prior to expiration of AfD discussion showing that this is a currently accepted discipline. I know very little of accounting, but it bothers me that what the article says seems to conflict with what little I do know. I believed that in standard accounting intangibles were valued by the amount actually paid to acquire them; that is, they <i>are</i> treated as part of ordinary financial transactions. I worry that this article is using words like "capital" with private meanings that do not correspond to their dictionary definitions or their accepted usage in accounting or economics, and that perhaps one of Standfield's purposes in creating the article to <i>promote</i> novel meanings for these words. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:31, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Accounting may be concerned with intangible assets, but could someone point me to a non-KS use of the term "intangible accounting"? Right now it sort of seems like creating an article called "squishy physics". Sure physics deals with squishy things... but.... <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 22:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's worse than that, because there is AFAIK no <i>existing</i> meaning for the phrase "squishy physics." A better analogy would be someone writing an article on the ratiocination processes of police detectives under the title "fuzzy logic." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:04, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If there is actually a term "intangible accounting", we should have an article on it (i.e., we shouldn't delete the article, just KS's rubbish.) Is there a ref. to a non-KS use of the term? <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 23:05, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Maybe someone can add something intelligent on the subject in the Ken Standfield article. I've been reading some of his stuff, but it reads like this: <i>Intangible Management® is the science of converting potential into results through the effective management of knowledge, relationships, motivation, and speed.</i> Maybe if you can get past the buzzwords, there's something there, but it's going to take work to dredge it out. Anyway, it's definitely original research. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 04:13, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article repeats <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Objectivity (philosophy)">objectivity (philosophy)</a>, which itself states that it is "concerned by <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemic.html" title="Epistemic">epistemic</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysical.html" title="Metaphysical">metaphysical</a> discussions of objectivity", the possibility and the various ways (according to different domains - objectivity in physics is not the same as that in history) according to which objectivity can be achieved. It is a pure artificial distinction to radically separate the philosophical discussion of objectivity to other general <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity.html" title="Objectivity">objectivity</a> articles, since philosophers discuss about this general sense of objectivity. The nature of an objective reality, Kant's distinction between noumenons and phenomenons, the Hegelian dialectic about the spirit and history, marxist materialist conception about reality (necessarily historic reality), is an <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontological.html" title="Ontological">ontological</a> discussion, which could maybe be better carried on at the <a href="../../../b/e/i/Being.html" title="Being">being</a> article. If it is decided to be kept to the "objectivity (philosophy)" article, as well as the "propositions" subsection, this doesn't mean that it is necessary to create again ten thousands articles about objectivity in specific fields. The "objectivity (philosophy)" article should be used for a general discussion of objectivity in all fields. Philosophy is not, by definition, radically distinguished from "non-philosophical" topics, such as history, journalism, etc. Henceforth, to avoid noise and multiplication of articles, it would be wise to delete this one, and find a solution for the repeat of a general discussion on objectivity on the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity.html" title="Objectivity">objectivity</a> article and the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Objectivity (philosophy)">objectivity (philosophy)</a> article. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 19:21, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Beg your pardon?</b> I am not sure that I am mentally equipped to follow the reasoning of the nomination. As far as I'm aware, the concept of objectivity in science can be discussed without delving into Kant's distinction between noumena and phenomena; in fact, science is <i>only</i> about the world <i>as we experience it</i> and has no business in distinguishing it from a metaphysical concept of a presumed world as it <i>truly</i> is. The article is not quite a dictionary definition either, or else I should advise you to acquire another dictionary. If the nominator's recommendation is to <i>merge</i> this into <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Objectivity (philosophy)">Objectivity (philosophy)</a>, well, we don't need to do that through the mechanism of a deletion debate. But I'm not sure what the intention of the recommendation is. Perhaps it is to deny that there are other concepts of objectivity than the philosophical one, and that all traces should be erased of articles that attempt to bypass an ontological discussion using Hegelian dialectic. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:13, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Week keep</b> I think it was me who created the article. To follow Lambiam I feel there is significant difference to how the term objectivity is used in Science with its strict philosophical usage. In science it has a more pragmatic usage, perhaps more equivilent to <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity_%28journalism%29.html" title="Objectivity (journalism)">objectivity (journalism)</a>. It is more a thing to be aimed for rather than an absolute measure. Whilst I feel there is ample scope to expand this article to give a good treatment of how the word <i>objective</i> is used in science, alas I do not have time to devote to it. Further <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Objectivity (philosophy)">Objectivity (philosophy)</a> is too full of philosophical jargon to make it an accessable article for the average scientist. Further still quantum physics with its paradoxes related to observers has useful contribution to the whole notion of objectivity. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 14:01, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, mark as stub, and expand</b>.

A merge could be done if the editors of the two pages want to, but that should be discussed on those two pages. If a merge happens, and if the resultant redirect isn't necessary, though I suspect it would be, then that can be brought up at RFD. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 21:06, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b>. About "it seems as if it were written by a studio executive", just summarize the reactions from the people involved instead of quoting them in full, and the problem is solved. Other than those quotes, I don't see anything objectionable with the article. As Qutezuce said, it is just an article about a future film (one that's been talked about in the press quite a bit) like any other. This one's pretty high-profile, so while of course it could get cancelled (ANY future film could), there are plenty of sources verifying its existence. I think it would be more usefull for Wikipedia to have an article about it than to not ackowledge its existence because there's a slight chance that it won't be released (a chance which is always there with any future film). See: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. Unless you're advocating that ALL future film articles on Wikipedia be deleted, I don't see any reason to single this one out.

<li>You say it <i>will</i> involve Elton John and Kate Winslet. Very well, then: you are saying that when the movie is released it <i>will</i> be notable.

<li>Actually, a movie is not an event, it is a movie, so that section does not apply. This article is not about the date of the release of the movie, or the premiere party -- it is about the movie itself. And the movie currently exists, it does not exist as a series of 80000+ individual frames with accompanying audio, but it exists in the press, it exists in a early pre-production stage. Whether or not it actually comes out is a not relevent. If you want to argue that this be deleted you should be arguing that this film in its current state does not warrant inclusion because it is not notable enough. My counter-argument to that is that future films are acceptable fodder for articles (the Wikipedia is not a crystal ball section specifically mentions articles about future films when it says that those articles must be careful not to be advertising, hence it makes them acceptable articles as long as they are written in an NPOV manner), and this film in particular has merited mention in the press. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 06:12, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with what Qutezuce just said. Even IF the film doesn't come out, it's been talked about in the press enough to warrant an article. There are films which have never been released that have articles about them (see: <a href="../../../u/n/f/Category%7EUnfinished_films_9363.html" title="Category:Unfinished films">Category:Unfinished films</a>). If it is never released, the article could be changed to say that very fact in the opening line; that it was an animation project for which Elton John was to do the soundtrack that was never released. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, so I see nothing wrong with having an article on an unreleased film. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 14:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>By this logic, developing ideas should not be documented</b>. Do I understand this correctly? Given the highly dynamic nature of podcasting (which is also a neologism!) developments like podagogy quickly evolve. While distance education and related technologies may not be your cup of tea, they are of great interest to many in the education discipline. How long did a neologism like "podcasting" have to wait before it could be defined and developed in Wikipedia? --Randym 14:16, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongest possible keep</b> I'm going to basically paraphrase the argument I made on the talk page for this article: It is my opinion that every National Spelling Bee winner is quite notable. To win an extremely well-known and well-regarded competition, one which millions of people enter and has been nationally televised for a decade, is as strong a claim of notability as being a famous <a href="../../../g/o/_/Go_%28board_game%29.html" title="Go (board game)">Go</a> or poker player (and I'm a <i>huge</i> poker fan, so I don't want my <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Luske_35ae.html" title="Marcel Luske">Marcel Luske</a> article deleted!). Coming in second in this competition is definitely a claim of notability which may, in and of itself, help the person pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But, for the sake of disagreement, let's say it's not. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/CanSpell_National_Spelling_Bee_8eb3.html" title="CanSpell National Spelling Bee">CanSpell National Spelling Bee</a> is a nationally-held tournament in Canada, and both years it has been held, Finola has won it. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> asserts notability for "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events," and Finola has been involved in three different newsworthy events (albeit all regarding spelling). Just look at Yanksox's Google News link to see how widespread coverage of national spelling bees (American and Canadian) is.

<li><b>Keep</b> She is notable for being a Canadian in a US-based competition called the <i>National</i> Spelling Bee. Because of her, commentators noted a feature of the Bee that I (and I'm sure most other Americans watching) were not aware of: the contest is open to qualifying children in all English-speaking countries. As an example of one such child who placed in the Bee, she is notable. -<a href="../../../f/s/o/User%7EFsotrain09_ca86.html" title="User:Fsotrain09">Fsotrain09</a> 04:54, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The memory of this event is still quite strong in the minds of everyone and this is swaying there opinion toward keeping the article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The National Spelling Bee is a highly relevant event, and the runner-up certainly deserves recognition for her hard work and dedication. Additionally, Finola Hackett has become famous because of the primetime broadcast of the National Spelling Bee. She is also the Canadian national champion, and she should have an article for that reason alone. Keep her article! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.187.155.89 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.187.155.89_bd3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.187.155.89">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> per Kicking222 above, among others.

<li><b>Delete</b> I was going to include the word "weak" before the word "delete" because there is so much info on the game, but no matter how long the article is, the game is still pretty non-notable. It was a World Cup qualifier (not even an actual World Cup game) that did not <i>directly</i> lead to England qualifying; even if qualification had been the direct result of this game, England didn't even make the semifinals for this World Cup, much less win it. The game had no particularly spectacular qualities- hell, it wasn't even close. The article is also highly POV, written entirely from the British perspective. Thus, the game doesn't really have any notability, and thus, shouldn't really have a WP article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:48, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> — Well I'm a football/soccer fan, but I have a difficult time seeing the notability of individual matches except in a few cases.

<li><b>Comment</b> If this result really did impact both cultures, the article makes absolutely no claim of such (aside from a slight amount of POV material). The article itself claims that England had beaten Germany at <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro_2000.html" title="Euro 2000">Euro 2000</a>, less than 14 months prior, so this couldn't be such a spectacular upset. Germany's team was obviously not particularly demoralized, as they were the World Cup runners-up. Meanwhile, England's team couldn't have been particularly boosted, as they still only reached the quarterfinals. In hindsight, it's rather obvious that much more was made of this match than it should have been. As far as "unbalancing" the national teams' articles... well, this article is already quite unbalanced. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:16, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is a silly article IN MY OPINION, not exactly something an encyclopedia can do without is it. But I leaned more to the merge option than anything else. The lack of a decent title alone makes me sceptical about this being some pivotal moment in pop or sports history. As far as I am concerned it should be merged into the section on the England-Germany football rivalry. Despite it significance for some English people I really don't see much for a single article, there are literally thousands of football games at the national, club, or amateur level that have great sentimental value for some group somewhere and this is just one of them and nothing else. This article should go to England-Germany football rivaly or maybe even a brief mention in world cup 2002 article.Sorry, but really if you take away feelings of national pride there isn't much to make to discuss here except for one normal qualifying match to a championship --Westee 13:41, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep in some form</b> Can't decide between a merge or straight keep, although would probably lean towards a merge.

<li><b>Keep</b> This was one of the best results in the history of English football and is still talked about to this day as the greatest of the past 40 years.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This is one of the greatest and most significant matches in soccer history, well worthy of its own article. For those who don't seem to know, the high scoreline for a match between two strong footballing nations is an extremely rare event. I find it an outrage that its worthiness is even being questioned, and the pro-delete comments are preposterous, particularly the description of it being "non-notable". The match is still discussed in the bars of England and Germany to this day. Neither does the article justify the comment of "silly" - it is appropriately titled and well-written. I would question the impartiality and policy of the whole encyclopedia should this unfortunate unreasonable and provocative proposal be carried out. Instead I look forward to the degrading "scheduled for deletion" banner being removed pdq and this amazing soccer encounter being rightfully immortalised without further question.

<dd>Whatthe hell?? Why on Earth would this be considered one of the most important matches in football history. Now that claim I have never ever heard before. It was a qualifier last time I checked and neither Germany's worst defeat nor England's highest win and considering Germany went on to be second in the actual tournament it certainly can not be called a turning point in German football or the beginning of a spectacular winning streak for England. This match has been largely forgotten outside of England, mostly because of relative insignificance outside of that country. And beleive me mate this match is not regurlarly discussed in bars in Germany, now that I can guarantee you. One of the greatest matches in football history... uh no. A relatively average qualifying match that is celebrated by some England fans like an actual world cup victory; yes! --Westee 11:27, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: 1) Calling it non-notable and insignificant is rather subjective. These products have been around for 16 years. 2) Please define advertising.

Would it make a difference if we used Wireshark's entry as a template? 3) This seems to be motivated by a desire to stifle competition.

<li><b>Comment:</b> It was speedied once earlier, then restored after User:Jtakano asked for and received help (by me and others) in trying to rewrite it.

My own view is that it is at best marginally notable, but as User:Jtakano was reasonable about it and willing to listen to suggestions I gave it the benefit of the doubt. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrik_6ef6.html" title="User:Henrik">H</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrik_E_5da8.html" title="User:Henrik/E"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrik_6ef6.html" title="User:Henrik">nrik</a> 19:22, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> If many of you believe that the article is nonsense in Wikipedia, you may delete it, that's fine with me. But if you think the article can be improved in someway, like, merging informations, e.g. rife machines, then so much better. Or any other ideas? Jtakano
<dl>
<dd><i>Comment</i> Citing sources is always a good idea. There are three rationales posted above for deletion: 1) "non-notable", 2) "no relevant citations", and 3) "no verifiability". Citing sources would knock out #2 and #3. These should be independent sources. If it was invented, was it patented? If so, cite the patent for the invention. I don't know Japanese patent law, but I suspect there is some equivalent to the U.S. patent office that will have made a decision if an application was made. I know that <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrik_6ef6.html" title="User:Henrik">Henrik</a> said there aren't any internet based reliable sources, but hard copy is still legitimate.</dd>
<dd>For notability the way of solving the problem is less clear. Why is this worthy of being in an encyclopedia? What source are you going to cite to verify the answer to that question. It should be a source that is neither from the inventor, manufacturor, distributor nor a copy of a press release by one of those. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 21:28, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, precedent may mean these won't be deleted but it doesn't make them notable. School articles like this are the shame of Wikipedia. Our critics point at them, and their endless trivialities about the most utterly banal things, and their endless duplication of "facts" which are the same for every one of millions of identical schools across the world, as evidence that Wikipedia is good only for children. They are essentially wrecking our dreams of gaining some credibility as a serious encyclopedia. Do you see hundreds of articles about individual elementary schools in Britannica or Encarta? Nope. Think there could be a reason for that? Hmmm, I wonder. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't see the need for WP to pander to our detractors. Besides, their main cause of derision is the <i>edit this page</i> link on every page, something which is WP's major distinction and strength. Having articles that neither encyclopedia will touch is a part of WP's charm and a major distinction between them.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Anyone can publish a biography on themselves, claiming how they are the great pioneers of a new scientific field. Thing is, besides what he's said about himself, nothing else collaborates his story. The one article he published was NOT in a peer-reviewed publication. <i>Medical Hypotheses</i> is a publication that really fits the name. It's for the publishing of hypotheses and possibly radical thoughts, often in order to try to get support from others in investigating the ideas. The website even says that it's a <i>gateway</i> to mainstream science, but is not meant to be a mainstream scientific publication itself.

<p>This appears to be an attempt at getting consensus on the first paragraph of the Abortion article, with plenty of discussion on the talk page. While the discussion should probably be preserved somewhere, I don't think this belongs in the main article namespace. I suggest moving this somewhere under the talk page for the main abortion article. <a href="../../../h/i/r/User%7EHirudo_8b5b.html" title="User:Hirudo">Hirudo</a> 17:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Speedy</b>. I am the creator of this page and was not aware that this sort of convention was not appropriate. I figured since we had a subpage just for first paragraph discussion, it would be helpful to have a place to edit and try out new ideas that wasn't the main article (which would lead to edit warring).

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Having played both pieces, I'm quite certain that Chopin's Schzero Op. 31 is in B-flat minor (alternatively, in D-flat major, the key in which it ends), and his Prelude Op. 28 No. 15 in D-flat major, and I've never seen anything suggest otherwise. The Prelude has a <i>section</i> in C-sharp minor, which would be equivalent to the supposed D-flat minor. I've never seen this section written in flats, however, and I don't think the fact that there's one section of the Prelude that goes into a key, that, if written in flats, would constitute D-flat minor, is enough of a reason for saying that the Prelude is in D-flat minor. Furthermore, I can't see any place where the Scherzo goes into anything remotely approaching D-flat minor. The closest thing one can find is a section in E major, equivalent to F-flat minor, the relative key to D-flat minor. Unless there's an actual manuscript edition somewhere that suggests that these pieces were originally written in an eight-flat key signature, I'm inclined to dismiss this as a hoax. (I can't speak for the Rachmaninoff or Schubert pieces.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 22:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: those keys all technically "exist" (i.e. can be written in standard sharps and flats notation) within the circle of fifths. D-flat minor, however, is a non-existent key that involves being written using double-flats.

<ul>
<li>Here, let me explain. In music, major keys start from C major and either add sharps or add flats, up to a maximum of seven (there are seven named white keys in an octave with which to make sharp or flat). Minor keys are related to major keys in a one-to-one correspondence and are arrived at by taking the major key, going down three steps (not three letters) on a keyboard, and changing the "major" to "minor.</li>
<li>Starting from C major and adding sharps and going up a fifth every time one adds another sharp, one arrives at the key of <a href="../../../g/_/m/G_major.html" title="G major">G major</a>, which has one sharp (F sharp), then the key of <a href="../../../d/_/m/D_major.html" title="D major">D major</a>, which has two (F and C sharps), then <a href="../../../a/_/m/A_major.html" title="A major">A major</a> (FCG), <a href="../../../e/_/m/E_major.html" title="E major">E major</a> (FCGD), <a href="../../../b/_/m/B_major.html" title="B major">B major</a> (FCGDA), <a href="../../../f/-/s/F-sharp_major.html" title="F-sharp major">F-sharp major</a> (FCGDAE), and <a href="../../../c/-/s/C-sharp_major.html" title="C-sharp major">C-sharp major</a> (FCGDABB). After this, there are no more keys going up, as all named white keys ABCDEFG have already had a sharp applied to them. Therefore, there is no key that is a fifth above C-sharp major, which would technically be G-sharp major.</li>
<li>The minor key corresponding to C major is <a href="../../../a/_/m/A_minor.html" title="A minor">A minor</a>, and the minor keys corresponding to the major keys I've just listed by adding sharps are <a href="../../../e/_/m/E_minor.html" title="E minor">E minor</a>, <a href="../../../b/_/m/B_minor.html" title="B minor">B minor</a>, <a href="../../../f/-/s/F-sharp_minor.html" title="F-sharp minor">F-sharp minor</a>, <a href="../../../c/-/s/C-sharp_minor.html" title="C-sharp minor">C-sharp minor</a>, <a href="../../../g/-/s/G-sharp_minor.html" title="G-sharp minor">G-sharp minor</a>, <a href="../../../d/-/s/D-sharp_minor.html" title="D-sharp minor">D-sharp minor</a>, and <a href="../../../a/-/s/A-sharp_minor.html" title="A-sharp minor">A-sharp minor</a>. Again, there is no minor key that is a fifth above A-sharp minor, as this would involve an eighth sharp, and there are only seven notes to sharp.</li>
<li>Adding flats brings a key <i>down</i> by a fifth every time another flat is added. Starting from C major and going down, one arrives at the key of <a href="../../../f/_/m/F_major.html" title="F major">F major</a>, which has one flat (B flat), then the key of <a href="../../../b/-/f/B-flat_major.html" title="B-flat major">B-flat major</a> (B and E flats), <a href="../../../e/-/f/E-flat_major.html" title="E-flat major">E-flat major</a> (BEA), <a href="../../../a/-/f/A-flat_major.html" title="A-flat major">A-flat major</a> (BEAD), <a href="../../../d/-/f/D-flat_major.html" title="D-flat major">D-flat major</a> (BEADG), <a href="../../../g/-/f/G-flat_major.html" title="G-flat major">G-flat major</a> (BEADGC), and <a href="../../../c/-/f/C-flat_major.html" title="C-flat major">C-flat major</a> (BEADGCF). Again, after this, all named white keys ABCDEFG have already had a flat applied to them. Therefore, there is no key with an eighth flat that is a fifth below C-flat major (which would be F-flat major).</li>
<li>The minor keys corresponding to these keys are, respectively, <a href="../../../d/_/m/D_minor.html" title="D minor">D minor</a>, <a href="../../../g/_/m/G_minor.html" title="G minor">G minor</a>, <a href="../../../c/_/m/C_minor.html" title="C minor">C minor</a>, <a href="../../../f/_/m/F_minor.html" title="F minor">F minor</a>, <a href="../../../b/-/f/B-flat_minor.html" title="B-flat minor">B-flat minor</a>, <a href="../../../e/-/f/E-flat_minor.html" title="E-flat minor">E-flat minor</a>, and <a href="../../../a/-/f/A-flat_minor.html" title="A-flat minor">A-flat minor</a>. The key that would theoretically follow next is a fifth down from A-flat minor, which is D-flat minor -- the subject of the article in question. The issue is that D-flat minor would involve an eighth flat.</li>
<li>Basically, the imaginary keys that have eighth or more flats -- in this case D-flat minor -- are nothing more than that: imaginary. Hence why this key is not the same as the other keys listed by Lambiam. Hope that all made sense. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 23:19, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was a music minor in college. I'm aware of how the typical scale structure works, and I'm still not at all bothered by this article. My puzzlement is why people are looking to delete this, as it's otherwise legitimate, albeit obscure and little-used, as well as not entirely technically sound. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:22, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, you looked a bit confused. :-) I still don't see the basis of your opposition. It's not a legitimate key. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 23:28, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>TheProject, my understanding is that what you are saying is only true for equal-temperament scales. In other temperaments, you can sharp or flat anything as many times as you want. B-double-flat is not exactly the same as A. D-flat minor has to exist, because, for example, you might want to modulate up a fourth from A-flat minor. If you announced that you were then in C-sharp minor, you'd be theoretically wrong, and in a non-equal-temperament scale, you'd be tonally wrong as well. I'm not a music major, so I admit I could be missing something, but I can't figure out what it is. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 04:44, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Very true -- it does apply strictly to equal-temperament, and I hadn't quite thought about that. But unless there's a notable work written before equal temperament in D-flat minor, I think this should be a non-issue. If we included D-flat minor based on equal temperament alone, we'd also have to include A-sharp major, which seems absurd to me. Also, as I've said already, I can't find any works in this supposed key, probably because equal-temperament occurred soon after notation was developed. :-) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 06:41, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Did some more research on the four pieces supposedly in D-flat minor listed in the article. The two Chopin works I've covered in my comment already, and looking through Amazon's collections of recordings of either work should verify that the Scherzo is in B-flat minor/D-flat major and the Prelude is in D-flat major. The Rachmaninoff work doesn't exist -- his Op. 8 is a trio elegante, and the work on the CD in the link I believe refers to Scriabin's Op. 8 No. 10, which is in D-flat major, according to B&amp;N<a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?z=y&amp;PWB=1&amp;EAN=89408058226" class="external autonumber" title="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?z=y&amp;PWB=1&amp;EAN=89408058226" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> and Amazon<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006419G/sr=8-2/qid=1150241747/ref=sr_1_2/104-6948942-8137522?%5Fencoding=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006419G/sr=8-2/qid=1150241747/ref=sr_1_2/104-6948942-8137522?%5Fencoding=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, and I suspect it's similar to the two Chopin works with modulation in key. As for the Schubert quartet, look at the cover image carefully: the title card says "String Quartets in E flat and D minor". A look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_compositions_by_Schubert_7fc0.html" title="List of compositions by Schubert">List of compositions by Schubert</a> verifies indeed that the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_and_the_Maiden_Quartet_%28Schubert%29_9221.html" title="Death and the Maiden Quartet (Schubert)">Death and the Maiden Quartet</a> is indeed in D minor. So we're again left without any piece in the supposed key of D-flat minor, and quite frankly, I'd change "little-used" to "never-used". :-) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 23:42, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I appreciate the level of research and knowledge being brought to bear here. I should stress that I have no technical knowledge of music, I'm merely looking for examples of D-flat minor music referenced out on the web.

<ul>
<li>Not having heard or seen the score for this piece, I can't really speak for it, but the article mentions that the key is modulated into (i.e. the piece moves to the key temporarily) for a two bar-phrase. This isn't really writing in the key -- for example, moving to a key a fifth above the key that the piece is written for, temporarily, is standard in classical pieces, and sometimes, if a piece is written in C-sharp major, the music will move temporarily into the imaginary key of G-sharp major. However, the piece won't actually change keys to G-sharp major; the temporary key change is simulated, rather than written in. Also, given that the key of the piece is B minor (two sharps), I'm wondering if perhaps it's simulated in C-sharp minor (four sharps), rather than D-flat major (eight flats), as it would be very unusual to simulate a key written in flats (and especially with so many flats) using a base key written in sharps. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 22:56, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe the wisest thing to do here is to <b>Redirect</b> to C# minor, and add a note about the non-existence or rarity of Db minor. Perhaps in some methods or other pieces of music Db is seen as a learning exercise? Also in Jazz keys change often, and a tonal center may conveniently be writte as Db minor, as opposed to C# minor--This is done becuase the key signature need not be changed and no confusion occurs. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 00:52, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In my view, it doesn't seem appropriate to delete schools on a piecemeal basis when the community has not arrived at consensus on a policy or guideline, see <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a>. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 18:38, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Counter-comment</b> While universities, colleges, etc. have plausible claims to notability based upon their age, alumni, research, etc., I just don't see how any K-8 school could possibly be notable for anything other than an unusual teaching method—which this one doesn't seem to have. As an aside, I'd have rejected the proposal you link to as too lenient. —<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanmcdaniel_1d51.html" title="User:Ryanmcdaniel">Ryan McDaniel</a> 19:08, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As mentioned in the Wounded Soldier afd I have heard and used this term many times. Obviously it is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>, but there does appear to be some source material for it which I found here <a href="http://www.yacht-volant.org/SailorTalk/seaterms08.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yacht-volant.org/SailorTalk/seaterms08.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> which appears to be from a book on similar subjects.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I have to agree strongly that this is inline with Wireshark's entry. I also do not consider a developer attempting to document the history and evolution of its products, which it appears is the intent of Wireshark as well, to be considered advertising. Does anyone recall Wireshark's entry when it first appeared? I am sure it is similar to OmniPeek's, which given the chance to evolve, would be supplemented by end-users and take on the community feel I believe was intended. Perhaps adapting to a format inline with Wiresharks would be more acceptable.Josh Gluck 11:18, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: 1) Calling it non-notable is rather subjective. These products have been around for 16 years. 2) Please define advertising. As mentioned before, <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wireshark.html" title="Wireshark">Wireshark</a> is much more akin of traditional and typical advertising. Would it make a difference if we used Wireshark's entry as a template? In fact, you could pretty much replace <i>Wireshark</i> with <i>OmniPeek</i> in that entry -- would that be better? 3) This seems to be motivated by a desire to stifle competition. Steven Fisher is a contributor to Wireshark, which makes him biased. --<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahboud_5e43.html" title="User:Mahboud">mahboud</a> 08:02, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If you could specifically point out where <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">Wikiproject schools</a> says anything about "all existing schools are notable," I'd appreciate it. As far as I can tell, the only reference there is in the context of suggesting that articles about "notable schools" (which implies that there are nonnotable schools ... otherwise, why the distinction?) should be formatted in a certain way. Unless, of course, you're referring to the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">rejected proposal</a> having to do with schools, which does address notability but has the unfortunate characteristic of being proposed-but-rejected and thus non-policy.

<li>Please don't lump me in with one side or another. I also made no comment as to whether or not anyone achieved a "victory" of any kind.

<li>Its drivel! They didn't even bother to write anything about it or even provide an album cover.

<li>Let me expand on this. If people deem it important enough to call out an artist or band's song to its own page, then they should have something to <i>say</i> about it. This page could barely justify four lonely words. I think that when it was decided that individual songs or albums could get their own articles, it was intended that there be some interesting or <i>notable</i> reason. Basically, <i>notable</i> is the watchword that trumps all others. This just isn't worth the nanometers of magentic disk space it is consuming. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeccampbell_ddc7.html" title="User:Georgeccampbell">george</a> 20:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. Unfortunately, however, the only person guilty of "character assassination" is Louis Dorman himself. As the article's citations show, he is thoroughly guilty of what the article accuses him of. In fact, it was even accompanied by a public admission, which I attempted to discuss with Gtoomey in his <a href="../../../g/t/o/User_talk%7EGtoomey_8d47.html" title="User talk:Gtoomey">talk page</a>.

His ads were featured in nationally printed, well-known bodybuilding and entertainment magazines including (but not limited to): FHM, Muscle and Fitness, MensJournal, Menshealth, Maxim,and Flex. <a href="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showpost.php?p=5405850&amp;postcount=7" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showpost.php?p=5405850&amp;postcount=7" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> in addition, as you can see -- the bodybuilding community congregates largely online, and on message boards -- and Dorman happened to be exposed there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.79.43.137 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.79.43.137.html" title="User talk:24.79.43.137">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.79.43.137_9ec1.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.79.43.137">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. Article needs better evidence of notability and could use a rewrite to de-brochureise it, but the consensus for Keep seems clear to me. Agree with Alphachimp's (et al) criticisms of the article as it is now, and if it isn't fixed in a few months, that's certainly reason to renominate, but the consensus is clear to me at this time. --<b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 04:52, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page appears to be a promotion for an economic development scheme, rather than an explanation of a geographical term that is already in common use. I have lived in Cambridge since 1998 and I read the local newspapers and newsgroups, but while I am well aware of Oxford-Cambridge academic links and the term "Oxbridge" I have never heard mention of an "Oxford-Cambridge Arc".

<li><b>Delete.</b> This is a totally non-notable marketing campaign and wishful thinking by Bedfordshire County Council, to capitalize on the success of Cambridge and Oxford.

<p>The result of the debate was Speedy keeping. I'm taking "already realized I made a mistake" as a tacit request to withdraw the AFD. That, combined with two speedy keeps, is good enough for me.

<li>I reread it, and I don't think that changes my opinion on the matter. It's a well-written and informative article, don't get me wrong, I just don't think the subject matter is encyclopedic, unless this is something that university dining facilities are modeled after the world over or something. It's just where people eat. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscrimate collection of information</a>, and I don't think it meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, either. I realize that the housing facilities have their own article as well, but I'm thinking of AfD'ing that one, too, pretty much for the same reasons I AfD'd this one (although I think that a long-standing living arrangement that stretches back fifty years is inherently a little more notable than dining arrangements). -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:15, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I think that this can potentially be very helpful for new UC Berkeley students. First of all, it is a good introduction to what Cal Berkeley represents. For example, potential students can see that our dining facilities serve only organic food. This reflects not only our emphasis on personal health, but also of the well-being of the environment and farmers. There are also many places to eat on campus that many students don't know about. For example, students most commonly eat at the dining halls or the Golden Bear Cafe, but there are other on campus locations such as Ramona's or Pat Brown's Grill that provide food. I have met many students that have never been to these locations and didn't even know about them. All in all, I believe that this article can be very useful for not only new/enrolled students to see what Berkeley has to offer, but offer an unbiased (something not written by the University) opinion. Also, it can be linked to from the Berkeley main site in order to show, more in-depth, the great facilities that are offered at this university other than the best education in the world.

<li><b>Keep</b> The overall arguments for deletion have been clearly addressed and refuted, and as a rule, I pay no attention to people that repeat their arguments.

<dl>
<dd>Smaller locations are noted alongside the well-known dining halls, providing awareness of the possible eating options for this international school (information which I propose to be expanded). An incredibly high number of people (not just students) are on this campus a day, and knowledge of these restaurants will be helpful during their stay at Berkeley. Cal Dining's efforts towards organic foods and an environmentally friendly program are of particular significance at a time when people have finally begun to realize the importance of environmental-friendly practices. The article's inclusion of these efforts enlightens others on what can be done and serves as a model for any other similar facilities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incoming UC students will undoubtedly find this information helpful, as well as tourists, parents, professors, international dignitaries, and the like. Information about Cal Dining serves a world-wide audience and an article is very much needed to carry this information to readers.</dd>

<li><i>The overall arguments for deletion have been clearly addressed and refuted</i> Ah, that old stand-by, the unilateral declaration of victory. Uh, no.</li>
<li><i>An incredibly high number of people (not just students) are on this campus a day, and knowledge of these restaurants will be helpful during their stay at Berkeley.</i> That's what those nice maps around campus are for. That what this nice website -- <a href="http://caldining.berkeley.edu/" class="external free" title="http://caldining.berkeley.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://caldining.berkeley.edu/</a> -- is for. That's what turning to your hosts, fellow students, or someone walking by and saying, "Say, where can I get a bagel around here?" is for. Wikipedia? Not so much.</li>
<li><i>Cal Dining's efforts towards organic foods and an environmentally friendly program are of particular significance at a time when people have finally begun to realize the importance of environmental-friendly practices.</i> Dude, Cal Dining isn't unique in that regard. Cal Dining isn't unique in <i>Berkeley</i> in that regard. Cal Dining isn't unique among <i>schools in Berkeley</i> in that regard (just ask <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Waters_34d1.html" title="Alice Waters">Alice Waters</a>).</li>
<li><i>The motivating factor for one disagreeing member is to mop "up after the dishonest, incompetent, and fanatical."</i> More irrelevancies -- I haven't brought any of those things up. When it comes to dishonesty, for example, I tend to think of things like <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESockpuppet_ef0b.html" title="WP:Sockpuppet">sockpuppetry</a>, when one person creates multiple accounts to give the illusion of mass support -- accounts that invariably have only a few edits and identical prose/rhetorical styles. When it comes to fanaticism, I tend to think of editors tendentiously wikilawyering, pushing for views or opinions that extremely narrow or of interest only to a tiny minority. When it comes to incompetence, I think of those that try all of the above despite that fact it's been tried -- many times daily, it seems -- with limited success. But I didn't bring them up, and surely none of those things apply here?</li>
<li><i>This article is accurate, concise, and far from extreme.</i> Well, at least it's not obsequious, clairvoyant, or purple -- qualities just as applicable to the <b>actual</b> issue at hand; that is, <b>whether the article is suitable for Wikipedia in the first place</b>.</li>
<li><i>It is difficult to imagine why people would have a problem with such articles.</i> I'm not sure why you have difficulty imagining what people have <b>told you directly</b>, but we all have our crosses to bear, I guess.</li>

<dl>
<dd>The debate about cruft is clearly a subjective one. My questioning of your World of Warcraft articles brings to light what you think cruft is. If you feel WoW articles are not cruft but this Cal Dining one is, please argue why. This current discussion pertains to the Cal Dining article only, but I believe that if anyone's definition of cruft is biased, his or her crufty argument against the article should be disregarded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I followed your WP:CRUFT link, and it states that fancruft "can be a contributing factor in [an article's] deletion, but it is not the actual reason for deletion." This brings to me wonder why we are even debating this point. It also states that "Non-canon fanfiction, in whatever fictional realm, is rarely considered encyclopaedic." To me, articles for WoW are certainly fanfiction, and I feel that your arguments against this article are hypocritical. Again, this is not an attack against you but against your minimalist arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The question now is whether this article is an encyclopaedic subject. One previous post feels that this argument reads like a travel guide, but I disagree. Following the "Wikipedia is not" link provided in that post, it states that "An article on Paris should mention landmarks." Although a dining hall at Cal certainly does not compare to Paris' Eiffel Tower, the dining program is an intricate and important part of any post-secondary school. In a liberal sense, the article discusses some of the landmarks at Cal. There has been a precedent set by the article on <a href="../../../u/c/_/UC_Berkeley_student_housing_9711.html" title="UC Berkeley student housing">Cal student housing</a>, as well as the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Tech_campus_85cc.html" title="Virginia Tech campus">Virginia Tech article</a>, which includes information on its dining halls.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree with the most recent post, which argues that the article is of no interest to anyone outside UC Berkeley. Please read the first post I made (06:56, 14 June 2006 UTC). If tourists, parents, company recruiters/representatives, and international dignitaries aren't considered people outside of UC Berkeley, then I truly don't know who are. Instead of assuming that this information is available to "them" elsewhere, find it. The information offered in the article is more comprehensive than it is anywhere else. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApook_3190.html" title="User:Apook">Apook</a> 17:57, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frankly, I don't really care at all whether the information is available to people elsewhere. I'm also rather uninterested in precedents; Wikipedia has its share of bad or unnecessary or otherwise unfortunate articles, WoW themed and otherwise. None of them have any bearing here. Furthermore, Apook, I must respectfully point out that I am not convinced that you're not a sockpuppet. Even if you are not, I must also point out that with the exception of a single edit on <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monta_Vista_High_School_9d8f.html" title="Monta Vista High School">Monta Vista High School</a>, you have never contributed to Wikipedia except twice on your own user page, and on this discussion. This, particularly when combined with your comments, leads me to believe that you are not familiar with Wikipedia's goals or policies and as such I will take your arguments with a grain of salt. I realize that you feel that this article should stay, but this far your arguments for that have mostly ignored any arguments against its inclusion and have been based on inconsequential and irrelevant straw men, such as whether WoW articles are fan fiction or whether landmarks in capital cities are somehow comparable to landmarks in universities. And yes, I'm sure that WP:CRUFT says many things, but WP:CRUFT is an essay, not a policy or a guideline. In any case, consensus will settle this issue in the end, not armchair lawyering or arguments about the wording of specific rules. I think you can very clearly see where the consensus is heading right now. If you want to change that, I suggest that instead of arguing here, you work on the article to establish notability -- if you can -- because <i>that</i> will most likely sway us. Building straw men here will not. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 04:03, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hey, Morgan, I dont mean to be rude, but what does how active a user is matter into anything? Just because I'm not all that active doesn't mean I dont figure into the discussion at hand.

<li>A simple look at the forums will show how notable this modification truly is.

<li>Iron Grip's AfD was actually no consensus, and most keep votes actually wanted to merge it with a list of Half-Life 2 mods. Per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, only claims to notability are PC Gamer ref (whether or not it's "trivial" is questionable) and player numbers for a game that's not out yet (forum numbers are worth considering, but what are the standards for a mod?). I get the impression that WP:SOFTWARE does not include reputation in the HL2 mod community. <b>Very very weak delete.</b> <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 03:00, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you should stop trusting impressions and actually become a member of the community. How can a person from outside the HL2 news feed possibly understand how popular or not a mod is, and pass judgement properly? I don't know how many mods can claim over 100,000 posts over a period of three years, many mods cannot even claim to have lasted three years. No More Room in Hell is the first of many HL2 zombie modifications, has been published in a noted gaming magazine, and needs to be treated with the respect it deserves. --StukaAce 03:07, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, the only sources I consulted for the above ref were the image you linked to (I can't imagine it would have gone much, or any, longer than what was in the image) and WP:SOFTWARE. Second, so far the only person defending this article that hasn't started posting in the past day is IU2002. You seem to be conferring a lot of notability on a mod that hasn't even been released yet. I did not claim that this was not unpopular, only that I didn't know how popular it had to be and that I didn't know if certain standards of popularity mattered at all. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 03:28, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - While it is policy to treat with newcomes with respect (as all editors here have), more weight is traditionally given to arguments from editors who are more <i>experienced</i>.

<li>By what you say, it seems it's obviously not judged by a hardcoded policy, just by people who have been around wikipedia longer then the newcomer has. I understand what you're thinking and that it's human nature to assume that those more experienced are more credible then those that are new, but it is conflicting to have a policy saying to treat all newcomers with respect and to consider their ideas while the members of wikipedia judge more on the basis of join date or edit count.<a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoob_cannon_lol_5f36.html" title="User:Noob cannon lol">Noob cannon lol</a> 16:05, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<b>Comment'</b> As per Xiliquem on the AFD:NeoTokyo debate, just because something is unknown outside of its core following (in this case, players who are into modifications of already existing games) does not mean that the subject should be non-notable, as editors are going to have different tastes, and would consider different pages Non-Notable and worthy of an AFD. As someone who has spent sometime covering the gaming modification scene off and on for the past almost two years now, the modification scene is getting to a point where the makers of the mods are quickly becoming the next generation of game designers, and the modifications only differ with actual games on a price point and the fact that unlike most retail titles, the mods work on an almost beta testing status once they go public. Is the subject non-notable to me? Not by a longshot. Is it non-notable to the nominator? Yes, ,but in my opinoun there may be some articles on some topics that I would find non-notable that likewise appeal towards the taste of the nominator of this AfD. Is it non-notable to others? Well, that depends on one's taste. The facts have been established that the subject has been featured at least once in PC Gamer, which is one of, if not THE, top magazines in the United States covering the PC Gaming industry and I would consider a respected technical magazine on the issue, thusly in this editors' eyes satisfying WP:Software, as well as anywhere from 14,200 to over 20,000 Google hits depending on the search terms, which in my eyes passes the Google test. Furthermore, even IF the subject truly is non-notable, its not like the subject is taking up valuable space on Wikipedia, its not going to harm a darn thing if heavenforbid a page with information on an unreleased modification was allowed to stand, just like its not going to hurt for some other page pertaining towards a niche audience to remain standing. --<a href="../../../i/u/2/User%7EIU2002_8174.html" title="User:IU2002">IU2002</a> 05:01, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry, but it's a fan-made mod. I would say that only mods that are commercially-released could be said to automatically attain notability by their release. Fan-made mods need to <i>earn</i> their notability, otherwise the place would be clogged up with every single one ever made. Since this mod hasn't even been released, and that there therefore exists nothing to tell us how many people have downloaded/played it, how can it assert notability? Come back if it becomes an insanely popular mod... but at the moment the article verges on both advertising and crystal ballism. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 08:19, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I visit many forums and hang out with nerds of all shapes and sizes, and this is the first time I've ever seen the term "sock puppet" used in that way. It seems to be exclusive to Wikipedia and yet, for some strange reason, it has it's own page. What's so "notable" about an inside joke? For that matter, why is there a page about Ugoff from the Burger King commercials? Three years from now no one will remember him, nor will they care. You all seem to be under the impression that this is a legitimate encyclopedia, when the reality is that it's a haven for external links and disposable pop culture references. I guess the reason we're all new is because we didn't feel passionate enough about a subject to edit it. Are we all supposed to correct 50 minor grammatical errors to be accepted into your elitist encyclopedia society? What a joke. Ouij 09:17, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> It would be wiser to ask everyone participating in this discussion to read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not</a>, Mr. Johnson. The <i>NMRIH</i> project exists and is verified by at least one external source. This voids the claim of not being <i>notable</i>. Wikipedia articles are not legitimated by hitting a made up number of people knowing about the subject of the article, as this would be against the idea of having a wikipedia. Also popularity of the subject is not a concern, either, otherwise articles like ["<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide</a>"] would have to be deleted due to being "unpopular" and "politically incorrect". The accusation of advertisement is not applicable for wikipedia entries in general, as wikipedia articles require the user to actually inquire about the subject. The only way to use an article as advertisement is to bias it in favor of the subject and then link to it externally. Being a freely available product instead of a commercial one does not make a subject inferior to others and does not prevent it to have it's own wikipedia article. The only difference of information value presented in this article caused by an release would be to change it from "has been attempted" to "has been done", the innovation value would be very similar. My main issue with this article is the estimated release date, as that is speculation, although it is not enough to justify a deletion of the whole article and may be considered custom for modifications in general. IMO the page is well structured and rather unbiased and anyone looking for informations about game modifications will find suitable information about the project. I'd like to see similar information on other modifications in their respective articles, as I doubt that this would cause damage to wikipedia's structure or credibility. -- Anapher 11:00, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'd have to say keep. Although I was directed from a forum is it not enough that the community behind the mod makes it notable. A mention in a well known publication is notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a webpage hosting company. If the modmakers want a place to host information about their mod, there is a place called the 'internet' they can use. Also, there is never any guarantee of a mod ever being released, so this mod could simply drop off the face of the earth. If the mod is actually -released-, then perhaps it might be notable enough for Wikipedia, but unless someone on the mod team is famous, definitely delete this article.

<p>This modification is eminent in the modding community, never dropping below fifth on the top 100 half life 2 mods list on moddb. There have also been two magazine articles that found the mod to be worthy of notice. If you have a problem with the mod being free and not a commercial production, then maybe you can understand that it was included in publications that are sold commercially. This mod is very prominent even without being released, which is saying something don't you think? The fact that NMRIH can attain so much publicity and support without even being released yet shows how notable the soon to be released game is. I don't know why people have it out for this article, but there are literally thousands of other articles that are less notable than this. -Bizarro1</p>

Deletion debates are intended to elicit the opinions of established Wikipedia editors, not people who vote solely to save their favorite game without making any other contribution to Wikipedia (and who tend to misunderstand Wikipedia policy).

<li>You should also read it more clearly. Deletion debates are not limited to established Wikipedia editors. The conclusion of the debate is reached by the consensus of a whole determined by the administrator. The consensus depends on the quality of arguments no matter the edit count or join date, not how many people vote for keep/delete. Point me to the policy that says that the argument brought by an experienced editor should always be considered more highly than someone who has contributed much less. Don't give me any of that "tend to" crap.

<li><b>Comment</b> Sure, go ahead and delete this Wiki, but if you do, how about we delete every wiki that has been made to cover a movie, a book, a mod, or any thing else that has work put into it and is not yet released. And if your are so hellbent on deleting things that you "don't cover", why don't we go ahead and delete EVERY wiki just to keep everyone happy? .

<li><b>Keep</b> First off, yes, I'm from the forum, same name. I'm currently not very active in the forum, and instead stay in the IRC channel for the mod. Also, I've only made a few minor edits to Wikipedia outside this article. That shouldn't matter, really, and I'm getting it out of the way first. I'll try to repeat as little as possible, but this modification has achieved notability in a Subscription Magazine distributed to a very large audience, and is one of the top Half-Life 2 mods on Mod DB. At the time of this comment it is #3 on the list, with more "Unique Hits Total" (14,818) than even <a href="../../../g/m/o/Gmod.html" title="Gmod">Gmod</a>. That's almost 15,000 unique hits from a single webpage. It has been interviewed by an internet radio station and featured in a magazine, <i>for being notable</i>. It is respected and lauded by those both within and out of the internet community of zombie modifications and Half-Life 2 modifications in general. I vote keep for this article because many of the arguments against are biased or irrelevant due to the circumstance in that this mod is due to release soon, anyhow. The prediction that is being termed under Crystal Ball is a statement by the team mebers themselves. Though the general lack of media as opposed to other modifications may seem to work against my point, the team has been incredibly tight-lipped about the modification, hiding the overwhelming majority of their work from the public. Taking the released media as a sign of the mod in general would be like looking at a drop of rain and claiming that there is no such thing as a flood. As for my statement that the arguments against this page are biased, other mods mentioned earlier in this discussion were only paid attention to during this discussion. They were allowed to sit unviewed until brought up as 'evidence', and only then were they properly brought to debate. It seems that too many of those voting Delete are skipping over the discussion and going straight for the kill, as that is what seems to be the opinion of the other Wikipedia regulars. This argument is undoubtedly biased on both sides, but there are valid arguments within that bias. The only way that this article could serve as an advertisement is if it was featured on the main page, and even then I use the term advertisement very lightly. The intention of this article is to inform those who wish to be informed, the same as Wikipedia itself. --RelicLord 01:48, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't oppose that information being known, Morgan, but why would it matter? If we are all here to debate whether or not an article should be removed, and are basing this argument on Wikipedia standards, what difference does it make that someone is new? It seems that you are trying to belittle the opinions of those against you by bringing up background information. You have not told the background of those who say Delete, only those who say Keep. We are all stating opinions and facts to support our respective sides on the issue. I would appreciate it if the debate could be taken at value, and above a personal level. Are my words denounced by the sole fact that I am writing them? What person, only knowing of me through this page, can properly judge me? Categorizing me only through an opinion is prejudice, and nothing more. --RelicLord 20:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I just briefly had a look over this discussion after just being informed of its existance only minutes ago. I am the project manager for No More Room in Hell. Theres just a few points I would like to make in defense of keeping this article on wikipedia. First off, this project is very notable having been mentioned in PC Gamer (US) and PC Format (UK). Both magazines are highly respected in the field of PC Gaming and mod development news. Another reason, as mentioned before, is that this project is usually in the top 5 of the ModDB Top 100 mods. We have a highly dedicated fanbase as well as a thriving community. What would be the point of deleting this wiki entry? Does this entry harm anyone? Does it hurt anything? No, it doesn't. As for the arguement about it being advertising, that is rediculous. In order to find this you would have to actually search for it (to the best of my knowledge). This entry to me seems completely legitimate and should be kept. Thanks. --Cs42886

<li><b>Comment</b> (Because I always stick my nose in). Out of curiosity, what is everyone's beef with just deleting it, and then recreating it upon a successful release? With everyone seeming to expect an imminent release, it's not like you'll have to wait long. Minimum effort, minimum fuss - everyone's happy. Unless, of course, you don't think it'll be successful. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngry_Lawyer_b02e.html" title="User:Angry Lawyer">Angry Lawyer</a> 11:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> People search Wikipedia for information. If someone wants quick information, they usually consult Wikipedia. The article exists to inform others of the mods existence, and can be updated with newer information quicker then a normal webpage, as the webmaster may be on break or something similar.--StukaAce 13:11, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia is not supposed to be free web-hosting; all that publicly exists of the mod so far are screenshots and other media, some text and a promise that something playable will get released one day; also, if the mod creators have a website that's difficult to update, then that's their problem. And they shouldn't really be significantly editing a Wikipedia article about themselves, anyhow. --<a href="../../../h/i/d/User%7EHiddenInPlainSight_7a9d.html" title="User:HiddenInPlainSight">HiddenInPlainSight</a> 16:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> No other mod in PC Gamer screenshot has an article. Therefore using it to establish notability is questionable.
