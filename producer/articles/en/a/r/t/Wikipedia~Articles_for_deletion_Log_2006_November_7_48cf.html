<dd><b>Comment</b>Yes, as it stands, it is just a list. As well, several articles on that list already have articles on them. I suggest expanding the concept of the article to house content, so it is not simply a list of names. This should serve several purposes. Consolidating information, developing stubs which are not yet ready for their own articles, and making deletionists happy by only having a single article. As you have noted, JChap, CUUPs, one of the UU affiliate organizations, has an article which may have reliable sources. It is reasonable to assume that since one independent affiliate organization has been written of in reliable sources, that others may be found in the future. Closing with a note, I see both JChap and myself are posting this thrice at the three ongoing AfDs about IAOs or the UUA; perhaps this would be simpler if we simply discussed it at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnitarian_Universalist_Independent_Affiliate_organizations_dc2a.html" title="Talk:Unitarian Universalist Independent Affiliate organizations">Talk:Unitarian Universalist Independent Affiliate organizations</a> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellaNorCal_013f.html" title="User:HellaNorCal">HellaNorCal</a> 23:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Yes, as it stands, it is just a list. As well, several articles on that list already have articles on them. I suggest expanding the concept of the article to house content, so it is not simply a list of names. This should serve several purposes. Consolidating information, developing stubs which are not yet ready for their own articles, and making deletionists happy by only having a single article. As you have noted, JChap, CUUPs, one of the UU affiliate organizations, has an article which may have reliable sources. It is reasonable to assume that since one independent affiliate organization has been written of in reliable sources, that others may be found in the future. Closing with a note, I see both JChap and myself are posting this thrice at the three ongoing AfDs about IAOs or the UUA; perhaps this would be simpler if we simply discussed it at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnitarian_Universalist_Independent_Affiliate_organizations_dc2a.html" title="Talk:Unitarian Universalist Independent Affiliate organizations">Talk:Unitarian Universalist Independent Affiliate organizations</a> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellaNorCal_013f.html" title="User:HellaNorCal">HellaNorCal</a> 23:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, its not all outlined there and cannot be understood as merely the same civil war that has been going on since 1991. The country has been in turmoil for many years, but starting with the taking of Mogadishu by the ICU countries such as Ethiopia have gotten involved.

<dd>Somalia has been in chaos since 1991. All of the armed conflicts in Somalia from 1991 to the present are part of the Somali Civil War. The article you created uses the name “Somalian War”; Somali is the proper adjective form for Somalia and the “Somalian War” is a name that you picked that is not recognized by anyone else. I will not say it again, the article’s information should be incorporated into the Somali Civil War page. – <a href="../../../z/n/t/User%7EZntrip_e9b2.html" title="User:Zntrip">Zntrip</a> 04:00, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, Somalian is used when pertaining to the country, somali is only for the ethnic group. Now that that is settled, how is it the same conflict when its obviously different groups fighting each other in a defined conflict totally different to the one in 1991? The state of chaos probably should not be treated as it is now where its Barre vs. Aidid, but instead as the state of chaos that it is. Within this state of chaos is this defined conflict between the ICU and other parties, and it does deserve an article. ~<b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">Rangeley</span></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERangeley_d899.html" title="User talk:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">talk</span></a>)</b> 04:04, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With respect, that's kind of what we're doing here. As I see it, "working on the article" involves both adding text to it and making certain it's named correctly and should be here in the first place. If there happens to be a source out there calling this conflict by this name (and editors more knowledgeable than I have said there isn't), then it should be added to the article and so forth. As it currently stands, though, there's a number of people suggesting that the best way to do things is to merge this information with another article - where it can be worked on - until later on. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:38, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A fair point, but the Afghan Civil War article cited earlier on here is a good example of an article which breaks with that definition. Should it do so? I'm not sure, but it certainly does. The point about Wikipedia is that we're bound by what other sources refer to something as, so if this conflict is referred to as a "civil war" (as it appears to be), then a civil war is what we must call it. To call it something else would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">a cardinal sin</a>. Likewise, one can argue until the proverbial <i>vaches</i> return to <i>la maison</i> that a given world leader shouldn't be called a President or whatever, but if that's what people call him, then that's what we have to call him. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:03, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To add to what BigHaz has said: It does not matter what this conflict SHOULD be called. Wikipedia is not a vehicle for changing the terminology. It is NOT a vehicle for changing ANYTHING. The only valid question is what do people ALREADY call this conflict. They call it the Somali Civil War. There is no compelling evidence of widespread recognition of a different conflict, or a different name for this conflict. Ergo, merge the non-redundant information into the Somali Civil War article, and redirect this one. It doesn't need to stay. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 17:33, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> as nom. Article utilizes poor grammar, spelling, capitalization, syntax and does not seem to follow naming conventions. Information displayed is largely non-neutral POV and becomes especially worrisome—speculative and inacurrate—as it describes <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a>. No sources are cited and images are not used sparringly.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. None of the reasons cited are reasons for deletion. Deletion should be based on the article's SUBJECT (is this a topic worthy of having an article on?), not on the quality of the writing therein. Tag it for cleanup, but don't delete it. The article might need a rename/move to a better name, and needs NPOV cleanup, as well as referencing, but the Spider Man movie franchise (as a cohesive unit) is a notable franchise, much like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings or Austin Powers. This is a badly written article, but a notable subject.

<p>Nominating both Catalin Barboianu and probability-based strategy for deletion.</p>
<p>Catalin Barboianu is an apparent vanity autobiography <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACatalin_Barboianu&amp;diff=86041560&amp;oldid=85442948" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACatalin_Barboianu&amp;diff=86041560&amp;oldid=85442948" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> written by User:Infarom. <a href="http://books.infarom.ro" class="external text" title="http://books.infarom.ro" rel="nofollow">Infarom Publishing House</a> is Catalin Barboianu's employer, and publisher of three of Barboianu's books on Poker strategy (and apparently no books other than these three). The article asserts that Barboianu is a notable mathematician, whose major work is probability-based strategy. The <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Scientific_Information_b216.html" title="Institute for Scientific Information">ISI</a> <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_of_Science_3edd.html" title="Web of Science">WoS</a> lists no peer reviewed publications for "Barboianu C*". The probability-based strategy article "phrase "probability-based strategy" appears only once in the ISI database, and refers to another concept. I can find no evidence that this is a notable mathematical concept. The concepts described in the article appear to refer to the optimization technique known as <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stochastic_programming.html" title="Stochastic programming">stochastic programming</a>. In over ten years' experience with stochastic programming, I've never heard of the term "probability-based strategy" used in conjunction with these ideas. The probability-based strategy article claims to refer to <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_theory.html" title="Game theory">game theory</a> concepts, yet none of the material presented has any game theory relevance. In summary, I can find no support for the claims of scientific notability, or evidence that this is anything more than vanity article by an author of books on how to play Texas hold-em.

<li>Is this "notability" a mandatory criterion in wikipedia policy? And, if yes, who establishes the catalogues, papers or directories that give this attribute to a person? It is hilarious that people like <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Negreanu_4892.html" title="Daniel Negreanu">Daniel Negreanu</a> - famous gambler (and probably other hundreds of "notabilities") may keep a biographic article on wikipedia, but a mathematician and author working on gambling math is not allowed.

<dd>Notability is established in debates like these. We are fallible people, who must try to determine a person's impact by looking at publicly available databases. If you feel like there is evidence for Barboianu's (your?) notability, please point it out. It appears to me that Negreanu has had a larger influence on professional gamblers than Barboianu has.

<li>The two articles you mention are "respectable" because they describe scientific beliefs that <i>were once</i> widely held in the scientific community, but are not now, due to having been proved invalid <i>with time</i>. The article under review here has <b>never</b> been valid, and <i>began</i> with demonstratably invalid physics. So yes, I would say that "lack of scientific validity" is a perfectly good reason to delete. The articles you mention are kept because historical value supersedes scientific validity.

<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b>To article on Volfson. The editors of Wikipedia absolutely are not the arbiters of scientific validity. An editor claiming that in his expert opinion it won't work is the very definition of Original Research. We only have the right to determine whether or not some person, patent, etc. is notable, based on the presence or absence of citations in mainstream publications. The article includes references showing that a U.S patent was issued for a previous invention, then the patent was written about, in some detail in the following major publications or the online versions thereof: National Geographic News,the British newspaper Telegraph, and the major science journal Nature (print edition.) The above makes a strong case for keeping the articles. In addition there are about 3,000 Google hits, and it was discussed at many websites. It may be pseudoscience, but that is not the criterion for including or deleting an article. Rather than deleting the article with a claim that it lacks "scientific validity," merge this with the previous invention in the article about the inventor and redirect to that article. <b>Edit boldly</b>in the article the criticisms of the invention in the references, so the article serves the important function of debunking any doubtful claims. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:16, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment on the above: <i>widespread interest</i> does not apply even with thousands of Google hits for Phonon Maser. If we exclude valid scientific research about actual <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonon.html" title="Phonon">phonon</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masers.html" title="Masers">masers</a> (that is lasing of phonons), Wikipedia and mirrors thereof, and junk webpages, there are two distinct results, one of which is Volfson's webpage and the other of which is a press release by him. I don't call that widespread interest.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note on the references: the references to Nature, National Geographic, and the Telegraph only mention the patent as a failing of the patent office, not caring about Volfson personally. This is only one of the thousands of junk patents that are the patent office has passed. It deserves no particular mention, as the patent office's problems are convered in the relevant article. Final thought: we can judge scientific validity when it approaches nonsense, which this article certainly does. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 17:57, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> • Some comments show exactly the problem with the american scientific community, apparently no one is keeping up with the work of Dr. Ning Li... I know it's difficult when she is under DOD contract. Check it out, note the similarities. Check out Volfson who has co-authored two "mainstream" physics-heavy patents, both with proven prototypes, and a couple of papers on geophysics. If the US government is paying for similar research, Volfson should at LEAST keep a Wikipedia article. Reactions such as these are EXACTLY why 99% of all Physic research is regurgitation Ricp31 03:43, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Meta-comment: When I searched for Volfson earlier, I did check the literature. There are zero results for Boris Volfson in the usual electronic indeces. If he has authored geophysics, it doesn't show anywhere, even on his own website, which also fails to mention any other patents. Observation: if everything the US government has paid for were included in Wikipedia, we would be buried in pork. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 04:09, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Meta-meta-comment: I'll dig out those links. They are older, He may have been living in Moscow or Israel at the time. When Volfson's Anti-Gravity Spaceship patent came out I thought <a href="http://www.americanantigravity.com/articles/303/1/Volfsons-Antigravity-Patent/Page1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.americanantigravity.com/articles/303/1/Volfsons-Antigravity-Patent/Page1.html" rel="nofollow">Tim Ventura</a> did an awesome job of explaining the vehemence of american academia when it comes to any sort of "edgy" research that may cut into grant money. I've tried to always keep my eye on and follow these Russian trained "Cold War" Physicists. Most have ended up in Government programs to never publish again. The training they received is NOT the same Physics training they are giving at Caltech. I dare a US grad student to think outside the box. Ricp31 05:25, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Being a member of 'american academia', my statements may be distrusted, but I know no reasonably good scientist who hasn't been trained to think 'outside the box', regardless of if it is my professors at Caltech or my collaborators in Europe and Russia. We are also taught to treat every idea as suspect. This training is consistent world-wide, and has been for decades (I have had old Russian physicists explain to me the ways by which they managed to continue working with colleagues here despite the Soviet censors). By the time we finish undergrad, certain filters are applied almost instinctively. I have reviewed Volfson and his ideas in detail. Volfson is not a 'Russian trained 'Cold War' physicist'. He is merely a man who has learned enough of physics to fool himself and a clerk in the patent office. As such he is not exceptional and deserves no special consideration. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 06:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Meta-meta-meta-comment: Michael, my apologies just noted you are a grad student at CalTech. But if it was 1880, would you delete Tesla's Wikepedia page? I'm not saying Volfson = Tesla, but with so much NOT known on the Quantum level, if someone told me it WAS Gravity Fairies... I'd have to at least listen to their argument. Ricp31 05:25, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have listened, and Volfson is not distinguishable from the four individuals I've had contact me in the last year with outlandish and completely unsupported claims. Tesla is not a fair comparison, considering his many valid achievements.

<li>The constraint on db-bio is, as <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> has correctly pointed out, that if the article contains any assertion of notability it must come to AFD, where more than one pair of eyeballs get the chance to do the research to determine whether the subject actually satisfies our <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. To that end: What research did you do to determine that the WP:BIO criteria are not satisfied by this person, and hence to come to the conclusion that the article should be deleted?

<li>Neither the "MUREX" nor the "Anjar International Festival" are in Wikipedia, and the other "assertions of notability" in this article are more generic praise: "gave a new meaning to...", "legendary singer..." than true assertions. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 15:17, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're not getting it, are you!!!!... First, while Bassem is an exceptional comedian, he is NOT a Legendary singer... He is actually a LOUSY singer who could not sing if his life depended on it. To the Lebanese, the Murex is equivalent to the OSCARS in the U.S. The Anjar Festival is equivalent to Woodstock in the US. Refer to <a href="http://www.anjarinternationalfestival.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.anjarinternationalfestival.com/" rel="nofollow">Anjar International Festival</a> The fact that it is not in Wikipedia stems from the fact that people totally ignorant of the Lebanese Culture are badgering people who know the Lebanese culture all too well!...

<li>Checking whether Wikipedia has articles isn't really research. There are lots of subjects still missing from Wikipedia (And, conversely, there are articles in Wikipedia that don't belong.). Research involves looking <i>outside</i> of Wikipedia. Looking at the assertions of notability in the article isn't research, either. The task of AFD is to <i>actually check</i> these things, not to take what the article says purely on trust, and not to ignore what the article may currently omit. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:00, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - First, there was no assumption of good faith... which is THE CASE here. Second, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bassem_Feghali_8836.html" title="Bassem Feghali">Bassem Feghali</a> in Lebanon has the legendary status of Bob Hope in the U.S. He is funny as hell and comes from the CORE of Lebanese comedy while introducing to Lebanon female impersonation... something that the Lebanese would have never embraced if it wasn't for the exceptional talent of Feghali. Lebanon is a very small country with very limited resources for internet exposure so you will not find a zillion articles on the net or many hits on google for MANY famous Lebanese. This is why we need to include famous Lebanese celebreties without discrimination. No one in the US would ever dispute the status of Bob Hope in he US or Louis de Funes in France. No one would EVER dispute the status of Bassem Feghali in Lebanon and in many parts of teh Arab world. Unless you are Lebanese or an Arab, you most likely have never heard of Bassem Feghali... just as much as an Arab (not Arab American) most likey has never heard of Bob Hope. The motion to delete Bassem Feghali's page is motivated either by racial discrimination or sheer ignorance of who Bassem Feghali is.

<li>Please refer to my Bob Hope analogy. I could not have made it more foolproof. The person who has requested deletion is eveidently ignorant of the status of Bassem Feghali as a very notable comedian in Lebanon. While I expect him to be ignorant of Bassem Feghali, I also expect him to assume good faith, as he should, when his knowledge is obviously very limited... and someone who knows a lot more than he will ever know about Lebanon is making a good faith effort to introduce them to Wikipedia. Frankly, such ignorance and OVER-INFLATED egos cause nothing but a waste of valuable time that should be used to introduce more unique content to Lebanon, Lebanese related matters and other unique content the world over <a href="../../../l/c/n/User%7ELcnj_2a16.html" title="User:Lcnj">Lcnj</a> 15:03, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - Victory Gin is in no way a significant enough feature of Nineteen Eighty-Four to qualify for a separate article.

This subject should be covered by an encyclopaedia.
<p>That no-one has merged it after a consensus to merge is not a reason to delete it. Firstly, <i>the nominator xyrself</i> could have merged it. Secondly, there is an argument against merger <i>on the article's own talk page</i>, making a case that all of the various "Victory" items — Victory Gin, Victory Cigarettes, Victory Coffee, and so forth — are better discussed in a broad scope article on "Victory" items in <i>1984</i> (which <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9155" class="external text" title="http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9155" rel="nofollow">some</a> have described as "total parallels of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_fries.html" title="Freedom fries">freedom fries</a>"), which <a href="http://www.exampleessays.com/essay_search/Victory_Gin.html" class="external text" title="http://www.exampleessays.com/essay_search/Victory_Gin.html" rel="nofollow">have been</a> <a href="http://pactlab.spcomm.uiuc.edu/class/05SP/199blogs/11/2005/04/21_years_after.html" class="external text" title="http://pactlab.spcomm.uiuc.edu/class/05SP/199blogs/11/2005/04/21_years_after.html" rel="nofollow">written about</a> <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/198423.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/198423.asp" rel="nofollow">by the</a> <a href="http://www.megaessays.com/essay_search/Gin_Victory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.megaessays.com/essay_search/Gin_Victory.html" rel="nofollow">world</a> <a href="http://www.orwelltoday.com/victoryday.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.orwelltoday.com/victoryday.shtml" rel="nofollow">at large</a>. Again, that neither the nominator nor anyone else has yet taken it upon themselves to follow that idea through, or <i>even to reply to the suggestion</i> on Talk:Victory Gin even though they've had six months to do so, is not a reason to delete this article.</p>
<p>AFD is not a weapon to force mergers to be done that one wants done, and when renominating it is a good idea to show that one has at least <i>read</i> the suggestions for refactoring that came out of the prior discussion. An administrator hitting the delete button doesn't get us either the aforementioned merger or the aforementioned refactoring. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I'll comment on this here: I think that Victory items in 1984 would just be a list of non-notable items, all pointless for the same reasons as Victory Gin. And there's nothing in the book that tells you why all these things, from cigarettes to apartment buildings, are called "Victory", so it would be an invitation for <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> too. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Johnson_fe0a.html" title="User:Robin Johnson">Robin Johnson</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobin_Johnson_4208.html" title="User talk:Robin Johnson">(talk)</a> 14:04, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would only actually <i>be</i> original research, however, if editors went and wrote their own hypotheses and analyses, rather than using the ones that have already been written and published on the subject outside of Wikipedia — several of which I pointed to above. An argument that "there's nothing in the book" ignores the all of the critical commentary that exists. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>You have things backwards. If this article is deleted, it is impossible to merge it. Whereas merging, or renaming and refactoring, this article to a new, broader scope, article, does not involve deletion at any stage. Any editor with an account has the tools to merge, or to rename and refactor. If your actual wish is to have the article merged, then having an administrator delete the content that you want merged beforehand doesn't help you. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><del><b>Delete.</b></del> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>, I respectfully disagree. Victory gin is a prop, not a plot or allegory device that is vital to 1984, and I do not see how it merits inclusion here. On the subject of "drinking Victory gin" being well known amongst political commentators, well there are 87 odd ghits for "drinking victory gin", about 4 of these from nn blogs and the rest from 1984 related sites. As for <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Fries_add7.html" title="Freedom Fries">Freedom Fries</a> being derived from Victory Gin, why not just have a note in the Freedom Fries page to state this, rather than a complete article listing the various different types of 'Victory' props in 1984. As for merging, I was kind of swinging that way but the 1984 article is massive enough as it is. I think this is a topic worth mention, but certainly not worth an article. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmists_8945.html" title="User:Amists">Amists</a> 14:18, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it is a "topic worth mention", then your view that <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_808a.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a> is "massive enough as it is" should lead you directly to the conclusion that it is time for a <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> breakout sub-article on the subject. Lo! That is exactly what we already have. If its scope is too narrow (as has been argued on Talk:Victory Gin), then rename and refactor it into an article with larger scope. It doesn't require an administrator to hit the delete button, or administrator privileges, to <a href="../../../m/o/v/Help%7EMoving_a_page_3be0.html" title="Help:Moving a page">rename an article</a> and then <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEditing_dd53.html" title="Help:Editing">edit it</a> to broaden its scope. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok, <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> you're right, in that if I think the subject is worth mention on WP then I shouldn't vote that we delete the entire article. My problem is that an expanded article on say 'Victory Props From 1984' would be no more valuable to WP than this article on Victory Gin (for reasons given above - no way is it a subject apart from the book in it's own right). I would support a merge with the main 1984 article, and I may have just done this myself, except the maintainers of this page (Talk:Victory Gin) appear to be against this course of action. In any case I'm changing my vote here to <b>merge</b>. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmists_8945.html" title="User:Amists">Amists</a> 22:50, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a short rephrasing from the book itself. While the various victory items were clearly plot devices and strong symbols, they were so collectivly, not just the gin. I am sure that anything here can easily be incoorperated into the 1984 book article. If an article on symbols from 1984(Big brother, doublethink, thoughtcrime ect...) entering pop culture is created it would go there. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 16:43, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please keep this. I am a new user, and probably not able to vote, but I am an English scholar, and this and other 'victory items' are important elements to the book. They provide vital clues to how the society is being kept subservient. It would seem a shame to delete this valuable information, and I don't see any compelling argument above to do so. Thank you, Frank.</li>

<dd>As you say, they're "important elements to the book", and as such deserve mention in the article on the book. However, they're not important enough to the real world to warrant an article of their own.

<li>Reading the 1984 article, I see that "victory gin" is mentioned: "the Outer Party's standard of living is very poor. Foodstuffs are low quality or synthetic; the main alcoholic beverage — Victory Gin — is industrial-grade". In my opinion, this sentence gives everything we need to know concerning the drink: It's foul and it's for the outer party.

<li><b>Keep</b> - An awful article full of redlinks, and really doesnt do well to establish the notability of the artist, until I realised he recorded in the 80's as Hashim, a legendary proponent of the 80's electro beatbox genre, whereby hip-hop grew out of electronic music. Hasn't done anything else by the look of it. He's probably still dining out on royalties from 'Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)' (which generates 18500ghits). --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmists_8945.html" title="User:Amists">Amists</a> 11:36, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Really hard to say with this one. If this is a place (or will be a place) where residents/businesses cite as their address - i.e. (in Arabic, of course) 123 Karachi St, Rabia City, Karachi, Pakistan - then I'd say keep.

<li><b>Delete</b> I found just one press clipping online that seems to verify that this item exists and was taken to Greece over objections from the Bulgarian curator of a museum, but no information about the allegations of forgery, claims of historical significance, etc. Since the most recent events regarding this item happened in 1997, someone may have to go to the library to find good sources. It appears that most of the websites that mention this item for nationalistic purposes have relied on very sketchy sources and when you follow their references you find only a couple of tripod pages which no longer exist. None of them seem to have actually seen the two newspaper articles which they mention in their websites. Also I see a red flag when the creator of this article claims to have made the photograph provided with the article. Really? Who is this person who claims to have personally been present with the item in question, which has been kept under lock and key by government authorities for nine years? I don't even feel confident that "Voden inscription" is the appropriate name for this item, so I can't even support the idea of making this a stub. Ecyclopedic content must be verifiable.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The comingsoon.net external link appears to reveal that Disney has announced the actual release date, which means it isn't just a rumor. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 17:22, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. And the mention of a release date doesn't mean the film is official. The name of the film has been rumored to be W.A.L.-E. previously as well (with THAT WK page being deleted for the same WP:NOT reason). Could it be a placeholder for some other unannounced film, or it could have been a mistake, or it could actually be for a new Pixar film. Since there is conflicting information being posted in blogs (Stanton directing? Maybe not), and a release date by itself doesn't mean anything -- we go back to asking for other verifiable information from an official source that would move this from WP:NOT to something factual and supportable. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpikeJones_20f7.html" title="User:SpikeJones">SpikeJones</a> 17:47, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. Can't see why redirecting to Malta would be useful - I think the page should simply be deleted. In fact I am not entirely sure we should be linking to this forum in the Imperium Europa page - Wikipedia isn't a web directory. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 21:36, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

typical of wiki, a total joke. vm does not need any damn links from wiki. we have enough hits and don't need any from here. we are one of maltas top sites. i added an article on vm to stop the inevitable slander fest that occurs on this site before it inevitably spreads further. anyone with a difference of opinion is not allowed to express it here as it is simply a haven for liberal leftists. this as usual is an unjustified attack on right wing sites just as slander of Norman Lowell is allowed.</p>
<p>i will be posting an article on this matter on the vm front pages and maybe spreading it to other news sites too.</p>
<p>vm and ie are two different movements. IE is directed towards europe and vm towards malta. we do however discuss converging views. IE is a static site whereas vm is a dynamic news one. just because there is a link to vm in the IE article is irrelevant. one would not call the European peoples party and the British conservative party as the same thing. same applies to IE and VM.</p>
<p>this is censorship at the end of the day and you all know it. slander is allowed on the ie and Norman Lowell articles but a balanced account with full citations on vm is not what this community wants.</p>
<p>PS. above it is written that this is a debate. what debate? a few people all agreed to delete vm and it was. no opposition was allowed!</p>

<p>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminant collection of information -- specifically a <b>directory</b> or a <i>TV/Radio Guide</i> (these articles are one, or both) -- despite the level of utility of the articles, they are not within the guidelines of what should be included in Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Articles are all grouped together due to content and style.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I would argue that the articles in question are not indiscriminate <i>directories</i> in that they only provide a list of what networks, content, or stations are included (not unlike <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_newspapers.html" title="List of newspapers">List of newspapers</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_television_stations_in_North_America_by_media_market_c587.html" title="List of television stations in North America by media market">List of television stations in North America by media market</a>; or outside of the media arena with entries like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airlines.html" title="List of airlines">List of airlines</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_auxiliary_Interstate_Highways_6717.html" title="List of auxiliary Interstate Highways">List of auxiliary Interstate Highways</a>). This information initially was contained within the <a href="../../../d/i/r/DirecTV_598e.html" title="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> article, and was broken out once it was realized how unwieldy the information is within the bounds of that single article. If this article was a full-fledged TV guide, I would agree with you completely, but given that this is completely outside of that realm, and more of an encyclopaedic list of what is included within the service, I have to strongly disagree with you, in that they do not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 15:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It certainly is not a guide, but rather a list.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I'm not trying to be difficult, but why are people using reasoning such as "well, if we delete X then we'll have to delete all these other articles too"&#160;? Regardless of an article's usefullness, or how many other articles violate the same policy, if it violates a policy, it needs to go. "But Johnny did it too" never worked when trying to justify my actions to my mom... why is wikipedia any different? Wikipedia seems full of reasons for why it's okay to break policy on a per-case basis, but doesn't this trump the purpose of having a policy at all? Just because it's useful, or because it's done in other places, doesn't negate the issue at hand... or so I think.&#160;;-) /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 18:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I disagree that there should be a redir. "Cockadoodie car" is used approximately <u>once</u> in the whole book/film and has no defining effect on either plot or characterisation (<i>pace</i> an analysis of Wilkes' repressed vocabulary and any connection between her general repression and her psychosis).

<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> What is the matter with you people? Have you had too much 'bitchly cow corn'? Never have I experienced so much outrage on such a simple article.

Whereas many internet users have complimented me on such a moving and interesting article, it was inevitable a minority of miserable readers would complain.

<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> It's is not I who have taken this issue to personally. In constructing this article, I took great care in to adhering to any regulations that govern the quality of articles submitted in to Wikipedia. The points I have chosen to highlight in my article are fact based, so it utterly baffles me as to how 'some' people still choose to dispute the truth. Everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but certainly FACTS are undisputable, and it was my assumption that Wikipedia is suppose to be FACT BASED.

<p>I am an avid reader of Stephen King Novels, and with Misery being my favourite of them all, I was utterly disappointed to find out that people were petitioning for this fantastic and humorous article to be deleted.</p>
<p>As a journalist for an independent magazine, in which the fantastic phrase 'Cockadoodie Car' was voted the No.1 most memorable phrase in a Stephen King novel (with It’s ‘can you float?' coming in a close second), I believe that all fans of the novel and movie should be able to express their own personal views and interpretations of the depiction of the Annie Wilkes character in any way, shape or form, and wherever they wish, and that is exactly what the author of this article has done. I personally think that it is utterly repugnant, revolting, vile, nauseating and absolutely appalling that some people would rally together and demand that this article be deleted. Once again I must state 'repugnant'!!! Wikipedia is a place for people all over the world to share knowledge defined as ‘the fact of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience or association’. With this definition in mind I believe that the author has done nothing wrong as everything that is stated in the article was something gained through the experience of reading the book or watching the movie. Nothing mentioned in the article has been falsified they are all of fact, and I am sure they were not intended to disparage the character in question. This article is merely a description of certain scenes depicted in the movie, and I think it goes without saying that Kathy Bates did not receive an academy award for her performance in this film for nothing.</p>
<p>What era are you people living in, the Puritan era? Is this a remake of the classic Salem witch hunts? I’m half expecting for you all to demand that the author be burned at the stake (along with the article)? Once again I must state ‘repugnant’. This kind of bullying will not and shall not be tolerated. If the author of the ‘Cockadoodie Car’ article had made false statements leading to a false representation about the book or film then I would see the need for this cause of action. But I have read the book and watched the film a countless number of times and the phrase is fundamental in describing the mental state and actions of Annie Wilkes.Oh the misery 22:08, 8 November 2006 (UTC)M.

<li><b>Comment</b> I can assure you that in the U.S. there are Ivy League schools and other leading universities charging $40,000 a year in tuition with very competitive admissions, where the technical classes are largely taught by grad students and professors who can barely speak English (although many of them have native fluency in Japanese, Chinese, or Korean). I know U.S. college graduates who went to China for a few years to make a good salary as English teachers. As for the school being real, nothing in the article sounds at all surprising. It is up to the editor creating the article to find a supporting citation. I could find no mention of a college in the town, but it is a center of the petrochemical industry and has seen widespread labor unrest for several years. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:52, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a borderline case for deletion, I think. It could become notable, but at the moment the subject is being discussed only on its originating website, and on <a href="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/" rel="nofollow">NASA Spaceflight</a>. I am concerned that this is being put across as more than what it is, which is a grassroots proposal having no official support. It has been listed in categories such as [Category:NASA] and [Category: Space Shuttle program], which is clearly inappropriate. I have removed these, but may have missed other instances. <a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLilburne_c545.html" title="User:MLilburne">MLilburne</a> 15:47, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as original research. Notability (WP:N) is not just a matter of opinion. One reference does not exist (click and nothing is found) and the other is someone's website.

Supporters of the project can call a press conference, show off a model and some animation of the concept, get endorsements from noted scientists, get this written up in the New York Times and covered by CBS and CNN, and then you are good to go with an article, but we do not accept using a Wikipedia article to bolster a concept which has no other notability. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:28, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's no shortage of proposed paper rockets out there, and having an article (especially having references to it like the one in <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuttle-Derived_Launch_Vehicle_2f0f.html" title="Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle">Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle</a>) really does seem to assert a significance this particular proposal doesn't seem to actually possess. I'd have no problem with resurrecting the article if it got widely picked up, or was even just used as a comparison in a formal study by anyone other than its proposers... but not as the state of play is now. There are significant, influential, and widely discussed forms of SDLV which never got past concept stages - Zubrin's Ares, some of the obscurer Shuttle-C designs - but that shouldn't mean any proposed alternate design is notable, and I don't see this as either having had any significant uptake or recieved any critical attention from the wider community.</dd>
<dd>Even rewriting the article, to me, won't solve the fundamental problem - that there isn't significant secondary evidence that this is important.</dd>

<li><b>Keep but rewrite</b> - This is real; I know one of the people who worked on the proposal, and it is published and being covered in the aerospace trade press etc. We do have other articles on proposed or in-development spacecraft (and a few which never got beyond the drawing board). That's not unusual here. In terms of whether the article misrepresents how "official" this proposal is (it's in competition to NASA's official Moon/Mars launcher program), that's a fair criticism, but should be addressed by a rewrite. We don't want a misleading article, but we don't want to delete all the proposed spacecraft articles either, and this is current, real, and newsworthy (at least, for now). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep. Don't Delete</b>. <u>As the guy who's name appears on the actual DIRECT Proposal itself, Ross Tierney</u>, I would like to just say that this is real. It has NOT currently been chosen by NASA's own administration, but is being considered seriously at this time. Other organisations are also investigating it including the DoD &amp; The Mars Society, and are strongly favouring our approach over NASA's current one. At this time, DIRECT is simply a proposal for an alternative direction for NASA to consider, and is rather appropriate given the fact the current Ares-I system it would replace is documented as falling short of reaching it's expected targets. While I have had nothing to do with writing the wiki entry myself, it does not appear to me to be "passing itself off" as anything more than a proposal. If the piece needs a re-write, that's okay by me. I will try it myself. But I certainly wish the wiki entry remains available to any and all who might be interested.

<dd><b>Comment</b>The article looks better, but I still do not see multiple independent mainstream coverage. I see an article at a website <a href="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/</a> which sounds like an official NASA site, but is apparently a private commercial site not connected with the government. Is it NASA or a private website about spaceflight? Still just counts as one source even if it is NASA and zero if private. And people personally vouching for it counts for zero, zip, nada. If there have been lots of publications about it, then add them to the article, don't just make unsubstantiated claims they exist. The creator of the proposal writing about it smacks of a vanity article and actually counts against inclusion. I am all for innovative spaceflight proposals, but the article is still nonnotable and original research until the notability is proved by multiple independent reliable and verifiable mainstream coverage. We are not a medium of first publication. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:17, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> The DIRECT proposal was published first on the www.directlauncher.com website and following this an article was published on the www.nasaspaceflight.com website. The latter website is a recognised source of information on developments in space technology and regularly reports on developments at NASA and elsewhere, and has been cited as a source in NY times. The Wikipedia entry post-dates these and is not a 'means of first publication'. Further, the entry is not a vanity article as its original creator is not in any way whatsoever connected with the proposal. The proposal's author has since corrected technical details on the entry Batoom 11:49, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Request for a Decision</b>. There won't be any further announcements or links for at least another month or two. Things are happening behind the scenes, but this is BIG - as in political, federal budget and Pentagon level, not just NASA. I've done pretty-much all the re-writing I can offer in my free time at this point. I would thus like to request a final ruling one way or the other please. The deletion notice at the top sure doesn't add any assistance to our efforts. If the article doesn't comply, I'd rather it just dissappear than remain in its current state any longer. There isn't any point in adding a link from directlauncher.com to the wiki article while it remains. Ross B Tierney 20:49, 10 November 2006 (EDT)
<dl>
<dd>I think that AfDs stay open for five days, so it ought to be closed tomorrow. I just have to say that the purpose of the article is not to "add assistance to your efforts," it's to offer a balanced appraisal of the proposal, its merits, flaws, and perhaps most importantly the impact that it's made. I will await with interest these future announcements. <a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLilburne_c545.html" title="User:MLilburne">MLilburne</a> 09:49, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. I understand that, however this is a very delicate time for this proposal and public appearance is going to be a critical part of it's perception. Any public content which affects the "image" becomes of serious concern for us. The deletion notice at the top of such a popular site as wikipedia makes the proposal "appear" dubious - which it is not. On such a publicly respected site as wikipedia, this is a VERY BAD THING, and a serious issue for us. So I'm trying to work with you to it resolved ASAP. Keep or Delete; we don't mind. Just as long as it gets out of this bad-PR "limbo" state soon - please. Ross B Tierney 14:40, 12 November 2006 (EDT)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and continue rewriting</b>. This article represents a vigorous debate currently taking place within the inner circles at NASA and it's Field Centers, over the direction the American Manned Spaceflight program will take over the next few years. So long as readers understand that the final outcome of this debate is in a state of flux, it will serve to inform and educate. Wikipedia is not a newspaper, and should not be used as one. However, this debate, currently underway, could have profound implications for the United States, and is unlikely to be carried in the major newspapers until such time as NASA actually makes a decision. As such, a properly worded article in Wikipedia serves the interest of educating and informing those wishing to know, and having otherwise limited resources to explore. clongton 19:44, 11 November 2006</li>

No one objected during the proposed deletion waiting period, but Virabhadra objects now, so I undeleted and listed here. Note that he refers to the band as "we," hinting at a personal interest. According to the article, the band has not released its debut album and is on an indefinite hiatus. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Epopt_6905.html" title="User:The Epopt">➥the Epopt</a> 17:05, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The term <a href="../../../h/i/a/Hiatus.html" title="Hiatus">hiatus</a> was used to indicate the band's current status. By Wikipedia's own definition, this indicates "An inactivity of a band that has not formally broken up." The term is meant to indicate a gap in activity caused by a lineup change, hence asserting that the band's intent is to resume the project whenever possible. Concerning the release of the <i>Of Lust and War</i> album, I do concede that the wording of this article was not technically accurate. The album is not a debut for the band, but actually the 3rd official release. The first being <i>Subjugation of Mankind</i>, the second being <i>Unearthly Affinity</i>, and the third being <i>Of Lust and War</i>. What was originally meant by "debut" was that <i>Of Lust and War</i> was the first <a href="../../../e/p/_/EP_0784.html" title="EP">EP</a> recorded by the group. I have changed the wording of the article to reflect this. Virabhadra 17:55, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The band's hiatus isn't the issue: the issue is whether they're notable. No amazon presence, nothing on allmusic.com. Only suggestion of notability in the article is that they've supported some better-known bands, but so have I, and my band certainly aren't notable. Looks like a local band to me.

<dd>The guideline you quote says 'most prominent representative of a notable style OR the local scene of a city'. I don't see any evidence that Impurity are either of these different things, and that they're the only death metal band in Gainesville doesn't make them either of them. The band isn't the most prominent representative of the death metal genre (obviously); nor is it the most prominent representative of 'the Gainesville sound' or 'the Gainesville scene' (whatever those are).

<p>Takis Tsoukalas is a controversial person and leader of <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympiakos.html" title="Olympiakos">Olympiakos</a> hardcore fans. He is offensive towards to other Greek teams of fans and likes to humiliate them. This article lacks the quality to be a wikipedia article (totally unimportant content, non-wikified), has controversial content, it is not neutral.

<p>It should be deleted. And on another note let's keep this discussion amongst greek people here, as only they have any first hand experience with the issue. That goes to tony, who does not seem to be familiar with the issues at hand yet diligently, albeit incorrectly puts forth his opinions. A marginal figure on greek trash tv should be the least item to be considered for wikipedia inclusion, and it's presence here only makes a mockery out of the essense of this encyclopedia, which I suppose is the intented goal, that and an inside joke. Had greek tv, or greek journalism been included in an extensive survey here I could consider this for inclusion. But letting this in as is we are opening the flood gates for who knows what to be included in the encyclopedia, next thing you know this becomes an outlet for anyone's self agrandasing prospects. Notability, and that agains goes out to tommy, is clearly not met here, unless of course we broaden the term as much as to include anything and everything and ultimately nothing at all. My two cents as a very frequent user and contributor here, despite my lack of a user account, for personal issues. 62.38.23.26 04:48, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, some people don't seem to understand what Tsoukalas is, but just listen to us who see his (ugly) face every day. THIS GUY IS A HOOLIGAN, who tells children and teenagers to go and hit other team fans. He is considered the most hated person in greek football and in greek tv. EVEN OLYMPIAKOS FANS HATE HIM.

<p>This is a somewhat misleading page. I had to read the whole article to realize that this individual has accomplished absolutely nothing notable. All of the biographical info has been in the article since the page creation by a user named FrankSchmuck. The only real page that links to it is a disambig of "schmuck". He has performed no act that seperates himself from every other military officer in the history of the United States.

<li><b>Delete</b> He seems like an extremely impressive person, but having participated as a company grade officer in notable battles does not make one notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> nor does simply achieving the rank of Brig Gen. The article needs to provide evidence that Schmuck <i>himself</i> was singularly notable in either these battles or at some other point in his life. As a company grade officer in the Korean War, I have no doubt that his actions were vitally important in the immediate sense, but I do have serious doubts as to whether that translates to notability in a historical context. I salute General Schmuck's service, but this article reads like a combination of a CV and obituary without any attempt at establishing notability. <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 01:12, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think that a military officer who rises to the rank of General is sufficiently notable, even if he's just a one-star. I didn't add any info to the article because I'm not knowledgable enough to do so in sensible fashion, but there seems to be a reasonable amount of published material about his military record in circulation (particularly his combat record in Korea). -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 20:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Give me a break. Unlike some of the posters here, I'm not a veteran of these debates, and am not aware of the history of the different proposals. I responded to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> because the article was originally tagged with a proposed deletion notice, which claimed that there was <b>No assertion of this school's notability per <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a></b>, by <a href="../../../k/a/v/User%7EKavadi_carrier_b65d.html" title="User:Kavadi carrier">Kavadi carrier</a>. I added some information to the article, which <a href="../../../k/a/v/User%7EKavadi_carrier_b65d.html" title="User:Kavadi carrier">Kavadi carrier</a> then tagged with an AfD notice, which pointed here. His deletion proposal at the top of this page starts with "This article does not assert notability of the school per <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>".

<li><b>delete</b> As I understand the article, the town only existed for 70 years at a time when it was probably easy to be the largest town in the county. If we adopt this criteria to the UK, there would be literally 1000s, (10,000s) of small settlements that were at one time settled for more than 70 years. The scottish highlands is full of old ghost villages probably all with several hundred years , if not thousands of years of history. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 00:36, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b>: No offense, but you must not be much of a college football fan, especially if you are from the state. This guy was a national story last year and is arguably the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alabama_7e4c.html" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</a>'s top player - they are still feeling his injury this year which helps explains why their offense is so poor this year (injuries, probation and their coaches). Look, I'm an Auburn fan and could really care less, but even I know who Prothro is. Do a google search on the guy as there is plenty of news about him which would seem to make the article a worthy entry. He was one of the top receivers in the nation before his injuries and when his leg is fully healed (if it heals - sure looked like an ugly break to me), I would think him to be a probable draft pick. Anyway, my vote is that it seems notable and should stay...at least until the end of his rehab. If he doesn't recover, then the article should definitely be removed. <a href="../../../o/t/d/User%7EOtduff_7ab5.html" title="User:Otduff">otduff</a> 5:52, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He's obviously getting a lot less famous, though.

<dd>Well your bias against <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn_Tigers_football_3de2.html" title="Auburn Tigers football">Auburn</a> has no bearing here as Prothro does not even play for Auburn - he plays for <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_c1b8.html" title="Alabama Crimson Tide">Alabama</a>. And not sure what you mean by Auburn "never played really well" considering they play in the toughest conference and have been ranked in the top5 the last several seasons. But again, it's irrelevant...just funny that a supposed football fan from Alabama doesn't know better? As for the high school, if you look at many other players (<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Montana_b4bb.html" title="Joe Montana">Joe Montana</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Jackson_c943.html" title="Bo Jackson">Bo Jackson</a>, etc), their high schools are listed so not sure why it's not relevant here.

<li><b>Keep</b> Added three articles about him from New York Times and four from Tennessee and Alabama papers which were carried on a national press wire service.

<li><b>Keep</b> As per reasons noted by otduff; both that catch and his injury were national stories in 2005 (though the injury probably only because the catch had already been a story). Also agreed that if he does not return for a senior season (2007) or make the NFL, it should probably be removed, as he will be just a footnote. And agree with Drennleberrn that there is no need for the paragraph on his high school career, but I will wait until after this vote is complete to remove it. <a href="../../../p/a/w/User%7EPawl_Kennedy_15cd.html" title="User:Pawl Kennedy">Pawl</a> 21:09, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Winning an ESPY qualifies as notable. Also, playing a skill position for a Top 25 team (well, last year) counts as "at the highest level in mainly amateur sports...including college sports in the United States" (from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b>, whether or not he is notable, it was an interesting, albeit very confusing article. E.g. He seemed to receive the 6th dan about 3 times. Some of the terminology must be explained, I'm not sure whether the "temple of doom" or whatever the names was is a made up name or an official karate term. The various martial arts also seemed to merge into one as if he were some kind of paganist new-age occultist fictional hero.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Pat Zalewski is renowned as an occult author having published many books. He has headed a number of occult organisations. He is also an accomplished martial arts athlete. I am presently engaged in research at a university and they certainly consider him a reputable source for material. If he is reputable enough for a university then he is reputable enough for wikipedia. I feel your remarks on this page, and your talk page, regarding occultists demonstrate a lack of objectivity in this field. "I thought someone could argue that being "7=4 Adepts and co-chiefs of Thoth Hermes Temple" asserted notability. You never know with these occultists. Leibniz 20:35, 25 September 2006 (UTC)" Perhaps you could refrain from editing (or requesting deletion of) pages you have an evident bias about.</li>

<li><b>Whoooh</b> I've had a quick look and the originator has only produced two articles, this one and Meta-paradigm. From the style of the entry they clearly are new and I would not like yet again to see the AfD Delete, Delete song as someone's Welcome! So, lets not be too hasty! On the other hand, there have been various comments on the article. My suspicion is that this article is just someone's opinion, whilst the Meta-paradigm seems to have some references and might therefore be improved. Therefore perhaps what can be salvaged from this article should be added to the Meta-Paradigm--<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 00:12, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>One argument for <b>keeping</b> Loggernaut Reading Series as a separate article (and the reason I set the page up originally) is that there seemed to be very little info on Wiki about different reading series, which are their own phenomena and distinct from online literary journals. <i><a href="../../../l/o/g/Loggernaut.html" title="Loggernaut">Loggernaut</a></i> is an online literary journal of interviews with authors. It would exist without the reading series, and vice versa. I don't think journals and reading sereis are the same thing. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarlanjohnson_b432.html" title="User:Harlanjohnson">harlanjohnson</a> 4 November 2006</li>
<li>Info about reading series is useful for authors, publicists, publishers, as well as people who enjoy live readings. I also did some work on this page, trying to set up a Wiki central area on literary reading series: <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_series.html" title="Reading series">Reading series</a>. Perhaps I didn't do the best job setting everything up (I'm pretty new to this), but I do think that readings series are notable activities, and as reading series go, Loggernaut is a notable one. I'll pop a couple more external references to help demonstrate this. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarlanjohnson_b432.html" title="User:Harlanjohnson">harlanjohnson</a> 4 November 2006</li>

<li><b>delete</b> As I understand it the reading series only relates to one state, of one country, I'm not even sure what a "reading series" is and whether it would be of any interest outwith a few teachers, within that one state within that one country. Is it the only reading series? Does it have any use outwith teaching? Is Wikipedia really the right place for this information? --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 23:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../l/o/g/Loggernaut.html" title="Loggernaut">Loggernaut</a>. Okay, I can appreciate the argument that there's not a lot potential for expansion, at least not at the moment. However, I do think that reading series are legitimate subjects for encyclopedia entries and I don't really understand Mike's comments above. Reading series don't have anything to do with teachers (and I don't know what "outwith" means). Consider them an analog to literary magazines: what literary magazines are to the publication of poetry, fiction, etc., reading series are to the public performance of the same. In the U.S. at least, writers travel around the country reading from their work, connecting with their audiences--it's one form of keeping the oral aspects of literature alive. As with literary magazines, some reading series are better known than others, some have reputations for presenting certain kinds of work, some are local, some attract national and international talent. I still think that a brief entry giving the relevant information about a noteworthy reading series is as useful as a brief entry giving the relevant information about a noteworthy literary magazine. But if people disagree, then I'd say merge Loggernaut Reading Series with <a href="../../../l/o/g/Loggernaut.html" title="Loggernaut">Loggernaut</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarlanjohnson_b432.html" title="User:Harlanjohnson">harlanjohnson</a> 11 November 2006</li>
<li>What, then, do people think of the entry for <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_series.html" title="Reading series">Reading series</a>? It's in need of expansion, certainly, but is it not a legitimate entry? I thought it was a useful start. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarlanjohnson_b432.html" title="User:Harlanjohnson">harlanjohnson</a> 11 November 2006</li>

<li><b>Can't be kept</b> I thought I would look at the article to see whether it might be kept. Unfortunately, as written there is nothing written about the company which would suggest it merits a place in wikipedia. Obviously the entry concentrates on the World trade centre terrorist actions. I'm sorry to sound cold, but as a user of Wikipedia, I would quite like to have some information on the casualties of the event, and that is what the article must provide - but I wouldn't be looking for this article under this name, so it would be almost senseless to put it in. I don't know whether it exists, but I can't see a problem with a page detailing the statistics of the event, which companies, were involved, how many people in each, where their offices were, etc. THere is a story to be told, and valuable information but this is not the way to enter it. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 23:37, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I read Mantanmoreland after I wrote above.

<li>First of all, the article does <u>not</u> have to provide a list of terrorist casualties of the company to show notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> Regarding the stats cited above, the key words here are "participated", "co-managed" and "advising". Bank deals such as debt and equity offerings typically have multiple banks and financial advisory firms participating in the deal. It is not unusual to have 3, 4 or 5 (or significantly more in syndicated loan deals for instance) large major banks (such as <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citigroup.html" title="Citigroup">Citigroup</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsche_Bank_93b5.html" title="Deutsche Bank">Deutsche Bank</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merill_Lynch_1d93.html" title="Merill Lynch">Merill Lynch</a>) participating at different levels for different fees (Lead Manager, Senior Co-Manager, Junior Co-Manager, Lead Advisor, Co-Advisor, Bookrunner, Documentation Agent etc etc) <i>plus</i> smaller firms such as Sandler dealing with less capital intensive or specialized aspects of the deal which the larger institutions decline because the fees offered are too small (major banks turn down business all the time when the fees are too small). So "participating in raising $66.4bn for its clients" means that Sandler took part in $66.4bn worth of deals which larger players had the major roles. A better indicator would Sandler's actual earnings (a small fraction of the value of the deals). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 06:35, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Your analysis is of course correct. However, what these numbers indicate is that Sandler is a player even if it is not a top-bracket firm.

<li><b>Keep</b> I strongly feel that the debate is more so due to the ignorance of some editors about the field of Homeopathy and that they need to read up adequately and understand the subject first. Each homeopath differs in his approach towards treating patients, hence the scarcity of cross references. You could refer to some websites on homeopathy, only then you will realise the extensive research done by Dr. Shah and his contribution to the field of Homeopathy for more than 20 years. As far as the journal is concerned, Simillimum which is the Journal of Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians, USA is an independent peer edited journal. References of Dr. Shah’s articles in various other international journals have been cited and are definitely verifiable.Sapnafive 07:23, 9 November 2006 (UTC) Dr. Sapna

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The references given in this article are from reputed Homoeopathic journals and independent organisations thus satisfying the verifiability criteria. His individual publications as cited also appear genuine. I would also agree with Sapnafive because after going thorugh references, he comes across as a Scientific Homeopath and not a Speculative one. Ashwinee 10:09, 10 November 2006 (UTC) Ashwinee</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I dont think it should matter whether the subject is a "Scientific Homeopath" or a "Speculative one" (whatever those terms may mean) - what matters is notability. I dont really think his own publications should count towards his notability. What should count are sources independant of the subject. I'm not in a position to judge whether Sify.com or Limca are notable sources - if they are, then the subject probably meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgleyDJ_85d5.html" title="User:MidgleyDJ">MidgleyDJ</a> 10:15, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Another example of how pre-www structures fail google tests. The article hold relevance. Little is known about the outfit, but the article is relevant out of two points: 1) The draft programme of SRC(b) was distrubted throughout the world by pro-Chinese and pro-Albanian groups. It was generally referred to as the voice of the internal USSR Left Opposition. 2) Although it cannot be confirmed, at least not by myself, whether the SRC(b) was a real organization or just a Chinese propaganda hoax, there definately was existed a pro-Maoist, student based, opposition in the USSR at the time. For obvious reasons, it was completly clandestine and there is little written about it. If anyone could taken on the task, this article could be rewritten to deal with Maoism in the USSR in general (as to opposed to just the SRC(b)), but I strongly urge not to delete it. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 14:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>OfficeGirl is right. When you write a meaningful, properly referenced article, no one will object. Right now the article is plain false. The problem is not in google, the problem is in the author, who probably does not fully understand wikipedia policies: <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable Sources</a>. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 19:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>And just to add a point which may not be clear to a newer editor: we will not keep an article in expectation (or hope) that sources will be added at some point in the future. If reliable sources are not available today, the article needs to be removed until such time as verification is available. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 21:08, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'll try to rewrite the article today itself, or possibly tomorrow. The following can be verified, with reliable sources (like PLA congress documents):</li>
<li>At the 1964 congress of PLA a Draft Programme of SRC(b) was presented</li>
<li>In PLA congress protocols it is mentioned that a SRC(b) delegation attended. (No names are of course mentioned, for security reasons)</li>
<li>The SRC(b) document was distributed amongst pro-China/Albania groups worldwide.</li>
<li>The SRC(b) document was, in summary, a critique of the economic policies of Chrusthev.</li>
<li>The SRC(b) document in many ways functioned as a program document of the Albanian/Chinese in their criticism of <a href="../../../c/p/s/CPSU_4352.html" title="CPSU">CPSU</a> during the initial phase of the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino-Soviet_split_79f8.html" title="Sino-Soviet split">Sino-Soviet split</a>, explaining why they regarded CPSU as revisionist.</li>
<li>The SRC(b) played a role in Albanian propaganda at the time, giving PLA legitimacy in terms of their relations to Soviet communists. (CPSU rhetoric at the time was that CPC/PLA were splitters from the Communist Movement. Using the SRC(b), the PLA responded that it was the CPSU that had diverted from Marxism-Leninism, and that the SRC(b) rallied genuine Marxist-Leninists in the USSR).</li>
<li>At least one author (the link given in the article) has questioned whether the SRC(b) was an actual organization, and claims that it was just an Albanian propaganda hoax. It should be noted that the author in question makes a rather general statement, essentially saying that since he never heard of the SRC(b), then it didn't exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I will not be able to answer is the following question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the SRC(b) a genuine organization or an Albanian hoax? The article still holds relevance with either answer. At this point we can only conclude that there is speculation over the SRC(b). If anyone is willing to plunge into KGB archives to find out more about the Maoist student opposition in the USSR, I would highly welcome it, but its a task I cannot physically do myself. Of course such a group would have been completly clandestine, perhaps working as a secret fraction within the established Soviet structures (like radical Maoists in China today). Official Soviet sources would not reveal its existance.</li>

<li>No, this would not be a case or OR. The article would present that the Albanians claimed existance of group, a document was distributed and there would be an open speculation of the actual existance of the group (based on lack of sources).

<li>You seem to misunderstand the term OR (see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). Unless the topic is covered by an expert (historian or reporter or writer), collecting bits and pieces (marginal mentioning, texts of documents, etc.) all over internet is OR. Only a professional may evaluate all these. Our job is to report findings of professionals, not to do own historical search. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 02:31, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. No-one appears to be challenging Mereda's point that there are no indications that the subject has been covered by reliable third party sources, no other substantial claim that the subject merits coverage in an encyclopaedia.

Google hits and <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a> are also non-criteria. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 01:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I prodded this article (checking through a category) when the sources I found in googling just didn't convince me about notability. For interest, three other open discussions about arts organisations at the moment are on <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_Association_for_Downtown_Arts_a443.html" title="Durham Association for Downtown Arts">Durham Association for Downtown Arts</a>, Jansanskrity, and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transition_Gallery_9627.html" title="Transition Gallery">Transition Gallery</a>. Can we be clear here? Is anyone saying that it has "a significant amount of media coverage that is not trivial in nature and that deals specifically with the organization as the primary subject"? Or is it longevity (20 years?) that ought to be relevant? Or what else is it here that matters?? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 10:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC) So I say <b>delete</b>.

Tashacromp's only other contribution is <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_Environment_in_Mediation_4139.html" title="Physical Environment in Mediation">Physical Environment in Mediation</a>, which I could see as a valid subarticle of the general <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediation.html" title="Mediation">Mediation</a> article.

<p>Hi People!</p>
<p>Just to set the record straight.</p>
<p>Yes, I did write the short biography and the little entry about my consultancy. If that is forbidden, then by all means we must remove the entries.</p>
<p>In fact, I did the entry when I was working on the RepRap article some months ago so that the RepRap article "People" section would have something to link to. I didn't really have any motive beyond that. As you can see both of the entries were very brief and to the point. As well, they've not seen much change since their posting.</p>
<p>None of the other intentions that I've seen suggested in your guidelines, viz, self-promotion, business seeking and the like were in the least intended or real. I have a full consulting load and am not seeking either new business or new customers. I'm also approaching the end of my career rather than it's beginning, so I'm not really very interested in self promotion, either.</p>
<p>You noticed that my "company" website is a mess. It certainly is. It was last active in the late 1990's and I just reinstituted the domain. Just why, I'm not completely sure since the domain really has no point. The old, old main page is partially up. It's not commercial and it needs a rewrite, something I haven't had time to attend to, since I stopped doing text mining consulting a long time ago.</p>
<p>As I have said, I had no ulterior motives in doing the entries for my name and little company beyond making links for the reprap article. If this warrants their being deleted, fine. If there is something that wants doing so that the entries can be brought up to an acceptable Wikipedia standard, I would certainly appreciate a little help in that regard.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Forrest Higgs aka plaasjaapie</p>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> - knowledge management is a nebulous concept, to put it mildly, and to justify the deletion of articles like these needs a much clearer consensus over whether the British Standards Institutions 2004 Report is enough to base an article like this on.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of the original page. I have edited it to make clear that the arguments are those which can be found in the published British Standards Institutions 2004 Report "Knowledge Management in the Public Sector", which meets Kuru's concerns fully. The rationale for having it as a separate page in the Wikipedia rather then under the general knowledge management page is precisely addressed by the BSI Report in its preamble, which I have added.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is</p>
<p>"The understanding and practice of Knowledge Management has been growing rapidly throughout the public sector over recent years. Yet a constant comment from existing and nascent public sector KM practitioners has been that, until now, most of the analytical literature concerning Knowledge Management has sought to understand and explain it within a mainly private-sector context. There has not been a single, easy-to-digest national study that objectively and specifically analysed the growth of KM in the public sector and thereby set out the evidence-based public sector context within which Knowledge Management can add value to the work of public servants. The British Standards Institution, through this Guide to Good Practice, has sought to plug this important gap."</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Dave Snowden is a good colleague of mine, but he is not accurate when he says the BSI Report is not an agreed position. The Report was debated and agreed by consensus of the BSI committee which drew up the Report. Dave has a particular view which is and was not the consensus view of the rest of the members of the BSI Committee. It is more accurate to say that it was not a unanimous view, because Dave was not in full agreement, but if we only published documents which had unanimous views with no dissenters, then there would not be much on the site at all. This is an official and agreed BSI Guide to Good Practice and published under the BSI's authority and with its full agreement. Of course, Dave is more than free to add some comments to the article, but simply deleting the whole article would deny the Wikipedia community access to a good and thorough piece of research carried out in conjunction with the Warwick Business School.</li>

<li>That you are a customer is irrelevant. Wikipedia would be a mess if that were a criterion.

<li>The being-a-customer note was an obvious irrelevant aside attempting to bring some levity. Sorry you took it so seriously. Anyway, 100+ store chain is notable.

<ul>
<li>Wrong. It's not POV at all. In fact, quite the converse. The number of stores in a chain is not a criterion exactly because where to set the bar is completely arbitrary, just as judging companies on numbers of employees or annual turnovers is setting arbitrary bars. The primary WP:CORP criterion, in contrast, simply requires published works of appropriate provenances and depths.
<p>By the way: A reason for involving British people is most definitely <i>not</i> the one that you have (Notability is not subjective. Wanting more subjective opinions leads to a bad encyclopaedia.), but merely that British people will be able to locate and to cite the necessary published works more easily. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:47, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b> - I'm happy to restore the material to userspace if needed, but I don't see why the article would be needed to write something about the organisation in another article. This article is two sentences and a simple statement of what the organisation is, half of which is quoting the organisation's motto. As it stands the article does not even assert notability as required by <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion criteria</a>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 02:04, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> That thought had passed through my mind as well. However, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarian_Universalist_Independent_Affiliate_organizations_f74a.html" title="Unitarian Universalist Independent Affiliate organizations">Unitarian Universalist Independent Affiliate organizations</a> is basically just a list. <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Selection_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia: Lists (stand-alone lists)#Selection criteria</a> says that list items should have their own articles or that it be reasonable to expect an article to be forthcoming in the future. As this topic is not covered in relable sources, we would not be able to write an article on it. In addition, such a list may be objectionable to some as listcruft. I would suggest that HellaNorCal, as well as <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanaen_d33d.html" title="User:Canaen">User: Canaen</a>, who I have also been talking too about these <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarian_Universalist_Association_287c.html" title="Unitarian Universalist Association">Unitarian Universalist Association</a>-affiliate substub articles, direct their attention to improving the articles on those UUA affiliates about which <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> have been published, rather than trying to save substubs that basically just serve as links to the organization or turning the list of UUA organizations into a linkfarm. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 16:01, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>Yes, as it stands, it is just a list. As well, several articles on that list already have articles on them. I suggest expanding the concept of the article to house content, so it is not simply a list of names. This should serve several purposes. Consolidating information, developing stubs which are not yet ready for their own articles, and making deletionists happy by only having a single article. As you have noted, JChap, CUUPs, one of the UU affiliate organizations, has an article which may have reliable sources. It is reasonable to assume that since one independent affiliate organization has been written of in reliable sources, that others may be found in the future. Closing with a note, I see both JChap and myself are posting this thrice at the three ongoing AfDs about IAOs or the UUA; perhaps this would be simpler if we simply discussed it at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnitarian_Universalist_Independent_Affiliate_organizations_dc2a.html" title="Talk:Unitarian Universalist Independent Affiliate organizations">Talk:Unitarian Universalist Independent Affiliate organizations</a> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellaNorCal_013f.html" title="User:HellaNorCal">HellaNorCal</a> 23:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Article was qualified for speedy deletion under A7, but doesn't qualify, because the notability of this actor is asserted in the plays and in the award(s?). I'm sending it to AfD instead.

<li>My bad. I admit to being a little hasty on the draw there. I do believe there's a conflic of interest here considering the original contributer to the article created this and another page.

<li>No, it isn't. Once again: If you actually focus upon doing the research and looking for, reading, citing, and evaluating sources, you'll get the right answer. For examples: You can read about <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagoras.html" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>' mystery school on page 41 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1592572154</a>.

You can read an opinion of how trustworthy <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herodotus.html" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> is, based upon the assertion that he was inducted in the Egyptian mystery school, on page 179 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0887387993</a>. You can read about the Egyptian mystery schools in general on page 338 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1417940778</a>.

<p>Another F-Zero fancruft article. Many characters debut all the time, it doesn't mean they should have articles about it. Merge into a F-Zero characters list. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 00:40, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> Same as above, new article every time a game changes, for example by adding a new level. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScope_creep_3ef9.html" title="User:Scope creep">scope_creep</a> 00:51, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> All the time? To name just a few, Legend of Zelda series has much more, Pokemon is going 400+ articles. Between X and GX, only 1 character was introduced. Not to mention this will make the F-Zero pilot list very large and less of a list. I suggest following what was done to the Legend of Zelda characters. By the way, isn't Pokemon Diamond &amp; Pearl coming out next year? Looks like 100+ articles for them! <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFullMetal_Falcon_81ca.html" title="User:FullMetal Falcon">FullMetal Falcon</a> 00:58, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
