<p>Well I think that this should be quite obvious. There is no academic source or scholar who attests to the existence of this mythical "Brown people", a term with racist connotations. Many Middle-Easterners, Pakistanis and Indians are varied in skin-tone, and can range from Caucasoid to Mongoloid in ethnicity. Looks like a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> violation, at best, Neo-Nazi/far-right propaganda at worst. It would not be so bad if the article were sourced reliably and had some kind of academic context instead of just a couple of sentences. However, I do not think that such a thing is possible. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 07:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>Response</i>: I'm not speaking for anyone else. I'm pointing out that the article has been completely rewritten since the timepoint of AfD submission through just prior to Edison's remarks. That needed to be explicitly stated for the reviewing administrator because the arguments given for deletion prior to Edison's addition to the discussion are based on different content entirely (and should therefore be re-timestamped to show that they acknowledge and maintain their opinion of the article <i>as it stands now</i>, otherwise their comments are irrelevant to the AfD discussion of the <i>current</i> version of the article). The submission is also based on different content entirely and therefore the submitting editor should reconsider their submission. Whether they reconsider and feel it still does not meet the inclusion criteria is up to them, but it is something they should have to deal with as opposed to ignore entirely. There is nothing in what I said before or how I clarify it now that is said out of arrogance or speaking for anyone else. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 00:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>There's no obviously offensive remark there, no "Interpret all deletes as keeps". It merely reflects fact- admins should (and probably would) not change those opinions but discount most of them altogether, or at least treat them as being of minimal weight. AfD is not a vote, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a democracy</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 01:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Its offensive to ask an admin to ignore the comments of those one doesnt agree with. The admin should ignore Ju's comments on other users intentions and focus on the votes. Both Carwil and I still think it is a rascist article that needs deleting and for anyone to claim that other voters who voted delete dont think that is clearly trying to affect the vote in a negative and entirely spurious way. Its not for Ju to decide that delete means keep, nor anyone else. To ignore the delete votes would be little more than trolling and I trust that no admin will do so, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:14, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Any discussion about the text of the article (regardless of whether the discussion signifies keep or delete) prior to Uncle G's rewrite of the article in its entirety are not applicable to Uncle G's contribution to the article. Is that not clear to you? The only part of the article that remained the same between the edit just prior to Uncle G's involvement and the current text is the title. The nomination even states that "academic context" would mitigate the need for deletion. You are continuing to falsely characterize my statements because in no way have I said "delete means keep", nor have I said "ignore the delete votes". Finally, I'd like to say that it is possible to discuss race without inherently being rascist or violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. There are numerous academic fields based upon race and the approaches taken to studying race are encyclopedic. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well I hope you will respect the delete of all users who wrote delete. Of course we can discuss race without being rascist. IMO Uncle G's contributions are to be lamented, he turned a troll bait article into something wikipedia might be stuck with (7-5 in favour of delete right now) even though the article is so full of holes (eg it says brown people dont exist, so why if that is the case is this article being used to justify anything other than its own deletion). In terms of watching comments (your edit summary) that is exactly what I am asking you to do and not to dismiss the delete of any users as you have asked for, so taking some of your own advice would perhaps be a good idea, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:09, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If they based their discussion on sound guidelines and the current text, then I give their comments due credit. If they are based on a different text entirely, then the responses need to be updated. If an article meets the guidelines then Wikipedia is better for having it. The article discusses a term of historical significance. At one point the term was used to classify people in an anthropological system based on skin color. Furthermore, there are still references in more modern situations (as also written in the article). Articles are frequently started for many wrong reasons but concern notable topics (e.g., if a "Paula Abdul" article is created saying <i>Paula Abdul eats goats.</i>, then it should be rewritten to discuss a notable entertainer and abide by WP:BIO and WP:BLP). There are articles about concepts that have little or no place in today's society (like <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrenology.html" title="Phrenology">Phrenology</a>) but are notable and historical concepts which makes them encyclopedic. Unless the article violates a guideline, then I'm not sure why it would require deletion. Can you point to the guideline(s) that the current text violates? <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well people are still voting delete. The text itself says it is at best a shoddy concept and at worst there is no such thing. The fact that one new person has called for delete and I continue to do so is the clearest possible indication that the other editors won have changed their minds either. IMO this article was writen as troll bait and I am sure the person who wrote it is having a laugh at our expense. I also think in rewriting it Uncle G has damaged the reputation of wikipedia and has done more harm than good, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:33, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> -- There's no central underlying concept here that has an encyclopedic meaning. As the article now says, "Historically, the appellation "brown people" has been applied by various people to a wide range of disparate, and disconnected, groups of people." Throw all the referenced material to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_metaphors_for_race.html" title="Color metaphors for race">Color metaphors for race</a>. I think we should be really hesitant to reify prejudicial and racist concepts, starting with Blumenbach's categories, but extending from there. If racists call people brown, ignore it. If notable racist systems call them brown, put them in the relevant articles (<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blumenbach.html" title="Blumenbach">Blumenbach</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_9005.html" title="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazism</a>, etc.). At most, though I think this is worse than just dropping the page, disambiguate to relevant articles (<a href="../../../c/o/l/Colored.html" title="Colored">Colored</a> (South Africa), <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay.html" title="Malay">Malay</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latino.html" title="Latino">Latino</a>). Note that quick google search suggests that <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_people.html" title="Brown people">Brown people</a> is used as a racist term most frequently.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarwil_fe69.html" title="User:Carwil">Carwil</a> 16:44, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

As also explained to you on the talk page, the article does say something <i>quite different</i>, which is that some people refer to Mexican Americans as brown people.

<li><i>Brown is used by Mexican people</i> It is? There is no exact equivalent in the Spanish language for the English word <i>brown</i>, only words describing various <i>shades</i> of brown. The Native American people of the US, some of which are of the same lineage (<a href="../../../u/t/o/Uto-Aztecan_6b0f.html" title="Uto-Aztecan">Uto-Aztecan</a>, for example) as many native Mexicans, are often described in English as.. <b>red</b>skins. Should we have an article on "red people"? Of course not, that's covered by articles about Native Americans, a "red people" article would be equally silly and redundant as this article is. Minus things that ought to be moved to other articles, what's left are dicdefs of several definitions of "brown people". This will be kept by "no consensus" and by "administrative courtesy", no matter what arguments go on here, since Unca G is an admin, but that's my pinche cinco centavos worth of opinion. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 09:29, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> At the very least, there is a strong historical (and encyclopedic) note to be kept on the term as used by Enlightment thinkers and early refrences like <i>On the Natural Variety of Mankind</i>. The rewrite seems close to this context, or at the very least more well-founded and better written. You may take the term to be antequated or ultimately flawed, but the term certainly existed and was used as a point in time. Even <i>if</i> I personally wouldn't recommend the usage of a term currently, that doesn't retcon the historical usage. (In fact, if verifiable, a section on the decline in usage of the term or possible modern offensiveness would be entirely appropriate.) <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 21:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Problem is, Blumenbach et al. were in fact racist douchebags, building a "scientific" system in large part to reinforce their underlying prejudices. (See the chapter on Blumenbach in S.J.

<li>If that's the case (I must admit to not being familiar with Blumenbach in particular), I would tend to think that citations and referencing in the proper context with a NPOV is a screen enough. In any event, I'd much rather judge Blumenbach to be a douchebag because of a knowledge of his beliefs and reasoning, not a lack thereof or impromper connotation of terms. Various articles discuss distasteful things in a (hopefully) neutral fashion, so long as they meet the standards for notability. I'd would certainly trust that editors such as yourself would be watchful about such articles spreading a POV even through their subtext; that is definitely something to be mindful of and remove. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 02:35, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "race scientists" don't use <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_people.html" title="Brown people">brown people</a> as a central concept, but rather <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australoid.html" title="Australoid">Australoid</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayan_race.html" title="Malayan race">Malayan race</a>. Brown is an add-on descriptor, not the central concept. Using it to link to anyone who's called their collective group of people brown (and contra the article, lots of people have brown skin) to these terms stretches the page into two unrelated concepts, and (this may be what's most important to those of us writing about the racism involved) gives legitimacy to very problematic concepts.</li>

<li>Hm, are you sure about that application of the naming conventions? That would certainly apply to the term as used in an article about people from that particular region, however, not to an article about the term itself. In the latter case, the term is not being used to describe people, rather the term itself and past usages are described. I suppose you <i>could</i> try and fold the term into the pages of all of the Enlightenment era authors that used it, but that seems a little off as a reason behind an AfD to me. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 23:29, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>A read of three academic articles by Jack Forbes on the issue, and using the word brown reveals that he uses brown only as a color descriptor, and makes no attempt to conceptualize or reify "brown people." The articles were: The Hispanic Spin: Party Politics and Governmental Manipulation of Ethnic Identity, Jack D. Forbes, Latin American Perspectives &gt; Vol. 19, No. 4, The Politics of Ethnic Construction: Hispanic, Chicano, Latino...? (Autumn, 1992), pp. 59-78.

Undercounting Native Americans: The 1980 Census and the Manipulation of Racial Identity in the United States, Jack D. Forbes, Wicazo Sa Review &gt; Vol. 6, No. 1 (Spring, 1990), pp. 2-26.
