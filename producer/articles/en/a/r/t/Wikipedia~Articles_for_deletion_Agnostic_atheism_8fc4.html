<dd><b>Comment</b> Just because there are articles on other terms qualifying the words <i>"atheist"</i> and <i>"agnostic"</i> doesn't mean <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> is anything more than a neologism. (There might be grounds for AfDing those other articles for similar reasons, by the way). Second, the first link you cite states <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> is synonymous with <i>"weak atheism"</i>, which would be grounds for merging the two articles. Looking through the sources on your second link shows that there is no consistent usage of this term. It really does seem like a neologism that people make up to fit whatever theory they seem to be pursuing at the time. If the article itself was better sourced as to where they got their information from I'd have less issues with it, but as it stands it's still <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a> 02:40, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Jeandré, your point seems to be that the term <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> is used outside Wikipedia. I am aware of this. However, it still seems to be a neologism for several reasons. First, it's not in any dictionary I'm aware of (apart from online dictionaries that use Wikipedia as their source). Second, the outside sources that do use the term <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> do not say where they got it, so that makes me suspect they just coined it; a suspicion that is confirmed by the relatively few hits this term gets. Searching google for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=atheism+-wikipedia&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=atheism+-wikipedia&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">atheism -wikipedia</a>" returns over 9 million hits, "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=xPK&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=agnosticism+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=xPK&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=agnosticism+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">agnosticism -wikipedia</a>" returns almost 2.5 million hits, while "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=I4e&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22agnostic+atheism%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=I4e&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22agnostic+atheism%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"agnostic atheism" -wikipedia</a>" returns only about 12 thousand hits. Third, the term is used inconsistently: in this article one of the doctrines of <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> is supposedly that <i>"knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is irrelevant or unimportant"</i> while the article you quote says nothing of the sort. Finally, and most importantly, this article is completely unsourced. Where did they get these definitions? Beats me, because there isn't a single reference. As such, it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and should be deleted accordingly (though copying it to the <i>"weak atheism"</i> talk page before deletion is also acceptable). -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a> 02:27, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is an established term which appeared in print at least 25 years ago and is widely used together with weak and strong atheism. As regards its Google standing, I note that <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weak_atheism.html" title="Weak atheism">weak atheism</a> returns only 13,700 hits while <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_atheism.html" title="Strong atheism">strong atheism</a> returns 20,100; these aren't exactly Britney-levels of interest but that doesn't make them invalid.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I believe <i>"weak atheism"</i> and <i>"strong atheism"</i> are also neologisms, but let's take one neologism at a time. Anyway, whether or not this particular neologism has appeared in print <i>"at least 25 years ago"</i> (can you provide a reference for that, by the way?), the fact is that that says nothing about this article's violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<dd>Sure. Sue Townsend had her character Adrian Mole describe himself as an "agnostic atheist" in 1982, in "The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole". The first Google groups hit for "agnostic atheism" is <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/alt.atheism/msg/450f912ca8c65c63?dmode=source&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/alt.atheism/msg/450f912ca8c65c63?dmode=source&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">this alt.atheism post from 1991</a> - they've been discussing "agnostic atheism" for *fifteen years*. Now those are not valid sources in themselves, but combined with the detailed outside sources you dismissed above, which do use and define the term, it certainly starts to look less and less like a neologism. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 19:51, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<blockquote>
<p>...We might as well define "agnostic" while we're at it, since there is a similar division of usage. I call a "soft agnostic" one who says: "I don't know whether there is a God or not." A "hard agnostic" is one who says: "The proposition `There is a God' is undecidable." Robert Green Ingersoll (1833-1899), the great 19th-century freethought orator, took the hard agnostic position when he said: "The Agnostic does not simply say, `I do not know.' He goes another step and says with great emphasis that you do not know." George H. Smith uses the term "agnostic atheist" for this position. He uses the term "agnostic theist" for a person who "believes in the existence of god, but maintains that the nature of god is unknowable." Yet another position, taken by Alfred Jules Ayer (author of LANGUAGE, TRUTH AND LOGIC, copyright 1936) and many skeptics, is: "The statement `There is a God' doesn't make sense, since the term `God' is undefined or incoherent." Such people do not call themselves agnostics, since they clarify the definition of the hard agnostic given above by expanding it to "The proposition `There is a God' is significant and it is neither true nor false: it is undecidable."...</p>

<dd>There's also <i>A Short History of Freethought</i> by J.M. Robertson, published in <b>1915</b>, and quoting an earlier work on Buddhism: <i>"Agnostic atheism ... is the characteristic of his [Buddha's] system of philosophy."</i> So we have established prior use and published works more than ten years old that define the term in the same way the article does.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Deleting this article would certainly set a dangerous precedent for the continuity of philosophical articles since all philosophy is original "research". Using the criterion at <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, we could legitimately strip most religious articles since much of the information in those articles originate from disreputable sources, such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holy_Bible_70c7.html" title="The Holy Bible">The Holy Bible</a> which has been translated innumerable times by only God knows how many people. Should we limit such religious articles to only discussions occurring in academic journals? I've seen some really crazy flame wars in academic journals. They're not exactly the pinnacles of authority.

<p>The compilers of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> operate a sensible criterion for deciding whether a new word shall be canonised by inclusion.

I'm not an expert on determining the spread of a word; however, I think this is certainly something worth looking into. The article <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religiopoiesis.html" title="Religiopoiesis">religiopoiesis</a> continues to exist despite having a measly 10 results in AltaVista whereas the article <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_atheism.html" title="Agnostic atheism">agnostic atheism</a> is under fire with 1,800 results. Boolean searches were conducted to strip results that mentioned "Wikipedia". You cannot find some terms and subjects through any search engine or in any dictionary. Knowledge of these subjects and words would necessitate access to private libraries or subscriptions to extremely expensive academic journals. Esoteric subjects are inherently noteworthy for encyclopedic inclusion. The appearance of a deficiency of information about a subject should prompt further inquiry about the subject instead of blunt opposition to the subject's inclusion.

<dd>It's not OR, it's unsourced, like thousands of other articles. It certainly isn't unverifiable. Quoting <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_d4d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion">Wikipedia:Deletion</a>: <i>"Problems that may not require deletion: ...

We've established that this is, after all, not a new term. However, without sources the article looks like a new definition of an existing term to me. For all I know someone did make this whole thing up. As I asked earlier, where did whoever wrote that article get his definitions? It's impossible to tell without sources. And the article is unverifiable, since there are no sources cited to verify.

<dd>Just because the article is unsourced doesn't make it a fabrication! If <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_pie.html" title="Apple pie">apple pie</a> didn't quote its sources, nobody would say that it was actually describing peach pie, just because of that. Assuming that the things in the article *are* facts, it's possible to find supporting sources which support the article and add them in. If they aren't facts, then it can be rewritten based on sources, or based on the existing material.

<p><i>[crazy indenting, let's start over]</i></p>
<p>But your own quotes disprove what you're saying, <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a>. <i>"If an article topic has no reputable sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic"</i> doesn't mean that an article with no sources listed can be removed, it means that an article <b>for which no sources can be found</b> should be removed. It's not talking about the article, it's talking about the topic, the subject itself. Like saying "we all know Tony Blair is a reptile, but the reputable sources won't print it" - there are no reputable sources for that and it doesn't merit inclusion as fact. We've provided you with several reputable sources, but this is not enough. As for <i>"material that is challenged and has no source may be removed by any editor</i>, I've never thought that was about deleting articles, but about removing material from articles. Read for context. I've already shown you the recommendation to add {{unsourced}} to unsourced articles from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; how about these quotes from <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"You can add sources even for material you didn't write if you use a source to verify that material. Adding citations to an article is an excellent way to contribute to Wikipedia."</i> - this directly contradicts your claim that nobody can prove what the original author was thinking; facts don't need telepathic verification.</li>
<li><i>"Disputed text can immediately be removed entirely <b>or moved from the article to the talk page for discussion. If the disputed text is harmless, and you simply feel a citation is appropriate, place {{fact}} (or {{citation needed}}) after the text."</b></i> - again, improve, don't delete.</li>
<li>Where I think you may have got mixed up a little: <i>"Unsourced criticism or negative material <b>in the biographies of living persons should be removed immediately</b>, and not moved to talk.</i> - this article is not a biography of a a living person.</li>
</ul>

<li>I'm not solely responsible, or even responsible, for the article. Read <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaboration.html" title="Collaboration">collaboration</a>.</li>
<li>I'm not interested in religious or philosophical articles. These are not my areas of interest.</li>
<li>This AfD is now invalid for the following reason: sources are cited; however, their citation may be considered incomplete. Incomplete citation is not grounds for this AfD per the specific complaint of the initiator (i.e., "... there are no cited sources. There have been sources cited in this AfD, but they are not integrated in to the article, so the specific claims of the article are not sourced. As such, it constitutes original research.")</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If you want to volunteer to verify the sources — after all, that's why bibliographies exist — go ahead. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 23:55, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whether adding a list of sources to the end of the article without any sort of indication as to the information each source provided constitutes even the initial stages of acceptable citation is a decision to be made by whoever closes this AfD. My contention is that if you consider your work to be at some sort of intermediate stopping point, that you shouldn't have bothered starting. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 00:48, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In other words, you are not interested in verifying the sources. Cool. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 01:02, 23 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, and you're not either. Again, why bother adding them then? They're useless. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 01:03, 23 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The person who chooses to verify those sources will find the listing useful. Again, read <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaboration.html" title="Collaboration">collaboration</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 01:09, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s>You've already admitted that they aren't sources: <i>"And they weren't used as sources.

<li><b>Keep</b>, obviously not a neologism. —<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPengo_70fc.html" title="User:Pengo">Pengo</a> 09:35, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but rewrite</b> - The Case Against God (referenced somewhere further up this page) has been around long enough for it not to be original research. However, I'm familiar with this term as a subcategory of atheism, and in particular from the book as one of the two shards of agnosticism that stand alone. The article makes it sound more distinctly separate than that. --Ted 19:12, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. If the article doesn't grow in six months, merge and delete. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 09:28, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
