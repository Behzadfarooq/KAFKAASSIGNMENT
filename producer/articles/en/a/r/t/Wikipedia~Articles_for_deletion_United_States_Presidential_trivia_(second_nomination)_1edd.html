<li><b>Delete</b>. Grouping them all into one article doesn't make them any more worthy of being kept than they would be if sent to their respective articles. If they aren't good enough for those articles, they're not good enough for Wikipedia, period. Other concern is indiscriminate information; that the trivia happens to involve presidents is a very loose thread. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe"><small><b>'</b></small></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/p/o/User_talk%7EApostrophe_d228.html" title="User talk:Apostrophe">Feeling chatty?</a> ) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Apostrophe_7a7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Apostrophe">Edits!</a>)</sup> 03:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm going to say <b>Strong Keep</b> because this AfD seems to have sprung out of the other AfD.

<dd>I do not think you understand the WP's you cited. The first one says "If you think another article is of equal notability to one being considered for deletion, you are welcome to nominate that article as well". And an example of disrupting wikipedia to make a point would be nominating an obviously notable article for deletion to try to leverage your vote AGAINST deleting another article. Here, I am saying we should delete <b>both</b>, for the same valid deletion criteria. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 06:44, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank-you for assuming good faith. My comment was indeed in good faith. Above you say "clearly" as if it was clear. It is not clear to me at all. We often nominate several articles at the same time, sometimes in the same AfD... each article stands on its own merit, but reasoning used by the editors is often a spillover effect. How is this counter to the best interests of the project? For us to achive consistency and to have standards for inclusion that make sense, would be a good thing? No? <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 15:10, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, obvious subarticle of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>, could use more references.

<dd>Hey Chris, if you wouldn't mind, could you outline a bullet point or two that you are speaking of? You did not vote in the previous AfD, and several reasonings were outlined in the AfD discussion, most of which were countered by other reasonings. Which ones are you saying have merit? I would be interested in seeing your point of view on this. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 05:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> this is more than trivia about multiple presidents, this is trivia about the office of the president, with examples taken from particular presidents. It is therefore a valid subarticle of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>, and while a merge would be obvious, the pages together are very long, so this should be kept separate. (Edit) Note: This is not just trivia as well, this is indeed notable information, organized for the context of the Office rather than the persons. (thereby failing to be considered trivia by Wikipedia) —<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>χ</i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo">o</a> 10:13, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is okay to have trivia if we make some sort of attempt to explain why it is significant. Is there any assertion that these pieces of trivia are notable?

<li><b>Keep</b> (as I "voted" keep in the companion AfD). While I have mostly supported the current push to delete subtrivial presidential lists (both American and Filipino) and have personally carried out some merges toward that end, I think that these particular articles should stay. The articles on individual presidents contain their own facts but not the agregation of facts that this one provides. Much of this info is interesting and/or encyclopedic but doesn't fit well in the basic <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> article and so splitting it out makes sense. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 09:18, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Looking more closely at a couple of comments above, I see a few Merge then delete "votes". This is not common practice (merged articles are kept as redirects) becuase it destroys the edit history and thus is incompatible with the GDFL which requires that proper credit be given. If sourced facts are incorporated into a plethora of individual articles or lists, it may be the only way forward, but if a significant amount of content is moved to a specific article (like the main president article) the history whould be <b>kept</b> behind a redirect. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 09:22, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My understanding of the GFDL as it applies to Wikipedia is that the wikipedia editors who contribute the article text do not have a license, and do not have protections for being credited for sourcing on subsequent use of the text within wikipedia. The concern you mention would only be applicable if the original article cited external documents as sources, republished previously-sourced external GFDL information, and such source citation did not occur in the article into which the content is merged. As long as the merging admin is privvy to the policies relating to merging content within wikipedai articles, I believe this concern will be addressed. But as I said, and as you pointed out: if User: SallyJaneDoe contributed significantly to this article, and we merge the content into another article, Sally has no evidence that she ever worked on it, and the merging admin would get all the "credit". But getting "credit" is not what wikipedia is all about, so its really a mute point. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 20:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am pretty sure that this is incorrect (see <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html#Contributors.27_rights_and_obligations" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Wikipedia:Copyright#Contributors' rights and obligations</a>). <b>I</b> own the copyright on the material that I submit to Wikipedia as its author and I agree to lisence it under the GFDL when I upload it. <i>You agree to license your contributions under the GFDL.</i> from the edit page. Thus Wikipedia is required to give me credit (in a history section) for any page in which my contributions occur. That this is a technical and pedantic requirement subject to <i>de minimis</i> exceptions is not in dispute, but it is still a requirement and should not be violated unnecessarily. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 08:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
