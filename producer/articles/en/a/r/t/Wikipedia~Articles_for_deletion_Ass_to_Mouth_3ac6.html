<ul>
<li>Delete Oral-Anal sex covers the topic 142.154.35.248 01:55, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Title is too vulgar, and the majority of the edits have been made by only one person. Too limited a subject, is this page really nessesary? <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestrosync_66c2.html" title="User:Maestrosync">[maestro]</a> 06:52, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Not making a vote as I haven't researched this, but the title being vulgar is not grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 07:13, Nov 18, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Many wikipedia articles deal with limited subjects. This is certainly true of articles dealing with human sexuality (see <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anilingus.html" title="Anilingus">Anilingus</a>). Furthermore, a fair number of articles have been written by but one person. Furthermore, this article is not prurient -- it addresses possible causes for A2M's rise in popularity as of late in American pornography. I vote for retention. It has been proposed that both <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anilingus.html" title="Anilingus">Anilingus</a> and Ass to Mouth be grouped under a new article to be entitled <i>Oral-Anal Sex</i>. I would prefer that Ass to Mouth be given a less vulgar name, but there seems to be no technical term for this sex act in existance. At Wikipedia, we should document our subjects, not create new terms for them. Of course, if a reduction in the title's vulgarity were deemed absolutely necessary, it could be called "Anal to Oral", following the age-old convention that English words with Latin or Romance sources are considered more refined than their Germanic equivalants.</li>
<li>I just checked -- "Anal to Oral" wouldn't be permitted, as Wikipedia has a policy against the inclusion of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologisms</a> See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a> for more info about this.</li>
<li>The term "<a href="../../../r/i/m/Rimming.html" title="Rimming">Rimming</a>" is commonly used to refer to oral-anal contact, and is currently used as a redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anilingus.html" title="Anilingus">Anilingus</a>. It isn't a technical term, but it isn't crude either.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> in some form, but probably by <b>redirecting</b> to an article which covers the topic, such as one on pornographic film clichés: this act appears, so far, to be a creation of the pornographic film industry -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> 11:52, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't have any problem with the title but there is nothing to say about the practice that you couldn't figure out for yourself from its name. The inclusion of health information is entirely spurious. It's mildly curious that it has become prominent in porn but is that enough to merit an article? I await the vote on anal double stuffing with bated breath.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 12:23, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: <i>Pardon me, I've got to save my ass.</i> - <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrek.html" title="Shrek">Shrek</a>. No encyclopedic info IMO, but that applies to most of our <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a> how-to articles too. Let's face it, sex is fascinating. No vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 12:41, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: At very best, this is duplicate material. A redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annilingus.html" title="Annilingus">annilingus</a> is fine, but redirects are the best way to handle the tee-hee topic names. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:51, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not that it much matters, but it's a different thing from anilingus entirely and a redirect would be completely inappropriate.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 14:58, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: Right. I'm not advocating any merge. I didn't want this subject matter redirected, just the name. I.e. I thought "Someone typing 'ass to mouth' in our search field should expect to get what?" I figured that someone doing that probably wasn't looking for the sodomy-sodomy thing but, rather, anillingus. That's what I was thinking, anyway. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:29, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>No, I agree, RaD, we ought not to be but "oral-anal contact" is the whole of the content. There is nothing more to say, unless perhaps we undertake a study of oral-anal contact through the ages or add our favourite anecdotes.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Ewwww... but doesn't seem to be duplicating information (Making me read it all to check that.. cruel cruel VfD), and is encyclopedic. —<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlorescentbulb_5fd7.html" title="User:Florescentbulb">Florescentbulb</a> 03:15, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's ... well, it's certainly a thorough treatment of the subject. Being disturbing isn't grounds for deletion, provided we try to be NPOV, so I think it should be kept. The proposed merge doesn't make sense to me, as the practices referred to seem to be substantially different things. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 03:48, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I think Wikipedia should cover pornography (what it is, what are the social legal issues surrounding it), but going into immense detail on every possible weird pornographic sexual activity will offend many readers, and doesn't contribute to the goal of making an ENCYCLOPEDIA, as opposed to the "Pornography Buyers Guide". I especially worry about the fact that children may come to Wikipedia, trying to find answers to school assignments, and then find this page. I certaintly wouldn't want my children reading about this, and a great many parents would feel the same. --JebeddiahSpringfield 04:06, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> offensive practice, but good article <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 05:26, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Offensive page names should be avoided without a good reason. <b>Move</b> elsewhere; <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral-anal_contact.html" title="Oral-anal contact">oral-anal contact</a> has been suggested as a target. <b>Do not delete</b> the content - <s>apparently a worthy topic</s>. <b>Rewrite</b> - the article does not need to contain repetitive vulgar language, and add some kind of a disclaimer at its top. There is no harm in <b>keeping</b> the redirect. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 13:41, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thinking about it once again, it seems to me that the topic is a bit too limited. It deserves a mention on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal-oral_contact.html" title="Anal-oral contact">anal-oral contact</a> (I believe that <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal-oral_sex.html" title="Anal-oral sex">anal-oral sex</a> would be a more appropriate article name) but not an article for itself. A cut-and-paste merge with <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anilingus.html" title="Anilingus">anilingus</a> is not an appropiriate solution, either; it resulted in a lot of duplicity in the article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, either under the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">slang</a> name of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_to_mouth.html" title="Ass to mouth">ass to mouth</a> or ATM (sex), or in the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral-anal_contact.html" title="Oral-anal contact">oral-anal contact</a> article. The latter is quite unfortunate, for it has nothing to do with <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anilingus.html" title="Anilingus">anilingus</a> and there is in fact no oral-anal contact at all. In any case, the practice may be disgusting but should be covered nevertheless, just like <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Bukkake_fcdf.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Bukkake">bukkake</a>. <a href="../../../r/f/l/User%7ERfl_2cf2.html" title="User:Rfl">Rafał Pocztarski</a> 16:12, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: valid subject. Distaste for the topic or name should not bias us to delete this when we keep articles of way less notability / notoriety daily. And if kept, it should be under this name; there is nothing in Wikipedia's naming conventions that says that prudery trumps 'most common name', which this is. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 19:31, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, we should seek the most precise or most common name. The precise and accurate name wouldn't be "ass" under any circumstances. First, only Americans use "ass" for rectum ("arse" for others). Second, the whole topic is not about an ass to a mouth; it's about removing from an anus to insert into a mouth. Next, though, saying that it is a "valid subject" is questionable, as many in the VfD voting are suggesting that this is strictly a porno industry myth. I suppose it's possible that a lot of people out there have multiple partners simultaneously who are seeking anal and then oral sex in a hurry, but it's not really very likely. Finally, though, if we were to say that this is a common problem, who on earth is going to search by this term? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:32, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Frequently, we AVOID precise names in favor of common names. This is in fact general Wikipedia policy. As to validity -- aren't porn industry myths ALSO valid subject material? Though 'myth' isn't exactly the right word here, since we're talking about a real phenomenon IN PORN. It is probably the case that this practice is exceedingly rare outside of porn, and the name is definitely one given by the porn industry. I detect in your reply here that you consider the porn industry and its consumers not a matter for an encyclopedia, and I disagree. Who's going to search for it under that term? Anyone familiar with phrases used in the porn industry, of course! which as you say, is the primary source of this stuff anyway. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 23:21, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We do opt for most common names, I agree. I don't think this is it, though. I'm not sure that the practice <i>has</i> a common name. That's why I thought the precise name was better. As for my feelings about porn and encyclopedias, I'm indifferent. I'm against porn starlets in, because their careers are usually extremely brief, and I'm against listing porno films the way we do mainstream movies because the numbers are so amazingly large and because the market, being run by shady folks with the most aggressively capitalistic motives, frequently chops and pastes "films" into five or six other forms and resells them. The more stable parts of the industry should be covered -- the major studios, the stars with very long careers (Seka, Jenna Jameson and the like) -- but that's not the issue here. I wouldn't vote against an article because it was distasteful, so to speak, unless I thought it put us in legal jeopardy (e.g. the pedophiliac stuff). I pretty much don't care. I was just saying that the name is a real issue here, because we should be precise or use the most common name, and I don't think this is the first nor that there is a last. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:21, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm sure there are also people who find <a href="../../../p/s/o/Psoriasis.html" title="Psoriasis">psoriasis</a> disgusting, but this fact does not make the phenomenon (including the name by which it is generally known) less encyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikikiwi_e290.html" title="User:Wikikiwi">Wikikiwi</a> 22:43, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
