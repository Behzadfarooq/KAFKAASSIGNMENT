<li>PinchasC should have identified himself on this AfD page as the creator and primary author of this article.</li>
<li>PinchasC claims that there are multiple independent reviews of his book. There are not. The "reviews" on the publisher's page (Wiley and Sons) are basically promotional blurbs, likely from associates of the authors, as you would see on the back of the book jacket. In fact, at least one of these is on the back of the book jacket. I am an IP professional and I own this book, and it is not a seminal work in the field. The other "review" (the pdf from SSTLR) is not so much a review as a chapter-by-chapter topic summary. There is no analysis or criticism in this document. I have not seen what I would consider to be a single independent review of the book, in the spirit of what is intended by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. E.g., a critical review of at least a few paragraphs in length from a reputable newspaper or periodical.</li>

<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does not say that a newspaper has to have given the review. The reviews given are by many people and they are considered to be independent reviews. If you have further analysis or criticism, you can add it to the document, however lack of it is not a reason to delete. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 00:25, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say that it did. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline; to follow the spirit of the guideline we have to determine for ourselves what is meant by an "independent review." I don't consider a (probably solicited) promotional blurb found <i>on the publisher's website</i> to be an independent review. I don't consider a chapter summary with no analytical content to be a review. I consider a critical review of at least a few paragraphs in length from a reputable newspaper or periodical to be a reasonable minimum standard for what is meant by an "independent review," and I think most other WP editors would probably agree. This article has failed to provide that, so I re-assert my vote to <b>Delete</b>.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 04:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So I guess we disagree, whether the publisher publishing a review makes it non independent or not. I would respectfully disagree and say that even if a publisher publishes the review, if <i>the review was by someone other than the publisher</i>, than it is an independent review. So I re-assert my vote to <b>Strong Keep</b>. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 12:55, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would say that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/_/WP%7EIS_7734.html" title="WP:IS">WP:IS</a> also disagree with your POV. The liner notes of a music album are typically written by someone other than the musician or producer, but that would rarely be considered an independent review of the album's contents -- the publisher and artist solicit someone whom they know will give a favorable description for the consumer. Likewise, these promotional blurbs published on the back of the book jacket are not "independent reviews".</dd>

<dd>To put this article in a bit of perspective: PinchasC is currently the creator and ONLY editor, other than EdColins (who nominated for deletion), not counting a style bot and one random editor who removed "Mr." before the subject's name.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 10:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As you wrote above, you own this book and only one of these are printed on the book. So I guess that would kind of prove yourr point wrong. Nowhere in WP:RS or WP:IS does it say what you are saying, and my point from above stands that although the publisher put these reviews on their site, the reviews were by someone other than the publisher and therefore independent. Additionally, this that I am the only editor of the article is not a criteria for deletion, and I'm not sure your point of bringing this up in all your comments. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I own the paperback version of this book; all three promotional blurbs on its book jacket are shown <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471209422.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471209422.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The link that you furnished has the promotional blurbs for the e-book, shown <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471273295,descCd-reviews.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471273295,descCd-reviews.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Since it's an electronic book, I would consider these blurbs on the publisher's website for the ebook to be on its electronic book jacket. It's published by the same publisher for the same reasons as a book jacket, regardless.</dd>
<dd>The reason why I bring up your relationship to this article as the creator and only editor is:
<ol>
<li>Good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" rel="nofollow">Wikietiquette for an AfD discussion</a> requires that you disclose whether you are the primary author and whether you have other vested interest in the article.</li>
<li>I believe there may be some <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">ownership</a> issues in play, and I think it's useful to those commenting or voting on the AfD to be aware of it. Along those lines, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability#Rationale_for_requiring_a_level_of_notability" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability#Rationale_for_requiring_a_level_of_notability" rel="nofollow">rationale for the notability requirement</a> says, "In order to have a neutral article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will be from unbiased and unaffiliated sources; and that those interested in the article will not be exclusively partisan or fanatic editors."</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It comes down to this: promotional blurbs are not reviews, and a publisher's site is not an independent or reliable source for unbiased book reviews. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/_/WP%7EIS_7734.html" title="WP:IS">WP:IS</a> are indeed relevant, as is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, especially where it says: "The "independence" qualification excludes all self-publicity, advertising by the subject, self-published material, autobiographies, press releases, and other such works affiliated with the subject, its creators, or others with a vested interest or bias."</dd>
<dd>The farther this goes, the more convinced I am that this subject is not notable. If there were existing independent reviews, they would have been produced by now, rather than having to defend such weak support. You would be hard-pressed to find any book today that does not come with the support of its publisher and a few short promotional blurbs; having these does not make the work an important one, nor does it make its subject notable. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 11:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The reviews under the reviews section are not printed on the book, only the ones in the description section. I hope you understand this distinction. You have not shown how these review would not conform with WP:N, you are just quoting sentences without showing relevance. Proving that an article or person is notable does not violate WP:OWN, I suggest you re-read this guideline together with the other guidelines that you seem to be interpreting to fit your viewpoint. I forgot to mention that I was the creator and primary editor of this article, but you did point it out so that took care of that. Continuing to use that as an argument for deletion shows a gross misunderstanding of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">policies and guidelines</a>. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:20, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't in fact understand the distinction -- especially since the quote by Lawrence Udell is under both tabs, of "description" and "reviews". Can you explain what differentiates these "review" blurbs from the "description" blurbs? In length and content they appear very much the same.</dd>
<dd>I think I've described quite enough for you on the relevant policies; if you choose to continue to deny their spirit and relevance, go right ahead. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 19:19, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please see the independent reference I brought above today, where the book was quoted in testimony by <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Choate_1c4d.html" title="Pat Choate">Pat Choate</a> to the The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and the Russian translation. Regarding the other references, we can agree to disagree. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 20:59, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Those brief citations by Choate and the Russian translation (presumably by the Russian co-author) do not add much to Lerner's notability. I suppose you can't explain the difference between the "description" book jacket blurbs and the "review" blurbs either. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 22:49, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
