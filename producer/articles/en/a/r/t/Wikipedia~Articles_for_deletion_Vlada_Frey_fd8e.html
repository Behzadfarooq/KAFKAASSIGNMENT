<p>This article makes no claim for no notability. A google search returns three sites: one Italian site that seems to be soccer-related, another Serbian, the third could be Croatian. Anyway, definately not enough to establish notability, unless those Serbian and Croatian(?) sites are somehow really important. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 00:50, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - This man deserve to have page on wikipedia, he may be the leader of the new artistic wave, obscure, yes, some times even scary, but free and passionate, strong and fresh, and what's most important - different! In this sea of mediocre, this guy is bringing something new. Currently he is only popular in the underground circles, as the article states, but wee can only hope that it will emerge and open eyes for many so called artists, and bring something new to this commercialized and conservative culture. There are so many things in the thrash-art that tell us of ourselves and our lives, it is sad that people failed to see it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Steff infidel (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteff_infidel_05a5.html" title="User talk:Steff infidel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Steff_infidel_a02d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Steff infidel">contribs</a>) 03:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC).</small><small>— Steff infidel (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteff_infidel_05a5.html" title="User talk:Steff infidel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Steff_infidel_a02d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Steff infidel">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><small><b>Strong keep</b> I must disagree with you people. Vlada Frey is very popular in the alternative art scene in Serbia. The reason he is not listed on many web pages is because Vlada is quite repulsive towards Serbia's modern art and culture overall, thus being in disagreement with many of Serbian artists and art galleries. But that does not mean he is not popular. Many alternative and abstract artists consider him a genius. When one of the users mentioned Frey as "underground" artist, he clearly meant different, a little bit anarchistic and anti-commercial. Just like punk and metal music. And I see these two music genre's, even though, considered "underground", have large articles on wikipedia, as well as many of the bands playing this music. Vladimir Stojkovic Frey is playing a huge part in Serbian performance art of today, and he deserves place on wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vuk Filipovic (<a href="../../../v/u/k/User_talk%7EVuk_Filipovic_06a8.html" title="User talk:Vuk Filipovic">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vuk_Filipovic_eb4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vuk Filipovic">contribs</a>) 04:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC).</small> <small>— Vuk Filipovic (<a href="../../../v/u/k/User_talk%7EVuk_Filipovic_06a8.html" title="User talk:Vuk Filipovic">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vuk_Filipovic_eb4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vuk Filipovic">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></small>

Also, no one <i>deserves</i> a place on Wikipedia. There are strict policies about adding articles for <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">living persons</a>, and Vlada Frey does not appear to satisfy those policies. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 04:38, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> Okay, I'm feeling very negative emotions, and anger coming from the user called "Kesh". Listen dude, I don't know if you have anything against Serbian art, culture or people overall, but if you do, I think you should keep it to yourself. Just because you haven't heard of someone, and I presume you haven't got all the knowledge of the world, that does not mean that person doesn't exist. With comments like that you are disrespecting Vlada's art and everything he is fighting. When I sad that Frey deserves a place in wikipedia, I just wanted to make regard, that if whole "underground" punk and gothic scene can find it's place here, one talented performance artist surely can. All I have for "evidence" is complete Vlada's discography. If that will make you feel any more convinced, I will upload it.
<ul>
<li>Calm down. He's just stating policy. I'm sure Vlada is a great guy, and I'm sure he exists. I'm also sure Kesh just loves Serbian culture and has an entire collection of Serbian folk records. We're not doubting he exists, but the article needs to assert notability, and it doesn't. What you need to do, to try and keep this article, is find an independent source to back up the claims. Go to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, find the criteria he meets it under, and give us a source. Even if he's entirely underground, if he's leading a new artistic movement, <i>somebody</i> has to have written an article on him.

<li>Well, I have no negative emotions about either Vlada Frey or the Serbian people in general. I'm just pointing out that this particular musician does not fit Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion in an article. I've known underground bands that I loved, but they're not notable enough to put on Wikipedia either. No disrespect is intended, but I have to be blunt: he does not satisfy the requirements for having an article here. Yet. Maybe one day, he will. As for your evidence, a discography doesn't help satisfy <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. We need articles published in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> about the artist and/or his work. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 22:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>What is with you people?So many people are fans of Vladas art,and what is wrong with wanting for whole world to know him.He is a fine young man,passionate and wise.We know of him in Australia too.He has this original vission of future and you will regret that you dont understand him now.Look at the Van Gogh! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Delirium S (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Delirium_S_2cf5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Delirium S">contribs</a>) 12:05, January 28, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
