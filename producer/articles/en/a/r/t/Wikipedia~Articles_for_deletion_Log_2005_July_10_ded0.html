Frankly, anyone who hasn't read it, and whose rationale isn't applicable to the nomination, should have his or her vote discounted. Read the article. Improve it, or vote to delete it, or vote to keep it based on something <i>in the article.</i> Rubber stamps are troll tools. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:58, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</font></sub></s>

Sometimes articles that deserve content (and you cna find verifiable content for) are bad and need to be improved. That has little relation on whether or not we should keep it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable. Not every porn star should have an entry on wikipedia. There is no information here about her anyway; this is basically just an ad for her website.

<li>The IMDB isn't based on legions of fans creating articles; most pages are created and maintained by agents to help promote their clients.

<li>My opinion has not changed since the last AFD discussion. No biographical sources are cited by the article, or were produced as a result of the prior AFD discussion. (The IMDB listing gives her date of birth and height in its biographical section. If that were all of the biographical source information required for a biography in an encyclopaedia, everyone with a passport or a driving licence would qualify.) Note that the place of birth given in this article <i>has no source apart from the almost certainly entirely fictitious biography on the web site</i>. People in the pornography industry are usually deliberately unverifiable by their own choice, for obvious reasons, and this person appears to be no exception. The purported biographies that accompany pornographic pictures are usually fiction, moreover.

<ul>
<li>Obviously this is a broader subject than just this AfD, but fictional characters are verifiable in that we know what books/movies/etc. they're in, there's often published criticism concerning them, essays about them, etc. What's kind problematic here is that there's really nothing verifiably known about this person other than that she's been filmed having sex 35 times. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:58, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indescriminate collection of information though, obviously. Biographies are written on verifiable information... it's just hard to see what's going to be verifiable here other than the contents of her IMDB page, that's what I meant.

<li>As <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> points out, the fictional characters for which we have biographies <i>have independent secondary source material available</i>, such as third-party annotations of or commentaries on the works of fiction concerned.

<li>I actually wrote "independent secondary source material". Ironically, the "proof" that you've offered is proof of my point. You've hyperlinked to a list of products for sale in a catalogue that contains no biographical information whatsoever and an on-line biography every field of which apart from the birthdate, ethnicity, and hair colour is "No data" — giving as much information about this person as a driving licence or a passport, as I said.

Also if the article is correct, she is not American born. We know that some editors have raised a bias issue with articles of foreign subjects.

<p>Reason why the page should be deleted I noted the discussion page for this entry on the 22nd May with the view that it was an invention. I invited verification from the author. None has been forthcoming. I therefore conclude that whoever wrote the page has no interest in defending its legitimacy and so the page should be deleted unless, at this eleventh hour, proper verification is forthcoming. -<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 7 July 2005 18:14 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Interestingly:
<ul>
<li>The article tells us that <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiberius_Junius_Brutus_f9c1.html" title="Tiberius Junius Brutus">Tiberius Junius Brutus</a> "was the younger son of Lucius Junius Brutus", "rebelled against his father's wishes along with his brother Titus Junius Brutus", and "aided [...] Lucius Tarquinius Superbus in attempting to reclaim the Roman throne"; that "Tiberius and Titus were captured and brought before the embryonic Senate of Rome", and "brought to trial"; and that "Lucius Brutus called for their execution, and they were beheaded".</li>
<li>The nominator, in the aforementioned talk page tells us that "LJB was killed in battle having killed his two sons", which does not contradict what the article actually says.</li>
<li>The entry for <b>Brutus, L. Junius</b> in <i>L'Emprière's</i> tells us that "His sons conspired with the Tuscan ambassador to restore the Tarquins; and when discovered, they were tried and condemned before their father, who himself attended at their execution.", and cites several sources, albeit in the almost undecipherable manner that the constraints of paper cause to be used.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucius_Junius_Brutus_3f2e.html" title="Lucius Junius Brutus">Lucius Junius Brutus</a> also discusses the tale of his execution of his sons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even though I cannot immediately verify the <i>name</i> of the son, and even though the story may be an outright creation of Roman historians, this <i>is</i> the story as apparently related by Roman historians (albeit reported in a little more detail than reported in <i>L'Emprière's</i>). The major thing that worries me is that the original version of the article has the tell-tale signs of a copyright violation from a paper book. As long as that is not in fact the case, <b>Keep</b>, albeit possibly trimming any of the details given that are not verified either by the above or by direct reference to the histories written by Lavilius and <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livy.html" title="Livy">Livy</a> (whom the article <i>does</i> attribute information to). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:26, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. As dearly as I&#160;love a truly good hoax, this, alas, is not one of them. The story is substantially true <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.2.shtml#5" class="external text" title="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.2.shtml#5" rel="nofollow">(Livy ii.5)</a> and was commented on in Antiquity already. Very quickly, I&#160;also find it alluded to in passing by Claudian <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Claudian/De_IV_Consulatu_Honorii*.html#611" class="external text" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Claudian/De_IV_Consulatu_Honorii*.html#611" rel="nofollow">(IV&#160;Cons.&#160;Hon.&#160;611)</a> (and see the Loeb editor's note to the English translation there). I&#160;can also confirm the connection of Tiberius Brutus with the famous Brutus, both his father and the far later assassin of Caesar. I&#160;didn't check the details. Copyvio of course is another matter; I&#160;don't recognize it, if it is, but I'm not the world's best classicist. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 15:53, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I've found the same references as Bill (hi Bill, nice to see you here). I would however suggest a tweak.

<p>The result of the debate was a bit tricky, but I'll try closing this now. (Closing the first AFD debate was much easier, when there was a clear keep consensus.) On raw vote count there is not a real consensus for outright deletion, and the main objection has been that Wikipedia is not a memorial. I <i>believe</i> that the objection is to the list of names in the article. However, the article has a lead section which describes the recovery of bodies and treatment of the wounded, material which is not really covered by the "memorial" argument. I will therefore call this a <b>merge</b> of the lead section only to the "casualties" section of <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_July_2005_London_bombings_2280.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">7 July 2005 London bombings</a>, and redirect there. The list of names will be dropped, but I'll add the BBC News link to the main article as well. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:34, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't say anything about lists of casualties. It says "memorials". Whether lists of casualties are considered memorials depends mostly on their context, IMO. And I don't think in this case the context has anything to do with "honoring" anyone, thus I don't see this being a memorial. Of course as long as the policy is ambigiously worded, it will solely be a matter of opinion. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 00:42, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I basically agree. In the Kent State article the victims are mentioned within the text to help further explain the incident (that being said, I think the articles on the victims could be merged back in), while in this example it's just a list of names thrown together.

This looks to me lika an example of systemic bias: nobody is pressing for a list of Tsunami victims, after all. It is problematic, though, since the chances of a full list of casualties making it seem to increase as the number reduces, making it more likely that some minor incident will have a full list than would be the case for a major tragedy.

<li>I'm sorry but I must object to your statement. A list of the names of people who died in a notable event <i>is</i> more encyclopaedic than a list of names of people who did not die in a notable event. Is it encyclopedic enough to include in Wikipedia? Depends on the circumstances (see <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_State_shootings_f7ad.html" title="Kent State shootings">Kent State shootings</a>). Such rediculous equivocations are not helpful to the debate. Obviously there <i>is</i> a difference between this list and a list of everyone who ever died of cancer. The question is: does the difference matter enough to make it worth including in Wikipedia? <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 22:52, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

They make up 2% of the population and through their dispossesion and discrimination, both blatant and subtle, are an underclass of Australian society (stop me if this is getting difficult).

<p>Please delete this article. I am the one who wrote it. I spent several weeks researching the material and organizing it to come up with a barebones outline of an article. I fully intended to expand it but health problems intervened. I never once considered it a controversial subject but have since been accused of bad faith in its creation, my efforts belittled, and I have been lectured rather than asked for sources. In addition the page seems to have become somewhat of a magnet for those pursuing an opinionated rather than a scholarly approach to the subject. I would therefore ask that it be deleted.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <b>Do not redirect</b>. My reasons are on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_West_archive1_e405.html" title="Talk:American West/archive1">archived talk page</a> but here's a recap: The <i>American West</i> is the nearly universal name for this region in both academic works and the popular press—that's what most people will be looking for. The <i>American Old West</i> is not a region but a historical era occurring in the <i>American West</i> from about the Civil War through the 1890s. Most of the history of the <i>American West</i> occurred before and after those 30-40 years and continues to this day. Also, to imply, as the <i>Western United States</i> article does, that Hawaii is culturally and historically part of the <i>American West</i> and states like Texas through the Dakotas are not, is simply wrong. And I think there is plenty of evidence to back that up. Also, only with great difficulty can the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_West_b966.html" title="Category:American West">category system</a> for the <i>American West</i> article which has been built up over time by several contributors be transferred to the <i>Western United States</i> because the articles are defining two different regions using different criteria. I would redirect <i>Western United States</i> to <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_the_Western_United_States_dfb8.html" title="Geography of the Western United States">Geography of the Western United States</a> and dab that page. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 19:15, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just some notes: Texas and the Dakotas are include in the Western United States article, it's just noted that they are often consider part of the South and Midwest respectfully as well, and thus aren't always include in the West. Also the Geography of the Western United States, does not include Texas and the Dakotas at present. According to Naming conventions adopted by <a href="../../../u/s/r/WP%7EUSR_ad62.html" title="WP:USR">WikiProject U.S. regions</a>, the article should be located at Western United States, which is where the original U.S. West article was moved; all other regions with diretions in their names are located at -ern United States. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 19:24, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> this article should be included in the history of the American West. The modern West does NOT include states such as Texas. Not only is geography a distinction but culture and politics as well. In response to DailUp, yes, Hawaii is part of the MODERN West and culturally too. Hawaii has similar legislation, outlooks and demographics to other Western states. Texas is nothing at all like any modern Western states, if you include it in the present West I am prepared to NPOV for original research. Yes, historically Texas WAS part of the West, not anymore. Here are some reasons why: US Census does not include Texas, polls indicate major differences in cultural opinion between Texas and the majority of thr West, ie 48% of southerners against same-sex unions vs. 28% of westerners, Texas restricts the sale of sex toys (there is absolutely nothing like this in any modern western state, in fact Nevada allows prostitution), Texas had a ban on interracial marriage at the time of the 1967 Supreme Court ruling striking it down, no Western state had such a law. Texas TODAY is part of the South, plain and simple. Using your line of thinking we would have to include West Virginia in the American West, when in reality, yes, it was considered Western in the past but not today. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlobeism_e3ea.html" title="User:Globeism">Globeism</a> 20:13, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just for your illumination, fursuits aren't made with once-living ingredients. They're made with synthetic fur, or rarely, latex or fabric. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 17:00, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fursuits can be washed or cleaned in a variety of ways, but there is no special "Furshampoo". Contrary to popular belief, it's not always impossible to put fursuits into a washing machine; if you use a low temperature and put it on the "wool" setting, you should be OK most of the time, even though hand-washing is still better, of course. Laundry detergents or shampoo (no matter whether human or pet shampoo) should probably not be used, but Woollite can be; additionally, many people will use Febreze on their fursuits (although that is only a short-term solution when you can't wash a suit right away, of course). In any case, you should NEVER put a fursuit into a dryer, as the heat will damage the fur fibers; instead, gently wring it out and then hang it and let it dry. Hope this helps, in case you ever want to get a fursuit. ^_~ Oh, and BTW, as far as colour fastness is concerned, that really depends on the fur used. Regular fur that's bought from a store is probably safe in this regard, but if you dye yourself or use airbrush to put accents on the suit, then you probably shouldn't count on it. -- <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchneelocke_ee99.html" title="User:Schneelocke">Schnee</a> (<i><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchneelocke_54a1.html" title="User talk:Schneelocke">cheeks clone</a></i>) 22:33, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Real Group</b> This fraternity is a true organization created by myself and others at Penn State University. No we do not have national membership, but I do not see how this pertains to being notable enough for inclusion. We are not technically a "fraternity" which is why we do not have a national membership. We are a club who calls themselves a fraternity in order to portray the ideals of brotherhood and comradery that we believe in. There are hundreds of articles on this site which do not serve any purpose or have any realistic background and yet they remain. The reason they stay is that there is a demand for the information provided. This article was added recently (today) and is not yet completed with all of the information which we are attempting to portray to others. We are not technically a "fraternity", but we are however a recognized club at the University as are many other clubs ranging from "Halo lovers" to "People who have the name Mike." Yes our name is a play on words and is meant to be humorous, but this in no way discredits our organization or its goals. We developed the group as a place to interact with others at college.

This is not a joke. This is a true organization. Merging it into Penn State would simply have it get lost among the hundreds of articles and topics that are available there. Deleting it means that your idea of information is better than someone elses. Wikipedia is a place for people to find information. Free information. Who was the person that gave you the power to deem information unimportant and not independently notable 20 minutes after the first draft of text has been uploaded. If you feel the need to delete this page and feel that my attempt at educating people about our organization and efforts are not notable of inclusion in the world of wikipedia then fine. But at least give people like myself and others a chance to provide the information that is desired before attacking us with these deletion attempts. If after this you still feel that my page does not deserve to be placed on wikipedia alongside articles dealing with "credible" information such as the detailed inner workings of a blaster rifle from star wars or other such pages that <i>specifically state that their information is fictional</i> then fine. I have no control over what you do. But if fictional information and hoaxes are what you are after, then I suggest you look elsewhere because I am only concerned with informing people about our organization. --Cousin

And as for the topic of notability, many things are not notable. An apple is just an apple, nothing too notable there yet it gets quite a lengthy page for itself (probably not done in the first 10 minutes of its creation either). You "Wikipedians" may need to choose some new terms in order to argue for the deletion of pages.

Thanks to an apparent unrelenting stream of people sitting at home with nothing better to do than worry about whether or not my organization is real, I'm taking down the information for both of my entries so far. Feel free to do whatever you like. Delete the entries through whatever process necessary. However please remember that patience is a virtue. In the future be more accepting of ideas and allow them a day or two to develop before tagging them for deletion. Verifiable does not just mean that you can Google it. There were times when things such as books, magazines, and newspapers determined what was verifiable. Apparently some of you have forgotten those days. Just because you can't find it in 5 minutes on a site like Google doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Just because some of you have no lives and apparently also have enormous sticks shoved in orifices I choose not to mention at this time does not mean that the rest of must suffer the pains of your scrutiny.

<dd>This VfD is not about an article on "how the historical jesus is different", the point is that the article implies it is the same, i.e. is essentially just a copy.</dd>

<li>I have no wish to defend the contents of this article - but the title is valid and quite distinct from those mentioned above. 'The Historical Jesus' is a regular academic title for Jesus reconstructions and even university courses - it is used by believers and revisionists alike (it asks what 'was Jesus really about' and may or may not conclude that this is the same as the NT's view). There is a whole history of scholarship here which could neutrally be recorded in an article. The question of the 'Historicity of Jesus' ('did he exist') is actually seldom debated in mainstream scholarship - and so to merge the mainstream into a peripheral discussion would be POV. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 12:22, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is the content which is being VFD'd. <i>Historicity</i> does not concern <i>did he exist</i> but <i>did he exist in the manner in which is described</i>, i.e. <i>did Jesus exist? and if not, was there someone by the same name?</i> <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 17:25, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>OK, this article is rubbish. It says it "presents a critical reconstruction of the Historical Jesus" - well that has no place in an encyclopaedia, as it will always be POV. What, IMHO, should be here is a record of the various critical reconstructions that scholarship has offered over the last 200 years. Not 'did Jesus exist?', but 'what kind of Jesus existed?'. I've simply been arguing that this title deserves an article. I understood Vfd was not the place for articles that had content problems, but for articles that shouldn't exist (that may be a moot point). If this is deleted, I'm willing to write/help a new scholarly article. If it is kept, I'll (help) re-write it - but either solution may take me some time. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 18:09, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> This is certainly no redundant fork. Important term widely used. Look at the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/103-9854268-8770260" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/103-9854268-8770260" rel="nofollow">number of books at Amazon.com</a> that have the term in the title.

<dd>The opening paragraph is good. <b>Childhood and family background</b> needs a lot more than just Biblical reference. One thing I know of is that there is some belief that "Doubting" Thomas was Jesus' twin. It should also mention his name was probably <i>Yeshua</i> (Joshua), but that "Jesus" derives from the Greek transcription "Iesou" (Greek having no equivalent of our "Y" sound, /j/ in IPA). It mentions this briefly toward the end, but this should really be at the beginning of the article. <b>Works and miracles</b> is a bit better about using extra-Biblical info (altho there's some stuff there that doesnt belong in that category). The last two sections are basiclly just rehashing the Biblical account without giving much outside info. Also, it mentions in passing the belief that Jesus was not a historical figure, but doesn't really expound upon it. Something else: I've heard that some scholars think that Nazareth was founded (I believe) around 70 BCE, therefore, as the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth.html" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a> article says, "Such historians argue that <i>Iesou Nazarene</i> was not 'from Nazareth', but rather that his title was '<a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazarene.html" title="Nazarene">Nazarene</a>.'" -<a href="../../../t/y/d/User%7ETydaj_1a42.html" title="User:Tydaj">Tydaj</a> 16:37, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Other stuff: The article opens, <i>"This article presents a critical reconstruction of the Historical Jesus, as based on the four canonical gospels. Other related articles present different descriptions and perspectives of Jesus.</i> The problem is that it should include other material and perspectives than orthodox Christian (whatever <i>that</i> is). Does anybody know where these supposed other articles are? Perhaps a merge may be in order -<a href="../../../t/y/d/User%7ETydaj_1a42.html" title="User:Tydaj">Tydaj</a> 16:48, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Basically, that is my point - the article explicitely states it "presents a critical reconstruction of the Historical Jesus, as based on the four canonical gospels". I.e. is a POV fork of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_view_on_Jesus%27_life_d81a.html" title="New Testament view on Jesus' life">New Testament view on Jesus' life</a>.</li>

<dd>Hmm, after looking at all the other articles I see what you mean. I don't know much about scholarly approaches to the figure of Jesus, so if the term <i>Historical Jesus</i> really is important, then it should probably be mentioned in <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a>.

<li><b>Merge</b> whatever really is historical to <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and <b>Redirect</b>.

<li><b>Rename</b> to <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_of_Jesus_9ad8.html" title="Life of Jesus">Life of Jesus</a> or similar.

<li><b>Rewrite and Cite</b> - <i><b>There are absolutely no sources cited</b></i>, and this article, in my opinion, needs to present more viewpoints of prominent scholars before it can claim to be "The" Historical Jesus.

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> I'd prefer the article to provide a disclaimer at the top and more-or-less outline what the term means and the disputes surrounding precisely who the historical Jesus <i>is</i>. It might also do well to point out "historical Jesus" is usually contrasted with "Biblical Jesus" and the two agree on such-and-such a point and disagree on such-and-such a point, etc. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmicuspublilius_c81e.html" title="User:Amicuspublilius">Amicuspublilius</a> 23:05, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and keep working on it. "The New Testament View of Jesus" necessarily reflects a Christian point of view (if there are different ways Christians interpret the NT, those different interpretations should be provided). But there are many critical historians and Bible scholars who believe that Jesus existed, draw on the NT as a source, but do a considerable amount of reinterpreting and reconstruction based on their rejection of the supernatural element, and their use of techniques of comparative literature, Biblical archeology, etc. We need an article that represents this important body of scholarship. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:08, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not nonsense, but very poor quality. Only contribution by an anonymous user.

<dd>I have to take issue with some of your google hits. <i>Victim "36 Crazyfists"</i> get alot of googles, but it appears most are not about the song. "Victim" appears in the name of many other bands that are listed on the same page as 36 Crazyfists in these hits. I see nothing notable about any of these songs, and I hate it when someone decides to write godawful articles on each and every song by their favorite band. These should still be deleted, even if not speedily. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:13, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's true, and that really can't be helped. In that one case, I think we can assume that it's the same as the other songs on that (rare) album. Keep in mind we're talking about the songs from a rare, early album from a (now) fairly well published band. I think redirection is the way to go for this. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 23:20, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. There are perhaps millions of songs in existence; I do not think it is in the best interests of wikipedia to have articles, or even redirects, on the vast majority of them. I'm sure there is at least one other insignificant song named "Victim", for instance, out there somewhere, and I'd rather not give special treatment to 36 Crazyfists by having a redirect for their version. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:42, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Harmil, I thank you for consulting me on this VfD via my talk page, but I still feel that this artist just isn't that important. I agree with R. fiend's thoughts on song articles, and I feel that perhaps it would be a good idea to move them into one article, but I need further proof that this band is worthy of an article, otherwise I'll just vote it deleted. I think you should go ahead and make the article, and if you prove that it is worthy, it won't get deleted. I'm kinda torn on this one, sorry. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity"><b>my</b></a><a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysekurity_22b6.html" title="User talk:Mysekurity">sekurity</a> 01:03, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As to the redirect: I think most of these song titles are common enough that they'd need disambiguation. For instance, <i>Clone</i> is by <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avail.html" title="Avail">Avail</a> (see <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_%28album%29.html" title="Dixie (album)">Dixie (album)</a>, <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who%27s_Next_a395.html" title="Who's Next">Who's Next</a>?</i> is a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a> album, <i>Victim</i> is by <a href="../../../g/z/a/GZA_59c1.html" title="GZA">GZA</a>, <i>In the skin</i> is a reasonable mistake for <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a>'s <i>In this skin</i>, <i>Daydreams</i> by <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Crawford_97ac.html" title="Johnny Crawford">Johnny Crawford</a>, <i>Voices</i> by <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disturbed.html" title="Disturbed">Disturbed</a> (currently links to Voices (song), spuriously), <i>The box</i> by <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_%28band%29.html" title="Orbital (band)">Orbital</a>, <i>Wake up</i> by <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Days_Grace_b388.html" title="Three Days Grace">Three Days Grace</a>, <i>The truth</i> by <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Charlotte_7c04.html" title="Good Charlotte">Good Charlotte</a>, and <i>Represent</i> by <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chingy.html" title="Chingy">Chingy</a>. Some of the song titles are probably unique, but I don't want to spend the time to find out which and even when that's done they won't remain unique forever. <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard">LizardWizard</a> 02:27, July 11, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Great, and good job with that research. I'm all for changing some of the redirects to be or point to disambig pages later. I'm only recommending redirects to the bands as a first-pass, which I think is a good start (see my suggestion for Voices (song) which has already had its info moved to the disambig page <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice.html" title="Voice">Voice</a>). -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 16:18, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b> per Harmil. If anyone thinks the band(s) aren't notable, VfD the bands.

<li>It's not about the bands being notable (we have a very low bar for bands, you may have noticed), it's about these songs. LizardWizard has pointed out the problem with unilaterally redirecting these to a minor band like 36 Crazyfists when many other bands have songs with the same name. And even if they didn't, I don't think there's a single other band on wikipedia that has article or redirects for every one of their songs, as we're on the way to doing for this band because of a single fanboy. If 36 Crazyfists has any "hits" that are somewhat noteworthy we can address those separately, but this is ridiculous. Shall I turn <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Nervous_System_be63.html" title="Central Nervous System">Central Nervous System</a> into a disambiguation page because its also the name of a song by <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Fish_b4c6.html" title="Citizen Fish">Citizen Fish</a>? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:49, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Nope, but an italized sentence at the top of the nervous system article wouldn't be a bad idea. If a band is notable enough to reside here, then, presumably, it is possible that any user might search for any of their songs. A user-friendly Wiki should accomodate these searches <i>to the extent practicable.</i> Massive disambiguation pages for common nouns isn't practical, but sending off redirects when they come to our attention seems practical to me. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:21, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personally, I think that's an awful idea. "Notable enough for wikipedia" isn't necesarily terribly notable; we potentially have an article by every band that's ever released some sort of album. That's thousands and thousands of songs, many of which are common words, terms, things, people, etc. Implementing your plan would have thousands of articles with useless headers at the top, so the first thing the reader sees when looking up a significant topic is that some band from the 70's whom no one's ever heard of had a song with that name (is <i>that</i> what you were looking for? no? Just thought we'd ask.). As no articles exist on such songs, just redirects, there's no real information to go to. In the Central Nervous System example I gave, we're talking about a rather insignificant song by what not one of the world's premier bands (great band though they are). No one who doesn't already know the song is going to search for it (it's not as if it gets radio play), so they won't gain any information out of it. While wikipedia should be (and basically is) a good resource for music topics, it is not, and should not be, a "who's that song by again?" reference. We should instead have full articles on important songs. Many headers you propose would in fact have a list of a dozen or more bands who had songs with the same name, which would particularly interfere with the article. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:55, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right, well, as I said, I'd impose a reasonableness test regarding practicality in cases where there were an inordinate number of songs with similar names or common names. I'm no music fan, generally, but if I looked up "Central Nervous System", I might be mildly amused/marginally enriched by learning about a song I'd never dream of. Such has happened before with the song about <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_K._Polk_65bc.html" title="James K. Polk">James K. Polk</a> written by <a href="../../../t/h/e/They_Might_Be_Giants_e0f7.html" title="They Might Be Giants">They Might Be Giants</a>. I still have little idea who this band is, but I continue to chuckle that they wrote a song about our dour 11th President. In any case, little headers at the top of articles are hardly disruptive; if you have no interest, they are very easy to ignore. I suppose I support any knowledge-connections that aren't too cumbersome. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:17, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where there are many songs with the same title, here's a possible solution. Imagine there are 50 songs named <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html" title="Highway">Highway</a> -- at the top of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html" title="Highway">Highway</a> article, one italicized sentence could read, <i>There are also many songs with this title. For more information, see...</i> and this could link to a song disambig page. Readers who cared would have a full list, others could easily ignore the one line. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It might be interesting to some, but its encyclopedic value is dubious, at best. And we are not here to "mildly amuse", but to mildly educate. It might not be terribly disrputive to have a header that Central Nervous System is a song by Citizen Fish, but wikipedia does have some first impression issues, and when that's the first thing someone reads when searching for that topic, it doesn't really help. Sure, it's interesting that They Might Be Giants have a song called <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_K._Polk_65bc.html" title="James K. Polk">James K. Polk</a> (and they're a pretty good band, give them a listen sometime) but I was still quite pleased to see there was no header on the President's page stating that fact; far down in the "trivia" section is much better. On a completley different note, now that we have mentioned our 11th President, I am hoping to get him official recognition as "America's <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullet_%28haircut%29.html" title="Mullet (haircut)">Mullet</a> President". I hope you all endorse this. I'm thinking of making some T-shirts. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 02:40, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I think that the topic is an interesting one, and considering the fact that before WWII one sixth of all Jews in the world were Polish, I'd say this deserves its own page. That said, the "article" as it now stands is woefully low on information and seems to be more a thought that hits someone one day than an academic encyclopedia article. Nevertheless I'm strongly in favor of keeping the page so that six months hence there will be a fine article on the subject here. - mnuez <small>Edit by 208.54.14.65</small></li>

It is also true that anti-Semitic statements in public and in private are still more common in modern Poland than they are in most other European countries. However, <i>this</i> article is beyond repair. Apart from the fact that much of the information is inaccurate or simply incorrect (such as the claims about the presence of anti-Semitic cartoons in the mainstream press, attacks against synagogues - which are paradoxically rarer in Poland than in other countries where verbal anti-Semitism is tolerated less, the "deportation" of Jews in 1968). Other portions are deliberately vague to create a false impression in the reader (such <i>"anti-Semitism in Poland as has a long history", "Persecution of Jews took place both before, during and after the Second World War", "During the war many Poles actively took part in the Holocaust"</i>). It is fairly obvious that this article was created in response to the ongoing VFD against <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Polonism_d987.html" title="Anti-Polonism">Anti-Polonism</a>, and thus constitutes a clear violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Let there be no mistake, the history of anti-Semitism in Poland certainly warrants a proper article. I am actually surprised that this prominent topic has not been covered yet. However, if one extracts the useful stuff from this drivel of simplifications and accusations, much too little will be left to justify an article. If no one comes up with any text that does more justice to this complex matter within the usual deadline, it's better to delete the article altogether for the time being. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 10:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Another update: When changing my vote from strong delete to conditional keep I was not aware that Piotrus's text was not original but duplicated material from other articles. I appreciate Piotrus's effort at improving this article, but I think there is a case for a seperate article on anti-Semitism in Poland only if redundancy with articles such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Jews_in_Poland_a097.html" title="History of Jews in Poland">History of Jews in Poland</a> is kept to a minimum. In modern Poland, anti-Semitism exists even in the absence of any major Jewish population group - it focuses on "imaginary" Jews in Poland and alleged anti-Polish lobbying by Jews outside Poland. Thus, it is possible and to some extent even necessary to deal with this sociological phenomenon outside the article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Jews_in_Poland_a097.html" title="History of Jews in Poland">History of Jews in Poland</a>. However, as long as the article remains a) strongly POV or b) strongly redundant with other articles, I change my vote back to <b>delete</b>. Sorry for adding to the confusion. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 20:03, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, I could certainly do that. However, I won't do so for two reasons: Any reasonable editing is likely to be immediately reverted by POV pushers from either side who are attracted to such articles like moths to a light bulb... Apart from that, as I said above, the non-POV substance of the article would hardly even reach the stub threshold: <i>"Anti-Semitism in Poland exists. After the end of World War II [it was] [...] used at certain moments by communist party or individual politicians in order to achieve their [...] political goals."</i> I think we all agree that this would not really be worth keeping. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 22:08, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

This subject is valid, but need not be discussed separately from Jewish Polish history. If that article gets too big, the solution is to break it up by dates, not by extracting one aspect as though it were somehow independent from the rest of Jewish history in the various incarnations of Poland.

<li>Treat my vote as <b>Delete</b> unless material is removed from main Anti-Semitism article, then <b>Keep</b>. The article was blatantly POVed, but I fixed it by replacing it by (much more extensive and sourced) text from relevant sections on Anti-Semitism page. Note that this means I deleted all the old content - as many said, it was beyong salvage. For long time there have been discussions at Talk:Anti-Semitism to create such a subarticle(s) and move national anti-semitic material there - this is a good start. I see it as a subarticle to Anti-Semitism. It should be part of the series of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_Germany_45a0.html" title="Anti-Semitism in Germany">Anti-Semitism in Germany</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_France_48eb.html" title="Anti-Semitism in France">Anti-Semitism in France</a>, Anti-Semitism in Italy, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_United_States_7322.html" title="Anti-Semitism in United States">Anti-Semitism in United States</a>, etc - but it should not exists separately.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The VfD tag says explicitly that "<i>You are welcome to edit this article</i>." The major rewrite that Piotrus executed solves problems raised by <b>nine</b> delete votes (so far) (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Semitism_in_Poland&amp;diff=18661473&amp;oldid=18661434" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Semitism_in_Poland&amp;diff=18661473&amp;oldid=18661434" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Wouldn't it be hypocritical to vote delete on account of severe POV, yet revert the article when the POV is fixed? On numerous occasions, VfDs were the cause of <i>major</i> improvement to articles during the VfD. Many times, those improvements caused the articles to be salvaged, having caused many to change their votes.

<li>Again, why do you want to create a <b>redundant</b> article thus creating a <b>precedence</b> for A-S + specific country? Look at the bigger picture and compare how A-S and the Holocaust-era past issues are being handled in specific country articles e.g. <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_Antonescu_4145.html" title="Ion Antonescu">Romania</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Austria_ab36.html" title="History of Austria">Austria</a>, etc. I would think that these countries, as major collaborators during <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html#Collaborators" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, would deserve more of your and similarly-minded editors' attention. --<a href="../../../t/t/y/User%7ETtyre_65d2.html" title="User:Ttyre">Ttyre</a> 18:36, 12 July 2005 (UTC)--<a href="../../../t/t/y/User%7ETtyre_65d2.html" title="User:Ttyre">Ttyre</a> 18:36, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I don't have much of a problem with creating such a precedent. This would allow sections on A-S by country (which would otherwise <b>needlessly elongate</b> the main <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> article) to have their own articles. I didn't start this article, but, now that it's here, why not use it as a precedent for streamlining the current main A-S article? As Piotr wrote, "<i>It should be part of the series of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_Germany_45a0.html" title="Anti-Semitism in Germany">Anti-Semitism in Germany</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_France_48eb.html" title="Anti-Semitism in France">Anti-Semitism in France</a>, Anti-Semitism in Italy, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_United_States_7322.html" title="Anti-Semitism in United States">Anti-Semitism in United States</a>, etc</i>." And, by the way, I haven't cast a vote yet; I'm currently undecided about whether this is the time to move info from the main A-S article to individual articles. My comment wasn't a call to keep the article, per-se. It was a call to retain the integrity of the VfD, which I believe you have been compromising. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 22:07, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's a very important subject. However, both sides of the edit war clearly don't have a clue about anti-Semitism in 20th/21st century Poland. There are many disturbing things in longer version's description of pre-20th century events. It uses mostly secondary sources and an almost exclusively focuses on anti-Semitic events to the exclusion of background information. It doesn't look like an article written in good faith. Where's the information about Jewish position in the social structure of the First Republic, about the situations of other faiths in it, about Jewish involvement in socialist and communist movement, the conflict between the socialists/communists and Polish nationalists which fed early 20th-century anti-Semitism, about anti-Jewish pogroms in czarist Russia which also spread to occupied Poland, about situation of other minorities in the Second Republic, cooperation of Jews in occupied Poland with the Soviet government, about involvement of many usually "anti-Semitic" nationalists in anti-Holocaust activities, and about usage of word "Żyd" to mean "member of the leftist/liberal conspiracy" by the modern nationalists (that's why asking people questions on anti-Semitism in Poland is futile - the nationalists believe they're answering different question than one the inquirer believes he's asking)&#160;? It's a horrible article. I, for one, don't think it's possible to write a good article on the subject alone, while leaving the background information elsewhere. Therefore I'm strongly for <b>deleting</b> the article and redirecting to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a>. <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETaw_8bc0.html" title="User:Taw">Taw</a> 08:44, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

However, while <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> provides a good summary of anti-Semitism in Poland, it doesn't really get into background and underlying dynamics, which you have said are important. It also doesn't get into the controversies regarding the extent of and reasons for anti-Semitism. I think that, theoretically (at least), this article would be necessary for a more thorough analysis of this topic. However, as Piotr mentioned, someone should be willing to work on this article.

<li>Let's try to stay civil, Ttyre. The frequency of anti-Semitic incidents is not the only standard by which to measure the problem. Statistics are rarely a reliable basis for comparisons, too many variables interfere, such as what is defined and gets reported as an "anti-Semitic incident"; also not only the overall size of the population is a factor, but also the number of Jewish citizens, Jewish institutions etc. Also, the past is of equal importance as the present. There can be no serious doubt that Poland, up to WW II a multi-ethnic country with a huge portion of Jews with a distinct ethnic identity, was also more burdened with ethnic conflict, including but not limited to Polish-Jewish conflict, than ethnically homogenous countries in the west. The semi-truth of the <i>żydokomuna</i> is very much a Polish issue, the events of 1968 are quite unparalleled, and until today conspiracy theories involving real or imaginary Jews thrive better in Poland than in many other countries - most recently in response to the Jedwabne affair. Of course, most accusations of past and present anti-Semitism in Poland stubbornly ignore its specific context, are unbearably complacent and often attempts of absolving oneself of one's "own" anti-Semitism. The original version of the article we are or should be discussing here is a textbook example of this. On the other hand, though, nervously attacking anyone who merely mentions anti-Semitism in Poland with hip-fired accusations of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Polonism_d987.html" title="Anti-Polonism">anti-Polonism</a> isn't at all better - in fact, the concept of anti-Polonism suffers the very same defects as the concept of anti-Semitism. Plus, like it or not, few people outside Poland care to take it seriously, so complaints about anti-Polonism can backfire badly. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 23:57, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

On one hand, something that came out of writing the article is that it is clear that Poland is often unfairly blamed for being much more anti-semitic than it was for much of its history, especially before the 19th century. On the other hand, it is also clear that there is a historical thread of severe anti-semitism from the 1920s-1930s through at least the 1970s in Poland (and, as recent surveys indicate, probably until today), and that discussion of this topic is often difficult. I think that the current <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> page does a good job dealing with many of these issues, but that, as both a history article and a long one at that, it does not delve into the subject in much depth outside of the chronology of events, which does a disservice to both the Polish history of tolerance and the persecutions of Polish Jews when they did happen. Thus, I would suggest that we turn this page into a subpage of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> dealing specifically with the issue of anti-semitism in Polish history. I would hope that we could develop an article here that would neither bash Poland nor deny anti-semitic threads in recent Polish history. That may be too much to hope for, but deleting the article seems to beg the question, no matter what perspective you may have on the topic. At least this article creates a good place to discuss both the myths and the facts, rather than denying that this issue is not one of curiosity and importance to many people. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 02:32, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article's special nature, deals with an atypical problem. Jews were afforded comforts by the rulers of Poland, but most of the Christian citizens did not enjoy this relationship between them. When Jews were going around the world to proclaim their own pain in reference to the Holocaust, Poles felt left out and anti-Semitism rose by clear margins. Whilst Christian Poles were treated somewhat different from the Jews by the Nazis, the rest of the world did not know the background to German-Polish violence. I have a feeling that the naysayers of this vote are tied to the page here: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anti-Polonism_cfd1.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-Polonism">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-Polonism</a> Is it true, that none of you care about the Poles but are frothing at the mouth to feel pity for the Jews?

<p><b>Delete</b>. This appears to be fanfic.

<li><b>Delete</b> this, but a real article should probably exist about the use of the term "first mate". The previous redirect to <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_officer.html" title="Executive officer">executive officer</a> wasn't bad, but it appears the article doesn't even mention "first mate" in it, which it should as the redirect's subject. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:04, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Cleanup and Redirect</b>. The article stub is not of a webcomic (although it does mention one), it is of an adventure game. It definately needs work, granted. It should be redirected, IMO, because "Inherit the Earth" is far too ambiguous of a page title. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> 23:26, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hmm, I don't know what a game must've done to be included in Wikipedia. There are tons of articles about open source games that obviously don't are a commercial success, and it's not easy to determine if they are a success in general.. At least this game made quite an impact in the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry.html" title="Furry">Furry</a> community, that's where I know the game from.

<li><b>Keep</b> — I won't go as far to list every Wikipedia article of games that "weren't commercial successful", that would be a sisyphean task.
