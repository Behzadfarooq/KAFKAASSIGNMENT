<dd>Not being a Sydneysider myself, my knowledge of the stereotypes that one part of the city has for the other are going to be slim at best.

<li><b>Comment</b> I can't be much clearer. When one part of Sydney's name calling war was deleted it created a NPOV problem. The war was determined to be caused by Sydney's Parochialism. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 04:29, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In that case, perhaps <i>all</i> the parts of the war should go, particularly if they aren't all equally notable. Another alternative would be to subsume all the constituent parts into one article (such as this one), so that everything can be in the one place rather than risking deletion for non-notability or other reasons when it's split off into separate articles. A third alternative, particularly if there's some overarching need to have this particular article here, would be to add more sources to this one. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:06, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The idea that the deletion of Easties caused a NPOV problem can only come from a misunderstanding of the NPOV policy, and so should not be mentioned in this discussion. Having said that, I did agree previously that the material that WikiCats and Richard are trying to cover in this article could make a good article if well researched. However, I think it would be better as a section of a cleaned up <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Sydney_3782.html" title="Culture of Sydney">Culture of Sydney</a> than in this form.

<dd>That article isn't and shouldn't be simply about multiculturalism or people getting along with each other. Any information worth having one these subcultures and stereotypes also should be talked about simply as a name calling war, but in a broader context. The Regions in Sydney suggestion from Capitalistroadster is another place where this might be covered in a broader context, but trying to only describe some "name calling war" is not helping anything. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 11:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Why would Wikipedia benefit from an article that is more or less going to be a class, ethnic and political battleground?

<p>Other articles similar to this one, such as Westies, should also be deleted. Slang terms to represent petty class, ethnic and political differences in Sydney do not need articles dedicated to them. Such an article will be based on biased sources (the primary source at the moment is from an online opinion column) and will also be succeptible to easy manipulation by those who want to discredit other groups. Article neutrality can't be claimed when the sources are opinionated.</p>
<p>I don't want to think about how poor an article on parochialism in my home city would be. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 04:52, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This style of parochialism seems largely unique to Sydney and is well documented. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 11:51, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm still not sold on this "well documented" idea. The links provided on the article mention the general <i>concept</i> of parochialism in Sydney (so we know it exists, but nothing more). Failing that, the ones which actually identify more about the phenomenon are blogs and the like, which are questionable sources. It might be my Historian Hat talking here, but for something to be "well documented", there really should be more neutral sources talking about how the different parts of the city are viewed or perceived. This is the sort of thing I'd imagine a sociologist would have written something on, for example. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 12:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for acknowledging that parochialism in Sydney exists. There's one blog to demonstrate usage.

<dd>Your sources are by no means reputable or "well documented". Two of them are opinion peices, two are simply small dictionary entries (if anywhere on Wikimedia, the slang terms should be on Wiktionary, not Wikipedia), and in one case, a comment replying to a blog post. Another speaks of the non-existence of 'parochialism in Sydney'. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 13:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
