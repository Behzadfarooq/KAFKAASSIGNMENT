<li>A quick glance shows that the notice in the Guardian and New York Times articles is just that: a notice. It's a list of webpages related to fan fiction and this site is on the list, neither more nor less important than most of the others.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a notable website within the fanfiction and livejournal community. It predates fanfiction.net itself, is the father of fanfiction snarking (once a niche in the Internet, now a common occurrence), and has been mentioned in numerous publications both on and off the web. Wikipedia has articles on communities that were arguably inspired by, or are outright 'spin-offs' from GAFF. It fully deserves an article of its own. There is no logical reason to delete it - not being personally interested in the subject matter is not a logical reason. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.177.168.160 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.177.168.160_ff1e.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.177.168.160">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The "attack" concept is misguided. The point of the site is to allow people healthy release so that when they do give criticism to authors, it's constructive rather than destructive. Telling authors that their work is being attacked on GAFF is frowned upon by the community. In addition, it has moved more into a "general" discussion forum for other things that could be godawful (websites, movies, novels, popular trends, etc.).Spotts1701 03:12, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Whatever else you think of it, GAFF IS an important piece of the history of 'fan fiction', as it was one of the first places of its kind. It deserves a place here. Ghost 05:29, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If you're going after "non-notable" articles, there are far more to start with than this one. Google and Alexa ratings are not the sole determination of whether something is worthy of study, especially when you don't use the right search queries for the job. As per your own guidelines, "There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia [...] Lack of fame is not the same as vanity." Aside from that, Squire seems to have a grudge. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 72.139.233.217 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.139.233.217_f5e5.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.139.233.217">contribs</a>) 11:54, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> You'd be surprised the kind of influence that site has had - both negative and positive - in a large section of the fanfiction subculture, notably and especially on the largest fanfiction archive on the net, FanFiction.Net itself. With thousands of members, though, most of whom have at least a cursory familiarity with fanfiction (if not actively reading and/or writing it on a frequent basis), that should not be surprising. Plus: it was actually reviewed in the New York Times (positively, I might add), as part of an article on fanfiction. A special mention in an article from the New York Times is not "merely being in the paper", I'd say.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lord Bob: you were labeled by one user as that precisely because you are letting your bias seep in - and rather obviously, at that, as it ("Also inaccurate, as it implies there's fan-fiction that isn't god-awful") was clearly an opinion, not fact. "Non-notable" is certainly up for debate, it seems, but "all fanfiction is godawful" is PURE opinion. Additionally, had you read the entire page in question, you would had noticed that it does not "imply" anything about the quality of fanfiction in general, it merely states that Godawful Fan Fiction was the first site dedicated to mocking badly-written fan fiction, and is a source of controversy in the fanfiction community. As such, I'd say it deserves a mention, if obscure comic books (such as Zodiac P.I.) deserve one. There are plenty of things that are less "notable" than the subject of this entry, and it seems to be quite balanced and neutral. Again - I vote keep, at least for now. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a></p>

<dd>It was a joke. If I thought that all fanfiction sites should be deleted, I'd have put <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanfiction.net.html" title="Fanfiction.net">fanfiction.net</a> up long ago. While stating such an opinion in serious form would be...stating an opinion...this was an obvious opportunity for light-hearted humour. I have in fact written bad Star Wars fan fiction in the past, for what <i>that's</i> worth. For that matter, even if I <i>did</i> hate all fanfiction, I'm not stupid enough to think that's a deletion criteria. I think <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> is stupid and I wouldn't vote to delete that. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 00:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I know that I personally only nominated this page because wikipedia is not a web directory. I certainly don't have any agenda against fan fiction. The only question at hand is whether and internet forum with 3,200 members deserves inclusion in an encyclopedia. If there were a consensus in favor of including such sites, I would not have nominated the article. I wouldn't have any problem with the page being turned into a redirect to fan fiction, as per Radiant. I also wouldn't have a problem with the page being merged into another article, if anything worthy of mention can be found. The problem is that almost all of the information, when sourced, is sourced to godawful fan fiction itself. I think UncleG summed it up pretty well in a recent comment on the talk page of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

</li>
<li>I've reconsidered this a bit, and while I'm not sure that an article on this subject has a place in Wikipedia, after considering what else is out there in Wikipedia I'd rather take the cautious route and <b>keep</b> the article, at least for now. I know that people want to remove "cruft" from Wikipedia, but if there are enough people who find the article useful, we ought to be careful about our decision. And plus, I'd think that if there can be an article on each and every Pokemon, then we can be pretty liberal about what we let in Wikipedia, as long as the articles are well sourced and not vanity. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoIdeaNick_49e4.html" title="User:NoIdeaNick">NoIdeaNick</a> 22:28, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Most of the reasons given against it are assinine and even goes against Wiki's standards.
