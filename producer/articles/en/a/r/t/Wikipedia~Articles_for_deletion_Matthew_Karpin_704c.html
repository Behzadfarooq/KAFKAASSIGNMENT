<li><b>Delete.</b> While sometimes it is acceptable for notable persons to write articles on themselves, Matthew Karpin is not notable. He has published only one (fairly unpopular) book according to Amazon.com. Google books returns <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;q=%22Matthew%20Karpin%22&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;q=%22Matthew%20Karpin%22&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" rel="nofollow">no results</a> in a search for his name. Per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, this author is non-notable.

<li><b>Don't delete</b>: There are 18 works, and 5 reviews, as listed in the Austlit database--the comprehensive reference source for Australian literature. (Are you all aware of this database? Perhaps not, which tends to indicate a super-power myopia.) Reviews are in reputable newspapers and journals, including The Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian, Southerly, and The Courier Mail. Amazon.com is not a good test for Australian notability. Thomas Keneally is a successful author in the sense of being bankable, but in Australian writing he is not the cultural high point. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jmeevans (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmeevans_8efa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmeevans">contribs</a>).</small> <small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FMatthew_Karpin&amp;diff=81170171&amp;oldid=81152497" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FMatthew_Karpin&amp;diff=81170171&amp;oldid=81152497" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

Lupo, I don't want to quarrel with you, really. You seem like a very nice person, even thanking me for correcting your inaccuracy--and also helping me by telling me how to sign my article. However, you're being a little obtuse, aren't you, in creating some magical boundary between commentary in your encyclopedia concerning schools and that concerning literature? The point, of course, is that the encylopedia--which should probably really be called a compendium--is stacked full of trivia. A very arbitrary browse would tell anyone that that is the case. Why would I want to enter a debate about tightening up <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria? I also would have no interest in sticking a tag on the trivia I find. It seems to me inseparable from what this encyclopedia does--as well as providing information about important issues. It seems that none of the people who have said "delete" have any expertise in the field of Australian literature at all--perhaps no expertise in any literary field. I don't really know. It even seems that no one was aware of the significance, when it comes to considering whether or not to delete this item, of the Austlit database--a not-for-profit organisation, unlike Google and Amazon.com., which one of you at least immediately turned to. However, no one has said Austlit should be considered the most reliable source. It's been remarked that to access the database you have to pay; but if Wikipedia can't pay to see the best information to support its decisions then it is even more removed from expertise than otherwise. The group who have responded to the article by saying delete strike me as at best punters, with a general understanding--annoyed at someone not using the editing process correctly; and, at worst, a gang, arrogantly backing each other up rather than trying to think about the material objectively. Finally, there is a real paucity of entries on Australian writers in your encyclopedia, but no shortage at all of American writers--many of whom I have never heard of before and never will again. Of course this reflects on the people who have taken the time; but it also reflects what this encyclopedia is: seriously biased towards the US, at least in this comparison. Such bias is the responsibility of everyone to correct. I do tell my students, when they quote from Wikipedia, that it is academically regarded as an unreliable reference source. I am not saying this to be contrary. This is a real criticism and something you should all be aware of. But you will make your decision sooner of later no matter what I say. ~~~~<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jmeevans (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmeevans_8efa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmeevans">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>By the way, doesn't Matthew Karpin fulfil this criteria in WP Bio: "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work"? And please note that the article has been considerably revised. ~~~~<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jmeevans (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmeevans_8efa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmeevans">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Wikipedia itself is not for profit. Therefore, unless an editor on this site wants to shell out some money, Wikipedians cannot see the Austlit list. Even if an editor did pay to access the list, not everyone can. Therefore, it will be unverifiable, because most people will not be able to see it in order to verify it. American and Australian writers are held to the same standards. American authors must have books that are reasonably popular, and unless their book sells a million copies and is talked about in the press frequently, they must publish multiple, well-selling books. Where are your <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable, third party sources</a>, verifying that Matthew has won <i>multiple</i> awards or has been reviewed <i>multiple</i> times? By the way, Google <i>certainly</i> is international in its coverage. If I can find boatloads of information on <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonian</a> writers, why wouldn't I be able to find a lot of information on an English-speaking Australian writer? All of the editors here have taken independent, objective looks into the article as well as magazines, web searches, online lists, Google Books (which, incidentally, has novels by Estonian writers...), and news archives. Please do not insult or degrade us; we have been extremely <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> towards you, especially considering some of your accusations. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 16:14, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>15 October Don't delete. Entry is useful and informative about a published author with two books from quality publishers, short story in Best Australian Short Stories (2004) .

<p><b>Don't delete</b>. What's the problem guys? Even if Karpin himself did create the original article and then got a friend? to resubmit it under a different name it's obvious the article is valuable in Wikipedia. The revised article clearly establishes a case to retain the information. (I've checked the austlit database, I have access and there are five reviews of Karpin's work in the herald, the Australian, Courire Mail and Southerley and another one, which are all very creditable pubs in Oz. Fulfils the multiple review crietera) I also see that the same author (jamievans) who revised the article created an article on the famous Australian writer Delia Falconer who hadn't been included before. This is all important stuff. Surely a big gap in Wikipedia, including references to the important mag Hermes. Important stuff. You guys are just ridiculous --Pop (Popallen)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Were you insulted? Dear oh dear. I don't think you should have been, any more than I should feel insulted. This is surely the argey bargey of debate. I'm trying to express this carefully, because I don't wish to offend: "Therefore it will be unverifiable" must be a special Wikipedian definition of veracity. The argument is: most people can't access the most significant of the databases in regard to this debate—only some can—therefore no one can verify the information. This is what we (you also have taken the liberty of claiming the collective) would call a fallacious argument. I can't imagine an argument of this sort standing up in any fair-minded forum. However, there is another fairly important point to make in response to Srose. The AustLit database is accessible via libraries in Australia for free—and I'm assuming this is the case with just about any library in the US (and most countries' major libraries). Obviously it may have to be organised at your end and would take a little extra time. You could probably do it through your personal computer at home. The argument that you have to pay to see the most relevant information is incorrect. The argument that Google provides the basis for Wikipedian information, at least in this case, and Australia's most academically authoritative source in this debate, the AustLit database, can't have a role, is surely demeaning to Wikipedia's relevance. Why not just rely on <i>Google</i> as your encyclopedia? (Jmeevans)</li>
