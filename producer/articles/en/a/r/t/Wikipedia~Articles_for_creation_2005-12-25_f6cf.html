<p>Servite High School is an all-boys Catholic high school in Anaheim, California. The school was founded in 1957, conducted by the Order of Friar Servants of Mary (Servites), an order that dates all the way back to 13th century Italy! It has an enrollment of 800 young men, from Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. Servite is best known for its rigorous academic curriculum, sports programs, fine arts, and its "four D's"; dedication, determination, discipline, and desire. Servite has over 6,400 graduates.</p>
<p>Servite's fine arts program has been taken to a whole new level since the arrival of Gregg Goodhart in the 2000-2001 school year. He has created its guitar program (one of the few high school guitar programs in the United States), which is recognized at a national level. Servite's Guitar Program offers beginning and advanced guitar classes. His students in his Advanced Guitar class have played several concerts, and have even played at the Guitar Ensemble Festival in Brownsville, Texas where they have won several awards. Most recently, Gregg Goodhart and his Advanced Guitar students have released a professionally-recorded Christmas CD of their music. What's truly amazing is, several of Mr. Goodhart's advanced guitarists, some of whom have won awards (at the Guitar Ensemble Festival) for their ability, had little or no guitar experience upon entering his beginning guitar class!</p>
<p>Servite's Athletics Program has won over 90 league championships, 3 State Championships, and 11 C.I.F. champtions. Servite competes in one of the toughest leagues around, the Serra League. Most recently (2005), Servite football won a league championship, the water polo team won both a League Championship and a C.I.F. Championship. And in 2004, the cross country team won State Championship!</p>

The musical won the 2006 Richard Rodgers Award. The second production (which premiered in July 2006) was <i>Rainy Day People</i> by Sean Keogh, about a writer in New York City struggling to find out what happiness is without the aid of love, sex, medication, or material wealth.</p>

<p>Image:http://www.caillaux.com/phpmyfamily/images/10086.jpgBorn 8am in Orleans France. Enginner and responsible for the design and construction of the Viaduct in Laval France.

<p>Joseph Caillaux, the son of Eugéne Caillaux, a conservative politician, was born in Le Mans, France, on 30th March, 1863. After obtaining a law degree in 1886 he joined the Finance Ministry as a deputy inspector.</p>
<p>Caillaux was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1898 and after acquiring a reputation as an expert on economic matters was appointed minister of finance in 1899, a post he held until 1902. He also served as minister of finance between 1906 and 1909. Caillaux introduced several important reforms but failed in his attempt to establish an income tax system.</p>
<p>On 27th June, 1911, Caillaux was appointed prime minister. While holding this position he upset a large number of people in France by making territorial concessions to the German colony of Cameroon. Caillaux, who was attempting to prevent a war over Morocco, was forced to resign over the issue in January 1912.</p>
<p>Caillaux was accused of being a pacifist in 1913 when he opposed an extension to conscription. This resulting in a press campaign against Caillaux. In 1914, Gaston Calmette, the editor of Le Figaro, threatened to publish love letters between Caillaux and his former mistress and now his second wife. This resulted in Madame Caillaux killing Calmette but at her trial she was acquitted of murder.</p>
<p>Caillaux, now a member of the Radical Party, was opposed to France's involvement in the First World War. Caillaux worked hard to achieve a negotiated peace. In November 1917 George Clemenceau became prime minister. He immediately clamped down on dissent and Caillaux and Louis Malvy, another senior politician opposed to the war, were both arrested for treason.</p>
<p>Caillaux was eventually tried in 1920. Although acquitted on the treason charge he was convicted of corresponding with Germany during the war and banished from France and deprived of his civil rights for ten years.</p>
<p>After an amnesty in July, 1924, Caillaux was appointed by Paul Painleve as his finance minister. He also served briefly in this post in 1935.</p>
<p>In 1938 Caillaux supported Edouard Daladier in his attempts to negotiate an agreement with Adolf Hitler. After the failure of appeasement he retired from politics and refused to become a member of the Vichy government. Joseph Caillaux died in Mamers on 22nd November, 1944.</p>

<p>This is the term for a close friend of a person (usually single) that "clears out" his/her house of questionable material before family members arrive in the event of a death or an accident. Usually, the porn buddy is given a key to access the premises and is told in greater detail of what things the friend wants disposed to avoid embarrassment of the person's lifestyle to other friends or family. This can include items such as black books, phone numbers, cell phones, magazines, deleting internet files and activity and sexual devices. The reason for having a porn buddy is for friends and family of the desceased to have better memories of him/her at their funeral or while visiting him/her in the hospital.</p>
