<li>That's a strange new meaning of the word "legitimate" I wasn't previously aware of. You could have simply deleted the material; instead, your edit summary for the deletion from <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bomb.html" title="Google bomb">Google bomb</a> read "Accomplished Googlebombs - move to own page)" Since you almost immediately put up that "own page" for deletion, it sure looked like a way to delete the section without raising suspicions. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 12:44, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a>'s method was a fairly standard and perfectly acceptable way to break an article section out into a stand-alone article.

<dd>This would be the case if there was a consensus that removing <i>this</i> information from the main article was the best way to tackle the length issue. As it is, there appears to be a consensus here that it should be merged back in: after that, a different method can be found to solve the length issue, such as splitting out a different section (if there's another one that could be split out), or simply editing the text down so that the same information is conveyed more concisely. However, the appropriate place to discuss such solutions is the article's talk page, not AfD. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:45, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm trying to figure this out... let's say you have an article that is contains what you think is an extraneous section... it seems that one choice is to just edit the article and remove the section... but perhaps you're not <i>sure</i> that the section is extraneous... you want some more sets out eyes on it... wouldn't doing as nominator did -- removing section to a seperate article and putting it up for a 'vote' at AfD serve that purpose? Perhaps nominator was trying to more 'democratic' by using this method? That being said, if this is nominator's intent, then:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Nominator need to explain what he is doing! Nominator's post at the beginning of this section is the <i>first</i> explanation that nominator has offered, belatedly. Suggest nominator explain <i>in original nomination</i> to avoid much mutual misunderstanding!</li>
<li>Could nominator put <b>Article#Section</b> in AfD? And say "I'm going to delete this <i>section</i>, are people OK with that?" If this is proper, I'm pretty new so maybe that's not allowed.</li>
<li>This would be faster than using Article:Talk. But one problem is, AfD is awfully long to wade thru as it is. So maybe using Article:Talk would be better. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:32, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
