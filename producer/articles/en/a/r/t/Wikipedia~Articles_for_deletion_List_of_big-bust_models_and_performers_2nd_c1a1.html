<li><b>Comment</b> For those of you who are troubled by the nominator, just pretend I nominated this bit of trivia instead and go from there. There's really not so much productive in discussing the motivation behind the nomination here. Best just to focus on the article at hand. GassyGuy 15:59, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> <i>Ad hominem</i> defenses are faulty ways to provide evidence for your point of view. <i>Ad hominem</i> means against the person: We are not debating the qualities of the person who nominated the AfD. That discussion can go on elsewhere on Wikipedia, like Requests for Intervention or other such places. The only valid means for deciding whether to keep or delete this article lie in the subject of the article itself. Not the quality of the writing. Not the people who have edited or created it. And certainly not in the personality of the original nominator. The article in question is subjective and and random. It lacks notability. Porn actresses are notable. Models are notable. Lists of random porn actresses and models by a random physical trait is NONNOTABLE. Stop trying to defend the "keep" position by <i>ad hominem</i> means. Defend the article itself on its own terms. Provide evidence. You can sway opinions by making a good case, not by attacking the original nom. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think anyone here is attacking the nominator. They're attacking the nomination itself. <i>Ad hominem</i> would mean saying that the nominator is a bad person, therefore his nomination is bad. We've simply said the nomination is bad. Sockpuppetry and bad faith administrative actions are real problems on Wikipedia, and it's not necessary to follow through with a problematic action if we know it to be unsound. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 14:18, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1. List is POV - This list is not POV because other than one or two actresses in the list all other actresses have minimum of a D Cup. Therefore the size is not POV, but requires a physical measurement based on cup size.</dd>

<dd>3. List is unmaintainable - How many actresses can you name off the top of your head that have a D cup?

<dd><i>Unindenting</i> Wait - fetishes are all about uncommon things? Care to explain, say, fart fetishism, then? This list is of interest to a very large number of people?

<li><b>reply</b> To the previous two votes: all lists are not equal. Some lists, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heavy_metal_bands.html" title="List of heavy metal bands">List of heavy metal bands</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_monarchs_of_the_Kingdom_of_England_c020.html" title="List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England">List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England</a> are notable in that they are based on notable information. The former is about bands based on their genre. Musical acts are discussed within the context of their genre. Knowing the genre of a band is essential to understanding how the music is to be understood and reviewed. The latter contains a collection of Monarchs listed by dynasty and in order by date of reign. Again, notable and important information to understand context. This list contains a list of models organized by a random physical trait. "Lists of models by modeling agency", or "lists of models by major ad campaigns", or "lists of models appearing in Penthouse magazine" would ALL be notable lists: They contain information about notable people organized in a notable way. A person's mere physical statistics (height, weight, eye color, and even cup size) are NOT notable.

<li><b>reply</b> 1) <i>Ad hominem</i> defenses are faulty (don't base your defense on the personality of the person who nominated the article) 2) the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers_5a5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of big-bust models and performers">prior AfD</a> was NO CONSENSUS. This is not the same as keep. It means exactly what it says. There was no consensus reached to do anything, so the <i>status quo</i> was kept by default. It doesn't mean that there was ever widespread consensus that this article is notable. 3) Valoem's arguement above is faulty because it merely says that it is interesting and useful. Neither is a "keep" defense. Lots of things are interesting and useful, but not entirely encyclopedic. As a "category" it might be worthwhile to categorize models by bust size, but as an article, it is a pointless list. The only person voting for keep who made ANYTHING of a credible arguement is Charlam about two votes above. I respectfully disagree; but at LEAST he is making a keep vote on notability grounds. Also of note, THE ARTICLE IS ENTIRELY UNREFERENCED... Thus it is original research, and thus it is also deletable. If EACH performer or model listed could be linked to an appropriate third-party reference that identified her as the cup size the article claimed to be, then we MIGHT have something, but as it stands now, it is Orignial Research, a direct violation of Wikipedia policy, and thus it must go... --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>reply</b> First of all an unreferenced article is hardly a reason to delete. If an article is unreferenced you add references. It is only when an article is unreferenced and references can not be made that you delete under WP:V. Secondly, this article is referenced in the links to the persons in question. If you click on anyone one of the people listed on that page their own articles have both references and their stated bust size. You also didn't mention any of the other points that I have made including my arguments against listcruft and WP:V. Therefore this article is not original research. Lastly, even you have stated that this nomination was bad faith, these are all the more reasons to keep. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 19:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>reply to reply</b> Ok, I will concede that the references can be found in the respective articles. I retract that the article is original research, but it is still NOT NOTABLE. It is still nothing more than a listing of people by a random and arbitrary physical statistic. Good lists can be made of adult models; this is not one of them. One more point: As i said before</li>

<p>" <font size="20">IF</font> the nomination was in bad faith" (note the use of the conditional word IF. It means that we are discussing a possibility, not a certainty. I have no idea of the mindset or intent of the original nominator, NOR DO I CARE) such a defense is still an <i>ad hominem</i> defense; it is a deflection of the actual issue, and a means of avoiding having to enter the actual debate on THIS article. If you belive bad faith to have been exercised here, then go to Requests for Intervention and ask to have the user blocked. It has NO BEARING on the inherant notability of this article. MAKE ARGUEMENTS RELATING TO THE CONTENT OF THIS ARTICLE. I apologize for "shouting", but so far only one person, Charlam, has done so; though it would be nice to see any proof that his assertion is true... Are adult models routinely catagorized in this way and is such catagorization used (note the past tense: not useful, but <i>used</i> in the sense that others have used this information before it appeared on wikipedia) routinely in reliable sources. If anyone could make a credible arguement of the MERITS of this article, and could make some proof as to actual notability, I would change my vote. As yet, we have 1 unverified assertion that I would call a claim of notability. EVERYONE else has avoided discussing the merits of this article by deflecting the debate away from the contents of the article. They make arguements against other lists, or they make arguements against people involved in the debate. Neither kind of arguement brings anything to the discussion. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 22:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>reply to reply</b> Not sure if this is what you're asking for, but as far as I can think of, to prove cup size is a valid standard measurement in aduly models would be to cite publications specializing only in models that would fit in this category, such as: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_%28magazine%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_%28magazine%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_%28magazine%29</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Busty_Beauties" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Busty_Beauties" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Busty_Beauties</a>, Gent, a specialiazed title series of Playboy (Playboy's Voluptuous Vixens) which is based solely on the models having larger then "average" bustlines. Aside from this, numerous websites featuring models specifically of D cup or larger, the fact that many Feature Dancers are booked by cup size and to some degree even the article on Breast Fetishism (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_fetishism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_fetishism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_fetishism</a>) would point to the relevance of this particular measurement standing out versus other physical characteristics. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlam_00_1901.html" title="User:Charlam 00">Charlam 00</a> 18:13, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Keep" as it is information but the title should be changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change vote to <b>Keep</b>. Thank you to Charlam. Homework has been done. Article looks like it <i>can be made</i> to pass the threshold. Suggestions to make it better:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Use the {{main}} tag to direct readers to the Breast Fetishism article. Perhaps a sentance or two from that article applied here will help establish context.</li>
<li>REFERENCE the notability of this article using the same references as the Breast Fetishism article. Also indicate the most notable magazines and film series to focus on Breast Fetishism, perhaps under a "see also" section. There appears to be reputable sources that indicate the notability of this particular kink, and so those references apply equally as well to both articles.</li>
<li>Rename the list article to indicate better that we are talking about Porn Actresses. Perhaps "List of Adult Film Actresses with Large Breasts" or some such. The title is misleading, as it could refer to non-adult film stars or models. I will still hold that OUTSIDE of porn, the catagorization of breast size is a non notable trait. The article needs to indicate its own context to make itself notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 19:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia excels in treatments of popular culture not treated in academia. The topic is of interest to many, even if 'vulgar'. Perhaps the strongest critique (apart from poor definition one mentioned above) is the feminist one that treating the topic legitimizes the objectification of women as sex objects. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rnest2002 (<a href="../../../r/n/e/User_talk%7ERnest2002_cce2.html" title="User talk:Rnest2002">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rnest2002_8591.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rnest2002">contribs</a>) 04:48, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
