<li><b>comment</b> None of the arguments you stated justify the keeping of this article. If the subject isn't worthy of encyclopedic value then the subject doesn't deserve to be listed in an encyclopedia. It doesn't matter how well written the article is or how many pretty pictures it has. It also doesn't matter the number of activities a certain person is involved in or if that person had an esporadic appearance in television. What matters is notability and it seems you weren't able to prove that the article's subject had any relevant merit to be covered in an encyclopedia. Regarding the google search tip, if I ran a simple, straight forward google test on my nickname I get more hits than your convoluted google test. Moreover, I can run a google test similar to yours (lots of inclusive logic) to prove that I am connected to the pope. Therefore your google test proves nothing more than that the article's subject is indeed very obscure and irrelevant. Last, your "avoid groupthink" jab at wikipedians shows that not only you know that the article deserves to be deleted but that you are irrationally defending the maintaining of an article which is completely void of encyclopedic merit. I aplaud the efford but unfortunately it is missplaced --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 19:58, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Holloway is influential in Canadian politics, and it's not vanity: she <i>never</i> edits the article herself. -- Marvin147 15:55, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Anyone could make either claim (she does/does not edit it herself) about anyone, so unless both of you have some evidence, this amounts to personal opinion. However, I'd like to point out that I look upon the practice of attempting to <i>out</i> people's anonymous edits as, rather distasteful. -- 70.28.153.94 15:23, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>They don't say "Feel free to remove any comments which reflect unfavorably on you." User:Marvin147 questioned your good faith in nominating this article. The subject of the article was, among other things, a regular columnist/contributor for <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relix.html" title="Relix">Relix</a>, and therefore qualified as notable under the criteria for writers.
