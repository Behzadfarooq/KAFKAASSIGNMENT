<p>I can verify that this group exists for the last 30 years in Borough Park, Brooklyn. I am a personal follower of this group and you can go see for yourself by visiting the location at 12th Avenue and 56th Street in Brooklyn, NY. I can not understand your argument that there is no match on Goggle. The way I understand, Wikipedia is exactly for this purpose to get new information that was not available in any other source.

<p>O.K. I accept your comment about new information. So let me put it to you this way. The Burshtiner Rebbe is not new in any way. He is a reputable figure for over thirty years and Google has him referenced under "Eichenstein" which is his family name. USER: Sunny123 March 30,2006</p>

<p>Deleted some flowery statements and kept only factual statements. Hope this is acceptable to all. Sunny123 April 4, 2006</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Everything in the article is verifyable. Just go to Boro Park. At 5822 11TH AVE, BROOKLYN, NY 11219 you can find Yeshiva Ohr Torah d'Burshtin (here is a website detaining education expenditures in New York that has it listed: <a href="http://www.e-ratecentral.com/us/nys/fundingReports/fundingHistoryDetail.asp?v=&amp;typ=entNum&amp;fy=2005&amp;ky=228046" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.e-ratecentral.com/us/nys/fundingReports/fundingHistoryDetail.asp?v=&amp;typ=entNum&amp;fy=2005&amp;ky=228046" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Now, someone has to find out a little more about the Burshtiner Rebbe. (From what I've heard, he's the nicest man in Boro Park. But unfortunately, that's all that I've heard). But please don't delete this merely for a lack of information. That's how these things start. Soon, iy<i>h, the article will grow. --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 22:53, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</i>

<li>Wikipedia requires <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Not everyone can "go to Boro Park". <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 13:35, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The statement was more tongue-in-cheek. But regardless, I provided a link to New York documents that "verify" the existence of a Burshtin Dynasty. In fairness though, it seems sort of silly. If it happened to be the case that no book was written about the Statue of Liberty, it would nonetheless be obvious and verifiable that it exists. Just ask anyone who drives from NY to NJ periodically. --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 15:16, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Made more corrections by major deletions:</b> The deletion alert is up more than one week and nobody came forth to deny any of the claims made in this article. The original article is comments that are facts and accepted by a large segment of the Boor Park community. However, I tried to keep to the Wikipedia standards and therefore made major deletions to this article. At this point I believe I can not cut it down anymore and I hope this is acceptable to all. Sunny123 April 6, 2006</p>

<p><b>AMAZING AND UNBELIEVABLE...</b> how after all my deletions and improvements there are 2 users (CLW and Stifle) that are determined to nitpick and criticize this site. Sunny123 April 6, 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - I belive that my "nitpicking" referred to above is my reversion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burshtin_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29&amp;diff=47254988&amp;oldid=47249759" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burshtin_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29&amp;diff=47254988&amp;oldid=47249759" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burshtin_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29&amp;diff=47269949&amp;oldid=47258175" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burshtin_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29&amp;diff=47269949&amp;oldid=47258175" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>; in both cases, [User:Sunny123] removed requests for citations, changed headings within articles to non-standard forms (e.g. with non-standard capitalisation and with colons) and reinserted deleted unverifiable statements, both times without using any edit summary. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 08:27, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>NEED HELP:</b> At this point I need help from Wikipedia users that have Admin authority to evaluate my position. I improved this site to the best of my ability and I do not think that it is fair to put Citation after every word in this article. I analyzed other Wikipedia articles and came to the conclusion that if you really want to nitpick, it can be done to almost every Wikipedia article. Sunny123 April 6, 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Agreed. The new article is a little ridiculous. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMeshulam_4706.html" title="User talk:Meshulam">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Meshulam_94f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Meshulam">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as unsourced (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>), no indication of notability, also utterly confusing (is this a "dynasty", a "sect" or an individual?
