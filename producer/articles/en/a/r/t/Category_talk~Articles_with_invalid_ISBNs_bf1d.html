<dd>Yes, the foreign books do take up a lot of this task. I have been very lucky in locating many. Not surprising, these page owners also drop leading and trailing digits.

<p>Just a note, be careful when removing the "Please check ISBN" tag, not to remove to many close brackets at the end, if it's nested in another template!

<dd>I have wondered about that. I have followed the word string back, trying to ensure just this point and found that it didn't take when I closed out the page. In many cases the word string never used a bracket at the beginning of the string. It should be no different then a math formula string but I have found it a bit puzzling.

<p>I know we've tried to talk about this before ... an official way of tagging ISBNs that are invalid as published ...

<dd>This is a possibility, though it would just be a template that told SmackBot to ignore the ISBN. In general I think it's fair to still leave these pages in the Category, because they still have invalid ISBNs. The reader should be put on notice that something is the matter with one or more of the ISBNs in the article. This is still literally true, even if the editors prefer not to fix it. So if they are going to be left in the category, then it's an argument for leaving the regular SmackBot template in place. Perhaps instead of making a new template, we could just create a file listing all the invalid ISBNs that editors have requested to be left in place. This would leave open the chance of fixing them or at least re-checking them in the future. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 01:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This would be a great feature to have. It is a bit disturbing to find a check digit error that isn't supported by ISBN. I have seen cases where the ISBN is in 4-5 site locations yet errors out on the check digit. Has anyone in botland figured that out? Another plus would be that the bot could be checking Wiki all the time. Wiki could probably be tracked for any new inclusion of ISBN. <a href="../../../e/k/o/User%7EEkotkie_083c.html" title="User:Ekotkie">Ekotkie</a> 08:22, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In principle, that may be possible, as I may be able to use the toolserver in a while. There is a crude method of keeping SmackBot off a whole article - use {{<a href="../../../b/o/t/Template%7EBots_9bfe.html" title="Template:Bots">bots</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../n/o/b/Template%7ENobots_fa26.html" title="Template:Nobots">nobots</a>}}, at the moment SB will avoid any article with either of these templates if I remember to set the option&#160;:-). I have put it in the ISBN article myself. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 22:59 <a href="../../../2/0/_/20_January_f602.html" title="20 January">20 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT).</dd>

<p>Hello Droll! How would you feel about deleting the bad ISBN from this article? I don't want to do anything if you want to study it further. Since OCLC doesn't show an ISBN, I figure they realize it's bad. Also since it's pre-1966 it may not have a real ISBN anyway. National Library of Canada says it has LCCN 60-9741 if you think it would be helpful to add that fact. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 02:52, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would be happy if you deleted it. I just left the note so that the next editor to check would know that he was not the first to try to find a valid ISBN. I read someones opinion somewhere that the first editor shouldn't do the deletion although I have deleted some on first site if they where to short to even resemble and ISBN after a conscientious search for a valid one. My personal feeling is that no data is better than bad data but that a good faith effort should be make to find valid data. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroll_6b3d.html" title="User:Droll">Droll</a> 03:35, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, there has been discussion on a number of pages about invalid ISBNs that are published, and whether to show, hide or remove them. Usually in these cases, the <a href="../../../m/a/r/MARC_standards_1dfb.html" title="MARC standards">MARC</a> records include the invalid ISBN (tagged as invalid), so the ISBN is valid for the purposes of searching for a book in most libraries. Oft <a href="../../../o/c/l/OCLC_c9d6.html" title="OCLC">OCLCs</a> are being used as replacements for Invalid ISBNs, but to my knowledge MARC records do not list OCLCs, limiting their usefulness. To resolve this, and so that we dont loose too much information in the "Invalid ISBN Cleanup 2007", I would like to propose that where it is obvious, these ISBNs are retained using {{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EListed_Invalid_ISBN_4eff.html" title="Template:Listed Invalid ISBN">Listed Invalid ISBN</a>}}, and we work out how to deal with these separately. My apologies in advance if this approach has already been rejected. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 08:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

There are fewer hits for ISBN 10 but still over 300. Some of these are alright since an ISBN could start with "10...". I wonder if anyone has discussed this. The magic word does not work with these since the actual use is usually ISBN-13. I realize this is probably not the correct place to discuss this.

<li>Sorry, I'm not sure what your question is. Could you please restate it? I do know that for me, Google is not a good way to identify or confirm an ISBN, regardless of whether it is of length 10 or 13. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 23:01, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are editors who use notation like ISBN-10 0-395-14806-5 and ISBN-13 978-0-395-14806-8. It is possible to find these using Google although there will be false hits. Wikipedia uses a "magic word" (ISBN) to identify ISBNs and generate HTML code. The ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 are not "magic words". I think that's a problem but then I'm a bit obsessive. Who else would try to repair all the invalid ISBNs. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroll_6b3d.html" title="User:Droll">Droll</a> 01:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm just wondering if anyone thinks its worth the effort to edit articles that currently use ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 notation and convert these to the standard ISBN notation. I mean what sence does it make to have the number in two formats neither of which generate a link. Look at the table in the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Rahn_d6c3.html" title="Otto Rahn">Otto Rahn</a> article. I think that sort of thing is counterproductive. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroll_6b3d.html" title="User:Droll">Droll</a> 08:22, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ah! If it were up to me, I'd say yes, let's convert the ISBN-{10,13} style notation over to the standard, link producing ISBN notation. I have less of an opinion on whether we should present both the 10 and 13 ISBN. I guess I prefer just presenting the 10 if both exist. A bot can come through later and change to or add the 13s if need be. The references are listed in a completely non-standard WP way in the Otto Rahn article right now anyway ... IMO, it deserves a clean-up unless there is a special reason why the references should be listed in just the way they are now. Hope that helps, and thanks for your patience with me while I got up to speed with your query! <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 09:56, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Here is what they already said:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few of the "unable to locate" articles have ISBNs that are supposed to refer to DVDs. I am not sure DVDs have ISBNs. --Droll 01:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>DVDs can have an ISBN, but usually when accompanied with significant supporting printed material. They also have their own identification system, and we are running into them a lot, so perhaps we need to start arranging how Wikipedia should handle them. John Vandenberg 02:18, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, John and Droll! This is my cue to point out the section of the ISBN manual <a href="http://www.isbn-international.org/en/userman/download/ISBNmanual.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.isbn-international.org/en/userman/download/ISBNmanual.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> that limits usage of ISBNs with 'Videos'. They offer the following as eligible for ISBNs:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>i. Educational videos specifically aimed at children up to the age of 16.</li>
<li>ii. Instructional videos imparting practical knowledge about specific subjects, the content of which is comparable to that available in printed books. For example, a video on how to play golf or how to make wooden toys.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>They go on to say that general entertainment videos, including documentaries, are not eligible for ISBNs. Naturally we don't have to follow their rules, but if we want to harmonize our usage with that of other agencies, there could be advantages in doing what is done elsewhere.</p>
<p>So, what are the other players already doing (as opposed to what isbn.org *thinks* they should be doing):</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon lists DVD movies by their ASIN numbers, and those can be Googled. (They don't use ISBNs for DVDs).</li>
<li>Worldcat thinks that the Schindler's List DVD has both an OCLC code and an ISBN. However Amazon does not find anything when you search their holdings for that ISBN, and of course they don't know about OCLCs. And Worldcat does not track ASINs. So it seems there is no universal identifier for DVDs that will be accepted by both bookstores and libraries. Unfortunately. So one option is for WIkipedia to store both an OCLC and an ASIN for each DVD. What do other people think? <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 03:53, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<p>A visit to my local library shows that 8 of 11 videos that I checked have ISBNs. (I looked at a mixture of DVDs and VHS tapes). These ISBNs can normally be looked up in Worldcat. So it appears that people are not obeying the isbn.org rules against ISBNs on entertainment videos! <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 03:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is an interesting point. I have an extensive DVD collection. Inspection of my inventory shows that the isbn shows up in support of the EAN bar code. isbn is configured as "X-XXXX-XXXX-X" as the top number. Unlike book bar codes that use the ten digit isbn on the top part of the bar code and the 13 digit isbn as the bottom part of the bar code number, the dvd's appear to have their own lower number. I have not looked at or seen a 2007 released dvd to see if this practice has been continued. I have seen scanners that are available with software that allows the user to "catalog" books, dvd's and cd's. This will remain as something to keep an eye on in the future. 66.242.209.79 15:53, 26 January 2007 (UTC) Interesting, one minute I was logged on and the next I wasn't.

<dd>Well, I did faintly remember someone talking about 14 digit ISBNs in Europe before, but, since I didn't immediately find the post, I started this thread. It doesn't surprise me one bit that the length of the number will grow. It has happened with zip codes and telephone numbers too. For me, it is no big deal, really; just a part of life. I'm not complaining that 14-digit ISBNs are on the horizon; I just wanted to confirm that they have already been seen in print. If you want me to re-read your previous posts on this topic, please provide a link or tell me which archive it is in or something.

<dd>There is something called EAN/UCC-14 on the page that EdK pointed to. However I don't believe that such a pending standard will affect ISBNs. That 14-digit thingie will put another leading digit in front of the current EAN that could be used to distinguish the ways a given product is batched. (See www.gtin.info). We already have an article <a href="../../../e/a/n/EAN.UCC_30f0.html" title="EAN.UCC">EAN.UCC</a> that doesn't mention the length issues, 13 versus 14. That article could probably be enhanced. Also <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBN_9609.html" title="ISBN">ISBN</a> could be improved to mention EAN/UCC-14. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a></dd>

<p>FYI, there is a world of difference between placing HTML tags in their persnickety way, and not. I just identified a previously elusive ISBN ... and the visible article grew after my correction. If you want to place html code, it absolutely must start and end with the characters as shown:</p>

<p>For reasons I cannot quite explain, if the HTML is instead like this</p>

<p>I copied the following from my talk page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Droll. Since it seems this much-discussed template is being put into use, how about discussing minimum standards for using it. I'd claim that either (a) an editor claims to have seen the book with the bad ISBN, or (b) the bad ISBN is found on line (not in a WP-derived source). Otherwise we might just be perpetuating somebody's copying error. And we're claiming to be a reference work! (Though perhaps not quite as reliable as the phone book, at least better than rumors from the neighbors). What do you think? Require some evidence of the ISBN being used (even though wrongly)? <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 07:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I figured this template was already being used so that is why I started using it but your concern and request are valid I think. I have a couple of comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using this template is better than using "hidden text" because it is easy for anyone to review using "what links here".</li>
<li>My personal criteria so far is that I was able to find the invalid ISBN on at least 2 unrelated google hits that are not wiki hits or wiki clone hits. At least once there was a hit on amazon.com? Several times I found the invalid ISBN on the publishers web page.</li>
<li>This template should only be used after a conscientious effort has been made to find a valid ISBN. I mean every tool available should be used short of searching each library with an online catalog.</li>
</ol>
<p>A few other thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have run across more than a couple of ISBNs that begin 999... In my limited experience there are no valid ISBNs that start that way. Is a practice some publishers use???? Most of the time I was able to find an alternate ISBN.</li>
<li>I saw some discussion about using "hidden text" and the possible consequences. I was thinking about the idea of creating a {{No valid ISBN found}} template. At least if you don't close a template it shows up and probably will be corrected. After google does a fresh crawl of wikipedia this kind of error could be found using google. I'd be willing to go back and change my hidden text to a template if this idea is agreed on. It would give us a record of these cases. It should probably have a field to identify the editor in some way that use the template. I started leaving my user name in "hidden text" comments so that if I go back to and article I can tell if I'm the first or second editor. I feel that invalid ISBNs should not be deleted by the first editor except in the few cases where the number is clearly not is ISBN or and ISSN or a OCLC. I don't think there is any policy about that yet. Ed also has been identifying his comments.</li>
<li>Can you tell I'm a little obsessive. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroll_6b3d.html" title="User:Droll">Droll</a> 10:26, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for starting the thread!</p>
<ul>
<li>As I understand the genesis of this template, it is a direct result of the inadequacies of placing information solely in hidden html text.</li>
<li>One observation I've had is even when the template is used, if the "ISBN" has less than 10 digits, the text displays (as normal, un-special text), but not as a hyperlink. I do not think this is a problem, but, it did trip me up a bit this morning when I was wondering how something was working.</li>
<li>The new Listed Invalid ISBN tag is perfect for works that really do exist with an ISBN, published by the publisher, with an invalid check digit. It allows us to display the publisher's information so the reader can take it to a book seller or library. It also allows us to not constantly go back and check whether the ISBN is valid or not. As I understand it, when this new tag is used, the "invalid" ISBN embedded in the tag is invisible to SmackBot.</li>
<li>While I am very glad this new tag exists, I have serious concerns about the general public using it.<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I am concerned about the tag being set in place prematurely.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) Those who know my work with ISBNs can attest that most of the ones I have fixed/found are ones that had stumped previous detectives. I enjoy the wikignome activity, but, need to mention details to stress a point. For say 19 out of 20 cases, when someone else says the number cannot be found, I can find it (or its commonly approved alternate). Personally, as I participate in the ISBN clean-up project, I'd rather not have to check articles using this new tag plus those using SmackBot's tag.</dd>
<dd>2) There's a subtle meaning to the essence the tag is getting at. I believe it is this:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the publisher really did publish a number that does not have a valid check-digit, then using the tag <i><b>is</b></i> appropriate. <i>However</i>,</li>
<li>if someone just wants the world to think they have an ISBN for something when they do not;</li>
<li>or, if sincere but not yet adequate, rigorous checks have been done to identify the proper ISBN (or an approved alternate such as an OCLC);</li>
<li>then using the tag <i><b>is not</b></i> appropriate. Using the tag inappropriately may cause the articles using {{Listed Invalid ISBN|...}} to very well become the next growing category of things to clean up here ...</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>IMO, We need to be careful when using this tag. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 12:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>999 It is indeed legitimate for a 10 digit ISBN to start with 9990, 9991... 99954. There is a formatting anomaly in the IIA's list at 99951.

<p>Just my perspective on how I work on ISBNs ...</p>
<ul>
<li>I find it silly to try to stay out of each other's way when fixing ISBNs. This is a wiki environment, after all, where anyone can edit and is encouraged to do so boldly. There are good instructions that pop on the screen for moments when we may get in to edit wars with one another.</li>
<li>I don't post here when I complete a certain letter since it seems easy to see what articles remain in the category.</li>
<li>I do appreciate the html tags so I can see whether when I start work on a problematic ISBN, I can tell if it is a new check or one that someone else has already fought with.</li>
<li>Posting problematic scenarios here seems like a great idea; it'd give all the ISBN editors plus whomever is concerned about the proposed changes to a particular article a centralized place to work matters out. Of course, another good place is the talk page for the article with the ISBN in question.</li>

<p>Wikipedia's reference lists should be of high quality, and many of us have been trying to improve them. Here are some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the degree of checking we should do before listing a book in a WP reference list? (to be sure we are supplying correct information)</li>
<li>Are there any situations where it is actually beneficial to the reader to be told about an invalid ISBN for the book?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my proposed descending scale of quality of the reference:</p>
<ol>
<li>The citation in WP includes a valid ISBN which retrieves proper book details from a major reference provider, such as a library OPAC.</li>
<li>The previous WP editor supplied a valid ISBN for the book, but no online book details can be found anywhere, not even in Worldcat. So we're not sure that the book actually exists. At least, there is nothing that another editor can check, and there's no obvious way to find it in a library.</li>
<li>The book is listed in WP with an invalid ISBN. The bad ISBN can be retrieved from SOME online source. Brief research does not reveal any other ISBN for that book.</li>
<li>The book is listed in WP with an invalid ISBN. Nothing about the book can be found online, neither its ISBN nor anything else.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that a #4 reference should *not* be supplied with {{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EListed_Invalid_ISBN_4eff.html" title="Template:Listed Invalid ISBN">Listed Invalid ISBN</a>}}. I just don't think it provides enough value to our readers. The invalid ISBN is completely speculative information that is not confirmable by other editors.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about #3. I'd prefer to just drop the ISBN in those cases, but would listen to arguments. In going through WP reference lists, the #2 situation comes up surprisingly often. I would argue that Featured Articles should not include references of lower quality than #1. By introducing the {{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EListed_Invalid_ISBN_4eff.html" title="Template:Listed Invalid ISBN">Listed Invalid ISBN</a>}} we are adding a template that would have to be *removed* before the article becomes a Featured Article. In my opinion&#160;:-).

This could easily come from a lack of understanding of the overall changes to the ISBN process. This is another reason why I asked Rich to get the bot to trigger a scan on any page addition of ISBN.

<dd>4) I guess the only difference between this and # 2 is that here the check digit test fails and in # 2 it passes? I'd follow the same reasoning as in # 2, except if we cannot find anything and there are no proponents, then it sounds like if the citation remains listed at all, it needs to do so without the ISBN, regardless of whether it is embedded in our new tag or not.</dd>

<li>I disagree with this blanket statement of this section header ("Featured Articles should not include any {{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EListed_Invalid_ISBN_4eff.html" title="Template:Listed Invalid ISBN">Listed Invalid ISBN</a>}} citations"). In what way would this rule help the quality of articles, vis-à-vis how helpful an article would be for a reader to either find a book they want to read, or verify a source? I can easily think of instances where it would make sources more difficult to verify, and books more difficult to find. Aside from a Levitical obsession with "rightness", what useful purpose does this the overall restriction serve? <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 17:58, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I guess I too disagree with the blanket statement. I like trying to use the tag as appropriately as possible, but, as with most things, this task may be more an art than something that can be put in to a formula. Check out my Yom Kippur War example above. I have not heard or thought of any good reasons for not keeping the invalid as published ISBN in the citation I recently updated. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 18:23, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hello Keesie and Cleduc. Do you really believe the user would *prefer* to have <i>Author+Title+Invalid ISBN</i> &#160;rather than plain <i>Author+Title</i>? In the Yom Kippur War book, the alleged ISBN was 96502004, only 8 digits. Is this helpful?
<dl>
<dd>I don't believe the user *cares* whether the ISBN is "invalid" as long as it leads to them being able to find the book in a library or bookstore. If it makes that easier, then I think the user does find this helpful. I, as a user of Wikipedia, find this personally quite useful. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 22:45, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From WP's point of view, it is extra work to carry along the invalid ISBNs and carefully protect them from the checking-and-fixing process. The Library of Congress tried to keep track of good and bad ISBNs for a while, but seems to have given up. Do you know any major libraries that you think are doing a better job thanks to their patient handling of invalid ISBNs? I know there are some libraries in New Zealand that seem to be tone-deaf to bad ISBNs, but I don't consider this a contribution to the world. There are really three choices for a library: (a) be oblivious (the 'NZ' option), (b) painstakingly track the good and the bad, and (c) delete the bad (apparently Worldcat's choice, and one that I recommend for us). <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 18:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see no evidence that Worldcat has deleted checksum-invalid ISBNs, since several can be searched there. BTW, <strong>I</strong> speak for <strong>myself</strong>, not WP, but I would like to point out that WP has been very good at applying a lot of (wo)manpower to time-consuming problems. I don't think a blanket solution is necessary or helpful, and an obviously useless 8-digit number is hardly the bedrock on which to rest an argument. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 19:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I think my Yom Kippur War example above is an example of WorldCat not keeping the invalid ISBN around. Click on either OCLC I provided, and all you see is an OCLC in WorldCat. Proceed to one of the libraries where the book is found and you may or may not see the ISBN listed. U of MI lists it. Harvard lists it, and indicates it is invalid.</li>

<li>Yes, the ISBN published on the book is helpful, even if its check-digit does not pan out. Especially if all I have is the ISBN for the book I want - sometimes, (often times?) that is all people exchange when suggesting books to one another. Also, not everyone knows how many digits a "good" ISBN has. If I were the author of a book with an "bad" ISBN, I would still like it displayed. It is not too, too much different if the real surname of an author, is, say Spier, but, for who knows what reason, it was published under Speir. It is what it is ...</li>
<li>During my ISBN work here, I have run into a small handful of books that have Invalid, Yet Real as Published ISBNs. For a subset of those, the WP editors have specifically requested that the invalid as published ISBN remain in the display. The new tag allows us to accommodate this reasonable request (i.e. an encyclopedia putting forth basic, true information) while also allowing us to behind the scenes distinguish Invalid as Published ISBNs from other ISBN mistakes (typos, fabricated books, ISSNs in disguise, DVDs, etc.). If we don't tag these invalid as published ISBNs, we're basically setting ourselves up to waste our own time or the time of the next crop of ISBN fixers who will time after time tackle the list, only to come to where we are now. The only concern I have about the new tag, if we adopt its usage, is we use it sparingly and appropriately so we don't just create another clean-up area.</li>
<li><i>I don't feel particularly strong about any of this</i> ... Perhaps what is more concerning to me is it is beginning to feel to me like the new tag was implemented prematurely, since, after it has been out and used a bit, we are now discussing whether it is needed. Shouldn't we have had this conversation before the tag was created, not after? <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 22:58, 29 January 2007 (UTC)<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the tag was in part created in response to the summary removal of "invalid" ISBNs from articles. I view the tag as a tool to allow us to continue to work as we try to reach a consensus on how ISBNs should be used in WP. I feel very strongly about the user experience and the utility of the information we provide in WP. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 02:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Ah - so the tag was created because some editors/readers <i><b>want</b></i> to see the invalid ISBNs?! Which is one reason why you and I want it to stay, if I understand you correctly.

<dd>This doesn't look like a printed book, it's more like a blog posting. It would be a 'type 3' reference in my proposed system, quite a low grade. I wouldn't suggest using {{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EListed_Invalid_ISBN_4eff.html" title="Template:Listed Invalid ISBN">Listed Invalid ISBN</a>}} when the reference is of such minimal quality and there is no library which associates that ISBN to a book that they hold. If somebody *referred* to that book in a peer-reviewed source, the situation would be different. Also would be different if the book were in Worldcat. Remember that the WP editor who created the article may have done nothing more than look at the web site, and he or she may have no other evidence that the book exists. When things don't turn up in printed sources, or in libraries, it may be for a reason. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 03:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both of these technically violate WP:NOT. The first I might cut some slack for, since it is a fan product not a publisher catalog, and these books might not be easy to locate.

<p>This Talk page is really for ISBNs not ISSNs, but maybe the collective wisdom here will have an idea on how to solve this new problem.</p>
<p>John Vandenberg, Rich F. and I were looking at ISSNs some time ago and we were using an on-line ISSN-checker at issn.org. The one we were using has just now become a dead link: <a href="http://www.issn.org:8080/English/pub/faqs/issn/issnchecking" class="external free" title="http://www.issn.org:8080/English/pub/faqs/issn/issnchecking" rel="nofollow">http://www.issn.org:8080/English/pub/faqs/issn/issnchecking</a>. If you go on issn.org's site they now present you with a login screen before you can check anything, and a free account only lasts thirty days. Some Google searching indicates that the libraries of the world aren't offering an online ISSN-checker anywhere. (Maybe the check digit is patented! (Just kidding..)</p>
<p>I've read somewhere that the ISSN check digit uses the same algorithm as the ISBN-10, though the number is only 8 digits. Another possibility, for those who don't mind running Javascript, would be to add a button on some Wikipedia page (like Booksources) that would verify a submitted number. There is a site that offers some Javascript for the purpose at <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/js-misc0.htm#SN8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/js-misc0.htm#SN8" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>I don't think SmackBot is affected by this issue because it uses its own algorithm when populating <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_with_invalid_ISSNs_ab44.html" title="Category:Articles with invalid ISSNs">Category:Articles with invalid ISSNs</a>.</p>
<p>Still another method is to use the old familiar isbn-check.com, and convert the ISSN to a pseudo-ISBN by prepending '00' in front of the ISSN you want to check. (This worked in at least two cases, so it must be right!). If you have any other ideas, please let me know. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 22:00, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Otherwise we're just taking the original editor's opinion that the supplied ISBN is correct, and there is no way for any other editors to verify it. Also, in this case there is a scanned version online; that will meet the needs of most readers who care to verify the book details. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 16:02, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So you'd recommend removing the ISBN all together and providing a link to the pdf containing scanned Russian material? That's fine with me ... if I can get the folks who care about the article to agree. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 17:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>After thinking a bit more about this, I am not comfortable listing the scanned version as a link since I am not able to read Russian and confirm that the material truly is in the public domain. I expect since it is for sale as well, albeit in a monograph form rather than html pages, it is not really supposed to be available for free online. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 23:12, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm hoping that Rich might respond to this comment. My proposal is to strike out the following phrase (in the text part of <a href="../../../i/n/v/CAT%7EINVALID_a700.html" title="CAT:INVALID">CAT:INVALID</a>) that's been used to describe the relationship between ISBN-10 and ISBN-13. The following is the full section, and I've <b>bolded</b> the clause I'd like to remove. I'll give reasons below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many books published between 2004 and 2006 have also been (explicitly) assigned ISBN-13s (they all have one based on the 10 digit ISBN, or 9 digit SBN). Until books with the 979 prefix start to appear, however, it will be possible to uniquely refer to any book either by its ISBN-10 <b>(although there is no guarantee the book will have been issued with a 10 digit ISBN)</b> or its (equivalent) ISBN-13 and both numbers will continue to be reserved for use by that book by the local ISBN agency. Beginning with the 979 prefix, only the ISBN-13 will work or be meaningful for the given book since there will no longer be an equivalent ISBN-10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no way a publisher (at present) can issue an ISBN-13 without also making a 'hole' in the ISBN-10 range for the numerically-converted value of the ISBN-13. So, in my view, it is technically *impossible* for a publisher to release a book with an ISBN-13 beginning with 978 without also making it possible to refer to the book using the converted ISBN-10. This fact is demonstrated by the way that Amazon looks up ISBN-13s. What they do is they first 'mechanically' convert it to an ISBN-10, and then they look up the resulting ISBN-10 in their system. (There is no way the corresponding ISBN-10 could ever be assigned to a different book).</p>
<p>So, in a sense, it doesn't matter if the publisher EXPLICITLY releases the book with an ISBN-10, it will automatically have one thanks to the conversion rule. I don't see this written down anywhere at isbn.org but it seems to mathematically follow from their other rules. Striking out the bolded phrase in the above passage will make the situation more clear to our readers.</p>
<p>Though this might appear to be a subtlety, it could affect the urgency with which people have to stop referring to books using ISBN-10s. I'll let you decide if you agree&#160;:-). <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 16:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

(It's fun to see the collective horsepower of WP's administrators being harnessed to look up obscure book references). There's a very thorough discussion of ASINs at <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_ASIN_ace8.html" title="User:Shimgray/ASIN">User:Shimgray/ASIN</a> that captures a discussion from 2005.

<dd>The recent <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> discussion was following by a thread of about fourteen mailing-list messages starting with <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-March/065723.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-March/065723.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, in which John Vandenberg put in a good word for the ISBN-fixing effort. Andrew Gray spoke in favor of what I would call 'naked references' in which you only have the basic author-title information, without trying to amplify it with an ASIN and perhaps with no catalog number at all. (Gray identified himself as a librarian). He also made some criticisms of Worldcat that I didn't fully understand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think ISBN-fixing, at its best, was resolving errors in book details, as well as just adding correct ISBNs. If ASINs were forbidden, it would not be a heavy blow to the encyclopedia, but it suggests some misunderstanding of the benefits of online-checkable book details. If anyone can think of a better way of stating the benefits of what we did, it would be helpful. I know we eliminated some completely bogus references. The next step would actually be to check references with *valid* ISBNs, because many of them are presumably bogus as well. However, that's not a quick job&#160;:-). <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 02:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If a company related to Wikipedia is now having this wonderful relationship with Amazon, do you think we could persuade them to do something rational, like allow searching for DVDs by their ISBN? Here is the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the fall, Amazon.com (Charts) also kicked in an undisclosed amount, a deal driven by founder Jeff Bezos's longstanding interest in Wales's work. Bezos has singled out Wikipedia as the site that "cracked the code for user-generated content" and once told Wales that he wished he had designed Amazon's user reviews of books and CDs to be more like collaborative wiki pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As discussed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category_talk%7EArticles_with_invalid_ISBNs_bf1d.html#Universal_IDs_for_DVDs.3F" title="Category talk:Articles with invalid ISBNs">elsewhere in this Talk page</a>, DVDs are being published (usually) with ISBNs on the back, and yet Amazon will not find them by ISBN. This seems to force us to use ASINs, which are frowned upon.
