<p>This page has been speedy deleted with an eye to an ArbComm case that wasn't closed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_November_17&amp;diff=89601962&amp;oldid=89601308" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_November_17&amp;diff=89601962&amp;oldid=89601308" rel="nofollow">overturned at Deletion Review</a>, and kept at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Marsden-Donnelly_harassment_case_1e80.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Marsden-Donnelly harassment case">AFD</a>. While the AFD was open, the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rachel_Marsden_c143.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rachel Marsden">ArbComm case</a> closed, placing this article under a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rachel_Marsden_c143.html#Articles_which_relate_to_Rachel_Marsden" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rachel Marsden">remedy</a> encouraging but not requiring speedy deletion. It has since been speedy deleted again, and gone to <b><a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_January_27_9ac3.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 27">deletion review</a></b> again. With no consensus to endorse the speedy deletion, it is overturned and brought back to AFD per <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">the undeletion policy</a>. So here we are, unfortunately. As part of the deletion review close, the article has been both retitled and cut down about 50%. So while you are encouraged to read the most recent deletion review, and any other desired discussion, many of the concerns are at least partly addressed and the article should be read as it is now before opining again. I don't want any admin to <a href="../../../w/w/_/WP%7EWW_a8b9.html" title="WP:WW">wheel war</a> over this, and I don't want to see it on deletion review a third time, so please come to a clear consensus. Ideas from the deletion review include 1) deleting it, 2) keeping it 3) merging it to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Simon_Fraser_University_e31b.html" title="History of Simon Fraser University">History of Simon Fraser University</a>, 4) merging it elsehere, and I'm sure you all will have more.

<li><b>Additional note to closing admin</b> Take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Request_for_clarification_on_undeleted_Marsden-Donnelly_harassment_case" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration#Request for clarification on undeleted Marsden-Donnelly harassment case</a>.

<li>Additional comment by relister: Personally, I think that merging to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Simon_Fraser_University_e31b.html" title="History of Simon Fraser University">History of Simon Fraser University</a> won't work, as that is a one edit stub that will be overwhelmed by this content, and is unlikely to be watched closely enough to prevent the content from violating <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> at some point in the future. I encourage opiners who believe that prior opinions should be endorsed to make it crystal clear which prior opinons they are endorsing; the possible merge solution was unavailable as a close in deletion review because it was unclear whether some "per above" opinions were in favor of or opposed to that solution. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 07:34, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reluctant <b>keep</b> as the outcome involved the resignation of the president of a top university. In other words, a significant outcome outside the case itself. Normally I would suggest a merge back into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a> but the ArbCom situation suggests that would not be helpful. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:49, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is overwhelming evidence of sustained nationwide coverage of the controversy, including a set of articles from more than halfway across the country two and a half years after the story broke (<a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Citizen_8564.html" title="Ottawa Citizen">Ottawa Citizen</a>). Articles whose primary subject is this case include multiple full-length articles in each of the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globe_and_Mail_1d03.html" title="Globe and Mail">Globe and Mail</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macleans.html" title="Macleans">Macleans</a>, and at least two Google Scholar results. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 08:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Reasons listed:
<ol>
<li>If we apply <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, the case shatters the required threshold of multiple reliable sources. I find upward of 30,000 words in Lexis-Nexis and Newsbank alone, over multiple months from almost all major Canadian news outlets (very few international though). The case reverberates in the Canadian press until today. Notability is also given by the institutional impact. Resignation of a president of a major university is no small thing. I cannot see how 30,000 words should be summarized in two lines in History of SFU. The case, while probably not a first-tier academic scandal, is clearly far from obscure.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> requires tight sourcing of all claims and balanced writing. It does not mean sourced comments must be removed because they put individuals in a bad light, and many other academic scandals on which we have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_academic_scandals.html" title="List of academic scandals">articles</a> have an element of wrongdoing by at least one participant. All are or should be held to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, none should be (or have been, to my knowledge) completely removed. After reading most of the articles I find that the article does not deviate in tone from the majority of articles from the major news outlets. It is not "grossly unbalanced". If the article appears biased, then it's because the facts are biased. If individual sources are found to be unreliable, this should not be a problem as most factual claims can be sourced in triplicate. <i>(Addendum: I support GRBerry's removal of the lurid details. The article should focus on the institutional process and impact in the style of Rick Coe's <a href="http://www.caut.ca/en/bulletin/issues/1998_may/sfu.html" class="external text" title="http://www.caut.ca/en/bulletin/issues/1998_may/sfu.html" rel="nofollow">analysis</a> for the Canadian Association of University Teachers).</i></li>
<li>This article revolves around three individuals and one institution. The institution, SFU, and one individual, President S., are notable ex officio; one individual, LD, is seemingly non-notable outside this case; and one individual, RM, is of contested notability. This argument has been made that because of the contested notability of this last individual covering the case in the detail allowed by the richness of the sources constitutes undue weight. I cannot find a precedent for this. We cover scandals in the bio of individuals if the scandal revolves around one person and biographical information is available (see e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_McCarthy_%28CIA%29_61d3.html" title="Mary McCarthy (CIA)">Mary McCarthy (CIA)</a>) or in a stand-alone article on the case (see e.g. <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_lacrosse.html" title="Duke lacrosse">Duke lacrosse</a> case), or as in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> case, spread over multiple articles. If RM is non-notable outside this case and biographical information is hard to come by, there should be no bio entry on her for risk of providing false information. But this should not affect this article which meets all of our standards per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and no arguments other that "there should not be two articles on RM" have been made in support of the claim that it fails our policies. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Easily passes the notability threshold (and I'm reluctant to grant that to "news" events.) If <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is an ongoing concern, apply an appropriate level of protection to the article, but do not delete it. BLP applies to <i>unsourced or false</i> information, not <i>true and well-sourced information which makes someone look bad</i>. This information is already a significant part of public record and consciousness, and our failure to include it will do little or nothing to "protect" those involved. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 09:35, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep at this title</b> (great idea, BTW)<b>, do not merge</b>.

<li><b>&lt;sigh&gt;</b> This will be kept here because it meets the notability requirements, only to be deleted because of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> concerns later and per the ArbCom remedies, brought up at deletion review and brought back here.... My opinion is there should be a <b>cooling-off period</b> with implementation of a <b>Brian Peppers solution</b>, per my reasoning at the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#27_January_2007" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">DRV</a> and because <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETIND_80d6.html" title="WP:TIND">there is no deadline</a>. The scandal <i>does</i> meet the notability guidelines, but it was relatively minor. And that's the primary continuing interest in this: a <i>scandal</i> involving the obnoxious <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a>. And that's why people are interested in this, not because of its effect on university administrative procedures. No one is champing at the bit to write University of Michigan speech code controversy, even though that was a big story in its day and we could no doubt find hundreds of sources on it. It could be a good article (and no doubt will be one day); but no one criticizes Wikipedia because it isn't covered here. It is important that we cover <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monicagate.html" title="Monicagate">Monicagate</a> currently; this is optional and can wait. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 17:54, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Please go to it now, in the spirit of {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}}. The hatchet I wielded last night was primarily aimed at biographical details, and may not have been perfectly aimed even there. Improving an article during an AFD discussion is always a good idea.

<li>I agree that "keep and cleanup" should not be a permissible opinion in this discussion. BLP issues should be addressed during this five-day procedural reprieve and not expected to be solved afterwards. And it also shouldn't be addressed in this handwaving "there are problems in the article somewhere" manner, we had enough of that during the DRV. If there are objectionable passages they should be brought up here to make sure they're fixed prior to closure of this AfD. That's not to say that I don't think GRB did an aadmirable job cutting through the clutter (double negative). ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 20:48, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
