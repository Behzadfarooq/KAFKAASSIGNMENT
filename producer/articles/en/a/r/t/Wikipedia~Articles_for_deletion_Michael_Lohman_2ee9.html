<p><b>Keep</b> This person has become an individual of media interest. In the future when one person says to another "it's like the Lohman thing" and they say what? and the first person says "search for him on wikipedia", what will this site have to say on this person of media interest? Nothing? Or a concise article?</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> This is a vanity page, about an obscure individual, of no encyclopedic value. Furthermore, unless someone is <b>convicted</b> of a crime, it is prejudicial to put accusations against them and publish it in an encyclopedia. After all, you are still innocent until proven guilty. I'd hate to see Wikipedia become a platform for smear campaigns and personal grudges.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't see any indication that the accused here is claiming innocence. In fact, he's pleaded guilty in order to avoid jail and to be diverted to an intervention program. Also, I don't see any evidence that the authors of the article have a personal vendetta or grudges.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>keep</b> We don't require a conviction for inclusion. This submission is unlikely a personal grudge. This was quite the sensational news item not only at Princeton but in college circles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" rel="nofollow">lots of issues</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">leave me a message</a> 07:43, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1) So Wikipedia is now a forum for listing everyone arrested for something? The accused is not a professor or a politician or even a public person. How is this appropriate for an encyclopedia? Furthermore, this seems likely to be applied in a discriminatory manner, since obviously 99% of criminals and accused criminals won't be listed. 2) This could open up Wikipedia for lawsuits of people accused and later proven innocent. Especially bad is when the article is NPOV and states things like "On several occasions, he would cut the hair of Asian women without their knowledge or consent." Typically newspapers and other reputable source make sure to qualify statements with "so and so is accused of ..." or "allegedly".
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> All of the above were reported similarly by mainstream, non-student news sources because the guy has confessed and admitted as much, making the cautionary language unnecessary. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowee_c487.html" title="User:Howee">Howee</a> 01:08, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>keep</b> The only real problem I see with the existance of this article is the point that it could be construed as a personal attack - however, I think simply what already happened, without a conviction at this point, is noteworthy - the accusations caused a great deal of buzz, conversation, anger that students weren't aware of suspicion earlier, and will likely have long-term effects on the university. If in two years that is not true and/or he is suprisingly cleared of charges, then the article should be deleted - the problem is not that it's an inappropriate topic, it's just that it's not a resolved story yet, and that resolution may, in fact, eventually make it non-notable, but right now I think it is definitely notable - this is not an obscure name in Princeton, certainly... that's the only area I can speak for. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 21:36, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<b>keep</b> I don't see how this page could be viewed as a personal attack. It's a NPOV article that simply recounts what the police report stated. The page also cites third party press articles about these alleged acts. There is no conclusion of Michael Lohman's guilt or innocence so it is not correct to state that this article may potentially open up Wikipedia for a lawsuit. The language in this article is no more discriminatory or libelous than any standard newspaper article. And, as others have pointed out, when this story broke, it attracted a lot of attention. Do a Google search for "Michael Lohman" and you will pull up multiple newspaper articles about this story. For better or worse, the story attracted lot of attention so Lohman is now a public persona. <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westworld.html" title="Westworld">westworld</a></p>
<p><b>delete</b> now that he has not been convicted, the page strikes me as dubious. Also, I don't like the precedent of non-notable non-public figures being posted. Is this moving into Megan's Law style sex offender lists??? See lots of potential for abuse, revenge, harrassment of private individuals. Willowx 6 July 2005 08:11 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is a really old discussion, neither the person who put this up for VfD nor I (at that point) had really figured out the whole VfD thing, and so it never got listed and after a few weeks it appeared that something like consesus had been reached - I removed the notice instead of listing it under VfD, which I now realize to be inappropriate but forgot to correct and apologize for playing <s>god</s> administrator. I still believe that the person is relevant due to the <i>impact</i> that he had in and out of Princeton. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 6 July 2005 12:31 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's been pointed out that the upset was wide than just his locality.

<p>Let me try to illustrate the shock of this story and why it reverberated further out than the campus. There are 6500 total students at Princeton. Half, 3250 are females, and 10% of that number forms the Asian female population. The man was involved in 50-60 lewd acts. An entire ethnic body nearly systematically targeted! This was a petty pervert but he pulled off an intimidating feat. You can imagine why Asians far from Princeton reacted to this as a shocking hate crime. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" rel="nofollow">lots of issues</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">leave me a message</a> 7 July 2005 05:56 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm more than a little disturbed to see comments from some people saying that this Lohman story is not notable beyond "an ethnic minority". In my opinion, some of you are basically saying that because his actions only affected non-Caucasians, it doesn't matter. And I'm sorry, but that attitude is verging on being racist. Maybe that's not what you meant, but it sure sounds like it to me. As for this story only being a "local community" (i.e, Princeton University) story, that is clearly not the case. The story attracted a lot of attention from nationwide press, as others have already pointed out. In addition to the ones already listed above, here's a few more.</li>

<p>Clearly this news article caught the attention of a lot of people beyond just Princeton. I don't think it's valid to say that he is not notable or notorious.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The main arguments for deletion seem to center on three issues: 1) the lack of a criminal conviction 2) the lack relevance to a non-Asian American (e.g. Caucasian) audience and 3) and the lack of national notability. I think if we examine each issue, it becomes clear there is insufficient cause to delete this article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. lack of a criminal conviction
<dl>
<dd>this does not seem to be a particularly useful criteria for notability</dd>
<dd>for example, OJ Simpson wasn't convicted of a crime</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. lack of relevance to a non-Asian American audience
<dl>
<dd>as pointed out above, even if the story was only of interest to Asians/Asian Americans (highly unlikely given the number of stories in non-ethnic, mainstream press e.g. Boston Globe, NY Post, ABC News, college publications, etc.), there are plenty of Asian and Asian American users of Wikipedia</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3. lack of national notability
<dl>
<dd>as noted above, media coverage was not isolated to local, or even regional outlets, but included national outlets</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> BTW, Google search for ""Michael Lohman" +princeton" produces 250+ results. I'm new to Wikipedia, but I just read over the guidelines for VfD. Based on the "Google test", the lack of a clear consensus, and the principle of keeping articles when in doubt, it seems that there isn't sufficient evidence/support to justify deletion. Also, it sems that this VfD process has gone on quite a lot longer than it should (5 days). It would be great if an admin could please remove VfD notice. Does anyone know how to request attention to this effect? Thanks! <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowee_c487.html" title="User:Howee">Howee</a> 03:06, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
