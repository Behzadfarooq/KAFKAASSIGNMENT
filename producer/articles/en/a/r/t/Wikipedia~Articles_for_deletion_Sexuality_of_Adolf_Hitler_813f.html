<p>This article is pure speculation and none of the information present can be confirmed. I vote to <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../o/s/u/User%7EOSU80_d26b.html" title="User:OSU80">OSU80</a> 04:10, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Both the original speculation and objections to that speculation are authoritative and well-documented in this article. It's well-balanced, and it's a topic of interest. Why not? <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 04:12, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Speaking as the person who added four references to the first paragraph of the article (and meant to go back and work on the rest but... didn't), I'm curious as to what is meant by "none of the information present can be confirmed". Hitler's sexuality is, like most things surrounding Hitler, a subject of interest, and if we are able to discuss it objectively and with reference to reliable sources, I think we should. —<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 04:38, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Even though this article needs work, it should be improved rather than being deleted. There has been a long standing interest and a number of inquiries into this aspect of Hitler's life by even mainstream historical biographers. The topic was even covered in my high school history classes in the late 60s. Normally I would want this type of thing covered in the main biography but that article is already rather long and has already spawned a <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism_of_Adolf_Hitler_4199.html" title="Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler">Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler</a> due, in part to space considerations. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 06:20, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> if I was gonna vote it'd be to delete, but given the way this looks like going, it'd be pointless. However, who the hell cares about Hitlers sexuality, and what cant be said in his own article about it, that it needs a seperate article all to itself?!

<li><b>Keep</b>. It has non-original research related to it. History is not quite as verifiable process as the nom seems to think it is. We have to rely on people commenting.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notability of subject can hardly be questioned (pretty much every aspect of this man's life is likely to be notable). Article itself could do with touching up but is certainly not amongst the worst I've ever seen. Surprised to see that this page has been nominated on AfD 3 times in the past 6 weeks (presumably as an exercise in order to spur interested parties into working on the page?)- in terms of the subject matter at least, I don't see why this should be deleted, given the space constraints described above. <a href="../../../d/e/b/Hidden_Fuhrer%7E_Debating_the_Enigma_of_Hitler%27s_Sexuality_fcc2.html" title="Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality">Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality</a> should/could probably be merged into this page however. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 02:11, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Badgerpatrol nailed it. The only reason I relisted this article for a third time was because I'd hate to see some 15 year old kid writing a paper about Adolf Hitler, after all I'm sure there are millions of them out there, only to include in his paper that Adolf Hitler was indeed a homosexual. Even a merge with the main page would be more constructive than having it's own page. There are missing citations all over the page. <a href="../../../o/s/u/User%7EOSU80_d26b.html" title="User:OSU80">OSU80</a> 02:18, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. <i>My thoughts on this don't change:</i> Unnverifiable pov fork. The topic is certainly borderline unencyclopedic, especially existing as its own article. If the content could be verified with reliable sources, I would suggest merging. This sets a very bad precedent for allowing every crackpot conspiracy bullshit to be treated with credulity. I'd like to think Wikipedia is better than this. --&#160;<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrash_5bb4.html" title="User talk:Krash">Talk</a>)</small> 03:56, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems like a potentially good article, could do with a bit of a tidy and POV purge but it has some well referenced information in it. People must remember that just because a subject is sensitive does not instantly make it POV. But as I said, needs work.

<li>Do people not know what "no consensus" means? It means that the <i>administrator</i> can't take any action. Users can do whatever the heck they want, and so I merged the article.

<li><b>Delete/Move this information somewhere else</b> - having a separate article for this gives a large emphasis on one small facet of one's life and is POV. This applies for all the others that have had a similar thing.

<dd>If there had been reputable sources speculating on the drinking habits of the Pope - then yes, that would be a valid article. But there aren't. There is however a verifiable debate on the sexuality of Hitler (not just 'was he gay?' but was he impotent, and how might we understand his sexual psychology). The 'facts' may be POV, but the fact that there is a debate can be verified and reported. Here's a review of a notable book on the subject <a href="http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=17696&amp;g17696=x&amp;g12272=x&amp;g30028=x&amp;g20991=x&amp;g21010=x&amp;g19965=x&amp;g19963=x&amp;amid=17696" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=17696&amp;g17696=x&amp;g12272=x&amp;g30028=x&amp;g20991=x&amp;g21010=x&amp;g19965=x&amp;g19963=x&amp;amid=17696" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which was reviewed in Britians leading History journal <i>History Today</i> and caused them to put a fascinating picture of the <a href="../../../f/u/h/Fuhrer.html" title="Fuhrer">Fuhrer</a> in <a href="../../../l/e/d/Lederhosen.html" title="Lederhosen">Lederhosen</a> on its front cover <a href="http://www.historytoday.com/dt_issue.asp?gid=17671&amp;aid=&amp;tgid=&amp;amid=&amp;g17671=x&amp;g30026=x&amp;g20991=x&amp;g21010=x&amp;g19965=x&amp;g19963=x" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historytoday.com/dt_issue.asp?gid=17671&amp;aid=&amp;tgid=&amp;amid=&amp;g17671=x&amp;g30026=x&amp;g20991=x&amp;g21010=x&amp;g19965=x&amp;g19963=x" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> with the title 'Hitler's Secret'. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 08:30, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
