<li><b>comment</b> <i>Failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept.</i> Nevertheless, since you are citing notability guidelines, I would like to point out again that the artist <i>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media; Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city; Has won or placed in a major music competition; Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style/technique in a particular music genre; Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture</i>. There was a MySpace link on the Wikipedia article, but it has been removed. Official site is still on there, and is NOT a MySpace page (though MySpace indicates official site is under reconstruction).<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 15:29, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> Musician's official site offers photograph and two links. One is to musician's MySpace page. One is to musician's e-mail address. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 16:33, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>response</b> I point you again towards the phrase "under reconstruction." And since when is not liking a subject's website part of Wikipedia guidelines? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 17:21, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> I felt that a MySpace profile as his website was a good metric for the notability of the individual. And kindly calm down. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:51, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Do not edit other user's comments. Not a personal attack, and if you think so, let someone else decide that. Again, the website and the MySpace profile are two different entities, so your argument here is not valid. Discussion and disagreement does not equal not calm. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 18:01, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>response</b> Yes, the website and the MySpace profile are two different entities. The use of a MySpace profile as his sole website containing actual content is demonstrative of non-notability, in my opinion. Obviously, you disagree, but that's my viewpoint, at least. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 18:10, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your insistence that I am not "calm" or that I am personally attacking you does not make it more true. I am refuting your grounds for nomination and the ill logic you are using to justify deletion. Notwithstanding the fact that it is clear the site is under reconstruction (which many sites will be from time to time, whether from a notable corporation or totally non-notable entity... rendering this point useless as a sign of notability), I still have proven notability criteria in other areas. Let's both agree to let others carry on this discussion now, and end our commenting on the matter of these AfDs you have initiated. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 18:15, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Deal. If you'll let what you've written here stand, I'll let what I've written here stand. No hard feelings from my end. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 18:19, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Mike (good name, BTW), I removed your speedy tag, as I feel there's definitely a <i>claim</i> of notability in the article (plus, we might as well just let the AfD go down). With that said, I'm still going with delete because the claims in the article are highly insufficient. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:23, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I have satisfied specific criteria as listed in notability guidelines <i>(Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media; Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city; Has won or placed in a major music competition; Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style/technique in a particular music genre; Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture</i>). Concerns about "claims" can be aired on talk page or with "citation needed" tags. These nominations are from one Wiki user whom I got into a scuffle over a different article on, and now he's apparently targeting all my contributions. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 03:51, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> It's more that I saw a pattern of non-notability in a few of his contributions, and figured they deserved a community review here. But of course, that's not really the case, it's just an excuse. It's really that <a href="../../../a/b/f/WP%7EABF_c955.html" title="WP:ABF">I'm an evil monster out to chomp on someone's precious baby</a>. <a href="../../../o/g/r/Ogre.html" title="Ogre">Babies, YUM!</a> —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 04:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>response</b> Notability has been met, as listed above, rendering your nomination inappropriate. Even further changes have been made to said article to assert notability. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 15:29, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>response</b> If the community decides that way, or fails to render a consensus vote of delete, then so be it. I still feel the group has notability problems sufficient enough that a community review is warranted. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 18:13, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Wikipedia's article on the Google test states <i>the minimum number of matches you should see if a term is not made up</i> is <i>Perhaps a few hundred</i>, that <i>search result(s) from Google are highly biased towards popular culture</i> (so a subculture or radio friendly artist may not be reflected, but that does not neccessarily refute notability, does it?). Most importantly, <i>The Google test has always been and very likely always will remain an extremely inconsistent tool, which does not measure notability.</i> Since notability is the issue here per the nomination, your reasons for marking this article for deletion are still unclear. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 15:29, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b>. A verifible nomination and performace in the "2006 Arizona Ska Punk Awards" may be a stretch to meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>'s <i>"Has written a song or composition which has won or placed in a major music competition not established expressly for new comers,"</i> but it does distinguish him from many of the generic myspace page holders. Also, can his relationship to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Foster_7a97.html" title="Stephen Foster">Stephen Foster</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/b/Elbert_Hubbard_2874.html" title="Elbert Hubbard">Elbert Hubbard</a> be verified?

<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I know of no published geneaology charts or such online that could verify this! I know it's not an untrue claim, I just don't know how to cite it. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 15:29, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Said relationships don't necessarily need to be documented in an online source, as long as it's in some existing source that you can then appropriately cite (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">citing sources style guide</a>. But if no such source — online <i><b>or</b></i> <i>off</i>line — exists, then it would be (by definition) an <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> item, and thus would not belong. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 18:17, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
