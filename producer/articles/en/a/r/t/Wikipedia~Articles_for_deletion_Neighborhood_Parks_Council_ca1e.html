<p>Looks like some park organization. My question I want to ask, is it notable enough in the sense of an <b>encyclopedia</b>. And if so, we need to cleanup the external link frenzy... and the article. Note, most of the citations come from the organizations own website. —— <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">ask me for <b>help</b></a>) 09:33, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Neighborhood Parks Council is environmental organization representative of over 100 parks groups in San Francisco. There are many other environmental organizations listed in Wikipedia, so I don't see how this one is any different. I am new to Wikipedia, so any feedback is welcome.

<dd>I live in the San Francisco area (<a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose%2C_California_e18c.html" title="San Jose, California">San Jose</a> to be precise) and have never heard of this council. It's suprising, since I see billboards for things such as the <a href="../../../b/a/a/BAAQMD_058a.html" title="BAAQMD">BAAQMD</a> daily and have been to many of the parks listed. <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gate_Park_61a6.html" title="Golden Gate Park">Golden Gate Park</a> in particular is very notable in my book and to San Franciscans in general, so I'd have to say <b>conditional keep</b>.

<li><b>Reply</b> - Please consider the following:</li>
</ul>
<p>The Neighborhood Parks Council is ten years old, and just celebrated its ten year anniversary. The organization is actually a coalition of several hundred park and green open space groups in San Francisco. Isabel Wade, founder of the organization, has been one of the most important green leaders in San Francisco, and is one of the founders of the Friends of the Urban Forest and also the National Aids Memorial Grove located in Golden Gate park. The organization is located at 451 Hayes Street in San Francisco. The phone number is 415.621.3260. With regard to content of the Wikipedia entry, efforts were made to use original language and not to replicate information available elsewhere on the web. Numerous links are now included in the article to other parks and relevant topics that are central to the work of this organization. Yes, the folks who created these entries are Wikipedia newbies and would very much appreciate feedback with regard to style, content, and linkage.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The organization's existence is verifiable and it looks notable enough to me. Problems with the article can be fixed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardamon_ba9d.html" title="User:Cardamon">Cardamon</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECardamon_c20a.html" title="User talk:Cardamon">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cardamon_1978.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cardamon">contribs</a>) 11:54, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>The article badly needs references to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> external sources (i.e. not just the organization's own website) which can <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the information in it. Books and journal articles would be ideal; magazine articles are okay. Government websites, websites of grantgiving foundations, and links to newspaper articles that are expected to remain available for a while are better than nothing.

<li><b>Reply</b> Thank you for these suggestions. Yes, I am a principle of NPC; my name is Wolfram Alderson, and I am Deputy Director of the Neighborhood Parks Council. One challenge with regard to external citations is that NPC is one of the leading sources of information with regard to neighborhood parks. There are many newspaper articles I can cite, and NPC is listed on the San Francisco Recreation and Parks official government website. I must admit that I am not too knowledgeable about how to create citations in wikipedia, but this is a welcome challenge.--<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolframald_d594.html" title="User:Wolframald">Wolframald</a> 19:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> I have added some of the requested references to external sources. I want to be cautious and not overdo it--the first comment in this discussion seemed to be concerned with the idea that there were too many external links. Again, any feedback in this reqard would be greatly appreciated.</li>

<dd>A local organization with about 22,000 google hits.

<li><b>Comment</b> Firstly, I'd just like to say I'm impressed at the response to this AfD: Wikipedia conventions are always convoluted for those unfamiliar with the system, and <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolframald_d594.html" title="User:Wolframald">Wolframald</a> is showing an admirable willingness to address concerns. Secondly, while I don't personally have an opinion on whether this organisation meets the criteria to have an article of its own (though I would say that notability could be established easily enough by the addition of some press citations), if the final consensus is that it does not then I would suggest that at the very least a summary be merged into <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parks_in_San_Francisco%2C_California_7535.html" title="Parks in San Francisco, California">Parks in San Francisco, California</a>, since this organisation does seem to be of some note in that context. (To avoid unbalancing the latter article, it would need expanding with summaries of the other organisations involved with SF parks; actually, it would rather benefit from that anyway...) — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:25, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Thanks for the nod from the latter contributor that acknowledges that we are trying to create a wikipedia entry of value that meets the standards of the wiki community. The comment from <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> that states <b>basically an ad</b> and the the comment from <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> that the organization <b>isn't of general importance</b> seem harsh to me. Please explain how our entry about an organization that has dedicated itself to greening the City of San Francisco for the last 10 years is less relevant (or more of an ad) than the entries in Wikipedia for the the <b>7-11</b> retail chain, <b>Charmin</b> toilet paper, or the <b>World Toilet Organization</b>? The Neighborhood Parks Council is considered a model for urban efforts to unite neighborhoods around their urban assets. We work tirelessly to bring resources and support to run-down urban parks in underserved neighborhoods. I am truly impressed at the level of democracy involved in the wikipedia community, and I am a willing and eager student with regard to bringing the NPC entry up to standards. Please note that I have added press citations, and can easily add more, but still feel gunshy from the comments that suggested there were too many external links.--<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolframald_d594.html" title="User:Wolframald">Wolframald</a> 01:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps "general importance" was the wrong term. I meant only that the organization isn't important enough, in the context of parks worldwide, to be linked to from the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Park.html" title="Park">Park</a> article. That article is about parks in general and shouldn't link to every organization anywhere that has anything to do with parks. Please note that I voted to keep the article about NPC, and that I edited it to bring it more in line with Wikipedia style conventions. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 07:08, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Soft Keep</b> The organization seems to exert notability, but I'm never to kean on people pushing any agendas through wikipedia, noble or otherwise. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolframald_d594.html" title="User:Wolframald">Wolframald</a> is nearly the sole contributor to the article. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichMac_732c.html" title="User:RichMac">RichMac</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichMac_1402.html" title="User talk:RichMac">(Talk)</a> 04:19, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> to Neighborhood Parks Council (California) or Neighborhood Parks Council (San Francisco), or even Neighborhood Parks Council (San Francisco, California). 38.100.34.2 23:29, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b>With regard to reply by <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichMac_732c.html" title="User:RichMac">RichMac</a>, there are nearly 150 member groups under the Neighborhood Parks Council and 14,000 folks actively on our mailing list, many of whom, I'm sure, would like to contribute to the Neighborhood Parks Council wikipedia entry, but are unlikely to do so while the article is scheduled for deletion. Highlighting me as the "sole contributor," seems diminishing and hardly rewards an earnest effort being made to rise up to the standards of the community. There is a learning curve here, and the sheer element of time involved, so if you seek a diversity of points of view that will strengthen the NPC Wikipedia entry, then simply approve it, so we can move forward with improving upon the article. BTW, my "agenda" is (a) to be passionate about a topic (related to preserving, sustaining, and developing green open space) and (b) creating a wikipedia entry that is worthy and meets the standards of the wikipedia community. There are thousands of entries in Wikipedia that portray much more of conspicuous agendas than this entry being submitted by park/green open space advocates in San Francisco (see Wikipedia entries: <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Republicans_96d7.html" title="Young Republicans">Young Republicans</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">Pro-life</a>, the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Communist_Party_6035.html" title="Revolutionary Communist Party">Revolutionary Communist Party</a>,or the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphalt.html" title="Asphalt">asphalt</a> entry that provides links to the National Asphalt Pavement Association. <a href="http://www.asphaltinstitute.org" class="external text" title="http://www.asphaltinstitute.org" rel="nofollow">The Asphalt Institute</a>).--216.102.91.242 14:40, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
