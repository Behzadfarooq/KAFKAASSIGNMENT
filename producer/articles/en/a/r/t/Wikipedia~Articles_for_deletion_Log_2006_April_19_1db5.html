<li><b>delete</b> I think the threshold of notability for web comics that would serve Wikipedia best is that the author makes money out of it (other than a few token from online advertising). Otherwise, we run the risk of having a flurry of vanity articles from anybody who draws. I nominated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_webcomics_5bf6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of webcomics">this related article</a> a while back but it didn't pass. Regarding this present case, the web-site doesn't sell books, are ask for a pay subcription and therefore doesn't pass (my newly create rule). Therefore, I think it should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruguiea_91de.html" title="User:Bruguiea">Tony Bruguier</a> 02:40, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see no reason why this entry should be deleted. The mere domain of a site does not constitute the value of its content. On the subject of the comic's lifespan, the comic has been around for a month and will continue to be around for many years to come. Just because it hasn't existed for an extensive amount of time doesn't mean that it will die out in a matter of weeks. I think that this entry should be kept. --Icehawk24000 01:02, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Is AFD even the place for this? Why don't you just transwiki it over to the Norwegian wiki and let them take care of it?

<li>There is no other obvious place for it (and also transwikis to wikibooks or wiktionary often go through AfD). I don't think transwiki'ing a nonsense article or advertisement to the Norwegian wiki (I don't even know whether this is Bokmal or Nynorsk) is going to do any good. I would transwiki good articles in languages I speak, but nothing that I'm not certain about.

<li><b>Delete</b> — If something can be <i><b>sourced</b></i> around the use of the term in regard to multiple cantons following Calvin (not just Geneva), set against Zwinglian and Roman Catholic cantons, then that information should be incorporated into the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation_in_Switzerland_aa7b.html" title="Reformation in Switzerland">Reformation in Switzerland</a> article. The other states mentioned are either not Calvinistic <i>per se</i> or are not confederations. Regarding William of Orange, the Netherlands are a constitutional monarchy, and any confederation of nobles needs to be shown to be described in some scholarly source as being called a "Calvinist confederacy". If this article were well-sourced, then there would be no AfD; but it is not sourced at all. A generic link to the Institutes does not suffice as a source. &#160;<font style="background: lightblue" color="#000000">&#160;&#160;<b>GUÐSÞEGN</b>&#160;&#160;</font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a><a href="../../../x/_/_/WP%7EX_5545.html" title="WP:X">X</a></small>&#160;– 18:38, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - From the first paragraph: the "confederacy" was a "confederation based on principles"...well, no, it was a "system" ... or a "union"! So who participated in the confederacy? in the union? Who followed the system? Who knows? But ... the Libertines opposed it, on the grounds that Calvin was a "snoop"! That last word gives away the show. The article seems intended not to describe a real political entitity, but to portray Calvin in a POV manner: as a snoop. A MUCH better pair of articles would be one on Calvin's view on church-state relations (perhaps as part of a larger article on the history of church-state relations: preConstantine, Constantine, Augustine, Greg. the Great, Charlemagne, high Middle Ages, the Reformation, Henry VIII/Elizabeth I, French Revolution, ..., Kline, Rushdooney?!) and one on politics during the Reformation. This overview [<a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/John_Calvin.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/John_Calvin.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] leaves little room in the chronology for a union of Geneva with other cantons, and I've never heard of such (although TeKE seems to have ... what do you have in mind?) <a href="../../../j/r/c/User%7EJrcagle_8a9a.html" title="User:Jrcagle">jrcagle</a> 20:56, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think it is a mixtape prepared by some fans (from shows perhaps) and distributed on a few websites <a href="http://www.datpiff.com/tape_detail.php?mid=36" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.datpiff.com/tape_detail.php?mid=36" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Yes, as a HS, it deserves its place on Wikipedia. However, the article needs an <i>incredible</i> amount of clean-up and removal of POV elements. In fact, everything on all of the clubs really needs to be removed (as I don't think any HS clubs or activities need their own sections unless they won some sort of national championship in something). Especially in this article, all of the info on clubs/activities is completely non-notable. My favorite sentence is "In January 2006 all three band performed in a Jazz competition."

<p>Originally prodded by me, and removed by page creator without comment. This is nothing more than a spamvertisement for a nn boat.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I dunno... if there were really 1100 sold that seems like a lot. Musicians are notable if they've sold 5000 albums, and surely a boat is worth several album-copies worth. If each boat cost $10,000, that would mean $11 million changing hands due to this thing. I'm not voting keep, though, because deletion seems intuitively reasonable. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 03:15, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Actually the classified ads on the net are advertising the things for over $50K. The boat seems notable enough, but the Worldcruiser link needs to go. It is not the manufacturer of the boat, but is conveniently enough a supplier of replacement parts for it. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 03:27, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Prodding the article one minute after its first edit and sending it to AfD after 30 minutes, without talking to the editor, is one heckuva way to welcome <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">new editors</a> to the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. (Disclosure — I own one...&#160;;-)
<ol>
<li>This is not a spamvertisement — the boat hasn't been in production since 1978 (I think).</li>
<li>The Westsail 32 is one of the most, if not <b>the</b> most, notable production fibreglass cruising boats ever made. It spawned countless imitations, and led to a massive revival of the "double-ended" Archer-Atkins hull style.</li>
<li>It sold 800 copies in just a few years which is <b>phenomenal</b> for a large cruising boat (even 30-year-old used copies are selling for $50,000 - $60,000, so more than a few albums' worth), and I don't know if it's ever been equalled.</li>
<li>It's probably the one boat that every cruiser would consider the "ultimate" cruising boat, in terms of being "the original", slow, stodgy, but absolutely seaworthy world cruising boat.</li>
<li>They're bloody beautiful! (OK a bit pf POV creeping in there...&#160;;-)</li>

<dd>Seriously, please don't make judgements about notability of this article without consulting some sailors, particularly cruising types.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is my impression that contemporary painters and other visual artists, excluding the <i>most</i> famous and most media-savvy individuals, are underrepresented on Google; this may well be true for a Bulgarian icon painter, even one living in England. Wikipedia also doesn't have any notability recommendations suitable for this typ of case. If she has had public commissions for somewhat significant clients and locations, such as for <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_1d4f.html" title="St Paul's Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> (as mentioned in the article), that is a claim to notability, but I would like more details on the nature of these works. I'm still undecided about this. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 06:14, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm gonna go <b>keep</b> in this case. Google has a decided and well documented systematic bias in many cases. That's why it's not the end-all of deciding notability. (Don't get me wrong, it's plenty helpful in many cases...). Assuming the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_1d4f.html" title="St Paul's Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> claim is verifiable this is borderline pass of WP:BIO. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.Smith</a> 19:03, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I totally disagree. I wrote this article and as far as I’m aware, Silvia Dimitrova has no idea about the existence of this article. The most prestigious Cathedrals in England ordered her icon paintings and every single “premiere” of her icon was a big event. She is truly one of the best icon painters and I do not see a point and logic in deleting this article. I do apologise that there are only 360 so-called “google hits”, but it is not my fault that people are not interested in this type of art. More over there are less important articles on Wikipedia which should be deleted immediately, but they are still up and running. This article will be developed, however I need more time and materials, because it is difficult to gather information on such a “individual” artist, who is not a public person, but her works are well known in specific environments. PLEASE DO NOT DELETE!! P.S. "She was also nominated and shortlisted for the European Women of Achievement Awards 2000 for contributions to the Arts"; it means something- doesn't it?! ---Mzalewski 21:15, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. She seems notable enough for mine if the claims in the article are correct. However, under <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">our verifiability policies</a>, we would need information from reliable third party sources such as reviews of her works, mention in books about modern day iconography or artists etc to permanently establish her notability. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 21:26, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is a lot about her way of icon-painting in Alan Ogden's "Revelations of Byzantium", Appendix. April 2001 (ISBN973-9432-32-8) (he analyses the iconic art using her paintings as an example). You can also have look at: <a href="http://www.london.anglican.org/page3505" class="external free" title="http://www.london.anglican.org/page3505" rel="nofollow">http://www.london.anglican.org/page3505</a>. There are many articles about Dimitrova in big newspapers, but I do not have links... She was mentioned in many brochures about icons but, once again, I don't have a link, etc., to prove it's true. ---Mzalewski 21:45, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. If there are mentions of her in the book, it should be cited as a reference in the article. I will have a look at the Anglican org article and add it as a reference. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 23:55, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - this one turns on sourcing for me. "Ghits" (Google hits) are not the only way to be notable, IMHO. If she has significant sales, presence in the art community, critical notice, mention in art journals or texts, those all contribute notability too. How much is needed may not be completely clear, but getting verified info of that sort into the article would be good... if it's not already at this point there. The comments at the bottom (from reviewers? Critics? they are untagged) are good but they need sourcing (and some demonstration that the commenters have some weight). No (non)vote for now because I could see this either way. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:09, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>You should consider that this product is the evolution of an older one... Maybe people should inform and add information before delete something. Or -at least- discuss it. I'm talking about many people, nobody in spec. Do whatever you want, whatever you feel it's right, BUT always discuss it before, isn't that right Where are the limits&#160;? 70, 700, how much is "a lot"? Why Sensatio Binaural keywords on Google? Is everything on Google? Science Magazines doesn't even exists? Just because you don't know it, it doesn't means you can delete whatever is new for you. Again, I'm talking to nobody in particular, this is a retoric question..- BTW; Why there's still a link in Meditation to a free program and the link is still there, and that link was there before my free contribution for wikipedia. This is a constructive article, do whatever you feel it's correct, but we should always be respectful with the collaborations and opinions from other people on wikipedia.</li>

<p><b>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</b> Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Lists of <a href="../../../f/a/q/FAQ_1fe9.html" title="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</b> Wikipedia articles should not list FAQs. Instead, format the information provided as neutral prose within the appropriate article(s). You may want to consider contributing FAQ lists to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>.</li>
<li><b>Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics</b> such as quotations, <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphorism.html" title="Aphorism">aphorisms</a> or persons. If you want to enter lists of quotations, put them into our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">Wikiquote</a>. Of course, there is nothing wrong with having lists if their entries are famous <i>because</i> they are associated with or significantly contributed to the list topic. Wikipedia also includes reference tables and tabular information for quick reference.</li>
<li><b>Travel guides.</b> An article on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> should mention landmarks such as the <a href="../../../e/i/f/Eiffel_Tower_5c34.html" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> and the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre.html" title="Louvre">Louvre</a>, but not the telephone number or street address of your favorite hotel or the price of a <i>café au lait</i> on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es_373d.html" title="Champs-Élysées">Champs-Élysées</a>. Such details are, however, very welcome at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a>, but note that due to license incompatibility you cannot copy content wholesale unless you are the copyright holder.</li>
<li><b>Memorials.</b> It may be sad when people die, but Wikipedia is not the place to honor them. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered by their friends and relatives.</li>
<li><b>News reports.</b> Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories (however, our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> does exactly that). Wikipedia does have many <i>encyclopedia articles</i> on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news, and can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> for examples.</li>
<li><b>Genealogical entries,</b> or <b>phonebook entries.</b> Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety. One measure of achievement is whether someone has been featured in several external sources (on or off-line). Relatively unimportant people may be mentioned within other articles (e.g. Ronald Gay in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_gays%2C_lesbians%2C_bisexuals%2C_and_the_transgendered.html" title="Persecution of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered">Persecution of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered</a>). See <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipeople" class="extiw" title="m:Wikipeople">m:Wikipeople</a> for a proposed genealogical/biographical dictionary project.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../d/i/r/Directory.html" title="Directory">Directories</a>, directory entries,</b> or a <b>resource for conducting business.</b> For example, an article on a radio station generally shouldn't list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, etc. (although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable). Furthermore, the Talk pages associated with an article are for talking about the article, not for conducting the business of the topic of the article.</li>
<li><b>Instruction manuals</b> - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice ( <a href="../../../l/e/g/Wikipedia%7ELegal_disclaimer_595c.html" title="Wikipedia:Legal disclaimer">legal</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedical_disclaimer_7dd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Medical disclaimer">medical</a>, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Main_Page">Wikibooks</a> is a Wikipedia sister-project which is better suited for such things. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_draw_a_diagram_with_Dia_4471.html" title="Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia">Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia</a>.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The principles of Wikipedia are interpreted and put into place by consensus, and that consensus is firm on the undesirability of cruft. Cruft is certainly a bad thing in any encyclopedia striving to be accessible and useful. Now if you want random infinite collectors of trivial information, they already exist; they're called "search engines." They're about as useful as Wikipedia would be if we let in anything anyone wanted to post. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:49, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Or that the competiton is viewed significantly by people that hire engineers (are there "scouts" or recruiters there?)

In a wiki-world where elementary schools are deemed "notable" enough to have entries, I see no reason why university student societies of significance cannot.

<li><b>Keep</b>-- <i>for now</i>. If the McMahonism thing is over and done with and never referred to again after Backlash, I'd vote to delete the article, as it would then refer to something that happened for two weeks and was over with. But McMahonism has the <i>potential</i> to be part of a larger storyline involving a stable of wrestlers loyal to Vince McMahon, and if that's what's going on here, then obviously the page should be kept.

<li>Subject is perhaps the most significant local pop-culture reference on one of the largest music sites in Australia. Is frequently referenced humorously, and usage of his name and image has crossed over onto other local sites and is well-known within these communities. Article is a great reference point for those who do not fully understand the references. Metallicamate, although somewhat localised, is somewhat of an internet phenomenon in Australian music, and is often used to characterise certain elements of Australian music culture. Although internationally somewhat irrelevent, the article is certainly relevent and helpful to a large amount of users who are part of these mentioned communities. <a href="../../../e/s/q/User%7EEsquared_au_84aa.html" title="User:Esquared au">Esquared au</a> 07:48, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bear in mind that wikipedia has a global audience, and ought not have everything about local affairs in it. See the official wikipedia policy: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. He's not a <i>major local (political) figure</i> as I can determine, has received no significant (any?) press coverage, though he may, as your argue have been <i>achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events</i>. Have a good look at the criteria. It's not my decision to delete it, others will have to respond too. Meanwhile, work on improving the article as much as you can. If you make it a well worked-out article in conformity with wikipedia norms (including verifiability), there's a good chance it won't be deleted even if sub-notable. Good luck!</dd>

<dd>The point is not that he is a blogger, the point is that in Australian music he is somewhat of an internet phenomena, something that is still referenced and discussed daily, and is a story that many people still need explained to them very often. You're completely ignoring the wider circumstances around this article - it's not simply a registered user on a forum, and to trivialise it down to that is just plain ignorant. It's like saying "all your base" is just the opening sequence of some obscure game. <a href="../../../e/s/q/User%7EEsquared_au_84aa.html" title="User:Esquared au">Esquared au</a> 00:46, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. "No proof?" Google it for yourself and follow some of the many, many review links and the ones referencing its use in the classroom.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Having a book listed and reviewed at Amazon is not a big deal nor does it prove it is <b>a well-known or high quality academic work.</b> 500 google hits is not very many for a "well known" work.

<p>I appreciate that the original author added some citations after I tagged this entry with 'prod' last week. Reviewing the evidence, though, I still think this is a vanity page. (1) googling for "david tham" and nanoknowledge turns up nothing but this page, a similar promotional page at everything2, and a corporate bio that cites the wikipedia page, (2) a global periodicals search in Nexis for "david tham" and nanoknowledge turns up ZERO hits, and (3) an ABI/INFORM search of academic literature for the same search string also turns up ZERO hits.

<li><b>Comment</b>. That's not a bad Alexa ranking by any means, but that's like saying the outfit that makes the silicon for a number of computers is "notable," a word a lot of Wikipedia editors seem to feel is synonymous with "ubiquitous."

<li><b>Keep</b>. They're more than a registrar, they're a large web host/ISP. The article includes non-positive information so to describe it as advertising suggests Ardenn hasn't actually read the text of the page.

<li><b>Comment</b> I also looked at the articles on Google. I felt these were just repeated copies of press releases issued by the company. Also, <s>WebFusion</s> Webhosting.info suggests that they may not be the UK's largest, but instead come in third.<s><a href="http://www.webfusion.co.uk/popups/largest_web_host.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webfusion.co.uk/popups/largest_web_host.php" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></s>(original source<a href="http://www.webhosting.info/webhosts/tophosts/Country/UK" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webhosting.info/webhosts/tophosts/Country/UK" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>) It really comes down to how many companies like this you think we should have on Wikipedia. It is no wonder that debates on similar companies (see above) have tended to end in "no consensus." -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 14:48, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a notable company with an interesting history. The fact that they come up 3rd on Google for "web host" suggests that they're a big host and are probably doing something right. Netcraft's recent figures say they're the world's largest Windows 2003 web host. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilbowonka_5a95.html" title="User:Wilbowonka">Wilbowonka</a> 21:19, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Those pages tell us he's a postgrad student. He's taken lots of universty courses (surprise). He's studied with some notable professors, but that doesn't make him notable. He's directed some ensembles that are anonymous (in the English link) or that no-one has heard of (second link). He is a member of a composers' assocation (no evidence that any notability is required to become a member). He's founded lots of groups (big deal). As a composer, has his music been performed by musicians who are themselves notable? Has it been published by a major music publishing company? As a conductor, has he conducted a notable orchestra or ensemble? Are any recordings of his conducting or compositions available commercially? <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 05:50, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>All comments by <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> are erroneous and false. Abras is not a postgraduate student anymore (besides, you can achieve notability even while being a student). Not everybody is accepted -as Abras was- to take university courses at the prestigious institutions he attended (where legends like Karajan, Abbado, and Mehta, for instance, studied too: University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, Austria, just for naming one). The ensembles Abras conducted (I checked them one by one) are not anonymous at all; they are simply not listed in this article. The Argentine Composers Association -Abras is a member of that institution- was founded in 1915 as "National Society of Music" and is one of the oldest and most prestigious composers associations of Latin America (of course, not everybody is accepted for becoming a member). Some of Abras scroes and CDs are, indeed available commercially (this was checked too). Abras was designated conductor of two of first-class Argentine Orchestras (this was verified too). Conclusion: all comments by <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> may be product of the evil, non authoritative, jealous and envious mind of, maybe, a frustrated musician that possibly doesn't even know how to read a music score.

<li><b>Comment</b> Dear Wikipedia authorities: Yesterday I have been told that Juan Manuel Abras, a notable young Latin American composer, internationally aclaimed by the Argentine and European media, has become the victim of an evil, envious and unjustified attempt of discrimination by a Wikipedia user named <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a>, who posted false and erroneuos information about the subject in order to support his wicked action, while attempting to confuse fresh comments written by new users with sockpuppets. Having created this account, named Perelli, I checked the truth of this statement and I energically demand from Wikipedia administrators to protect the mentioned article from deletion and not to avoid further activities by <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> or other users that show similar behaviours, activities that are not only totalitarian and against the claimed Wikipedia conventions and policies but also violate the many human rights defined in international law and covenants. This activity will be properly denounced and prosecuted if serious actions are not taken. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerelli_f0de.html" title="User:Perelli">Perelli</a> 20:31, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Music Master, you have made many personal attacks. You have broken the laws regarding libel. Go read WP:NPA immediately. What the hell are you talking about human rights and international law? No one has the RIGHT to an article here. Also, this isn't a vote. 1 edit newcomers and anon editors don't get a sway here. Their comments are taken with very little weight. Stop making socks, OR stop defending them. If your not involved you have no idea if they are a sock or not. Oh yeah, threaten me legally.

<li>With such insightful people as yourself "policing" Wikipedia, I'm sure it won't be long before it declines into something even more meaningless than it is at the moment. Who are any of you to say whether something is noteworthy or not? Also, why has it only been flagged as "vanity/advertising" now after being on here since 11th July last year? Phill.corbett 07:48, 21 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that it has taken since July to get nominated for deletion is a marker of its lack of notability. It means its taken this long for someone to even find it -- I only found it because I was disambiguating links to Newcastle. If you think that wikipedia is "meaningless... at the moment" then you shouldn't be concerned with your article being deleted.

<li>How can you acuse me of advertising someone elses website when you said yourself it's taken this long to get anyone to notice it? What would be the point? Isn't Wikipedia a place for people to write articles about people, subjects and places regardless of whether they have a good Alexa rating or so many millions of Google hits or whether three people believe it is noteworthy or not. -Phill.corbett 11:57, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Phill, Alexa and Google are just tools we can use to compare how well known people, blogs, podcasts, bands, etc. are. It is usually not the end of the story and some topics are notable that don't register well. The question before us here is whether or not Phil Coyne has done something remarkable and verifiable that distinguishes himself from all other individuals with blogs/podcasts (we can't cover everything/everyone). We also try to follow criteria that have been agreed upon by more than the 3 or 4 people who are voting in this debate (see e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). Also, spam does find its way into wikipedia (not to say your article is just spam), and even if human editors don't see it, search engines do--this is typically what the spammers want to increase their rank on internet search results. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 14:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I think it should not be deleted. This girl is not just a blogger but a growing writer. I have known a school where she is really popular (the children using her writings as their reference). This is not just about the blog but the girl that will soon become popular. So I nominate it will not be deleted. But I don't think that's the case. Of course being her as a Christian she'll experience "Discrimination". --Kimber143 21:24, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I did not put this woman information here for popularity or for my space thing. Why would I do that? The reason why I put her because like the person who said at the upper one, she is a growing writer and as I have told, someone had asked her from wincosin school to make a book about her. Although my vote of course is not to delete, I respect your words. But please do respect my article. --Lmae 21:36, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've always been bemused at the widespread belief that the meaning of the word "fair" is "letting me get my own way." Wikipedia isn't a "free place," per se -- it is a private encyclopedia with rules and guidelines for inclusion, and articles about people need to satisfy those criteria to be considered worthy of inclusion. We're not here to "respect other people," whatever that means. We're here to respect Wikipedia's rules. Take a look over <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for the criteria that apply in this instance. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:00, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Indeed Chetters is probably a mate of Hugh Minnock. All the latter's edits are concerned with this article or his user page where he has saved the floor two article with the comment " I have set this lil page up so that the annales of floor two may be kept safe from above mentioned editors". When I welcomed him on his talk page last night and pointed out that what he was doing was damaging the serious endeavour of Wikipedia, he blanked his talk page within minutes. I was involved in an earlier debate about Halls at Exeter when they all were merged into one. It seems to be particularly full of idiots who want to add nonsense and vanity stuff to their Hall article(s). Since they got on my watchlist then, I have been reverting nonsense regularly. Hugh, you should not save this article on your user page. Wikipedia is not your private web site. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 22:28, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable student group. Ardenn is altogether correct when she intimates that, irrespective of the propriety of her nominating the article of a newbie, the group is non-notable; no decorous welcome would change that. There are cases in which the subject of an article can be identified as notable even where no assertion of notability is made; in such cases it is surely appropriate for an editor either to improve the article him/herself or to contact the creator and suggest that he/she edit the article in order that notability should be established (or at least that an assertion should be essayed); here, even asd the article presents a good deal of information about the subject, it is eminently clear that the subject is non-notable, which term we generally ascribe to student groups save those which are university-wide (see, e.g., student governments, especially at Canadaian colleges and universities) or otherwise notable (see, e.g., <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a>). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:06, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The EUS is an internationally known group. In Vancouver alone we are known extremely well for 'hanging the bug', and our red jackets which can be seen all over the city. Many engineers worldwide also have these red jackets. Internationally we also have recognition from our many stunts as seen in the article. I would be more than happy to expand on some of the stunts. FYI The Queen of England, Prince Charles, Boris Yeltsin, and Scotty from Star Trek all have been given reds and have worn them (exception: the Queen did not wear hers to my knownledge). <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_clare%40hotmail.com_8a47.html" title="User:Ryan clare@hotmail.com">ryanc</a> 21:13, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>We have been through situations like this in history before with the likes of the logical positivists.</b> While the intentions of the logical positivists were to remove false and untruthful facts, they lacked consistency in their definitions for what was 'notable.' I see here similar inconsistencies in determining what is 'notable.' Case in point, explain to me how this is more 'notable' than a well meaning and prominant engineering society <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Monkey" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Monkey" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>.

<li>Well, Mr Brand-New Editor, you might have had the ghost of shred a possibility of a point if the comparison in your cliched "If X article exists, why can't mine?" argument (I swear, I'm going to start numbering them, for convenience) was to an article that had been through the AFD -- which, <i>quelle surprise</i>, it hasn't. Of course, the article you dredged up from whatever dark corner of Wikipedia you found it has nothing -- vip, zero, nada, nil -- do with the actual article under discussion, either in terms of subject area and appropriate notability standards.

<li>I re-worded my entry so it was less of an 'attack.' Though the entry here before was a slight 'personal attack,' entries shouldn't be simply editted by others. A lot of valid points were missed when someone editted it. Oh...and the way it was editted... spectacular.. really I don't know how missed ommiting some of those valid points...

<li><b>Keep</b> even though as an arts grad I should oppose on principle&#160;;-) I'll agree that it's undesirable to have an entry for every little club that might form on any given campus. That said, I have no opposition to articles on student clubs that have established a significant presence, even if it's within their own campus. There are a few student societies popping up on AfD with enough frequency that I've begun to suspect it's a bit arbitrary what makes one "notable" and another not. I've seen it suggested that one can substitute a place like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a> and the entry would still fail notability. Let's take a look at some of the entries on clubs at Harvard: Harvard Computer Society; <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard-Radcliffe_Science_Fiction_Association_6464.html" title="Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association">Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association</a>; <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_club.html" title="Final club">Final club</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The EUS has traditionally had a prominent (and often controversial) presence on the UBC campus, and it has established a certain international notoriety over the years. The annual stunts during Engineering Week have attained [<a href="http://batman.mech.ubc.ca/~eus/stunts.html|" class="external text" title="http://batman.mech.ubc.ca/~eus/stunts.html|" rel="nofollow">local</a>], [<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/insite/AS_IT_HAPPENS_TORONTO/2001/2/6.html|" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/insite/AS_IT_HAPPENS_TORONTO/2001/2/6.html|" rel="nofollow">national</a>], and even [<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/goldengateproject/" class="external text" title="http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/goldengateproject/" rel="nofollow">international</a>] attention. I agree that the page needs a substantial rewrite to focus on the aspects of the EUS that <b>are</b> noteworthy to readers outside of the UBC community. However, it should <b>not</b> be turfed just because it is a "student society". Successfully planning, coordinating, and executing schemes to "borrow" the Speaker's chair from the BC Legislature, hijack the Rose Bowl trophy from the University of Washington, and hang Volkswagen Beetles from (among others) the Lions Gate Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge is, I think, worthy of an article. I'll also add my voice to those asking "Why are we doing this again?"

<dd>Since Vancouver is the economic Hub of British Columbia most people in BC get their news from Vancouver. The Vancouver Sun has on various occasions covered the exploits of this engineering society. Thus anyone in BC knows that the UBC engineers attempt MIT-esque pranks. The authors of the article should simply link to the news coverage and then this would be a non-issue. This isn't made up one day. The pranks are basically repeated every year. My complaints with the article is that the authors did not take the necessary time actually go and collect links like this: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/05/MN60371.DTL" class="external text" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/05/MN60371.DTL" rel="nofollow">Beetle Overboard!

It's not really for me to say if I'm notable or if it should be deleted but I would rather have it deleted than have a whacking great box sitting above it in cyberspace for all eternity suggesting people supply "verifiable" information. I don't know how anyone can verify anything very much beyond birth certificate, contracts anyway - or you could go out and buy the books, three of which sold more than 5,000 copes and one of which goes into paperback in August. I tried to remove the last three paragraphs as they probably are just puff, but I was not allowed to: they were re-instated. I think the box was sitting there for about a month, I sent three e-mails and it looked like nothing was ever going to be done about removing it or to decide whether to delete the entry or not.

<li><b>Keep</b> as notable. Why would FHM need wikipedia to advertise? This sounds like a notable yearly thing by a notable magazine.

<p>Brooklyn College's B.A.-M.D. is a notable program at the City University of New York. It receives 500 applications a year from some of the New York Tri-state Areas brightest students, of these, it only accepts 17. B.A.-M.D. is also a pipeline program that the princeton review mentions in its guide of medical schools under SUNY downstate, the major state medical school of NY and the only state school in NYC. Lastly, AAMC cites it under its book of medical schools with BA/MD programs. <b>keep</b> <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbabymonkey_5ac9.html" title="User:Mrbabymonkey">Mrbabymonkey</a></p>

<li>The program accepts 17 of <i>500</i>, not to mention <i>many more</i> that are advised not to apply by school counselors due to the program's extreme selectivity (most students in the program finish in the top two percent of their class, and the median SAT score is in the 98 percentile).

<li><b>KEEP</b>. Combined programs are very different from standard pre-med undergrad in that they often have their own unique courses and curriculums.

<li>check the ip addresses, no sockpuppetry here. Although i must say there is something awfully wrong when someone tries to add content to wikipedia but is shot down everytime for apparently little reason. What does it need to be notable enough to have its own page? does it have to be affiliated with an Ivy-league? Do you have a problem with the fact that someone who wrote about it is a "n0ob" maybe? Should I write a cute "about me" page first? B.A.-M.D. has been around for 37 years and is a fairly well known program in the New York tristate area. Just because the wikipedia deletion police has never heard about it, does not mean it does not exist.

However, I do not believe that Wikipedia needs to have individual articles about joint degree programs merely because they exist. The only thing that Wikipedia needs to say about this program is "Brooklyn College offers an 8-year B.A.-M.D. program with SUNY Downstate Medical Center," with a link to the program site at <a href="http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bamd/bamdmain.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bamd/bamdmain.html" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>.

<li><b>KEEP</b> The BA-MD program at Brooklyn college has been in existence for almost 40 years and has graduated over 600 physicians, almost all of whom are in active practice to this day in almost all fields of medicine ranging from primary care physicians in underserved areas, to cutting edge research, to highly specialized surgeons. By allowing this entry to remain, and added to, wikipedia allows those who search out physicians who have such a broad educational background provided by the BA-MD program a place to find them - via a (hopefully) eventual graduates list like many other educational institutions. Yes, the program is small, but that is what makes it unique. With so many high school students choosing to apply to such programs, and wikipedia increasingly being used as a de-facto search engine, this is an excellent way for students to find such relevant information. With so many articles on relatively useless topics ranging from cartoons to pornography, this entry has positive social implications and should be expanded upon.Chakrabs 02:20, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>""KEEP" This is a credible entry. The information is accurate as can be confirmed by comparing it to the linked websites. The number of students in the program has nothing to with whether or not this article should be included. The primary issue of concern should be the accuracy of the content. This article can be a source of valuable information for students who are applying to the program as wikipedia is becoming a popular source. Often time official websites can be hard to find or present a lot of information that can be presented in an intimedating way. This article allows students to learn about this program in clear way. Because the program is relativly small and many times unfamiliar to many potential applicants, an article about it is even more important.

<li>KEEP This school has admission rate of 3.4% of its applicants with a median high school GPA of 3.8 unweighted and median SAT scores in the 98th percentile. That academic criteria alone only grants a student an interview, during which the students charachter, extra curricular promise, problem solving skills, cultural refinement, and interpersonal skills are evaluated. For nearly 40 years we have been offering a superb medical education while still allowing students to pursue the benifits of a liberal arts background at the minimal cost to the student. For example, the undergraduate education is FREE because these exceptional young students are elite to say the least. They defer admission to schools such as Dartmouth, Yale, Columbia, Georgetown, Cornell, Brown University, and Washington University St. Louis to name a few. Students in this program also have a mean MCAT score of 32.3 which is well above the national average, as well as the average MCAT score for matriculating students. By not allowing this program to have a full entry students who are very bright, talented, and the paragons of success may not have access to an education; furthermore, this page must be seperate from Brooklyn College's because most of these elite students are interested in the program itself, and thus may not be able to reap the programs advantages and opportunities if it is merged with brooklyn college's page - Ravi815 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.134.137.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.134.137.77_a671.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.134.137.77">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Strange how there are suddenly all these experts on this school's particular academic program coming out of the woodwork. Attempting signature forging grossly hurts your case, guy-who-wrote-this-article.

<li>Yes, because I, like most people, have at least 10-15 computers at my disposal. Perhaps, this program just effects more people than some of us previously thought. And hypothetically speaking, in the <i>ridiculous</i> event that I don't have 25-gazillion computers, shouldn't the movement of so many people to save one article, that is, to setup accounts and learn how to edit wikipedia, be enough to preserve this one article? <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbabymonkey_5ac9.html" title="User:Mrbabymonkey">Mrbabymonkey</a>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd like to point out that any given college student has access to "25-gazillion" computers. And to answer your question, no it isn't. I'm pretty sure that editors who have actually spent time on WP, rather than new users who started just to protest this AFD, have more weight in issues such as this. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 06:03, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, let us not be presumptuous, and assume I am a college student. Let us not assume anything including that these new users have set up accounts to protest this one issue. Second, the City University of New York is closed for passover break, and assuming I am affiliated with it, I certainly wouldn't have acces to "25-gazillion" computers at 2 in the morning. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbabymonkey_5ac9.html" title="User:Mrbabymonkey">Mrbabymonkey</a>

<li><b>Comment</b> The quality and ability of editors on Wikipedia cannot be based solely on how many edits have been made in the past. I have been an avid Wikipedia user for a while now. Just because I did not create an account and make edits does not indicate that I am unaware of how Wikipedia works and the policies that it keeps. I also particularly take offense to people claiming that I do not exist, and that I am actually just another of the gazillion computers at Brooklyn College run by Mrbabymonkey. It is in fact possible that more than one person exists who passionately and articulately expresses their defense of the page. You can check the IP addresses, and you'll notice that my computer does not have Brooklyn College's IP address. So for all of you "valid editors" of Wikipedia, I'm sure everyone would appreciate it if you backed off on your false accusations and trivial "comments" and just listened to what we have to say.

<ul>
<li>It isn't. And your comments are welcome. However, since there is no way to distinguish accounts with no previous edits from people who've just signed up for one to influence an AfD discussion, their remarks are given less weight. Keep editing Wikipedia and eventually your comments will be given more weight (also because you'll start familiarizing yourself with Wikipedia policy). <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 03:08, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It was rejected because there was nothing left in it for deletionists to cling on to. The keep criteria had been reduced to a level which all nonimated school articles are raised to during the process and it therefore served no possible purpose. In other words it was a default "keep all". Can you not show the good grace to accept that, move on and stop wasting time on this issue? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 02:08, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The problem is that the arguments to keep every school article are not unique to schools. They're the same arguments that could be used to keep any article (in other words, there's no such thing as notability). Pretty much, verifiability = notability.

Also, I just realized that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html#Structure" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH#Structure</a> dictates that the school's own sources cannot be used.

Nothing there is any kind obligating rule. In fact, I personally (while logged out) wrote the "References" piece which you refer to. I did that, to encourage higher standards. However, I did it entirely on my own, and had no authority to impose any rule on anybody.

<p>Other intentional communities such as Twin oaks and Acorn community are listed in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It is the largest cult with a self-created religion in the United States.

<p>This amateur and childish version of Polish history has no redeeming features. The title is all wrong, as Poland was never a formal empire. The material is already covered in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Poland_f479.html" title="History of Poland">History of Poland</a>. The rambling article is written in a manner that can only be called unsophisticated, to put it mildly. Section titles are so ridiculous, they are actually humorous. There are obvious copyvio problems. Some of the content might, after considerable rewriting, be moved into the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Poland_f479.html" title="History of Poland">History of Poland</a> article, but quite frankly I do not think that is worth the trouble. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 22:44, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, or <b>Merge</b> what can be salvaged (if anyone is brave enough to attempt that). At the very least, leave the term as <b>Redirect</b>. It may be a matter of perspective as to whether or not Poland was an "empire" (some texts do use the term), despite the "formality" (by whatever standard that implies). Even though the nominator is correct that the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth (for lack of a better term) never styled itself as an empire, people may very reasonably search for that term despite the correctness of it.

<li><b>Delete</b> How can Napoleon I have helped Poland achieve the 3rd May Constitution 8 years before he came to power? Why does Sobieski and the Turks take up about half of the whole article? Why is this called "Polish Empire" when there was never a Polish state in history to proclaim itself as such? This article is misleading and misinformed, with a worrying emphasis on "conquest" and "empire" considering the fact that Poland has been one of Europe's least expansionist nations! The writer should get his priorities right when writing about Poland as he is not doing their reputation (or Wikipedia's) any favours however good his intentions.--Ohollo 17:01, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I split the article into Oncotype (related to cancer) and <a href="../../../o/n/c/Oncotype_%28Denmark%29_6d51.html" title="Oncotype (Denmark)">Oncotype (Denmark)</a> for the design firm. Someone should nominate the design firm separately if they want to delete it. Oncotype as a term used in cancer research appears to be relatively new (24 PubMed hits) but could very well enter into wide use as the technology to perform gene screening on cancer patients becomes less expensive and more useful in clinical settings. However this article is just an advert. This could either be rewritten or deleted and recreated with non-advertsing content. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 11:26, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
