<dd>I'm going to begrudgingly accept your verdict on most of the disputed matters for the sake of a civil discussion but you've still not addressed the primary concern, this team is not noteable according to wikipedia's rules on noteability. The only reference given is the team's own website not an external source. You say it is part of a noteable group and it gains noteability whenever the group is refered to, like a magazine might have the article: "The BCAFL, whose members include the Washington Tigers and the Surrey Stingers, will be sponsoring a team in the marathon to raise money for lukemia." That would be a trivial reference, nothing to do with the team itself. If you can prove that Surrey Stingers is noteable by it's own merits, rather than just because it's part of a group then I'll stop complaining and let it stay.
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I think it's pretty presumptuous to say that even though you're the only one who has a problem with the page, you get to decide whether to "let it stay". Sometimes people don't agree with you (in good faith). Tone like this does nothing to win support for your argument. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasonpatriot_1b91.html" title="User:Masonpatriot">Masonpatriot</a> 15:49, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This just seems to contradict the rules of wikipedia. Homer Simpson gets his own page but Apu's children do not get individual pages because they are not noteable, they are part of a combined page. Perhaps a few BCAFL pages should consider being merged into, say, Minor teams in the BCAFL?</p>
<p>I do aknowledge the comments about my tone, and I appreciate perhaps it should have been a little more civil. But so far the only three reasons given to keep it are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want the information to be kept...somewhere. (Dissobays wikipedia's rules, wikipedia is not an indeascriminate collection of information)</li>
<li>The group is noteable so the team must be. (I think this is illogical, by the same token every branch of Tescos, Sainsburys and Argos could have its own page)</li>
<li>You were quite rude when you suggested it for deletion. (Maybe I was, maybe I wasn't but that doesn't change the article and it's the article we're here to discuss)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I'll say this one last time. I do not think the Surrey Stingers are noteable enough to warrant a page on wikipedia. Can anyone find proof that they are?<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimondrake_cba7.html" title="User:Simondrake">Simondrake</a> 13:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, here are some external sources that publish Stingers information (I have linked specific pages when possible:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/SURREYSTINGERS.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/SURREYSTINGERS.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/SURREYSTINGERS.htm</a> This is a 3rd-party site with Stingers news and information.</li>
<li>www.hot-iron.co.uk A website about Scottish teams, but it does include information about opponents.</li>
<li>www.touchdownclaymores.com The former Claymores website contains a lot of BCAFL information, mostly in the forums.</li>
<li>www.nfluk.com The British NFL page, it also contains lots of BCAFL information in the forums.</li>
<li>Lastly the magazine First Down features news and game reports for EVERY TEAM in BCAFL, they do not have a web page but I will buy an issue and scan the Stingers page if it will calm you down.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I will say this again: Why have you singled the Stingers out for this treatment? There are several other BCAFL teams that are even less notable than them but you have left their pages alone. The fact that you are a Surrey student makes this seem like a petty vendetta against the Stingers American Football team.<a href="../../../j/s/k/User%7EJskivington_dbb6.html" title="User:Jskivington">Jskivington</a> 15:32, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This debate is a mess, it's become more about my tone and calling me petty than it is about the page. The bottom line (And the top line, if you'll look at the topic instead of worrying about my tone) is that I do not think this team is noteable on its own. The fact that there are other pages out there that are less noteable is a topic for another day, this discussion is about Surrey Stingers.<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimondrake_cba7.html" title="User:Simondrake">Simondrake</a> 16:17, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, this line of inquiry could be considered relevant if there is a possiblity that you are approaching this discussion from a position of bad faith. Regardless, it seems like closing this issue is in order given the path and results of this discussion. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> seems to tie things up nicely. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasonpatriot_1b91.html" title="User:Masonpatriot">Masonpatriot</a> 01:20, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, one last time. Despite my tone, faith or creed, despite me - Are Surrey Stinger Noteable?<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimondrake_cba7.html" title="User:Simondrake">Simondrake</a> 03:47, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, since you are the one that brought this issue and the article has existed without problem for well over a year, I would think that the burden is on YOU to prove non-notability. Plenty of points have been made above by MLA, Black Falcon and Jckivington to support notability. Are you saying that just because you want to disregard their arguments, you're right? All you've said is that the Stingers aren't notable, but haven't said why (except to dismiss what others say and post blanket links to wikipedia policy). I don't see this as unreasonable. Like I said above, though, this seems to be a dead issue at this point. -<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasonpatriot_1b91.html" title="User:Masonpatriot">Masonpatriot</a> 04:07, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Their evidence of noteability is not valid according to wikipedias rules, which is what I said from the start. No one has provided evidence that is valid by wikipedias rules on non-trivial external references and the incredibility of forums. I'm just going to give up now because this is getting rediculous. It seems like a simple logical connection, this page is not noteable by wikipedias rules so it should be deleted unless noteability could be proved according to the rules.<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimondrake_cba7.html" title="User:Simondrake">Simondrake</a> 04:13, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You keep on saying according to Wikipedia rules, but you are yet to note a single rule that this page does not conform to despite numerous requests, you keep on going "aginst the rules, against the rules!!". When someone stands up in court they are charged with an individual law violation not just "he broke the law". You also said "I do not think that this team is notable on it's own" which implies that your arguments are not based on any rules but a dislike for this individual page or team. This amuses me given the fact that you falsely claimed that this page is non-neutral, but that is a much better description of you.<a href="../../../j/s/k/User%7EJskivington_dbb6.html" title="User:Jskivington">Jskivington</a> 03:26, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. The team is very minor, but given that they are part of this: <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Collegiate_American_Football_League_1ab3.html" title="British Collegiate American Football League">British Collegiate American Football League</a>, and that the article forms part of a very complex whole, the nomination to delete is highly unlikely to succeed. An argument might be put forward that all the teams should be mentioned only in the parent article - however, there is already enough information on each of the teams to justify a split off. The amount of information on the League is sufficient to justify its existence on Wiki. The only debate would be as to how the information is organised. And it seems from looking at the matter, that the information is organised in the most helpful manner at the moment. All that this discussion is doing is causing upset. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimondrake_cba7.html" title="User:Simondrake">Simondrake</a> clearly felt the article was worth a discussion to see if other people felt the same way as he did. That's fine. I would agree the article needed testing. It has now been tested and found satisfactory. It is clearly going to become even more satisfactory (rather than less) as time goes on. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 22:22, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
