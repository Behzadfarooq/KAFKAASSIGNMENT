<p>This article was nominated for deletion on July 30, 2005. I closed the VfD on August 7, 2005 with a consensus to delete, and deleted the article. That VfD can be found below. <a href="../../../m/-/f/User%7EM-filecastle_2dc3.html" title="User:M-filecastle">User:M-filecastle</a> brought it to my attention that the article had undergone a significant rewrite and that the existing VfD might not reflect actual consensus. (All delete votes were cast before the rewrite.) I investigated, and found that the article had indeed been revised extensively (from a stub to a decent-sized article). In the interests of fairness, I have agreed to re-submit the article to VfD for a new consensus. <b>I am not voting in this nomination</b>, and I will not close the new result; it will be left to the descretion of a different admin. <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> Â· <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 04:05, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Again? Please. The <i>encyclopedic</i> content of the rewritten article boils down to the following: *:<i>Ralph Woodrow is an evangelical Christian minister. [Dates and bio-info here.] He formerly supported the theories of <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hislop.html" title="Hislop">Hislop</a> as to the syncretic or pagan origins of Catholicism and wrote a book saying so, but has since changed his views and written another book saying so. [Links to ISBNs of Woodrow's two books here, and to Woodrow's external site.] End article.</i> Anything more than that, including minutiae about the shape of manna, ziggurats, and the like, is OR, rant, and crank. The persistent proponent of this article does himself no favors with his idiosyncratic prose and layout style. Sorry, the good Pastor Woodrow is not the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venerable_Bede_a5f1.html" title="Venerable Bede">Venerable Bede</a> or even <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L.

<p><font color="purple">The Original Link (found on Hislops Two Babylons Wikipedia page) finds Hislops ideas discussed in minutiae <b>covering these very same topics</b>. So the original article (with false assumption in detail) is appropriate, yet its crticism, by one of its most noted detractors is not? The purpose of the 'minutiae' in the original argument is to lay out the very case that Christianitys roots are pagan. The purpose of the 'minutiae' in the rebuttal is to lay out the very case that Hislop was in error. <b>The Woodrow article IS ABOUT HISLOPs BOOK because the very link that references him (Woodrow) distinguishes him as a critic of it.</b> Woodrows second book is about the VERY SUBJECT of refuting Hislop.</font></p>
<p>Assuming that the value of the need to view the rebuttal is found worthy of 'Wikipedians' perusal, undoubtedly Woodrows page will ultimately be expanded and 're-written' further so as to give an even more in depth understanding of the errors of Hislop.</p>
<p>Just as the referenced <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venerable_Bede_a5f1.html" title="Venerable Bede">Venerable Bede</a> finds aspects of his life, works, struggles, and ideas ... so would any 'completed' article on Woodrow. Many Wikipedian articles, within themselves, and through links, show both PRO and CON views of the subject. The article on Woodrow is following in the established Wikipedian style and allows the reader to understand how one set of ideas may have been falsely arrived at. (and WHY)<br /></p>
<p>Is it 'more appropriate' to take these very same Woodrow facts and examples and <b>incorporate them into the body of the Hislop articles</b>, or more reasonable to provide the link to the Woodrow page that discusses them. --<a href="../../../m/-/f/User%7EM-filecastle_2dc3.html" title="User:M-filecastle">M-filecastle</a> 21:16, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>This topic should not be deleted.</b></p>
<p>The subject matter is religion.</p>
<p>Is Humblefool? an editor of this type of topic?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a series of articles that suggest that Christianity comes from pagan origins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such articles are all over the internet and on Wikipedia as well.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The debates on this topic are widespread and involve both Christians<br />
(interdenominationally) as well as 'non'believers</p>
<p>Mr. Woodrow originally wrote a book - <b>AGREEING</b> that there are pagan roots to Christianity. It was very popular.</p>
<p>It (his book) took many of its assumptions from earlier works by <b>Alexander Hislop</b> (Wikipedia) as well as his theories regarding <b>The Two Babylons</b> (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The Wikipedia articles on the above -2- subjects <b>LIST Mr. Woodrow</b> as someone who has argued <b>AGAINST</b> these points of view.</p>
<p>THE ARTICLE IN QUESTION GIVES MR WOODROWS point of view as to why he found his own earlier work, as well as the work of Alexander Hislop, <b>to be fraudulent and in error.</b></p>
<p>Any reader of this particular subject would have great interest in understanding that Christianity, while it is accused of being from pagan origions, is NOT in fact .... and that the historical facts do not support such a claim. Mr. Woodrow, and his book REFUTE these claims.</p>
<p><b>ONE OF ITS VERY PROPONENTS (Woodrow)</b> is now one of its critics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the purpose of Wikipedia if not to inform the reader to give them insight into each side of a subject and a broader understanding of the topic.<br />
Wikipedia <b>already LISTS a LINK to RALPH WOODROWS name</b>as being a critic of the Hislop - Two Babylons theory .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LEAST Wikipedia could offer its readers is what Mr Ralph Woodrows actual thoughts on the matter are!</p>

<p>Much of what is in the original articles by Alexander Hislop<br />
(Two Babylons) are unsubstantiated and are no more than his opinion.<br />
Apparently Alexander Hislops saving grace (here) is that he is long dead.</p>
<p>Mr Woodrow is a known critic (and one-time exponent)<br />
of those very same 'opinions'.</p>
<p>His POV or 'opinion' is RELEVANT for that very reason.<br />
And although some may quible with his syntax or 'phrase-ology' ...<br />
I would argue that the very VALUE of his words are because of JUST THAT<br />
because they ARE his words ...</p>
<p>When other peoples thoughts and ideas are recorded here -<br />
is it incumbent upon the gallery to edit their thoughts&#160;?</p>
<p><br />
Were there an article on Princess Dianna's criticism of the press (here)<br />
- would we correct her statements for grammer or use of analogy?</p>
<p>In an article on the Pope, (here) would we edit his remarks<br />
so as to reflect the Protestant view?</p>
<p>The views expressed are those of Mr Woodrow -<br />
any reader of such a text link would understand FROM HIS WORDS<br />
that what they were reading WAS HIS VIEW ...</p>
<p>Isn't that the point&#160;?</p>
