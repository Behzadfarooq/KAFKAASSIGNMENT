<p>United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure: Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Narcotics Facts of the Case</p>
<p>Under California's Compassionate Use Act of 1996, the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative was organized to distribute marijuana to qualified patients for medical purposes. In 1998, the United States sued to enjoin the Cooperative and its executive director. The government argued that the Cooperative's activities violated the Controlled Substances Act's prohibitions on distributing, manufacturing, and possessing with the intent to distribute or manufacture a controlled substance. Although the District Court enjoined it, the Cooperative continued to distribute marijuana. Rejecting the Cooperative's medical necessity defense, the court found the Cooperative in contempt. On appeal, the Court of Appeals concluded that the medical necessity defense was a legally cognizable defense. On remand from the Court of Appeals, the District Court modified its injunction to incorporate a medical necessity defense, under which medically necessary distributions were to be permitted. Question Presented</p>
<p>Does a medical necessity exception to the Controlled Substances Act's prohibition on the manufacture and distribution of various drugs, including marijuana, exist? Conclusion</p>
<p>No. In an 8-0 opinion delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that there is no medical necessity exception to the Controlled Substances Act's prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing marijuana. "The statute reflects a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception, " wrote Justice Thomas, therefore, "medical necessity is not a defense to manufacturing and distributing marijuana." Justice John Paul Stevens' concurring opinion, which was joined by Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, argued that "[b]ecause necessity was raised in this case as a defense to distribution, the Court need not venture an opinion on whether the defense is available to anyone other than distributors." Justice Stephen G. Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</p>

<p>Brighton boys are a gang of boys. They are all mates and travel from country to country searching for hidden treasure. While they search they sometimes come across other gangs. When this happens they have a total all in brawl. with weapons of all sorts. After the gang is finished they steal their clothes and items. The brighton boys have found alot of valuable items and sell them on ebay for a profit. Many girls are attracted to them but they cant help it they are just too hot. They have a secret base located on a deserted island. This island was used for resources many years ago but now no one lives there. Finally the gang is getting bigger as weeks go on soon the population of the gang will be so strong they could take over the world.</p>

<p>Kittybot is a futurstic sci-fi comic set in a place that does not resemble Earth. The comic is still in its infancy, but the cover and name of the comic indicates that large robots are somehow involved. Architecture of the known world seems to be based on large plant life and green illumination.</p>
<p>Claire's current art style within the comic is cel-shaded full colour. Construction is entirely digital.</p>

The theme engine draws the actual widgets, and can be configured with 'themes' that invoke the theme engine with different configurations. It is the default theme for many Linux distributions including Fedora core 4 and 5, Ubuntu before 6.06 and SUSE. Many users have contributed themes that have changed the colours and some visual effects, leading to a huge number of clearlooks based themes on theme sites such as art.gnome.org art.gnome.org and www.gnomelook.org GnomeLook</p>
<p>The README distributed with Clearlooks 0.6 reads</p>
<p><i>This is a GTK+ 2.x engine based on Bluecurve. It features a modern look without sacrificing (much) speed.</i> The lead developers are Richard Stellingwerff and Daniel Borgmann</p>

<p>The local tavern is a much-respected establishment in the hinterland and is purported to a venue where scholarly individuals would come to confer on matters of great importance. It has also the scene of great storytelling and some say the art of the seanachai is honed in the taverns confines. Some more cynical locals have been known to question the legitimacy of some of the elevated tales and yarns that have been chronicled to the clientele. Nevertheless, as the taverns patrons say “to drink amongst the learned, is to be learned in itself”. Wise words indeed. The tavern has also been the scene of great individual human feats that have been likened to those of the Fianna and the Firbolgs in ancient times.</p>

<div align="justify"><b>Kiteboarding Report Dot Com</b> is an extensive online resource for kiteboarders and other wind or water sport enthusiasts.</div>
<p align="justify">Established in May of 2006 by Kevin Kelley and Jesse Anders, the site offers unique information such as wind and weather reports geared specifically for kiteboarding as well as a vast array of valuable articles for beginners and professionals alike. “Our goal” says cofounder Jesse Anders “is to promote and maintain the well being of this fledgling sport and give kiteboarders the tools they need to create a thriving online community. For instance we currently have the most extensive and up to date list of www.kiteboardingreport.com/resources/kiteboarding-schools.htm Kiteboarding Schools in the Unites States.” In addition to lists of kitesurfing schools, the website has an online forum and an annual photography contest.</p>
<p align="justify">The company also has lofty goals to be a top presence on the internet. “We would like to see kiteboarding report at the top of search engines when people search for terms such as kiteboarding resources or even just kiteboarding.” stated Kevin Kelley. “In fact we are already #1 on MSN.com when searching kiteboarding schools.” Both Kevin and Jesse maintain that it is important that resources and information sites can maintain top slots in search engines in spite of all the money that is being spent by large companies to create top ranking websites. Anders states “There is a stand off between those who believe that the internet should be a capitalist resource and those who believe it should be an informative resource. We believe it should be both, but currently there is a ton of internet marketing pollution and spam that companies like Google are defending themselves from. We do not want to be a part of that problem”</p>
<p align="justify">All money aside, Kiteboarding Report is an exciting new addition to the internet which will no doubt help to improve and instigate the kiteboarding community.</p>

<p>Leonard Koscianski</p>
<p><br />
This is about an artist named Leonard Koscianski. His art work is different he uses thing that would be in every day life and makes them look extraordinary. Leonard kosicanski was born in Cleveland, Ohio. Leonard Koscianski is an artist that is famous for his work of nationalistic art work, and his post-modern, and imagery, and ferocious animals. Leonard art style is a nationalistic; Leonard received a degree from Cleveland institute of art, and a master degree from the University of California, Davis. Leonard Koscianski feels that artist have been given an insight into a certain aspect of life, they just express the facts that they see. Leonard Koscianski says that Political, social, and economic changes are happening all the time around us he feels that none of his work has been affected by war of famine, how ever one of his children died as an infant and that was a catastrophic time for him on a personal level. Some of the work that he had done around the time of his child’s death is the “Fire-eaters” he say that “ An airborne raptor vs. an earthbound dog, Flaming brambles vs. orderly, suburban homes; cool, heavenly light from above vs. hot firelights from below”. I feel that this is a picture that is showing heaven and hell fighting for the soul of his child and since the house is so far away it will be easier for the birds of heaven to get there for his child and help provide comfort for the family. Leonard Koscianski says that the availability of materials has made it much easier for artist these days, since they are able to pick up a phone and have materials delivered to their studios. Leonard Koscianski says since this is available to him it makes it much easier for him to create larger paintings and it takes just a little less time then it normally would have. Some of the greatest developments made would be computer graphics and digital photography, he used a program called 3-d studio Max to create models that he would use for inspiration for paintings. Leonard Koscianski didn’t really collaborate with any one, but helped his friend Ray Troll with one of his installations. My artist was influenced by a number of artists that inspired him when he was young and helped him become an artist. He was inspired by Vincent Van Gogh (his art not his ear), Pablo Picasso (again his art not all of his girlfriends), and Rembrandt which was one of his most favorites.</p>

<p>Leonard Koscianski</p>
<p><br />
This is about an artist named Leonard Koscianski. His art work is different he uses thing that would be in every day life and makes them look extraordinary. Leonard kosicanski was born in Cleveland, Ohio. Leonard Koscianski is an artist that is famous for his work of nationalistic art work, and his post-modern, and imagery, and ferocious animals. Leonard art style is a nationalistic; Leonard received a degree from Cleveland institute of art, and a master degree from the University of California, Davis. Leonard Koscianski feels that artist have been given an insight into a certain aspect of life, they just express the facts that they see. Leonard Koscianski says that Political, social, and economic changes are happening all the time around us he feels that none of his work has been affected by war of famine, how ever one of his children died as an infant and that was a catastrophic time for him on a personal level. Some of the work that he had done around the time of his child’s death is the “Fire-eaters” he say that “ An airborne raptor vs. an earthbound dog, Flaming brambles vs. orderly, suburban homes; cool, heavenly light from above vs. hot firelights from below”. I feel that this is a picture that is showing heaven and hell fighting for the soul of his child and since the house is so far away it will be easier for the birds of heaven to get there for his child and help provide comfort for the family. Leonard Koscianski says that the availability of materials has made it much easier for artist these days, since they are able to pick up a phone and have materials delivered to their studios. Leonard Koscianski says since this is available to him it makes it much easier for him to create larger paintings and it takes just a little less time then it normally would have. Some of the greatest developments made would be computer graphics and digital photography, he used a program called 3-d studio Max to create models that he would use for inspiration for paintings. Leonard Koscianski didn’t really collaborate with any one, but helped his friend Ray Troll with one of his installations. My artist was influenced by a number of artists that inspired him when he was young and helped him become an artist. He was inspired by Vincent Van Gogh (his art not his ear), Pablo Picasso (again his art not all of his girlfriends), and Rembrandt which was one of his most favorites.</p>

If it encountered ordinary mass, then both could "cancel out" each other's existence, in the same way that positive and negative electric charges can cancel out each other's effects.

<p>Dr. Forward extended those ideas in considerable detail -- even used them in a science-fiction novel -- and named the cancelling-out process, when ordinary mass meets negative mass, "nullification". At this time there is no evidence that negative mass (and negative energy) can exist -- but neither is there any evidence that it cannot exist. (It mght be noted that there are places in General Relativity where the existence of negative mass/energy would allow things like <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Faster_than_light.html" title="Faster than light">faster than light</a> travel.)

<p>In the spring of 2005 Chas Portch AKA Tombstone To Hell sent a private message at W-E Forums to one Fire Wolf wondering if he was interested in setting up a wrestling forum. FW was interested and the Blade Wrestling Forums were born. Blade began at the very bottom of the forum chain as an Invisionfree Board. Blade Wrestling, found here, then added Babatunde Bistara AKA Bubba T to its administration and was staffed by known members of the IWC such as William2k2DJ, The Evolved and OHSNAP.</p>
<p>Then in August 2005 Blade moved and became an Invision Power Board forum. Blade had now moved up in the world and was becoming more and more popular. This new version of Blade added more renowned users to the staff such as Raw Is Jericho, [Rockstar CC] and TM1.0. Blade version 2 can be found here.</p>
<p>As winter began, Blade reached new heights as it moved to vBulletin in November and gained the domain name bwforums.net. Staff members additions for the vB Blade included well known W-E Forums moderator, Pyro™ to the administration team. Blade had become one of the top forums of the IWC in less than a year. However, Head Admin Fire Wolf was forced into a leave of absence and Blade was put on hiatus for several months.</p>
<p>Now in April 2006, the Blade Wrestling Forums have returned as a bigger and better discussion board. Blade's amazing staff, great graphics designers and top of the line wrestling discussion will send it back to the top of the forum world. Even though co-owner james Fardi sold the license, Blade has still survived with the addition of Neil. With recent launch of a an efed and rumours and talk of a wrestling news site what will be next for the Blade Wrestling Forums?</p>

<p>Realizing there was no single organization which recognized Florida International University's campus life leaders, five students gathered in <b>October of 2003</b> to establish the first honorary leadership society at FIU named "Order of the Torch." These five student leaders include: <i>Omar Castillo</i>, <i>Sanjay Dhawan</i>, <i>Marlon Font</i>, <i>Kadian McIntosh</i>, and <i>Clayton Solomon</i>. The initiators acknowledged that involved students at FIU would most likely follow the same path of being leaders and playing important roles within all aspects of society. Moreover, they were likely to remain committed to their alma mater. The founders sought to apply the brilliant individual strengths towards united goals. The organization stressed leadership development and university advancement as seen in the motto, <b>“Non Mihi, Non Tibi, Sed Nobis.”</b>translated to mean <b>"Not for you, Not for Me, but for Us"</b>. By <b>September of 2004</b>, Order of the Torch had inducted nineteen outstanding student leaders, who by election and attainment, held places of prominence and confidence in the student body.</p>

<p>The purpose of the organization is to provide recognition to students who have excelled in their leadership roles and made significant contributions to the Florida International University community.

<p>The Order of the Torch will have as its members the uppermost percentile of the most prominent student leaders on campus. <b>Among the university population of 37,000, the society very selectively admits only 30 or so members from the university's undergraduate and graduate population.</b> The Order recognizes students that have demonstrated their moral character, integrity and exemplary leadership through active service to the university. Becoming part of this selected group of students is a prestigious honor. Membership to this organization is a lifetime commitment.</p>

<p>A Once hearful Jedi by the name of Tai'an Ameythir, he embraced the darkside after a series of sith attacks on his homeworld of kal'vorta. He took upon lord rank of the sith after he single handedly took on a regiment of 50 jedi and slaughtered them all.</p>
<p>His favorite weapon was his prized, and hand crafted SNFS, which stands for Sonic Nanotech Fusion Saber. It was red bladed with a hint of purple in the cortosis crystal embalmed within it. His hilt was pure chrome laced with a black trim and modified for a stronger emmitted blade. With his blade he tore through the jedi regiments one after another eventually winning the war for the darkside. Little did he know that war still raged on throughout the galaxy, and would continue so for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Currently, Executioner is not with the Off the Hook TV group, as he is trying his luck with rap, and/or thinking about going back into wrestling.</p>

<p><b>Ogetrap</b> - n. colloquial English circa 2006 (Ōg-trapp) - An ogetrap is a strategically created and displayed sample of work disingenously designed for shameless self promotion. An employee that creates and stages visual displays of their work as a means of ingratiating him/herself to their superiors is said to be "building an ogetrap."</p>
<p>The etymology of the word is said to have originated from "ogre trap" - the act of trapping a surly boss or "ogre" into paying attention to recent accomplishments as a means of gleaning respect or admiration.</p>
<p>Related use of the word: A bachelor/bachelorette may employ similar tactics to endear himself to a romantic love interest by placing impressive sporting paraphernalia, photos, medals, trophies or reading material in their home or car to make themselves look more interesting, athletic or wealthier than they actually seem. Although this is strictly speaking not an ogetrap it is often used in this manner.</p>
<p>The most famous examples of an Ogetrap were said to be Renaissance era paintings or frescoes that were often created to curry favour with local religious figures.</p>

<p>Appellants' 15-year-old son, Gerald Gault, was taken into custody as the result of a complaint that he had made lewd telephone calls. After hearings before a juvenile court judge, Gerald was ordered committed to the State Industrial School as a juvenile delinquent until he should reach majority. Appellants brought a habeas corpus action in the state courts to challenge the constitutionality of the Arizona Juvenile Code and the procedure actually used in Gerald's case, on the ground of denial of various procedural due process rights. The State Supreme Court affirmed dismissal of the writ. Agreeing that the constitutional guarantee of due process applies to proceedings in which juveniles are charged as delinquents, the court held that the Arizona Juvenile Code impliedly includes the requirements of due process in delinquency proceedings, and that such due process requirements were not offended by the procedure leading to Gerald's commitment. Held:</p>

<p>A parametric equaliser is an <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_filter.html" title="Audio filter">audio filter</a> that allows the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency.html" title="Frequency">frequency</a> of maximum cut or boost to be set by one control, and the size of the cut or boost by another. These settings, the frequency level of the peak or trough, are two of the parameters of a frequency response curve, and in a two-control equaliser they completely describe the curve. More elaborate parametric equalisers may allow other parameters to be varied, such as skew. These parameters each describe some aspect of the response curve seen as a whole, over all frequencies. A <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equalization.html" title="Equalization">graphic equaliser</a> provides individual level controls for various frequency bands, each of which acts only on that particular frequency band.</p>

<p>Kiddonet is a network for, as you might guess, kids. My own have been using it sucessfully and here are their reports: Alex: Kiddonet is really cool. You can chat with all your friends, and also play games. It is the best place to go for games, and all the cool stuff kids today like to do. Sally: The best part is the Chatter Box. That is cool, because you can talk to friends, and people who aren't friends. That is the end of the reports. You may be concerned that children do not know who it is they are dealing with, or exposed to online. This may put many in dangwer. So, if your children are condsidering joining it, be sure to teach him/her/them that Safety is the most important feature. In this fast-paced world, it is important for (are we on generation z? Y?) this generation to understand internet safety. Try typing in Web Safety or something like that later for more tips. However, it is also important for your child to know that sometimes, sitting down with a quiet book is every bit as satisfying as the Kiddonet.</p>
