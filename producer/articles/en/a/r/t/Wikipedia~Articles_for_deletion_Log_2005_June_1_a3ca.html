<li>First: <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_McCormick_6316.html" title="Kenny McCormick">Kenny McCormick</a> isn't large.

Second, the reason that <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_McCormick_6316.html" title="Kenny McCormick">Kenny McCormick</a> is the length that it is is because it's terribly written. For example: Why, since Kenny <i>doesn't appear</i> in any but one episode in season 6, does that article include the <i>individual episode titles of every other episode</i> in season 6, <i>twice</i>? <b>Redirect</b> and by making the escape route of growing another article unavailable to them thereby force the editors of <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_McCormick_6316.html" title="Kenny McCormick">Kenny McCormick</a>, who think that that article is so large, to find some ingenious way of making the article shorter whilst not removing content that is <i>actually connected to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_McCormick_6316.html" title="Kenny McCormick">Kenny McCormick</a> in some way</i>.

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Virtually all the voters argued that the then-current version of the article should not be kept. The comments specifically addressing whether or not this band meets the recommended criteria at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> were also split with at least 2 voters explicitly <i>not</i> expressing an opinion on that topic. Reviewing those standards myself, I am not convinced that a "one-hit wonder" that topped at #71 on a niche chart qualifies. I note that criterion 3 sets the bar at "two or more albums on a major label".</p>
<p>The article was substantially cleaned up during the discussion period but I note that none of the voters in this discussion decided to reverse their votes. Of the two people voting after the clean-up, one argued "keep" and the other "delete". I take this to indicate a lack of confidence that the cleanup was enough to address their concerns.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my discretion on this one and call it as a delete but without prejudice against the re-creation of the article if/when the band someday becomes notable. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:22, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The sisters Helene Rask and Johanne Rask Arnesen seem to fall into this last category.</dd>

Why deny any man the right to be known for who he is, or even who he wants to be? Maybe it is "incoherent vanity." But what is the sum total of history if not incoherent vanity?

<li><b>undecided</b>, clearly needs cleanup to remove pov, etc, and most of the waffle should go (but with the appropriat outlink). I suppose to be a feminist one has to be <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female.html" title="Female">female</a>, but one can agree with certain tenets of feminism whilst being male. This I think is usually expressed as <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, but if anyone can come up with a more specific widely-used term. The piece's author Mr Flood seems to be the only one who refers to this as "pro-feminism" on the WWW. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">âº</a> 14:41, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Utterly useless neologism and original research. Therefore it violates the deletion policy. On the content, all I can say is that it is rambling and a cherry picking of things that bother the author. There is no such thing as "feminism," as "feminism" refers to not one, but dozens of developments of thought, so there is no such thing as being pro-feminism, for one is always pro- one type/strand of feminism and never all of them. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:29, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a perfectly good article about an encyclopedic website. It's difficult to take a second nomination seriously when it's barely a week after the first was closed. If there were an "endless revert war", this suggests that the article should be protected, not destroyed. As it happens, there doesn't seem to be significantly more revert warring than on comparable articles. However, the nominator, <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmileyrepublic_1cbc.html" title="User:Smileyrepublic">User:Smileyrepublic</a>, seems to have been engaged in a pointless edit war in the past day or two. I'm issuing a warning to him to stop.

<p>Okay, I know some people are "keep all real places" so let me explain: This rock is completely unpopulated. There are far more many such rocks and reefs off the coast of Norway than there are schools in the United States.

<li><b>Delete</b>, as the article is a falsification and probably abuse. There was a chimp called Oliver that walked upright and had less hair than a chimp normally does (e.g. seemed more human than the average chimp) but was genetically 100% chimpanzee.

<p>Neologism: The use of the term to refer to the group of young conservative politicians in Japan is not an established one in South Korea, Japan, or the rest of the world. It is only a name that the author of one news article of <i>Choson Ilbo</i> uses to call those Japanese politicians. The term that the author of the news article uses is not even "neoconservatism" exactly but "neocons," and his use of the term is not of scholastic definition but rather of pejorative manner with an insinuation to the famous neoconservatives of the U.S. If someone wants to write about the group of conservative Japanese politicians, it should be written in "Politics of Japan" or "Japanese politicians" or some other generic namespace related to Japanese politics. <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaintjust_103b.html" title="User:Saintjust">Saintjust</a> 15:26, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think we should <b>keep</b> it as is, as I expressed on the article's talk page. I think it's a bit hasty to make a judgement that this is an isolated neologism. âthames 04:41, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. The author of this namespace rather seems to be concerned about creating another neocon article to add to the list of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservatism.html" title="Neoconservatism">neoconservatism</a> rather than genuinely interested in those Japanese politicians on their own merit. <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaintjust_103b.html" title="User:Saintjust">Saintjust</a> 14:10, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I didn't have any agenda when creating it. I personally don't like the term neoconservative, since it is euphemistic at best. But after reading those Korean news items (cited as references), this namespace seemed the most appropriate place to put the information about this group of Japanese politicians. The <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Japan_d399.html" title="Politics of Japan">Politics of Japan</a> article doesn't really seem to have a place to discuss a small faction like these "neoconservatives"âit focuses on parties principally, whereas the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservatism_%28Japan%29_76e9.html" title="Neoconservatism (Japan)">Neoconservatism (Japan)</a> article focuses on a group not drawn principally along party lines. âthames 16:24, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Update:</b> I've added another reference link. This is from the <i><a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_Times_80a1.html" title="Japan Times">Japan Times</a></i>, a Japanese english-language newspaper. It's written by a (presumably American) professor teaching in Tokyo. It also refers to Shinzo Abe and Shigeru Ishiba as "neoconservatives".

<li><b>Keep</b> What? Vanity page? If you talk to those who know about these things in the UK, this is hardly a vanity page. This is a man who was imprisoned for a lengthy period of time for his beliefs, and has never fully recovered from his experiences. Talk to any genuine left-wing student at any of Britain's more 'academic' universities, and you'll find his name held in the highest esteem. It's mainly due to the UK's capitalist press that he's been almost excised from general political consciousness (such as it exists now in the UK) - not the case whilst the Morning Star (Socialist Worker) was still around. Is this yet another attempt by capitalist society to try to delete this hero of so many true socialists from ever having existed?

If you don't believe it, go to www.ohsaa.org and research the Division I Austintown/Youngstown Regional Track Meet results. I bet you will see a very familiar name in first place. Also, he DID shave his head, he DOES like to pronounce "Nicaragua" that way, he IS AP Stats student of the year, he LOVES leaders with big muscles and loud voices. It is the truth. You guys are just mad because you can't run fast.

<li><b>Do not Delete</b>. This article is certainly a laudable attempt at absurdist humor and as such represents an exemplar of pre-post-modern deconstructionist structualism and a solid refutation anarcho-syndicalist nihilistic existentialism. Anyone who reads this article and concludes otherwise only demonstrates his clear bias towards this latter school of thought; his vote should be ignored. It should also be noted that he certainly has no tolerance for either curling irons or baracudas.

<li>Is there in fact any article that could <i>not</i> be kept as long as people deem it "useful"? The issue is how all five Scandinavian languages are related to one another, not how each individual language is similar (or dissimilar) from one of the others.

<ul>
<li>Note: There are only three Scandinavian languages: Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. Also, the relationship between Danish and Norwegian is of special interest because modern Norwegian is <b>developed from Danish</b> (they were almost entirely the same written language until 1907).</li>

Were it not for nationalism and orthography, the Mainland Scandinavian languages might be considered mere dialects of one another today. And, mind you, the information in this article is of very low linguistic value; it has been written by someone of very shallow knowledge of even basic linguistics. The section on prepositions is not particularly representative and includes blatantly false info including info on the combined definite artilces/<a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstrative_pronoun.html" title="Demonstrative pronoun">demonstrative pronouns</a> under "Prepositions". On top of this I just noticed that the info on the use of the Danish definite article are just plain false. "Den" is in this case a combined demonstrative pronoun and definite article, but Danish uses the same definite endings as in Norwegian and Swedish except that the syntax is slightly different; Swedish and Norwegian use the definte suffix <i>-n/-t</i> in situations where Danish does not. As an example, the word <i>bil</i> is inflected identically in singular definite/indefinte in Swedish, Danish (and Norwegian?); <i>bil</i>, <i>bilen</i> ("car", "the car"). The differences could really be described in just one paragraph and without redundant examples, and could be generalized to include far more dissimilarities at one time. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 04:06, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish are the prototypical examples of how the distinction between languages and dialects is often arbitrary. Those three are considered separate languages, but are all mutually intelligible. We should, therefore, have some discussion of the relationships between the languages. If this article is kept, I would definitely hope to see similar articles comparing Danish and Swedish as well as Norwegian and Swedish. Alternatively, a single article comparing all three would be fine. As yet another alternative, all such comparisons could be merged onto the page <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavian_languages.html" title="Scandinavian languages">Scandinavian languages</a>. Since I have no real preference between those options, <b>no vote</b> besides the probably unnecessary "do not delete". -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> 03:54, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, the article should stay and let me elaborate on this. First of all, the term HYPS is widely used among people in the know. College counselors refer to it and people refer to it in many internet discussions. Second of all, there is a page called "HYP" that appears to have gained legitimacy. This "HYPS" page seems no less legitimate, and definitely reflects upon its wide usage on the internet.<br />
Times are changing, and internet publications like chat forums and talk boards should be taken seriously. They are a new form of print media in the 21st Century, and Wikipedia, of all organizations, should respect this. Therefore, I think that the fact that HYPS is widely used among internet chat forums is evidence enough of its legitimacy. It's equivalent to dictionaries like Webster inculding slang words like "cool" in its entries.

<li>However, nobody puts Oxford or Cambridge in acronyms used to describe the best schools. HYPS is commonly used, and based on that criterion, I feel that it should be included. If people started using HYPSO or HYPSOC to include Oxford and Cambridge, I would not be opposed to using that acronym. Anyway, this is not a contest about which colleges are better. This is simply a proposal to include a commonly used acronym in Wikipedia in order to better inform people and to spread the wealth of knowledge on the web. There is no ego-stroking here, just information exchange. <i>User:Stanford08</i>
<ul>
<li>Forgive my semantics, but my "nobody", I assume you mean no American that you know of. I imagine they probably have acronyms over in Europe too. I would recommend <b>Transwiki</b> to wictionary (if others consider this appropriate).

<li>I am sorry for commenting so much on this page, and I promise this will be my last one for this particular vote for deletion. Anyway, I just wanted to say that since HYPS is an actual acronym that is certainly used fairly frequently, I think it would be a great disservice to the users of Wikipedia to deny them this useful piece of information. I would understand the need for deletion if HYPS was some made up term, but it is definitely well-established. I hope that in the future, when the term HYPS becomes too well-established to ignore, Wikipedia will allow this topic to have its rightful place in this section. Thank you all for participating in this vote, and I look forward to collaborating with you guys in the future.

<li>As the owner of VGF, I will remain neutral (I'm assuming this is allowed). I was considering voting delete to blend in, but I'll resist that temptation for the time being. I'm not voting keep because keep votes apparently aren't particularly welcome in this discussion (looks like at least one was deleted and one was blasted for being the same as two delete votes, which nobody mentioned), and I don't particularly care whether this article remains or not anyway. If I did care, I'd PM our 50 most active forum members and have them descend on this topic. It's pretty apparent where this vote is headed, since most of the people who have voted thus far appear to be either new to the Internet or just don't know that much about video game sites. That said, I have a few comments about the site (I'll try to be brief... apologies if this is too long).</li>
</ul>
<p>VGF has a fairly long (8 year) history. It started out as a single site that was updated on an excessively frequent basis, at least twice daily every single day (all original content). The community, which remains a strong focus to this day, was a large part of that. In a short time, it was built up to a very respectable stature in the video game site genre. As it became more popular, it evolved into a network. This was very successful, and VGF soon became one of the top video game networks in the world, reaching 25 million monthly page views at its height and owning several of well known sites. This allowed it to partner with all the major ad networks while I personally became among the most prominent voices in the online advertising community as one of the most respected members of Geekvillage and Gethighforums, as well as a writer for Adbility. Granted, this was only 1/4th of IGN's numbers at the time (though certainly respectable by any standards and on par with others like GX - Gamers.com, FGN, and Gamefan), but we didn't have $1 billion (with a b) to flush down to the toilet either. To the contrary, I was dirt poor when I started the site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a couple years ago as the bubble was fully bursting, without the financial backing the major corporations had (and even they all either collapsed or had to be bought out to survive), it became necessary to make cutbacks, including deliberately killing off traffic. As a result, I'll acknowledge that VGF is not nearly as large as it once was or could have been. Still, it's unfair to claim it's unknown. Also, since we update on a regular basis and have an active community, I fail to see how it's just an advertisemnt. And it's just silly to claim that nothing links to VGF, even though the number of links is perhaps not particularly large. Regardless, what I would like to stress is this... If you want to visit the site, you're welcome to. If you don't want to visit it, who cares? But at least try doing more than 30 seconds of research based on clicking one link, visiting Alexa (inaccurate spyware that at one time ranked itself #3), or getting one unobtrusive popup here or there (oh no, it's the end of the world!) before bashing it.

<li>I find it funny that your first line reads "As the owner of VGF, I will remain neutral", yet your article (which is much bigger than the VFD'd article) is completely in the direction of keeping the article. It's good that you didn't have your forumgoers descend on this topic, because then it wouldn't make a difference. (sockpuppetry) As for the keep votes, one was made with no reason to back it up, and the other was deleted because along the way, the voter vandalised other votes (read the history of this VFD, please). I doubt those three paragraphs save the article from below the notability bar, but it was a good try. <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENestea_bc8a.html" title="User:Nestea">Nestea</a> 01:34, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
