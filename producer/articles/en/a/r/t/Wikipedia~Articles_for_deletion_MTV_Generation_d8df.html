<dd>Sorry for the misinformation. Please don't be offended by the use of the word MTV Generation. It's only a name, which may have nothing to do with the Strauss and Howe generations, but it has been used to describe a group of people nonetheless. I have changed the article so that it is not a generational gap, but a cusp encompassing the tail end of X and the beginning of Y, but not a separate generation. This is verifiable in:&#160;::::<a href="http://www.youthspecialties.com/articles/topics/family/multigenerational.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youthspecialties.com/articles/topics/family/multigenerational.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=156" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=156" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
<dd>I plan to change the name of the article when this discussion is over to XY Cusp. <a href="http://www.tomorrowtoday.biz/mindthegap/genscusper.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tomorrowtoday.biz/mindthegap/genscusper.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Actually, it is called Xer-Millennial cusp, but since there is no agreement yet on the name for Generation Y, I used XY Cusp. But I plan to refer to the MTV Generation in passing not as a generation, but as a description of the influence of MTV on this group of people within the article. r430nb</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> i am sorry to say because r430nb is trying but its just that you source statistical facts that have no point or are irrellivent, the sources are about drug statistics from a certain period not about the MTV gen per sey. I think your skills may be bettter suited to pages on drugs.

<li>Fabhcun! Part of those articles do acknowledge a gap or a cusp, which is not acknowledged by Generaiton Y and X pages in wikipedia. So, if I change the name so it is not a generation, but a cusp, would it still be ok?</li>

<dd><a href="http://www.youthspecialties.com/articles/topics/family/multigenerational.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youthspecialties.com/articles/topics/family/multigenerational.php" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> says There is one other group that's important to mention. The "Cuspers" are those who are born in the transition between generations. If you couldn't neatly place yourself in any of the above categories, then you're probably a Cusper. 1943-1947, 1962-1967 and 1978-1982 are each considered transition times. Many people born during these cusp periods identify with the generations on either side. Often, Cuspers feel like they belong to neither and belong to both. This population caught in the middle can play an important role in ministry. They are generationally bilingual. They can act as translators and ambassadors between the generations.</dd>
<dd><a href="http://users.metro2000.net/~stabbott/genx.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://users.metro2000.net/~stabbott/genx.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Ok, I will delete that one</dd>
<dd><a href="http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=156" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=156" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Rainmaker's Martin feels it's necessary to classify the 1978 to 1988 cohorts as a unique, mini Gen-Y. According to Martin, "the problem with longer definitions is that they're too huge" -- in other words, they cover too much societal change. This analysis puts the Gen-Y teens of the early 1990s into a unique buffer zone between X-ers and Millennials.</dd>
<dd>I'll remove the drug section.</dd>
<dd>Again I appreciate the suggestions, you're good. Ok, I made the changes, but I'm still waiting on the question about: 1. the name change from a generation to cusp? (as that will cause a redirect) 2. Will you change your vote after I do it? r430nb</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. There are problems with the article, but nothing that can't be fixed. The concept is notable and verifiable, I can't see how it can be deleted. Ifnord 03:52, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> if it can be cleaned up. There is a lot of data there but it lacks coherency. Is the huge list of bands actually necessary, for example? I was not sure what exactly the article was telling me. PS r430nb, may I suggest that you use the&#160;: character to get indenting so that your comments are easier to follow... and for deep discussion on how to improve the article, I suggest using the article's talk page. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 06:58, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the help Lar! I removed the list of bands, but I plan on putting one or two examples of each musical type.
<dl>
<dd>No worries. BTW r430nb, it is not necessary to respond to each and every comment from everyone expressing an opinion, especially if you're just commenting on their comment... that can make these quite long and hard to follow for the "closing admin". What may work better is to try to address all the concerns in one <b>comment</b> that you tack on the end of the discussion, instead of individually. Hope that helps. And thanks for signing your comments, it's hard to remember to do it every time but it really helps if you do. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 16:20, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now, but revisit in a while. This article needs a scythe taken to it: the phrase "MTV generation" has some currency and deserves documentation, but there is no need to list every band, every film and every other cultural influence here; these are already covered in the articles for <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, so much of this is redundant. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:01, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks, but if every cultural influence is moved out, what should I keep? The list of bands has been moved over to the talk page for the article. Then, for the hard subject of the the phrase "MTV generation" I can't find a source matching it to the specific dates mentioned, like he said up above and that it describes a gap between X and Y. So, while I like the term MTV generation, it doesn't match the specific group we're trying to get. This term overlaps with any teenager born anytime who is influenced by MTV. The only claim we have to it is that we were born around the time it first came out, like how Generation Y has always been surrounded with computers and they don't know about a time before that. Believe me, I don't want to change the name "MTV generation" but to comply with Wikipedia, I have to change it to match the sources or else it's deleted. I hope this doesn't change your vote. r430nb</dd>
