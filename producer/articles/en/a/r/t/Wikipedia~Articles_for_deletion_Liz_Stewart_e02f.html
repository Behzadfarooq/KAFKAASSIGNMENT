<li><b>Keep</b>. Note that she has appeared many times in different publications, even if they are by the same company. It's a very notable publisher, and not that influenced by her personally. Between that, and the half dozen articles on her design press page, <a href="http://www.lizstewartdesign.com/press.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lizstewartdesign.com/press.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, that should be enough.

<ul>
<li>Community consensus has consistently kept Playboy Playmates as notable, over several years and a fair number of nominations. That's what stuck the criterion in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>. Nothing has recently occurred to significantly change that. They have a good bit of structure (just look at that category I linked - subcats, templates, lists...). There are quite a lot of them; nominating them is likely to be disruptive due to sheer numbers if nothing else. Going after them one at a time does seem as if it could be trying to make a point. I may have missed something - is there a directive from Jimbo that Playmates are out? Has there been any similar precedent? If nothing like that has occurred, I wouldn't recommend a campaign. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 19:11, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you do as has been suggested and put 25, 50, 100, etc. Playmates and Pets up for deletion then you are creating a large disturbance to the encyclopedia in general. Although, if you take up the discussion at <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_f7cd.html" title="WP:PORN">WP:PORN</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> and then come to a decision, that would produce minimal disturbance. Then whatever decision was reached could be carried out. Additionally, mass deletion votes are inherently hard to handle and slog through because when people put up more than a couple pages for deletion, the voters have to slog through each article and most will say something like "I think articles A, C, and G should be deleted but articles B, D-F, and H-Z should be kept due to...." Then the person who closes the AFD has to write down all the article titles, and count each vote for each one. It's just a mess. I also do not suggest carrying out that campaign, as AnonEMouse said. <span style="font-family:monospace;"><a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></span>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:14, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It's becoming pretty obvious there's some time-wasting <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>-making going on in this recent outbreak of AfDs. Sources on pornographic subject are being labled 'unreliable' because they deal in pornography. Does this law apply to other fields as well? Articles on a historical figure are 'unreliable' if they appear in a historical journal? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Porn mags are not independant and reliable sources. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 18:56, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">POINT</a> can't be that porn mags are not independent and reliable sources for non-porn subjects, because this is not a non-porn subject. No, your <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">POINT</a> appears to be that a model's appearance in a porn mag is not reliable evidence of a model's appearance in a porn mag, since it is these appearances which establish her notability. I guess you're saying we need a reliable secondary source-- the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Britannica</a> maybe-- which states that a particular model appeared in such-and-such a porn mag, because her actual appearance in such-and-such a porn mag is not reliable evidence of her appearance in such-and-such a porn mag. So we have secondary sources in the external links section which document her appearances. Ah, but those sources-- even though they are appropriate for non-porn subjects-- are not reliable when they deal with porn subjects. OK, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">POINT</a> taken. Enough time wasted. Now back to real editing... <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:29, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm just following the guidelines. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 14:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume Good Faith</a>" does not require us to play dumb, Epbr123. And a sudden outbreak of mass AfDs in one category, on some articles that have been around for a couple of years raises obvious suspicions. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 17:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Calm please, calm. Epbr123 hasn't followed through on the threat to nominate hundreds of Playmate articles, my long spiel was restricted to that. Nominating a dozen pornographic model or performer articles is certainly a trend, but not on that level of disruption. This is a legitimate area, but not the most cited area in the encyclopedia, and at least some of the nominations do seem to be generally supported and warranted. He's also not citing God's law as a reason for deletion. (!). I don't agree with the apparently tautological premise that porn mags are not reliable because they deal with porn (!) but I'm willing to assume good faith in general. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC) I'm also impressed by his willingness to change his own mind at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Alicia_Rhodes_%282nd_nomination%29_19e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alicia Rhodes (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alicia Rhodes (2nd nomination)</a>. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sure, I'm willing to assume good faith. But when I now find a couple more AfDs that have gone under the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Porn_stars_Deletion_69ae.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Porn stars/Deletion">Wikipedia:WikiProject Porn stars/Deletion</a> radar, and then come up with a <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Mann_b418.html" title="Pamela Mann">totally unsourced stub</a> recently started by this nominator who professes such concern for sourcing...
