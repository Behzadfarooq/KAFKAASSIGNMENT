<p>James C. is bekend geraakt toen hij trouwde met zijn eeuwige liefde, de prachtige Kelogs. Deze 2 hadden een hartstochtelijke relatie en staan ook bekend voor de creatie van een nieuwe, vurige salsadans. James C. is ook een waar wiskundig genie en meesterbrein. Hij paste differentiaalvergelijkingen toe op de Cartesische vergelijking om zo op de convergentiestraal van de bisectiemethode te komen. Later kreeg James een affaire met Ysabel. Ook zij is een ware schone die door vele mannen geprezen werd. Maar enkel James kon haar bevredigen. Zo ontstond een driehoeksrelatie tussen james, Kelogs en Ysabel.</p>

<p>A well made macro in the Pilsner style. Poured out to a reddish-orange color, ot a dark beer but good coloer. You can tell its not waaterd down, Descent level (about a 6 of 10) of carbonation, and a white foam head that calms and leaves some head of foam. Smells of malts and corn, with some cereal, if u give a good deep breath through the nose. Taste is a sefinate step up from 95% of mass produced beers, as this Pilsner has a solid flavor. Both the malt and hops have their moment on the palate, with definate aftertaste hints of grain making u a majority of the flavor of the beer. A cold, crisp, almost like biting into a ripe apple, it makes your mouth water which makes this beer exceptionaly drinkable. Special thanks to The Lion Brewery in Wilkes-Barre, Pennslyvania (I believe its owened by Yuengling) for a beer I have been drinking since age 16. Yes, I might have a slight bias because it is the local, cheap beer, ($10-12 for 24 bottles), but I live in NYC now I've tried a uncountabale amount of beers, but this is still, hands down my favorite.</p>

<p>Cult Dynamite is a localised and enigmatic phenomenon, which was founded in the North Shore of Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>In mid-2005, multiple motor vehicles were attacked, with the locution 'Cult Dynamite' being written in permanent marker on the windscreeen (or other glass panels) of the motor vehicle. These attacks typically happen in the late evening. The mastermind/s of this phenomenon are unknown, however it is widely believed that this movement has many supporters and therefore copycat attacks are likely to have occurred. There is also ambivalence as to the denotations in the phrase. It has been suggested that the Cult Dynamite phenomenon is a reaction to political and social pressures, with cult portraying an image of public veneration towards authority, and dynamite suggesting something that has the potential to generate extreme reactions and emotion.</p>

<p>Preston B. Whitmore is the eccentric billionaire who funds the expedition to discover Atlantis in the 2001 Disney film, Atlantis: The Lost Empire. He was played by actor, John Mahoney.</p>
<p>Born in 1844 in Seattle, Washington, Whitmore was a graduate of Georgetown University (Class of 1866) before becoming the founder and sole owner of Preston Whitmore Industries, Ltd., an empire that encompassed logging operations in the states of Washington and Oregon; the Southern Rail Freight line; Whitmore Mining and Petroleum in Texas, Alaska Territories, and South Africa; Whitmore Stockyards in Houston, Texas; and P.W.I. Shipbuilding in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
<p>Whitmore is also considered an eccentric, practicing Yoga long before it was fashionable and favoring a hiring system based on merit rather than on one’s ancestry, gender or ethnic background (a practice decades ahead of its time!)</p>
<p>An avid collector of rare antiquities, Whitmore spent sizable fortunes on expeditions to retrieve precious relics with the help of his longtime friend and advisor Professor Thaddeus Thatch (who he met back at Georgetown). Whitmore even accompanied Thatch on a number of these expeditions spanning the globe, sharing his friend’s ambition to find treasures and places of myth.</p>
<p>He also listened to Thatch talk endlessly about the Shepherd’s Journal, an ancient text which allegedly contained a guide to the lost empire of Atlantis. Doubting the existence of this text, Whitmore made a bet with Thatch that if he could find the Shepherd’s Journal, then he would not only fund the expedition to find Atlantis, but that he would kiss Thatch “full on the mouth.” Of course, Thatch did find the Journal in Iceland and Whitmore was forced to make good on his promise.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Thatch was by now a laughingstock among his colleagues and he died a broken man. Whitmore was then forced to replace him with Thaddeus’s grandson, Milo Thatch, who shared his grandfather’s passion for Atlantis. And so, after hiring the finest crew available at the time, designing and building Ulysses, a state-of-the-art submarine and equipping his team with all the gear and supplies they would need, Whitmore saw the expedition off. The only reason he didn’t join the expedition himself was because of ill health.</p>
<p>Later, Whitmore helped cover up for Atlantis after learning their very survival depended on surface-dwellers being ignorant of its existence. For his generous assistance, Whitmore was given a special Atlantean crystal pendant that helped restore his full health and vigor.</p>
<p>Whitmore finally visited Atlantis himself in the Disney sequel, Atlantis: Milo’s Return, and was instrumental in reassembling the team for a series of adventures back on the surface. His fate thereafter is unknown.</p>

<p>Ed Labetski is a talented artist who is mostly known for his digital painings. It might not be accepted as an art-form by everyone, but he creates it like any other conventional art. He tries to make digital paintings more acceptable by making the result look to people in a familiar way, while using exclusively computers to create them. He has also held exhibitions of his printed digital paintings[5][6][7] (in fact, the very first of its kind in Estonia) to bridge the gap. Ed does not have a degree in art, but he has studied conventional ways extensively and also paints using conventional techniques like oil.</p>
<p>Ed Labetski is also the author of Unitube webcomic.</p>

<p>Ed Labetski was born in 1982.</p>
<p>Ed's parents have lived in Estonia for years. It was then a border-state of the Soviet Union. It's likely that there the fear of nuclear disaster was driven into subconscious particularily firmly during the Cold War and was passed on to the children. When Ed was a child, the Soviet Union collapsed, which was accompanied by rapid money devalvation voiding everyone's lifetime's savings. Bread had to be aquired for food stamps. Shops were rather empty, though it wasn't much different from Soviet Union era.</p>
<p>A turbulent time came along with Ed's turbulent teen years. His little sister has been sent to mental institution. People had to learn to value simple things, though many chose to drown their sorrow in alcohol, which happened also in his family. Estonia regained its independence and Soviet version of history was replaced by a contradicting account. This shook many people's world views. Some met it with angry defiance, others learnt to be healthily sceptical.</p>
<p>Things were going well for Estonia -- it could be proclaimed a part of Europe now and become a very fast developing country embracing Western world. Computerisation became a high priority and schools have been provided with computers so people could get comfortable with them at an early age. Ed took interest in art and seized an opportunity of using the Internet to self-teach different aspects of art -- from oil to 3D.</p>
<p>Ed tried to enter an art university, but was rejected. He went to work as a computer designer instead and kept drawing in his spare time developing a recognisable style. He has held exhibitions[5][6][7] and received several offers to buy his paintings. In 2003, he went to Spain on a whim and after some time was hired to paint over the entire bar's interior, then worked as a computer designer. In 2005, he returned to Estonia and became an art director of an advertising company. He still draws in his spare time.</p>

<p>The Federal Correctional Institution, Ray Brook is a medium security men's prison in the northern Adirondack Mountains at Ray Brook, NY. Constructed midway between two popular resort towns, Lake Placid and Saranac Lake, to first serve as the Olympic Village for the 1980 Winter Games, Ray Brook was designed to be converted to a prison and was wholly financed by the federal government. Its isolated location in the woods about four miles west of Lake Placid, and its spartan accomodations drew nearly universal scorn from the world's premier winter athletes, who disliked spending two weeks in a jail. Among the most critical were the members of the Soviet Union's acclaimed hockey team, which was upset by the "Miracle on Ice" United States squad that won the gold medal.</p>

<p>Richard "Ty" Reiber is a mountain man. Born in the scenic hills of rolling Pennsylvania in the log cabin that his father built, he has conquered the wildlife around him to epic proportions. Mastering every variety of beast he encounters, "Ty" has seldom come up against a foe he could not overcome. He has made deer bologna that has won him first prize for years at the Trout Deer Bologna Cook-Off. He has but one enemy he has never defeated, though he tries with gusto every day: Steve Wales. Steve Wales is a machine. He was created out of video game parts and a bubble gun, giving him amazing trumpet playing abilities. "Ty" often mistakes these trumpet calls for the sound of the hunt (as horns are often used to hunt foxes) and has thusly felt tricked by The Machine many times. Therefore, they are forever locked in epic combat. "Ty" is also a world-class Republican who drives a Republican car. It is only worth $4.66, which is twice the resale value in England, oddly enough. A master of the forest and of epic Rednecketry, "Ty" Reiber will live on forever in the hearts of all who knew him. He is not dead yet. He also has broccoli in his shoes.</p>

<p>A hand turkey is a drawing made to resemble a wild turkey (<i>Meleagris gallopavo</i>) by tracing the outline of the artist's open hand and adding various elements such as a wing, beak, eye, or feathers. In the sketch, the artist's thumb corresponds to the turkey's head, and the fingers correspond to the standing feathers typical of a turkey. Because it is so easy to draw, a hand turkey is a favorite project for children, especially during Thanksgiving because of the importance of the wild turkey in that holiday.</p>

<p>Rock Deputy was born a mortal man by the name of Cody Petruk, in the year of 1977. But at the tender age of 27 Cody had an awakening that shook the very foundations of our known universe. And lo, Rock Deputy rose up, like a Phoenix born out of the ashes, bringing colour and light to, what would soon be known as, the Dark Pre-Wakening of Society (or Prae Rock Deputius). It is said that, on the day of the transformation, the sky opened up and warm rays of hope flooded the Earth for 7 days in which there was no death or pain in the world, and the air was filled with the laughter of children. At the end of those 7 days a spiritual awakening occurred throughout the globe. Rock Deputy, or The Giver, left as quickly as he came, his mortal shell burst into a blinding white light revealing his true form that of pure energy. Now he spends his time forming stars and creating new galaxies. He still finds time to communicate with us humans by beaming down his thoughts onto the internet where many have benefited from his wisdom.</p>
<p>He can be often be found on Threadless.</p>
<p>Rock Deputy has been called "savior," "creator," and "Jesus Christ Reborn" but he insists he is not any of those thigns and actually does not believe in organized religion so much as one "life force" that permeates the atmosphere and controls the balance between good and evil. His abilities, however, surpass any mere mortal's and theologists are in agreement that this humble man is really a God.</p>

The 4 piece have a wide range of songs, which shows off their songwriting talents, such as "Wannabe Indie" which takes a swipe at the self conscious "in-crowd" scene, while also making the listener want to boogie in their tighty whiteys and the band aren't afraid to show their tender side with "You Know Who You Are", with its upbeat chorus and heartfelt lyrics. Although the band are believed to be at their best while performing their trippier tunes.</p>

<p>Three musicians met literally on the "front steps" of The Juilliard School during the summer of 2004. Each had in common a desire that their music evoke in listeners a range of pure human emotions through collaboration, musical harmony and creative programming. The Piano, Violin and cello being their individual instruments of expression.</p>
<p>Grand Prize Winner of the 2006 Plowman National Chamber Music Competition (USA), Manhattan Piano Trio is rapidly gaining recognition as one of the most versatile and exciting emerging chamber music groups in the country. The Trio comprises Milana Bahl(Piano), Dmitry Lukin(Violin) and Dmitry Kouzov(cello). Eversince their formation, they have performed over 150 concerts spanning 22 US States. Merkin Concert hall(NYC) selected them as one of six prominent "Up and coming" Artists in the country during the 2005-06 season. They are being featured on many other similar "Rising Artists" Series at prestigious venues throughout the country.</p>
<p>In addition to their demanding recording and touring schedule, members of the Trio are committed to the next generation of audience by giving master-classes, concert shows and special music shows at schools and colleges. Musical education is one of the primary goals of Manhattan Piano Trio. As part of their outreach and gift to the community, they were one of the first chamber music groups, post Katrina, to perform in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Todd and Evan is a webcomic in the vein of Penny Arcade. It is published sporadically throughout the week with the idea being a new comic every Wednesday.It is written by Todd Michael R. and Evan Lusky, with art chores shared between them. The subject of the comic is at random and follows the whims of whatever these two seem to feel like writing about that week. It generally consists of the both of them living together in an apartment and Todd being the target of Evan's biting sarcasm.</p>

However, internal band problems meant that the tour in support of their record was cut short. The subsequent death of Schlosshardt (significant other of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nymphs_c603.html" title="The Nymphs">The Nymphs</a>' <a href="../../../i/n/g/Inger_Lorre_6637.html" title="Inger Lorre">Inger Lorre</a>) of a drugs overdose finally put an end to the band.</p>

<p>Dave Z. is the multitalented singer, songwriter, and bass player of the band ZO2 and is both a studio and on-stage bassist for TSO (see Trans-Siberian Orchestra under search). ZO2 is a hard rock band with flavors of 70's bands such as Sabbath, KISS, and Zeppelin, with a little of 80's metal such as GNR and Savatage tossed in. Originating in 2002, this Brooklyn, New York-based band released its debut, <i>Tuesdays and Thursdays</i>, in 2004. Paulie Z., guitarist, brother of Dave, large fro, is like a three-headed guitar fiend demon parented by Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, and Ace Frehley. He was likely raised by Joe Perry and Chris Caffery. Joey Cassata, Italian guy, drummer, was probably created by a copulation of John Bonham and Tom Hamilton (yes, he is the bassist of Aerosmith. Joey's hard-hitting precision reminds me of Tom, even though he is not a drummist.) and is pretty awexome.</p>
<p>The genuinely dedicated and talented musicians of ZO2 have worked with greats such as TSO and its individual members, the Blue Man Group, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, and have toured with KISS and Poison. They often play at the Arlen Grocery in NYC for free.</p>

<p>Woodcote Housing Estate is part of Epsom Town. Owned by the Woodcote Brothers, of whom little is known about, the Housing estate has grown to be a large area of suburban mass interlinked with the surronding country side. The Estate is also home to the the large stately home called 'Woodcote House', or more commonly know to the resisidents of the Estate as the 'White House'. The Estate has little in the way of a community, but the youth members of the estate created 'The Woodcote Manhunt League'. This is a game in which the players in effect play a game of 'IT' or 'Tag', in teams around the estate. The Woodcote Estate also has a small forest area called the Millenium Green. It was recultivated from baron waste land into a large communal forest and boasts its large amount of wildlife.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-04_363d.html" title="Edit section: Ronald Reagan (Revision)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ronald Reagan (Revision)</span></h2>
<p>You need an edit to your Ronald Reagan entry (I'm quoting Wikipedia here):</p>
<p>"His economic policy of supply-side economics, popularly known as "Reaganomics", is noted for a 25% cut in the income tax, reduction in inflation, reduction in interest rates, increased military spending, increased deficits and national debt, a temporary solution to the Social Security issue, elimination of loopholes in the tax code, continued deregulation of business, a sharp recession in 1981-1982 followed by a very robust economic expansion starting in '82 — the greatest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history.[citation needed] "</p>
<p>The reason a "citation [is] needed" is that this "very robust...greatest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history" never occurred during Reagan's presidency (perhaps during Clinton's). Yes, an average business cycle recovery occurred, but the post-Reagan spin machine continues to tout it as "Morning in America" (from the Wall St. Journal) The details for why this was no such thing are contained in Paul Krugman's "Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in an Age of Diminished Expectations"</p>
<p>Krugman convincingly makes the case that presidential policy (as opposed to Federal Reserve policy) influences productive capacity, or capital investment most directly, and the course of the business cycle indirectly. Because of Reagan's enormous deficits, capital investment actually declined during his administration, while the business cycle, peak-to-peak, that most nearly coincided with the term of his presidency was unexceptional in how much higher the later peak was than the earlier one. It was certainly not the greatest peacetime economic expansion, and if you factor in the growth in income disparities, it was disproportionately throwing money at the rich.</p>
<p>One further revision in the Reagan article: The S&amp;L Bailout is correctly cited by your Reagan entry as a scandal his administration fostered. What you do not include is the magnitude of the scandal. The following is a quote that pretty much speaks for itself:</p>
<p>"The theft from the taxpayer by the community that fattened on the growth of the savings and loan (S&amp;L) industry in the 1980's is the worst public scandal in American history. Teapot Dome in the Harding administration and the Credit Mobilier in the times of Ulysses S. Grant have been taken as the ultimate horror stories of capitalist democracy gone to seed. Measuring by money, [or] by the misallocation of national resources...the S&amp;L outrage makes Teapot Dome and Credit Mobilier seem minor episodes."</p>
<p>"...the swindles, like the industry itself, were a backwater, and, worse, the subject was inherently technical. As the Bush bailout bill moved through congress in the summer of 1989 P.J.O'Rourke wrote...that the story was 'an awful example of what's replaced democracy in modern America-- dictatorship by tedium....This allows the boring government officials to do anything they want, because any time regular people try to figure out what gives, the regular people get hopelessly bored and confused, as though they'd fallen a month behind in their high-school algebra class."</p>
<p>"The S&amp;L story is desperately important not for the reasons usually given but because its development, maturity and crisis raise profound questions about American society. In the light of this bonfire, we must ask whether our great professions are still capable of self-regulation, of giving honest service, and of accepting fiduciary duties in an age when all costs and benefits are reduced to monetary measurements and all conduct that is not specifically prohibited has become permissible. Watching the obedient dance of our officials and politicians when their patrons pipe a tune, unrebuked by a public that attends this show as it might any other, we must ask whether this generation of Americans remains capable of self- government." --from Martin Mayer's THE GREATEST-EVER BANK ROBBERY The Collapse of the Savings and Loan Industry (Scribner's) (Unfortunately this is out of print, but is available at least in the Sacramento Public Library)</p>

<p>Al Schwimmer was born in the US in 1917 and grew up under impoverished circumstances during the great economic collapse. Despite numerous difficulties Al obtained a pilot’s license and education and was certified as a flight engineer. In 1942 he volunteered to the US army and during WWII served on the trans-Atlantic supply routes, demonstrating great courage which won him a citation at the end of the war. In 1947 he initiated contact with the Hagana representative in the US after being informed that assistance was needed to establish a mechanism for smuggling Holocaust refugees by air from Europe to Israel. Appalled by the sight of Holocaust survivors in Europe, he immediately volunteered to the cause. While in the throes of planning, he was asked to change the plan and to organize the purchase of aircraft and aviation equipment, and to recruit pilots and crew for the war anticipated following the establishment of Israel. Al left his position at TWA and devoted himself to this mission. He saw himself totally committed to helping the struggle to establish a Jewish state in Israel: He recruited scores of volunteer pilots, mechanics and air and ground crew; initiated the smuggling of planes to Israel in violation of the US embargo; and purchased all types of arms which was vital for the survival of the young country fighting for its life, often putting his own life at risk. When this became known to the US government, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Al played a pivotal role in the struggle to establish Israel, as a central figure in the recruitment of Machal (Hebrew acronym for overseas volunteers) volunteers, in obtaining military knowledge and know-how from around the world, and in locating sources of ammunition. His personality and total commitment to the Zionist ideal were legendary the world over, when he managed to accomplish what appeared to be impossible.</p>
<p>Al left the easy life in the US and despite the difficulties and risks, embarked on a new path which required superior leadership skills, firm social values and adherence to the goal. After playing a central role in establishing the Israeli Air Force, arming and equipping it, he returned to the US at the end of 1949 to stand trial. He was convicted of the illegal export of aircraft and of violating the laws of neutrality, was fined and stripped of his civil rights for life. In 1950 he founded a private airline company, and a plant for the repair and maintenance of planes in California. But this chapter of his life was short-lived: in 1951 on a visit to the US by Ben-Gurion, the Israeli Prime Minister urged him to return to Israel and to set up an aircraft industry, which would address the maintenance needs of the air force and EL Al aircraft. Yet again Al rose to the Zionist challenge. He sold the plant and left the US for Israel. His goal: to establish what was to become one of the country’s finest industries, and the jewel in the crown of the security industry – Israel Aircraft Industries. 30 years later, when he resigned from his position as CEO, Israel Aircraft Industries was the largest plant in Israel, with a payroll of more than 20 thousand employees. The industry became Israel’s no. one exporter. His personality, humility, leadership and exceptional management remain imprinted at Israel Aircraft Industries until this very day. Even after retiring, Al did not cease serving the country. He placed himself, his knowledge and his extensive connections around the world at the disposal of Israel whenever needed, and in some cases participated in missions which till today have not been publicized. On his last day in the White House, Bill Clinton granted amnesty to Al Schwimmer and annulled his conviction. This, despite the fact that Al refused to express penitence or remorse for what he had done. His strong stance, obliteration of his personal benefit and clear commitment to his nation, are exemplary. Until today, Al contributes and helps in enhancing the ties between Israel and the Diaspora, and continues to see himself as an emissary of the Zionist concept with all his might and all his soul.</p>
<p>For his activity, his courage and his leadership Al has won numerous prizes and citations. But in his eyes the most important of all is a special award of recognition, awarded to him by the David Ben-Gurion Foundation (2003), 30 years after the death of the founder of the State of Israel. In his letters Ben-Gurion cited Al Schwimmer’s role in establishing the country: “Out of all the support we have received, the most important asset which US Jewry gave us at the time was Al Schwimmer”. (Ben-Gurion, 13 May 1968).</p>

<p>Gene Hart (June 28, 1931 - July 14, 1999) was an American Professional Sports Announcer for the Philadelphia Flyers of the Nation Hockey League and the Philadelphia Phantoms of the American Hockey League.</p>
<p>Hart was born in New York and soon moved to Southern New Jersey, where he graduated Pleasantville High School. He then graduated Trenton State College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Education.</p>
<p>After serving time in the Military, Hart began officiating high school football, baseball, and basketball in South Jersey. After one game at Atlantic City High School, the school’s athletic broadcaster Ralph Glenn was walking around frantically to find a person to go with him to Trenton to announce a game. He explained his situation to Hart, and Hart agreed to go with him. Thus began one of the most successful announcing careers in hockey history.</p>
<p>Hart continued to announce with Glenn on a regular basis in Southern New Jersey, and keep several side jobs as well. When Philadelphia was granted and NHL expansion team in 1967, Hart submitted his tapes to the team, which would be called the Flyers. Since the Flyers could not afford one of the more experienced Canadian announcers, Hart got the job.</p>
<p>He figured he would only be on the staff for a few years until the Flyers could afford a better broadcaster. He was mistaken. Gene Hart was the voice of the Philadelphia Flyers for 29 years, from the team’s inception until the end of the 1994-1995 season. Hart announced more then 2,000 NHL games, 6 separate Stanley Cups, 5 NHL all-star games, and the NHL Soviet Union all-star series.</p>
<p>He came out of retirement in 1997 to announce for the Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers’ minor league affiliate. He announced the team’s Caulder Cup championship series before retiring at the end of the 1999 season.</p>
<p>Gene Hart passed away from a variety of illnesses on July 14, 1999. He was 68 years old.</p>

<p>The Illinois St. Andrew Society (ISAS) is the oldest charitible organization in Illinois - founded in 1845. The ISAS has operated a charity retirement home for more than 100 years.</p>
<p>There were more than 8,000 Scottish residents in Chicago ath the time of the Great Fire of 1871. ISAS membership records, Flags, memorabilia and plans for a Scottish Charitable Home were destroyed. Two ISAS members were killed in the fire.</p>
<p>The ISAS is the largest landowner in Rosehill Cemetery - with more than 400 Scots buried there. ISAS provided free brials to many Scots in need.</p>
<p>In 1910 ground was broken in North Riverside, Illinois for the Scottish Home. After completion the Scottish Home burnt to the ground in 1917. Funds were raised and it was rebuilt. The Scottish Home was expanded in the late 1990's and is in operation today.</p>
<p>Many prominent Chicagoans have been involved with the ISAS including Colonel John McArthur, members of the Armour meat packing family, former police chief John Joseph Badenock, former Chairman of Marshall Field and Company Hughston McBain etc.</p>

From 1918 her ministry was based in Los Angeles. She went from coast to coast preaching to others, but the largest auditoriums were usually incapable of holding the crowds that wanted to hear her preach and pray for the sick. Aimee had her own auditorium built with money that she has gotten fromt her preachings on the road. The auditorium was called Angelus Temple. It was more auditorium than church with over 5000 seats, plenty room for a full-orchestra and a stage on which holiday pageants entertained and inspired the faithful. In 1924 the church acquired a radio station which won her thousands of additional followers, but two years later she became forgotten of her preachings and remembered for the dispute over her alleged kidnapping. She used the radio to inform many listeners of their wrong doings and how much sin they were causeing for themselves. She didn't believe in the short skirts and the freedoms of women. She was very against how the women who are refered to as flapper girls dress, acted, and lived their lifes. Most of her creditbility of a gospel abiding person much fled when she was found in a hotel room with a married man. Then a couple days later she was pronounced kidnapped by the police. Her being found in a holtel room with a married man may be the reason for her unexplined kidnapping. No one really knows much about that part of her life. She was found in Douglas Arizona and said that she was taken by kidnappers but her attorney could never put together a clear case. For many people this was the last straw. The kidnapping destroyed Amiee Semple McPherson's credibility and her popularity gradually declined. But for nearly two more decades, until her death by "accidental" perscription drug overdose in 1944, crowds still gathered to hear her unique way of preaching the Pentecostal with enthusiasm and high flown energy.</p>

<p>FetusSwingers are a 2-piece band hailing from Kirkcaldy, Fife in Scotland. Their debut album "Interlocking Genitalia" was a hit among their community during it's initial release but had a cult following on the internet a year after it was launched. In 1999, the single "Your Hamster is My Grandmother" released on Wombhead Recordings reached number 2 in the NME charts for 1 week. Although the fame was shortlived, Pol and Lil' Dave from the band claim that the material was only intended to annoy and bewilder.</p>
<p>In 2001, the band split up but rejoined to create a new band with a new formula: the 'Sh... Sh... Shingles'. Their demo "Trophy Knife" has caused a stir in the local Folk scene and the new move is hoped to have better horizons for the Fife-based band.</p>

<p>A War Dog is genarally considered a dog used by the military-not by gangs,indivauls,or the like.</p>
<p>Many ancient countys have used war dogs for all kinds of reasons - defence - gaurding - and attacking.</p>
<p>A riecent variation of the war dog was used by russiain in world war two. they would train dog to run towards tanks, once the dog got close enough they would set off the explosives, therefore destroying the tank. but in the battle field the turned out to be useless as they were trained with russian tanks and therefore they only ran towards russian tanks, which then resulted in the dog getting squished and the tank blowing up.</p>
<p>if the use of war dogs were to ever be used agian it is likely that animal activists would try to/prevent them bieng used.</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>Since its discovery by the westerners in 1722, easter island has captivated and fascinated the world by the haul of mystery that enclose its culture, its history and above all its famous statues called Moais.</p>
<p>The form in which the Moais were carved, transported and summoned to court is not still entirely resolved, but the magnificencia of their enigmatic and silent faces are a testimony to our days of the intelligence and tenacity of its builders (the town Rapa Nui)</p>
<p>Many board games originated in the most diverse corners of the world, represent elements of the culture that sees them born. Chess for example is an evident and alive portrait of the medieval Christian world, with its representative board of a small kingdom and with pieces that represent the most important figures of the feudal war.</p>
<p>Has arisen in these authors the idea of ambienting a board game with elements of the culture of Rapa Nui. In a game of this type the board would represent the island, the pieces the figures of the Rapa Nui culture and the sense and objective of the play to some fictitious, historic or mythological event related to them.</p>
<p>Thus it was born “Hanga Roa”. We conceive it like a fight or competence among 2 coalitions of Rapa Nui tribes. Each one of these coalitions fights by displacing in the quickest possible way a Moais in a road of stone, since its quarry to reach to the opposite side of the island. The Mato to’a or warlike are the pieces responsible for destroying these roads and to impede the step of the enemy Moais, and the Ariki, or tribal chief, is a piece that have the power of building the stone roadsl. Another form of victory is reached if one of the coalitions surrounds and knocks down to the Moais of its adversary.</p>
<p>Although it will be time the only one that determine the degree of success that this game can have, we believe that an objective already has been completed, to honor with him, the value and ingenuity of the people of Rapa Nui.</p>
<p>Rules</p>
<p>Board It is played in a board of 9x9 squares called island. DIAGRAM 1</p>

<p>Pieces:</p>
<p>In “Hanga Roa” each player have 7 pieces, distributed in 3 different hierarchies.</p>
<p>1.-Moais:</p>
<p>It is the main piece of the game. It lacks own movement, only can move to squares in which stones of their color exist, which are retired when the Moais occupies them. In his turn the Moai can be displaced to as many of his stones as there are in his way, provided that they are connected among them. Upon this displacing, the Moais capture its own stones, but can never capture the rival stones neither to other pieces. In the following diagram, two examples of displacements are observed.

<p>The own stones do not form part of the units that enclose the Moais, since they are a way of escaping for the Moai.</p>

<p>After carrying out its movement, the Ariki has the right to throw 2 stones (exception is the first move of the black pieces, in which they can only throw one stone(see note)) in any direction (orthogonal and diagonal) and any number of squares (can also be thrown both stones in the same direction)</p>
<p>Note: UIT the purpose of making the game more balanced, the first player (white) in his first move has the right to only throw one stone with his Ariki. After this move the game can continue in its normal way (throwing 2 stone).</p>
<p>The stones cannot be thrown besides other stones or pieces that are in its road. In the following diagrams examples of throwing of stones are observed.</p>

For the case of stones thrown in the same direction, should be careful in the order of throwns of these, since the first stone is the limit of distance for the other stone. In the preceding example if the stone e3 would be hurled before that the stone d2, this last one would not be able to be thrown to that square, since would imply to jump over the stone e3.</p>
<p>It is observed in the previous diagram that the Black Ariki, cannot throw a stone to the square of d1, since it cannot jump over the stone situated in d2.</p>
<p>If an Ariki is surrounded totally by stones or rival pieces, it is captured.</p>
<p>If an Ariki is surrounded with own stones, its owner retires him of the panel and is able to enter it on any empty square of the first own row in a future turn. (this piece drop constitutes a turn)</p>
<p>3.- Mato to’a</p>
<p>It is a defensive piece, whose mission is to destroy the rival stones. (Also it can comply with offensive functions collaborating with the surrounding of the contrary Moais) It moves in the same way that a king of chess, that is to any square in orthogonal or diagonal form as it can</p>
<pre>
It is capable of destroying own or rival stones being moved to the square occupied by them.

<p>The game can be played also adopting other intial formations, respecting the intial quarry of the Moais, and that the pieces cannot be situated in squares that transfer the half of the board.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: Wins a game of “Hanga Roa” the first player that manage to carry his Moais to the last square of the rival field or capture the adversary Moais.</p>
<p>SYSTEM OF ANNOTATION:</p>
<p>The players of “Hanga Roa” can register a game following an algebraic system of annotation similar to that of chess, and utilizing the following letters to describe the movements of the pieces.</p>
<p>M: Moais A: Ariki P: Mato to’a The squares of the board are described according to the coordinates. “a” to “i” and of “1” to “9” as observed in the preceding diagrams.</p>
<p>The move is described in such a way that the groupof letters that appears to the left corresponds to the white player and that of the right to that of the black participant.</p>
<p>Then the movement is described placing first the intial of the piece that moves, followed by the coordinate of destiny to which the piece arrives. This it is carried out indistinctly if the piece captures.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<p>23. A 3a P 4i (This illustrates that in its turn 23 the white played its Ariki to the square 3a, and the black responded, moving its Mato to’a to the square 4i)</p>
<p>To indicate the stones launched it played goes accompanied by the 2 coordinates of the stones thrown.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<p>2. A 3b 5bh8 (This indicates that the Ariki that moves to 3b throws a stone to 5b and the other to h8)</p>
<p>If 2 or more pieces of the same rank can carry out the same movement, should be placed next to the intial of the piece that moves, the coordinate of origin of the same one.</p>

<p>The Great Burn was a catastrophic nuclear war on Earth in the fictional Babylon 5 universe which took place in the year 2762, 500 years after the founding of the Interstellar Alliance. The nuclear exchange was the culmination of a growing political divide among the human inhabitants of Earth, with one side favoring Earth adopting an increasingly isolationist position in interstellar politics, as well as an authoritarian, Orwellian, domestic policy. The opposing side in the conflict favored continued strong relations with the Interstellar Alliance and a more liberal society that is accepting of alien cultures. The widespread devastation of the nuclear exchange killed most human life on the planet, and left the surviving civilization in a state of pre-industrial technological development which took several centuries to recover from.</p>
<p>SPOILERS:</p>
<p>While a full scale nuclear war between the opposing factions was arguably inevitable, the immediate cause of the attacks occured during the production of a propaganda piece intended to discredit the founders of the Interstellar Alliance. Psychological profiles were constructed and combined with holographic representations of the long deceased John Sheridan, Delenn, Stephen Franklin, and Michael Garibaldi for the purpose of using them as "actors" in propaganda produced by the authoritarian regime. During the production of this propaganda, the representation of Michael Garibaldi hacked a communications network and broadcast to the opposing faction plans of an impending attack. This led to a pre-emptive nuclear strike and corresponding retalitory response which escalated into the full scale nuclear exchange.</p>

<p>Kennedy Mindreader</p>
<p>Over the last five years Kennedy has taken the magic and psychic worlds by storm. Living in England near the Scottish border, he travels around the world reading people’s minds in one of the most exciting interactive live entertainment shows today.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s amazing abilities have gained him front page newspaper coverage, prime time TV interest as well as numerous radio appearances. The Mindreader is in constant demand, performing at events large and small throughout the UK and the world.</p>
<p>It is not just about him telling you what you are thinking, Kennedy also engages his mind to affect inanimate objects and cause them to move, flinch and twist by the power of thought alone. This really has to be seen to be believed.</p>
<p>His skill has seen him risk his life in a game of Russian roulette where five Police Colt Magnum revolvers are mixed…one is loaded and the other empty. Kennedy engages his mind power to decipher which one could potentially kill him. In another stunt, Kennedy wowed the people of York, England as he was set his biggest challenge to date.</p>
<p>Let us look at this young man’s amazing list of achievements:</p>
<p><br />
February 2004 – Published author of a book on mind reading technique</p>
<p>August 2005 - Front page of MY Life for the Newcastle Chronicle Newspaper</p>
<p>September 2005 – A National Theatre tour across the UK, performing in theatres holding 3000 people capacity.</p>
<p>October 2005 - Second book release on further mind reading techniques</p>
<p>November 2005 - Listed as the North East’s No.1 Wedding Entertainer by Bride Magazine.</p>
<p>January 2006 - In talks with a TV production company about a major new series on prime time TV in England.</p>
<p>May 2006 - Special Guest at Nationwide Building Society’s Annual Dinner.</p>
<p>May 2006 - Special Guest Performer at the internationally renowned House of Illusion, Salut in Spain.</p>
<p>May 2006 - Hide and Seek in York city centre, England. The city centre manager of York has hidden an object in the city. Kennedy has to find it. He doesn’t know where it is, as if that wasn’t enough he doesn’t even know what he is trying to find. To make the whole challenge even more difficult for our Mindreader, Kennedy will never have met the gentleman before and thus will not know whether he will be susceptible to his techniques.</p>
<p>July 2006 - National Theatre Tour</p>
<p>Kennedy is hailed as one of the UK’s most up and coming, most engaging and interactive live acts and is fast getting an international reputation for his amazing abilities to simply know what people are thinking.</p>
<p>Influences; Kennedy claims he has a lot of influences for the work that he does. His main is Uri Gellar who seemed to start of this work and move it very steadily to the public forum. Since he performs his skills, Kennedy is an admirer of performers too and since he was a magician in his past life he has great respect for the likes of Joseph Dunninger, Raymond Carlisle and Morace Fogel.</p>

<p><br />
Rob Smith is a singer/songwriter and musician from Dublin, Ireland. He was once the drummer of a Beatles-influenced quintet called The Gears. They parted in 2000. He decided to spend his time writing solo material. He did not play his first proper solo gig until 2004. He is best known for choosing not to release any material "until my following is in the hundreds, if not thousands. Until then there's no point" he once said.</p>
<p>He has compiled a collection of rarities and demos and calls it "The Soul Shaker L.P.". These CD's are sometimes given out either for free or for 1euro or 2euro. In December 2005 a copy of this demo went onsale on eBay and sold for UK£24.33 with eleven people bidding.</p>
<p>He has regularly toured with the likes of Aslan, The Stone Roses Experience to name but a few and has played venues such as Olympia Theatre, Vicar Street, The Village, Castlebar Royal Theatre, Dolans Limerick, Belfast Limelight, Glasgow Garage, Barcelona Las Ramblas amongst many others. In June 2006 he is set to play his first ever UK headline show at Liverpool's Cavern Club.</p>
