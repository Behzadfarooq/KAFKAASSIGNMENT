<li><b>Comment</b> In Gardner's book, "The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix", p. 42, he mentions prior publication of the list in the Aug. 10 Newsweek and the Aug. 21 Time magazine in 1964, so I doubt he was the original author of the list. Like most urban folklore, the origin may never be established. The list, as reproduced in his book, contains only 16 items. The entire chapter 4 of the book is devoted to the subject. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 17:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, it's just a list of coincidences. In fact, some are not even conincidences, like "Both Corbett and Ruby were known as unstable men who were prone to violence." This would be expected in lone assassins (as opposed to a military operation or a revolutionary group) of political figures. Another thing that is not irregular enough to be a coincidence is "Both assassins knew of their victims' whereabouts by reading about it in newspapers." The media is by far the most likely source of information for the assassins, so there are two choices, newspapers and television news. Others are just silly, like "Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theatre. Kennedy was shot in a Ford car; a Lincoln limousine." Still others are common to many if not most U.S. presidents, like military service and the studying of law. Few things that are listed are true coincidences and most of them are still not that unusual. However, coincidences happen all the time and there are so many things that are not coincidences that are not listed. For example, the presidents and assassins had different first and last names and they were not wearing identical clothing during the assassinations. Also, they were not shot on the same date. Finally, the presidents and assassins were different ages at the time of the assassinations (measured to the year). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:34, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> True, this has been around for a long time, but it's hardly encyclopaedic. If we had an article on Buddy Starcher's top forty hit "History Repeats Itself" from '66 where he just spouts off some of these, perhaps one or two examples could be included there, but on its own it's just an arbitrary collection of info that could be done for any two entities.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The rewrite is better and the topic may squak by as far as encyclopaedic content.

<li><b>Keep</b> if rewritten for context per Dhartung.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not aware of another such list of similarities that has anywhere near the notability of this list, so we are not in danger of a flood of similar articles. This list has been circulating for <b>43</b> years. As mentioned by others, the article needs cleanup to clarify the status as urban legend, remove the less commonly noted similarities, and note the faults and inaccuracies of many of the items on the list. That doesn't change the status of this list as a notable piece of American folklore. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 16:54, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I've seen this circulate many times, just rewrite per what everybody's saying. Cut down on the amount of items listed and explain the folklore surrounding it. Specifically, talk about the similarities between the assassinations, as that's rather unique to the two presidents. A lot of the other stuff is, as has been pointed out, pure chance, however the assassination similarities are rather striking. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 17:48, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but trim it down to only the most cited coincidences/similarities. This is a subject that has certainly been notable enough to be featured in TV documentaries and discussions of the assassinations. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:58, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The accuracy of the list is not in dispute! It is known to contain false information. The article needs to make clear that the list is inaccurate, but that does not diminish the notability of the list as folklore.

<li><b>Keep</b> - But clean up and include verifiable comparisons. These coincidences have long been the subject of speculation, and has enjoyed discussion accross many publications; including <a href="../../../r/i/p/Ripley%27s_Believe_it_or_Not_088e.html" title="Ripley's Believe it or Not">Ripley's Believe it or Not</a> as well as many "non-fiction" books on the paranormal. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkurix_1622.html" title="User:Merkurix">Merkurix</a> 03:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I tried to clean it up, but the biggest problem is the selection criteria. They all have been chosen to suggest a connection that doesn't exist. Should we also list all of their dissimilarities so as to not lead the reader down an inappropriate train of thought? This list is encouraging the reader to draw illogical conclusions based on the article. A disclaimer at the top would be pointless, because at that point we're admitting the unencyclopedicness of the article. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 02:38, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I have completely rewritten the article. I hope folks find this rewrite acceptable. If so, perhaps we can keep the article either at its current location, or at a new name such as <b>Lincoln Kennedy Coincidences (urban legend)</b>. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 05:07, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think this is the proper approach to take with this article (I was going to propose something similar, but then decided Syphonbyte pretty much covered it). The article should be about the phenomenon of drawing irrational conclusions based on selective comparisons of important individuals. What it be <i>real</i> great would be if we could find some primary sources to cite. With that, I've changed my vote to <b>Keep</b> on the basis of the rewrite, but would support a name change. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 13:10, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> it presents the list in a very POV light and immediately beginning by stating that it is <i>debunked</i> - how can an article on an english encyclopedia use the word debunk and still seem balanced? It is unfortunate though as this could be a good article - however not as a list as a history of the list with some examples and a discussion of the discrepancies.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not quite. It states that Martin Gardner debunked the list and cites the book where he debunked it. It does not say that Martin Gardner was correct.

<li><b>Comment</b> hmm yeah but does he use the word debunk? If not then it is the article authors view not fact. Besides it gets used in a seperate context later on which indicates the debunking as fact not a given point of view - slight differenc I know but it niggles me.
