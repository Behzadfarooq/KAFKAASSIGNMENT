<p><b>Delete</b> the article was nominated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_films_by_gory_death_scene_9a48.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of films by gory death scene">once previously</a> with a result of no consensus. The article is an indscriminate collection of information along with being a repository of loosely-associated topics. The fact that a film has one or more "gory death scenes" is not sufficient to relate it to another such film. Many of the "keep"s from the last round were variations on <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. There are also POV issues in deciding whether a film death is "gory" enough to qualify.</p>

<li>Loosely-associated topics are ones which are connected through incidental similarities. Apples, fire trucks and red giant suns are all red, but beyond the coincidence of color they share no similarities which would warrant including them together on an encyclopedic list. A film about the French Revolution has nothing in common with Friday the 13th just because both involve scenes of decapitation, but this list would lump such films together based solely on that one commonality. That is simply insufficient association between the subjects to warrant a list. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:25, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is the relationship between, for example, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypto.html" title="Apocalypto">Apocalypto</a>, a film set in the closing days of the Mayan civilization, and <a href="../../../i/_/s/I_Spit_on_Your_Grave_653e.html" title="I Spit on Your Grave">I Spit on Your Grave</a>, set in the United States in the 1970s, other than they contain "death by violent organ removal"?

<ul>
<li>I think you answered your own question. The fashion of death they portray is something they have in common. Now granted, you or I may not think this association is particularly interesting, but then again, I don't find the subject of Oriel College (FA on the main page today) particularly riveting (no offense to the editors of that article). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:13, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, the manner of death of a character is what they have in common. That is <i>all</i> they have in common. There is no commonality between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Evil_Dead_77ff.html" title="The Evil Dead">The Evil Dead</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Mighty_Morphin%27_Power_Rangers%7E_The_Movie_2372.html" title="Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie</a> other than they both have a death scene involving dismemberment (which, by the way, I question that MMPR has any "gory" death scenes at all) and this one trivial intersection makes the list an improper loose association. There is no commonality between <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gremlins_2.html" title="Gremlins 2">Gremlins 2</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Soldier_3195.html" title="Universal Soldier">Universal Soldier</a> other than a "death by blendering" (which, U.S. was a "wood chippering" so that's even less commonality) which makes the list an improper loose association. There is no commonality between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_After_e65b.html" title="The Day After">The Day After</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jaws_2.html" title="Jaws 2">Jaws 2</a> beyond that each has a character who burns to death, making listing them together an improper loose association. Items on a list need to have more in common with each other than the items on this list do, under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:39, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are taking a very broad interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> is for lists of loosely-associated "quotations, aphorisms, or persons", phonebooks, and business directories. Only the first one <i>might</i> (note my emphasis) be applicable. Note that all of your examples are of the type "no commonality ... other than". Other than suggests that there is a commonality. Whether that commonality is sufficient is a different matter. You believe it's not; I believe it is. Obviously those editors who created and edited this article believe it is. You or I may not find the association interesting enough so that it isn't "loose", but that does not imply that it is an inherently loose association. Rather it is a reflection of our personal preferences. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:15, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The exact wording is "<b>Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics</b> <i>such as</i> quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional)." (italics added, bold in original). These are <i>examples</i> of loosely-associated topics, not an exhaustive list of them. This is a list of loosely-associated topics, and if you don't think that the association of the <i>films</i> qualifies under the policy then it certainly does as a losse association of fictional characters who have nothing in common but mode of death. And the strength of the association has nothing to do with whether the associated items are "interesting." I have not said one word about whether this list is "interesting" or not as <a href="../../../i/n/t/WP%7EINTERESTING_6e23.html" title="WP:INTERESTING">WP:INTERESTING</a> is not a valid argument for inclusion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:25, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I <i>did</i> notice the wording and that's why I wrote "<i>might</i>" above instead of "doesn't". <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> can only apply if it is indeed proven that this is a loose association. How can you prove it? My point is that the fact that you think it is "loose" is only your interpretation resulting, in my opinion, from your lack of interest in the association. "Interesting" is not a valid reason for inclusion, but "Uninteresting" is not a valid reason for deletion. If the consensus view is that the association is indeed "loose", then alright. But as long as it is the opinion of just a few editors, I think it ought to be kept and improved. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:02, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have offered a number of examples of how this is a loose association. I have offered multiple combinations of films included on the list and asked what they have in common other than a character dying a certain way. No one has offered up anything to refute the notion that the examples are anything other than loosely associated. And I have not suggested either that this list is uninterested or that the level of interest in the list is a reason for deleting it. Now. Can you explain how the films listed here are not a loose association or not? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:06, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have offered multiple combinations of films that are associated only by a character dying a certain way. You asked what they have in common other than this? The simple answer is: nothing (at least that I know of)! However, this is not proof of "loose association". You are assuming <i>a priori</i> that "a character dying a certain way" is a loose association. That is only an assumption. Only once that assumption is accepted, is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> applicable. However, I dispute that assumption, and thus think it should be kept. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:56, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Which frankly strikes me as a variation of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:01, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>As I have commented above, <i>your arguments</i> strikes me as a variation of <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. There is an association/commonality between the films, which you (for whatever reason) don't like and don't seem to think is sufficient. My argument is mostly a counter to your insistence on the presence of <i>at least two</i> commonalities between films to establish a "non-loose" association. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually I don't think you said anything about <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> before but your arguments all tend to blend together after a while. Anyway, yes, things on a list should generally have more than one thing in common to be retained here. Bananas, canaries, some diamonds and the Sun are all yellow, but List of yellow things would be deleted as a loose association. Films that share no elements of plot, theme, setting, time period or style, but have in common a particular method of killing a character (but even that's not really a common feature since even within the subsets of death types there is a wide variety of implements and manners of death), are similarly lossely associated. I don't think it's the slightest bit unreasonable to expect that a listing of films have something more in common than a few feet of footage depicting a similar thing. We would not have List of films with shoes in them or List of films that show bunny rabbits or any other of a wide variety of unrelated loose associations and this one is no better. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:32, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My comments that attributed your arguments to a lack of "interest" on your part in the topic was my (perhaps too) subtle way of suggesting <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. As for my argument, they blend together, do they? I have a hard time seeing how one object can blend "together" with itself. My argument from the start has been that the association is not "loose", thus rejecting the basis of your nomination. The number of associations is not as relevant as the <i>nature</i> of the association(s). List of yellow things that are round, weigh less than 1kg, edible, and can be penetrated by a butter knife is not an improvement over List of yellow things even though the former has 5 associations versus the latter's 1. You think this association is loose? Fine, that's your personal preference. I don't consider it loose. Yes, the article needs significant improvement (specific criteria, additional information on the films, better sourcing, etc.), but I disagree that the concept itself is fundamentally flawed. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:51, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Resetting indent.</b> Fine, even if you reject the idea of the number of associations in favor of the quality, which is a mistake, the quality ofg the associations here is also poor, as I've pointed out several times. <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypto.html" title="Apocalypto">Apocalypto</a> and <a href="../../../i/_/s/I_Spit_on_Your_Grave_653e.html" title="I Spit on Your Grave">I Spit on Your Grave</a>. They are associated only by the "death by violent organe removal" scene. But what does knowing that both of these films have "violent organ removal" tell us about either film or about the films in relation to each other? The former is a high-budget prestige project about the final days of the Mayan civilization. The other is a low-budget exploitation-style film about a woman avenging her rape. What kind of quality association do these films have with each other? <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fargo_%28film%29.html" title="Fargo (film)">Fargo</a> is a critically-acclaimed Academy Award-winning black comedy about a heavily pregnant sheriff investigating murder and blackmail. <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Soldier_%281992_film%29_ad02.html" title="Universal Soldier (1992 film)">Universal Soldier</a> is a science fiction/action film about Vietnam soldiers who are cryonically frozen, mindwiped and unleashed as super-cyborgs. Where is the high-quality association between those films, despite each having a scene where a man gets fed through a woodchipper? <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_After_e65b.html" title="The Day After">The Day After</a> has a scene of unnamed extras burning to death in a nuclear explosion in Kansas in the 1980s. The quality association with <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Sherlock_Holmes_8470.html" title="Young Sherlock Holmes">Young Sherlock Holmes</a>, in which young women are burned to death by hot wax or oil during the Victorian era, is what exactly? None. None of these films has any association with each other, from either a quantitative or a qualitative standpoint, beyond a death by a similar method, and even that one similarity in many or most cases don't even match up. No similarities, no commonalities, loose association, bad list. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:05, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><small>I hope you don't mind--I'm capitalizing the "Resetting indent" part of your comment so that it's easier to find and distinguish.</small> I understand your points and will readily admit that the association that exists between the movies is not among the <i>most</i> relevant or significant (I disagree, however, with the idea that it is irrelevant or insiginificant). However, consider this. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Antchouet_da7b.html" title="Henry Antchouet">Henry Antchouet</a> is a Gabonese football attacker. <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jono_Bacon_6fbd.html" title="Jono Bacon">Jono Bacon</a> is a writer and software developer based in the United Kingdom. These people seem to share nothing in common other than that they were both born in 1979 and are both classified in <a href="../../../1/9/7/Category%7E1979_births.html" title="Category:1979 births">Category:1979 births</a>. Does this mean that the "by birth" categories are based on a "loose association"? Of course not. You ask for sources that demonstrate the cultural significance of "gory deaths". There are plenty <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22gory+death%22+-wikipedia+%2Bfilm" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22gory+death%22+-wikipedia+%2Bfilm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22gory+death%22+-wikipedia+%2Bmovie" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22gory+death%22+-wikipedia+%2Bmovie" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22death+scene%22+-wikipedia+%2Bmovie" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22death+scene%22+-wikipedia+%2Bmovie" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and you could get a lot more by using various different search terms. There is cultural interest in and plenty of publishes sources about death scenes in film. There are <a href="http://www.cinemorgue.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.cinemorgue.com/" rel="nofollow">directories of deaths in films</a> (<a href="http://www.moviedeaths.com/deaths/" class="external text" title="http://www.moviedeaths.com/deaths/" rel="nofollow">more than one</a>), <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120784,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120784,00.html" rel="nofollow">articles about disturbing deaths scenes</a>, and plenty of blogs and online polls about the "best" or "worst" death scenes (which usually don't count as RS's, but are an indication of cultural interest in the subject). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:29, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if there are so many other indexes of gory deaths on the web, this one is hardly necessary, is it? And a cursory look at a few of the things your google searches turned up doesn't seem to indicate that they are analyses of the cultural significance of gory death scenes in films. But since I never suggested that there wasn't interest in the topic, your point isn't really that relevant. As far as the "by birth" categories, my understanding is that they are maintined in some measure for legal reasons because of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. But of course you know that the existence of that series of <i>categories</i> has absolutely nothing to do with the existence of this <i>article</i> so I'm not sure why you even brought them up. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I brought in the analogy to illustrate the point that two entries can be categorized/listed together even if they share only <i>one</i> commonality. As regards your first point about the necessity of the list, I will give three replies. First, the online directors of gory deaths are indexes of deaths by movie or deaths by actress (not deaths by type, which is the case here). Second, in addition to indexes of gory deaths, there are <i>articles</i> which address the subject. Third, ... almost everything on Wikipedia is taken from online sources. If we follow the principle of "why write on it if it's already on the web?", we'd need to eliminate all but a few hundred or few thousand WP articles which exclusively use book sources. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Categories and lists serve different purposes and are subject to different rules and guidelines. Things that would not survive as lists routinely exist as categories because of the differences in the two organizationsl systems. Citing a category tree as support for a list article, especially when the category tree may be maintained for specific legal reasons, is a poor analogy. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:06, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, granted, the analogy may not have been a particularly good one (I thought it applicable because the basic purpose of categories and lists is essentially the same--to organize information/entries), especially if what you say about issues of legality is true (I'm not doubting your honesty, it just is obvious from your comment that you yourself are not entirely certain). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:31, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, possibly split</b> The information for the list should be kept, but perhaps split the sections up into separate lists to get a better focus on the type of death scene. A separate intro could be included for each type of death to explain their significance in films. This list should obviously be expanded, and if it's split up, it will be easier to focus on adding films on each individual death scene. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 05:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, maybe split, definitely rename to something more accurate and more encyclopedic (like List of films categorized by unnatural methods of death). <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>bd2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 12:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per all the reasons already given, plus this is a highly-detailed, information-packed, well-organized list that could not easily be replaced with a category. Gore-hounds are extremely interested in just this information, making it of cultural significance. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 18:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article is useful for categorising and/or listing films notable for gory and cruel death scenes. This, coupled with the manner of death in question, speeds research into various modes of violence used the splatter/horror/ultra violent genre. However I agree the article needs some guidelines in the nature of what to include and where -- it is too easy to degenerate into a "cool list of splatter scenes". --<a href="../../../j/q/u/User%7EJquarry_fa2e.html" title="User:Jquarry">Jquarry</a> 05:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Possibly split, criteria would be useful too.
