<li><b>Comment</b> - "Cat Stuck Up Tree" - that's a little unfair. This guy likes to measure muscle in some sexually perverted way. He has been infamous in the NW of England for some years. a *REAL* Urban Legend, not an Urban Myth.</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. This man has made the national news, and is now known far outside Widnes. Now he belongs to the world. I've gone through the article and made it as good as it is ever likely to be; the local trivia was fascinating but the only sources I could find were forum posts, blog entries etc, which are insubstantial. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 12:21, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep - The article needs rewriting with a number of additions, placed into it. There freely available pictures of Akinwale Arobieke on the internet, as well as numerous news reports. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/6087922.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/6087922.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/6087922.stm</a> from 27/10/06 refers to his release and conditions. He is also a wide spread 'Urban Legend' from the North West of england and until his arrest following the harrassment of over 123 persons, and his sentence of 31 indefinate restraining orders. He has been in Prison for the last 3 years I believe</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - notable urban myth that turned out not to be a myth <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilandi_2556.html" title="User:Evilandi">Andrew Oakley</a> 16:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - It seems that perhaps calling it a stub would be appropriate as there is little actual info from the case, for example, as to what this person actually did. <a href="../../../3/c/o/User%7E3countylaugh.html" title="User:3countylaugh">3countylaugh</a> 20:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - very notable as an urban myth who is known to people across a large part of the UK. Also notable as a real individual for his crimes.--Suttonpubcrawl 01:03, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The subject of the article has been the inspiration for at least two songs by noted bands (The Ballad Of Purple Acky by Hungy Ghosts and Ode To Purle Ackey by Zen Baseball Bat), and has as such entered the popular consciousness to some degree. Also, there is an (admittedly unconfirmed) case to be made that Clive Barker's 'Candyman' draws heavily on the mythos surounding Aki before his arrest and subsequent confirmation of his existence.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - if you live in Liverpool, St. Helens, Warrington or Widnes you will have heard of him. Try telling all of his victims he isn't notable. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenorKristobbal_a2de.html" title="User:SenorKristobbal">SenorKristobbal</a> 09:08, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I do. And I would still maintain that he isn't notable. The article was also full of dubious information with nothing to back it up (e.g. "he chased a kid on to the railway lines in New Brighton and electrocuted him but was found not guilty of manslaughter"). Happily, the article has been cleaned up substantially since the AfD, but what verifiable information there is, is contained in scant few online news stories and is barely enough to make more than a stub. There are hundreds of crimes (and sex crimes) committed every day and Wikipedia doesn't carry articles on them. Equally there are dozens of Urban Legends like the story of "Purple Aki" and Wikipedia doesn't carry articles on all of those. This story is nothing special - perhaps the most notable thing about it is that he was never convicted of anything more than harrassment and intimidation; despite the legend that built up around his activites. Purple Aki is not the Yorkshire Ripper. He is not Fred West. He is barely a footnote. All IMHO. Marwood 09:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Barely enough to make more than a stub."? Are you proposing the deletion of all stub articles then? Also, you note that there are many other urban legends like that of Purple Aki, but how many of these other urban legends have been proven as being based on a real figure? It's very interesting as an example of an urban legend which many believed to be purely false until the man himself was captured.--83.216.157.38 11:19, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Fair comment. I wouldn't propose the deletion of all stubs, no. However the "stub" exists as a placeholder for a topic that needs expansion. I would contend that there isn't enough <i>verifiable</i> material to write a full article on Purple Aki - it is all rumour and hearsay. It looks like consensus is "keep" though, so I hope someone will find the time to create a good factual article on the subject. IMO, however, it can't be done.
