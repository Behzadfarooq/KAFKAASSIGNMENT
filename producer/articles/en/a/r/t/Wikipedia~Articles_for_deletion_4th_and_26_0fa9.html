<p>I didn't prod this because I think it's borderline, but I don't see this as a play worthy of its own article. It was a difficult play to convert, sure, but was it notable?

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I simply can't decide on this one. On the one hand, it was a huge play that was analyzed over and over and over and over again. On the other hand, it was just <i>one</i> 4th down play, and one that, in the long run, was unimportant- the Eagles still lost in the conference championship game. This isn't to say that other huge plays haven't come from teams that didn't win the Super Bowl, but those plays were things like the Music City Miracle or the Miracle at the Meadowlands- absolutely spectacular, you-will-never-see-this-again plays. A 4th-and-26 play does not fall into that category. So, tough as it is, I'm voting for delete. Barely. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:43, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Plenty of notable single plays are already included (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Catch_c9a9.html" title="The Catch">The Catch</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fumble_e752.html" title="The Fumble">The Fumble</a>, etc.). The fact that the Eagles did in fact <a href="http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/homeNewsDetail.jsp?id=8918" class="external text" title="http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/homeNewsDetail.jsp?id=8918" rel="nofollow">sell shirts</a> making reference to the play also helps. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 03:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think comparing this play to either the Catch or the Fumble is a huuuuge stretch. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 04:08, 16 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking</a> says it doesn't matter because the Eagles still lost, but then the Broncos still lost the Super Bowl after the Catch and the Fumble, and the Titans still lost the Super Bowl after the Music City Miracle. If the Eagles don't make a play which required them to get a quarter of the field's worth of yardage, they lose. Simple as that. That at least ranks with the Tuck Rule as a play worthy of <b>Keep</b>ing. -- <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlGreven_50ab.html" title="User:IlGreven">Grev</a> 04:12, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: For whatever it's worth at this point, it's certainly up there with the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_City_Relay_81db.html" title="River City Relay">River City Relay</a>, and not only was that not a playoff game, but the Saints didn't even win. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 18:35, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>You rank this play up there with "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Catch_%28American_football%29_4585.html" title="The Catch (American football)">The Catch</a>"? Seriously?? Still I suppose I can buy keeping the article in that it was notable for Eagles fans, at least for now. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 04:15, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's too recent for comparisons, quite honestly. It is, however, in football folklore now, kind of like the tuck... we just need to see if it stays in there over an extended period of time. -- Jjjsixsix <sup>(t)</sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jjjsixsix_2e5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jjjsixsix">(c)</a></sub> <small>@</small> 04:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Well, I've come to agree that there is some claim to notability here, but for the record I think that some of you don't fully understand the significance of plays like the "Hand of God," a very famous, oft-replayed and controversial goal. A similar claim can be made about the "Immaculate Reception." The Catch and the Fumble, likewise, have their place etched in sports lore. There's Doug Flutie's Hail Mary, a last second 50-yard prayer that is miraculously caught and wins the game. There's The Play, a game won between two heated rivals based on a kickoff return featuring five laterals. This, on the other hand, is simply a long fourth down conversion in a non-championship, conference or otherwise, playoff game. It was impressive and probably notable as it relates to Eagles fans, but I don't think it's at all accurate to compare it to these other plays. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 06:05, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Well worded article about important event in Green Bay Packer history. If innumerable anime characters get articles, this decisive play should have one, too. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">Baron</a><a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBaronLarf_6f13.html" title="User talk:BaronLarf">Larf</a> 05:55, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak Keep</b>, I would <b>delete as above</b> but I think anime characters are a lost cause. My main quam with this is that it's poorly written and unclear. Some pictures and copyeditting would really help it but I think it's notable enough. <a href="../../../o/l/l/User%7EOlleicua_887d.html" title="User:Olleicua">Olleicua</a> 17:52, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There is <i>no way</i> this can be compared to the Hand of God, which changed the outcome of a world competition and led to significant international tension. This play is not widely known outside fans of a single sports team. Therefore, it is not encyclopedic material. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:28, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tell me how it would affect an Ohio State fan. And even if it does have a more wide-reaching effect than the others, explain what significance Red Right 88 has outside of Cleveland, 25 years after the fact, or the Miracle at the Meadowlands (a regular season game, no less) has outside Philly or New York (the Eagles lost their first playoff game while the Giants didn't make it at all).<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 20:15, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, but what about <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Right_88_aa13.html" title="Red Right 88">Red Right 88</a>, which was not only a single play, but one that didn't even work, for a team that lost the game? --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 01:51, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I'd say that was significant to the team's history.
