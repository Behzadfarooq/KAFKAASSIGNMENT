<dd>The Williamette Week Online article has two sentences about the site and two sentences describing interesting stories. It's pretty trivial. The Portland one isn't online, so I can't check it. The title isn't promising. Horowitz has about a paragraph of information, but that still falls into the "directories" exclusion of sources that don't count for notability, and even if we count it, it's still only a single source. If you can find me another good solid paragraph about the site, then you might have something. The problem is that almost all of the links and sources given are trivial in their information about the site. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

To my own surprise I could find no full-length articles treating the website as their subject. <i>That said</i>, the citations speak for themselves -- this website not only republishes articles from other sources (using standard newswire contracts, as far as I can tell), its material (a portion of which is original) is republished and cited elsewhere, and it has been <i>mentioned</i> or <i>cited</i> by almost every major news organization in the US and UK, either because it was the only stable URL for an article or because it was the only online source, period, for some. We can certainly <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> that much about it. The website predates Wikipedia (not that being a non-profit is an automatic pass) and predates virtually everything known today as a blog, and has a high Alexa ranking.

<li>That's true.

If there are 101 ghits, it's easy enough to skim through them. If there are $BIGNUM, it isn't. Likewise, separating all the trivial news reports isn't easy. I still think that skimmimg recent journalism/media studies textbooks would be the best way for people who want this kept to conclusively prove that it is notable, but I've neither the time nor the inclination to check.

The absolute <i>best</i> source I have seen offered above is a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0865714428&amp;id=7vD55mKAVmoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA202&amp;lpg=RA1-PA202&amp;ots=vMEOmB9qE4&amp;dq=common+dreams+news&amp;sig=GZpjpW4JAkUH7is3LlLnKaAlg3I" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0865714428&amp;id=7vD55mKAVmoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA202&amp;lpg=RA1-PA202&amp;ots=vMEOmB9qE4&amp;dq=common+dreams+news&amp;sig=GZpjpW4JAkUH7is3LlLnKaAlg3I" rel="nofollow">two sentence description</a> of the site in a book that is apparently only held in <a href="http://worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/49205454&amp;tab=holdings?loc=98101" class="external text" title="http://worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/49205454&amp;tab=holdings?loc=98101" rel="nofollow">four libraries in the entire world</a>. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#Criteria" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB#Criteria</a> specifically defines "a brief summary of the content" as "trivial" coverage, so the <i>Better World Handbook</i> therefore fails to satisfy even one of the <i>multiple</i> non-trivial independent references required to establish notability, and the <i>Better World Handbook</i> is the <i>best</i> source I have seen offered. With no sources to establish notability, the remaining arguments are "I like this website (ILIKEIT)" and "Morton is a poo poo head (IDONTLIKEMORTON)." Neither of those is a valid argument, and therefore, AFAICT, the site doesn't meet notability criteria. We're not in the business of writing articles about <i>popular</i> websites, we're in the business of writing <i>sourced</i> articles about <i>notable</i> websites. No one has offered even one non-trivial source, much less multiple such sources, and I therefore recommend deletion.

<li><b>Summary</b> Its notable enough that multiple newspapers use it for a source and reference it. There are lots of popular sites on the web, like <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> however they are not used as sources for major newspapers. The fact that major newspapers use them as a source goes to show the site is notable. If you would like a closed examination it would be to look at Digg.com, where as Digg is not referenced by Washington Post, they are not because they are popular but not notable. Where as Common Dreams is both. Its hard to see the line where popularity and notability divide, however when major newspapers and not just average people begin using it as a source, its clear its passed that line. So how do we find out if a news source is notable? The basic idea of a news source is to cover other items and people, not to attract coverage for itself. Much like Schools do not require sources to show their notability, it makes little sense why a news source would, considering the popularity and notability (enough to be cited by the biggest national papers). It seems to say that Washington Post and other national papers find them notable enough to include thier views and cite them, but since there is little evidence of someone writing about them, they fail WP:N, is a bit of wikilawyering. What happened to the spirit of Wikipedia and not the letter of the policy? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 20:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not really sure what you are talking about.

<dd>There's been no consensus that being cited indicates notability, that's why that doesn't appear in the guidelines. This isn't wikilawyering over technical details, this is making up a new definition of notability and saying it is "in the spirit".

<dd>Please AGF. I am stating that we adhere to the spirit of the guidelines, stating that an article cannot exist without sources is false, hence the WP:SCHOOL example. My point isnt that citations are required to be notable, its that citations for a news site are an example of notability. How can they be not notable yet often references by the most notable sources in the world? That makes little sense.

<dd>Please AGF yourself, wiklawyering is a pejorative term. And my point still stands: this isn't wikilawyering by people arguing "delete". Your argument for notability (and I'm not commenting on the validity of it here) isn't expressed by the principles or spirit of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Nobody is arguing over technical points, they are saying that the principle - multiple, non-trivial mentions in independent reliable sources - isn't met. So by all means make your arguments for notability, but don't make false attacks on the other side. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 21:50, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not sure why you keep repeating yourself, but I already explained this. Who said its part of WP:N?

<dd>Um no, I have been specifically stating that the criteria in that <b>guideline</b> is not appropriate. Did you read the massive paragraph? It makes comparisons to WP:SCHOOL where schools are deamed notable without having someone write about them, etc. As for accusations of wikilawyering, it wasnt meant as a attack, its a term. Seeing as there has been a mountain of WP:INSERT GUIDELINE HERE talk, it seems there is much wikilawyering going on.

<dd><a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">Wikilaywering</a> is a pejorative term, so there's an implied attack there. And I don't think any wikilawyering has gone on; it's not simply quoting and using policies and guidelines, but dwelling on technical details which override the spirit. But this argument isn't really relevant to the deletion debate, so I will accept it as a difference of opinions (and advise that using the term doesn't normally help your cause). On topic again, I disagree that being cited indicates notability; I think a topic needs to have been specifically written about. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 20:52, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
