<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> to delete.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. In fact, it appears that all the lists in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_publications_in_science_36ea.html" title="Category:Lists of publications in science">Category:Lists of publications in science</a> suffer the same problems. However, as only this is the only one that appears to be nominated, I'll stick to this one. The "criteria" are far too vague or subjective and are all a matter of opinion or a judgment call. We only have the say-so of the editors adding the publication to the list that the publication is "important" No sources are provided to back up the allegation of importance. How do we know a book is a "good" introduction or survey? How do we measure "influence"? What constitutes "most advanced"? There is nothing to verify or support these opinions. Isn't this list better left where it belongs, in a library's catalog listing? There also seems to be no line drawn to keep the list from getting longer and longer. "Importance" diminishes in a crowd. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> -- re: above, I don't know of any library catalogs that will tell you what papers are important out of all of them&#160;:) which is sort of the point of making a secondary list. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrassratgirl_9ef9.html" title="User:Brassratgirl">phoebe</a> 01:35, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> any list with "Important" as a criterion. Major POV there. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 01:21, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> - what is the criteria for inclusion in such a list? <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 01:51, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The biology article has been brought here twice and kept. It was after the last time that the word "important" was added to all these lists. The chemistry list has a process to debate importance and come to consensus. I recommend that the others do the same. These lists are slowly approaching being lists of publications with a wide appreciation of their importance. If people think some entries are not important they can propse removing them on the talk page. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 02:20, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But importance is subjective. It does not MATTER if there's a consensus as to what constitutes importance, since it's still a subjective consensus. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 02:21, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think we often use consensus to decide whether things are notable, important, etc. In the case of the chemistry article there some criteria about what importance means. These lists allow a reader to find a book that is historically or educationally notable within a discipline, so they are important articles. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 02:27, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it's being used to list all <i>notable</i> publications, then it should just be renamed to remove "important", but that's not the impression I got. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 02:30, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As I said when one of these lists came to Afd before, the consensus was to add "important". Now you want to remove it. It just shows that AfD debates are often not consistent. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 02:37, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And... who said they were? Can you imagine the trouble we'd be in if results of AfD debates were binding throughout eternity? -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 02:44, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surely if these publications are notable in themselves, they are worthy of individual articles. Those can then be listed. Otherwise the criteria for inclusion is very vague and subjective. Is 'important' a lower test that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and if so, how is it determined? <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 02:36, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It does not appear when these lists come here that people are aware that they are part of a Wikiproject - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Science_pearls_6ea7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Science pearls">Wikipedia:WikiProject Science pearls</a>. I think we need to determine whether this article meets the criteria set out there and then whether these criteria are proper for Wikipedia. If they are not, then the whole project and its created pages should go. Such a debate might lead to a positive developement rather than just deleting stuff that many editors have contributed to and found usefull. I note that the editor who started this Project - <a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAPH_6b7e.html" title="User:APH">User:APH</a> has not contributed to WP since January 2006. I do not know why but last year he was trying to make a positive contribution to WP with this project. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 03:28, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Existence of a wikiproject does not denote or import encyclopedic value or notability upon an article within the subject matter of the project.

</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> There are many such groups, where individual publications are other entities are not notable enough for a separate article, but are as part of an article such as this. We right here frequently end our discussions with consensus on a merge, and that produces such articles. The precedent with other sciences has been established. There are some people who don't like such articles, but there are more who contribute to them. Contributions to such articles tend to com in bursts.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 01:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, your claim is quite ridiculous. If a publication is not notable for a separate topic, then how can it be "important"? `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 23:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> This list has actually been useful to me in my job (as an academic); just now, I went specifically looking for it &amp; came across this AFD. There may be subjectivity in determining importance, but there are also npov measures -- citation analysis, # of copies sold, historical first mention of a notable topic, etc., that can be applied to lists such as these. Individual articles for people or publications are <b>much</b> less useful; they don't provide the intellectual content of gathering things together, which is the point of this list. Wikipedia shines in computer science; let's keep it that way. -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrassratgirl_9ef9.html" title="User:Brassratgirl">phoebe</a> 19:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They don't have to be individual articles. If some breakthrough was a result of 2-3 seminal works, then write a single arricle about a "broken-through" issue and describe the papers there. Right now this eclectic collection is totally useless pile of data. I am surprized how scientists don't understand the importance of proper categorizing of things. "... in computer science", indeed. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 23:40, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"In Computer Science", indeed. There are graduate programs in computer science, there are curricula in computer science, there are overview works about computer science, and there are libraries for computer science. It's a valid category, and such a list,done right, could be useful for all of these situations. I often encounter students who want to know what the seminal works in a field were. If replaced by smaller articles, whether it's an article about a publication or an article about a "breakthrough" discovery, you're still splitting up the collection of important reading in the field. I fully agree that the article needs work; but let's keep it and improve it. Also, if you're referring to me as a scientist, I'm not a scientist; I'm a librarian, so I like to think I know a little bit about organization. -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrassratgirl_9ef9.html" title="User:Brassratgirl">phoebe</a> 01:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, having this list of course doesn't preclude discussing the papers in fuller detail in the appropriate topical or discovery pages, which should be happening anyway; and a list does not preclude having individual articles about the books or papers in question. This list, like most lists, can be partly duplicative; it's another way of viewing the available information. -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrassratgirl_9ef9.html" title="User:Brassratgirl">phoebe</a> 01:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm torn about this list. The current version gets it partly right, at least in the sense that if a publication is included in the list, it is generally important. However, there is a huge problem: Who gets to decide what's considered important? Clearly it cannot be us, that would be original research. Wikipedia is a tertiary source, our job is to be a meta-meta-publication, if you will, that is, we have to find meta-publications that actually come out and say "publication A is important, publication B is not". The current list fails miserably in that regard: it doesn't cite any sources (which would have to be meta-publications, not those publications that are considered important according to the list). None. Zero. The two external links come closest, but then again who's to decide that "frequently cited" equals "important"? I want to say: <b>start over and do it right</b>. Be diligent, cite sources, use sunscreen, etc. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 21:23, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>comment</b>. Quite a few entries strike me as ridiculous. For example, a number of textbooks. However popular they are, certainly they are not groungdbreaking. Further, "Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty process" labelled as breakthru. Huh? What did it break? If it was a <i>real</i> breakthrough, there <b>should be</b> a wikipedia article no matter what someone wrote above. And so on. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 23:33, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The criterion for textbooks on most of the analogous pages are either the classic textbook in the field or the latest most widely used book.
