<dd><b>Comment:</b> I find this doubtful...the amazon.com SalesRank and lack of Google hits indicate that this author and his books simply are not notable, something that can only be changed if the book gains popularity, which is unlikely to happen before the end of this AfD... -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 00:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>comment:</b> In regards to the amazon.com Sales Rank, as of this writing, the rank indicates #88,470 in books and 52% of the people who look at the page purchase the book. The sales rank has certainly not been in the 1,000's, but can be considered notable for a first novel. However, please clarify the amazon.com sales rank standard for Wiki.</dd>
<dd><b>comment:</b> In regards to the Google search, as of this writing, a search for "bowie ibarra" has 598 unique hits, all of which, as noted before, do not relate to his book. But what is the Wiki standard for Google hits to be considered relevant.</dd>
<dd><b>comment:</b> 'Popularity' - the novel has gained a popular following among zombie fans around the world, with the first review of the original vanity printing coming from England (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk</a>). It has also been discussed on zombie themed forums across the internet. Does Wiki define 'popularity' as 'mainstream'? user:elaire26</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are no set-in-stone standards for SalesRank or number of Google hits, each Wikipedian will probably have his own opinion on how low is "too low" to really call a work notable. 88,470 (or 101,000) is probably well below anyone's threshold though. Should all the 88,469 books with a higher SalesRank be listed as well? As for Google hits, they just serve to give a broader picture of how much buzz this guy and his books are getting, how much they're being discussed and reviewed, etc. The generally-agreed-upon guidelines for notability in books can be found at <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOK_b369.html" title="WP:BOOK">WP:BOOK</a>. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 20:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment:</b> The article has attempted to take a neutral tone, providing only facts without embellishments.</dd>
<dd><b>comment:</b> If Google searches and Amazon.com sales ranks are a standard Wiki uses in determining notability, then the reviews of Brian Keene and David Moody need to be reconsidered. Author Brian Keene has a sales rank (as of this writing) for 'The Rising' at 10,164, a four star rank for his book (published two years ago) with 145 user reviews, as well as being awarded the "Bram Stoker Award" for this story. His sequel 'City of the Dead' is currently at 15,336 with a 3 and a half star rating. His Google search results in 123,000 hits. Brian Keene also has his own Wiki page. The information provided in his bibliography is comparable in tone to the article being discussed.</dd>
<dd><b>comment:</b> David Moody, who also independently reviewed the book "Down the Road" has an amazon.com sales rank as of this writing for his zombie novel "Autumn" of #36,471 for his novel published last year. A google search of "david moody" provides 119,000 hits, with not all of which relate to the author. user elaire26</dd>
