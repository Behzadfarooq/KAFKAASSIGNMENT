<p>Article is inherently <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> and can never be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - this is the type of article that would have an NPOV and cleanup tag forever since much of this data is at the level of pure allegation. My suggestion is that the article be deleted and whatever relevant information is there about each country be taken to that country's article on human rights, and anything else to articles on torture, which I think is unnecessary since the information is just a rehash of info from other Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 19:09, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> where have you found that <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is reason to delete? Also, could you eleborate on what you consider POV, especially with those notorious unreliable and biased sources as HRW, AI, WaPO, The Telegraph, et cetera. The article was started in Nov 2004.

<li>Please read <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDELETE_1b88.html" title="WP:DELETE">WP:DELETE</a> - this article is not in any shape or form encyclopedic. It is inherently POV can never be neutral - please also read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Furthermore, HRW, Amnesty, and other such groups are not in any way "neutral" or unbiased - on the contrary, they are political action groups like any other, often relying on second and third-person accounts which cannot be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. Like I said, country-specific items can be taken to the respective human rights articles for those countries. An article simply listing uses of torture in various countries can never be neutral. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 19:26, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Clearly advocating human rights is not equal to being biased. HRW, AI and others do not limit their comments to one country. Since they respond to every instance of human rights abuse the suggested POV sounds hollow. Also, you failed to explain the bias of WaPo, Telegraph, et cetera. Could you explain the cabal logic? <font color="green"><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a></font><sup><i><font color="blue"><small><a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENescio_071f.html" title="User talk:Nescio">Gnothi seauton</a></small></font></i></sup></li>

<dd><b>Delete</b>, <s>pending further checks</s>. I find it troubling that the article makes claims of torture in some places without proper citations (or any for that matter). These are extremely serious accusations that must be backed up by rock-solid references. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BLOG" title="WP:NOT">not a blog</a> and alleging torture without double- and tripple-checking one's sources (which must obviously be provided) is bordering on defamation. In any case, it's not appropriate. -- <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeed_2.0_ad50.html" title="User:Seed 2.0">Seed 2.0</a> 19:45, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did some more research (particularly relating to the non-US sections) and I'm afraid I'll have to stick with my original vote on this one. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is a <i>huge</i> problem here and it's likely to stay that way. Accusations of this magnitude must be backed up by serious, confirmable sources, every step of the way. In addition to that, I would like to point out that Wikipedia articles are not a place to voice one's opinion (and articles are not essays) - there are plenty of places on the Internet to do that but this Wiki's mainspace isn't one of them. -- <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeed_2.0_ad50.html" title="User:Seed 2.0">Seed 2.0</a> 21:51, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Divide the article into Torture and Foo articles</b>, it is a valid subject country-by-country because there is no indication that one country's practice is based on or relies on anothers. There is an article <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture_and_the_United_States_5521.html" title="Torture and the United States">Torture and the United States</a> and so we can take whatever's sourced and put it separate articles.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> The topic discussed is clearly encyclopedic, contains a great deal of well-sourced content (and some which badly needs sourcing), and is verifiable in principle. There seems to be a major problem with the structure, insofar as the country-by-country structure keeps the article consistently too long. <b>Torture in</b>, and <b>torture and foo</b> articles would be a big help. However, I have to add that there are major patterns of regional use of torture (for example in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_pact.html" title="Warsaw pact">Warsaw pact</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Condor_1508.html" title="Operation Condor">Operation Condor</a> countries historically). Several early sections of this article could be retained together with an attempt at a global summary. See, for comparison, <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_capital_punishment_by_nation.html" title="Use of capital punishment by nation">Use of capital punishment by nation</a>. We could also have a productive conversation (on talk, not here) about how to clearly and concisely represent different types of sources: conclusions of judicial review and governmental inquiries, human rights documentation, refugee reports, medical documentation, press reports, etc. Of course, NPOV and sourcing concerns should be taken up in the article itself.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarwil_fe69.html" title="User:Carwil">Carwil</a> 21:45, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> FYI, here are the unsourced statements I found:

<li>In 2002, in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cologne.html" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, a history of physical torture at Eigelstein police station only came to light because the victim died, and a post-mortem examination unearthed the facts.</li>
<li>Under <a href="../../../e/n/v/Enver_Hoxha_8c6e.html" title="Enver Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a>'s Communist dictatorship, torture was widely used.</li>

<li><a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> has used "moderate physical pressure" on terrorist suspects defined as "ticking bombs" for their knowledge of imminent terrorist attacks against civilians which the information they possessed had the power to prevent, at least since the 1970s. In 1987 the Israeli Supreme Court formed a special commission headed by retired Justice Moshe Landau, to review the whole question of physical pressure during investigations of this kind. In their report they reinforced the criteria for the use of "moderate physical pressure".</li>
<li>Russian army is believed to use torture extensively in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a> and the surrounding districts, as investigative tool, and as a deterrent/punishment for captured fighters.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I was thinking about that as well but I don't think cleanup is the way to go here for two reasons. Number 1: A lot of the material has a certain bias, which is fine. Balancing that bias (encyclopedias deal with facts, not opinions) is a Sisyphean task and, therefore, I don't forsee the cleanup tag ever coming off. Number 2: There are some good parts but the article itself is in need of a neutral rewrite (I'll admit that the line between a major, major cleanup and a rewrite is somewhat blurry and more of a technicality, ie. delete and rewrite vs. keep and cleanup). If this article is kept, it's only appropriate to mark the parts that need reliable sources since we (I think) can all agree that the article isn't exactly FA-material at this point. I think it would be easier to just wipe the slate clean and rewrite the article (using the good parts, of course and replacing the bad parts with something that isn't pushing a point). -- <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeed_2.0_ad50.html" title="User:Seed 2.0">Seed 2.0</a> 10:51, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Article could be cleaned up, but it should not be deleted. This is a serious subject and it hsouldn't be deleted just because it is difficult to present it objectively.--Darth Borehd 01:13, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Sorry but I strongly disagree with your second point. In fact, I believe it is the other way around. It is a serious subject and making allegations of torture is extremely serious indeed. Therefore, at least a best-effort to reliably source every single claim <i>must</i> be made. And, frankly, I don't see this here at all. Without reliable cites, the unsourced parts are plain and simple in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and since this is true of large portions of the article, it could make the entire thing unencyclopedic. -- <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeed_2.0_ad50.html" title="User:Seed 2.0">Seed 2.0</a> 10:25, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Important and quite wikipedic. Verifiability is a big challenge, but human rights organisations such as <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> or <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Watch_35a7.html" title="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> may provide respectable (if not infallible) sources. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 09:17, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Delete</b> -- Impossible context. There is no way to tackle torture worldwide in an article. It can't be balanced because it is always looking down from on high to specific locales. I would suggest a list in place of an article. Make a list of allegations of torture by locality, with links to articles (contexts) in which this can be addressed in a balanced way. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 13:59, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
