<li><b>Strongest possible keep</b> You just cant merge these into the RS article. It would make it far too long! All these articles are useful, and many have already been cleaned up to make them into great articles. RuneScape is a major game, and these articles provide a great deal of useful information. They are merged in to general articles, and the RS series has been greatly improved in the last few months, with <i>economy</i> being almost completely re-written to meet standards, <i>quests</i> actually re-written to turn it from a game guide into a useful and factual database of quests, and every other article has either been cleaned up or is in the process. A lot of work has gone into these and I see them all as good articles that should definately be kept - <a href="../../../u/n/i/Image%7EUnion_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg_5679.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg/20px-Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../u/n/i/Image%7EUnion_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg_5679.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/u/s/User%7EDussst_2af3.html" title="User:Dussst"><font color="blue"><b>• | ĐÜ§§§Ť | •</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../d/u/s/User_talk%7EDussst_df82.html" title="User talk:Dussst">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dussst_7b36.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dussst">C</a></sup> 16:15, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep most, or transwiki before deleting</b> - To merge would mean enormous pages (though some may be reasonable merges) - to delete would be an insult to all who provided content and edits - if they must be savagely curtailed, please aid in transwiki to <a href="http://RuneScape.wikicities.com" class="external text" title="http://RuneScape.wikicities.com" rel="nofollow">RuneScape Wiki</a> - some re-edit, movement of images etc would be required, though it would avoid the waste of deletion or massive cutbacks in a merge. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Risk_7eea.html" title="User:Ace of Risk">Ace of Risk</a> 17:04, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> How did you think of that one? The longer the article, the worse it is? And lots of the pages have been hugely re-done to avoid being a game guide, and instead become a databse of information (I myself have worked on the <i>economy</i> and <i>quests</i> articles). If the pages are game guides, then can be cleaned up. Deleting them is way too drastic. There are series for a number of other games, and I dont see them up for deletion - <a href="../../../u/n/i/Image%7EUnion_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg_5679.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg/20px-Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../u/n/i/Image%7EUnion_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg_5679.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/u/s/User%7EDussst_2af3.html" title="User:Dussst"><font color="blue"><b>• | ĐÜ§§§Ť | •</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../d/u/s/User_talk%7EDussst_df82.html" title="User talk:Dussst">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dussst_7b36.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dussst">C</a></sup> 21:28, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Totally agree. These articles can be edited down. Let's try that first before just deleting them all.

<li><b>Keep</b>. What's it to you if we have them here? They don't break any solid rules, there are similar articles about other games, and I feel that they are necessary.

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> I am not interested in RuneScape at all, and I've seen all these articles mauled badly, both by vandals and well-meaning but inept editing. They are certainly very high-maintenance, and a magnet for fancruft. It does seem, however, like there is too much legitimate, encyclopedic content on RuneScape to fit in a single article. For this reason, I'd prefer it if the articles were kept, and were cleaned up to meet Wikiepdia's standards. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 09:53, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete insignificant articles</b>. As all RuneScape players should know, the game site has its own forum, which would be clearly more suitable and more attractive to RuneScape players wanting to know something about the game. Much of the information in the pages are available in-game as well, meaning that posting articles specifically on skills and quests seems to be redundant. As a RuneScape player myself, I do not pay much attention to articles and simply "pick up" on the game information while playing. --<a href="../../../y/u/n/User%7EYunzhong_Hou_a8d2.html" title="User:Yunzhong Hou">Yunzhong Hou</a> 14:10, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b>. Runecraft is a very notable game. These articles, while somewhat different, are very similar to several other series of books or games that have multiple articles. How many hundreds or thousands of articles exist for the Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. To dismiss these articles as pure <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a> doesnt hold much weight when compared to how many minor articles have been created for other series like LOTR. If we're going to get rid of these articles, a serious look into similar series articles will also have to be taken. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottyBoy900Q_4200.html" title="User:ScottyBoy900Q"><b>ScottyBoy900Q</b></a><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottyBoy900Q_e18d.html" title="User talk:ScottyBoy900Q"><font color="red"><b>∞</b></font></a> 02:02, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep All</b>. ScottyBoy is right. Objectively we can't look at the game as a fringe piece, because there are a lot of players out there. And so if we treat this similar to other major works, most notably the LOTR series, a serious change to the format of ALL these works would be necessary. Quote Prodego: "And finally, users with very low editcounts likly haven't read the policies of Wikipedia." This is my first edit ever. But I have read the rules on several occaisions and use wikipedia almost daily in my studies. Thanks for your vote of confidence in the less-vocal among us.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Not sure it would be proper to add to the list that late in the game (so I don't), but RuneScape clans should have made the list as well. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgae_d44b.html" title="User:Algae">Algae</a> 09:49, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
