<li><b>Keep</b> - This page is only going to keep coming back and getting re-created. The content conforms to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> guidelines, by being based upon multiple written external sources. The main 9/11 conspiracy page is now an accepted part of the WIKIPEDIA, and at over 100kb, was FAR TOO LONG. A concensus was arrived at that the main page was too long, and the creation of sub pages is in accordance with the ALREADY ESTABLISHED CONCENSUS ON THIS MATTER. Above comments are clearly in error, and seem to border on the hysterical. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 08:57, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, it's the opposite of an endorsement. Not a single person supported the split in that particular discussion. I'm confused... since nobody supported the split there, and few supported similar splits elsewhere (that I saw, anyway), why is that your justification for a speedy keep?

<li><b>Comment</b> - No, it needs the headings splitting off into sub pages. Thats all this is about. An overly long page, that needs subdivision. 98 kilobytes is an absurd size, and vastly exceeds the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article_size</a> guidelines, which give 20-32 kilobytes as the range to begin to consider subdivision. So logically, following the WIKI rules, AT LEAST 3 sub pages are required, and possibly 5. I don't understand why there has to be so much discussion about something, that is just the application of standing WIKI style guidelines. If this was any other topic than 9/11, it would have been done MONTHS ago. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 10:03, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Much of this material is only supported by citation to primary sources - the conspiracist websites themselves. There is not at this time enough secondary source material to support independent articles. There is barely enough to support one main article; the reason it's so long is every theorist with a website wants his link and a promotional paragraph. There was certainly no consensus on the talk page to do this. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 12:35, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete, PLEASE!</b> What, pray tell, is the purpose of this article? The second paragraph says, "These statements are contradicted by the preponderance of eye-witness testimony at the scene reporting an aircraft fitting the description of American Airlines Flight 77 crashing into the side of the building."

<li><b>Keep</b> This vote isn't whether the 9/11 conspiracy theories page itself should exist; it's not being voted on for an AfD here. The subpages were created as a result of forking a large page into separate subpages when it gets too large; this is a standard Wikipedia practice. Based on that, it's not really a question at significant issue. — <b><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">WCityMike</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> <span style="color:black; background-color:#FFFF99;">&#160;<b><small>⇓ plz reply <u>HERE</u> &#160;(<a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html#How_to_keep_a_two-way_conversation_readable" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">why?</a>)&#160;⇓</small></b>&#160;</span> 18:38, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think a good start at problems with article length would be adherence to Wikipedia policies, notably <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. A lot of the articles are regurgitations of self-appointed "researchers'" blogs and other self-published sources. While I appreciate the stupidity displayed in those blog entries to demonstrate the weakness of the conspiracy theorists' arguments the articles are unencyclopedic messes. Splitting them up so we can pile more junk on top of junk isn't helpful. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 18:31, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> These articles have just as much of a right to be here as any. These are not POV, they are debated facts.
