<li><b>Keep</b> - A stub can always be expanded. The information about the board of education is easily verifiable (just check the Cranbury School website), as is the other content of the article.

<dd>A <i>good</i> stub can be expanded. This stub isn't really expandable. There is not really any information beyond the basic statistics, ie, how many students, who are the administrators, on the official website.

<dd>It is possible to expand it - If one finds the history of the school (when it was established, if any major additions or overhauls were made), that would make a good addition.

<dd>But no such history exists and you are being disingenous. You can claim all day that just about any article could be expanded to fill a fifty page article, in theory.

<li>That would have been more feasible if Cranbury School served grades K through 12. But, it's K-8, and restoring the category to the Cranbury page would be misleading - The District Factor Group category applies to school systems, not the actual municipality. The Cranbury School is New Jersey District Factor Group J - Princeton Regional Schools (which serves high school students in Cranbury) is New Jersey District Factor Group I. Therefore two factor group categories apply to Cranbury's student body. As for listing both, the problem is that Cranbury doesn't have its own high school - it sends its kids to someone else's school district, which is listed anyway as Factor Group I. A school district is as much of a local government as a city, borough, etc. itself - Local government articles are notable. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 17:58, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In fact, the trend now is to try to merge into the school district - When <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clear_Creek_High_School_8e19.html" title="Clear Creek High School">Clear Creek High School</a> was up for deletion, at first merging into League City, Texas was considered, but later someone pointed out that it should actually be merged into <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clear_Creek_ISD_e367.html" title="Clear Creek ISD">Clear Creek ISD</a>, since CCISD is the parent school district. CCHS was kept, but I'm showing the idea here. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 18:04, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> in this case because the school has a long history and the page is well-developed.

<dd>Inclusion of information from varied sources, with references, is what Wikipedia is all about.

<dd>The <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranbury_School_7f05.html" title="Cranbury School">Cranbury School</a> article is a carefully researched, thoroughly documented article that provides all sources regarding its backgound and claim to notability. Of the 105,000+ K-12 public and private schools in the U.S. (see the <a href="http://www.asd.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.asd.com/" rel="nofollow">American School Directory</a> for further details), under 3/10 of 1% of schools (based on your unsourced numbers) felt that they were willing to go through the rigorous selection proces to be recognized by the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a>. The article on the program describes in depth the rigor of the selection process. You provide no source for your claim (or for your statistics) other than your personal feeling that the award is "rather easy to obtain." Again, the article makes an explicit assertion of notability, contrary to your claim. You need to provide a better justification for deletion, and providing objective criteria that the article fails to meet would be a start. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My bad for forgetting to quote the source, it was from <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2005/2005-statistics.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2005/2005-statistics.pdf" rel="nofollow">this pdf</a> from ed.gov and the figure is for the award in 2005 only (the program has been running for 24 years by now?). Also, if most schools feel this is a rigid process (and unwilling to apply/nominate) then it means that the award is not even recognized from within the education sector? Btw, my feelings that it is "rather easy to obtain" is from the high number of successful selected schools (82%) of whose schools who are willing to go through this "rigid process". --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinhunter_d2c4.html" title="User:Winhunter">WinHunter</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWinhunter_2903.html" title="User talk:Winhunter">talk</a>)</sup> 18:14, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Also, if most schools feel this is a rigid process (and unwilling to apply/nominate) then it means that the award is not even recognized from within the education sector?" - Not necessairly - Not all students in school choose to take <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_5c2b.html" title="Advanced Placement">Advanced Placement</a> tests, but AP tests are recognized by universities. Is this a good analogy? <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 18:31, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>. I am no longer so certain this article should be deleted. I don't know if it's possible for me to change my vote seeing as I originally nominated the article for deletion, but if it is, I am voting keep and hope it is kept. WhisperToMe and Alansohn have more than addressed any concerns about verifiability and turned the article into something which could really grow. I feel guilt and regret for having nominated this page for deletion-- partly out of genuine belief that the school was not notable enough for a Wikipedia article (a concern that I don't feel is totally addressed still)-- but mostly for petty and unwholesome reasons. I may disagree with WhisperToMe on other unrelated issues but his model behaviour on this article-- not just sitting around arguing, but actually showing not telling by improving the article-- has shamed and inspired me. I'm sorry I nominated this article for deletion. Congratulations on bringing it up to shape. <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> <a href="../../../d/g/_/User_talk%7EDG_200a.html" title="User talk:DG">G.</a> 19:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. The nominator has withdrawn and the school was established in the 1850s, later added as a <b>New Jersey State Historic Site</b>.
