<p>The subject of this list is unworkable, simply because it's too vast and is going to get bigger and bigger, but unfortunately with less and less notable artists and more and more contemporary ones, swamping the significant figures that one would wish to stand out. Smaller lists would work much better, i.e. List of 18th century American Artists, etc, List of American Artists born 1900-1950, then List of American Artists born 1950-75 and then 1976-. At least all the contemporary ones and the self-noms would be in one place to see easily if they merited a place. This would also create a historical context for the artists. There are also other artists lists that will need assessing, but let's take one at a time.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep, but reorganize</b> Can't you just divide it by periods instead of alphabetically, put a notice on saying redlinks (and external spam links) will be deleted, &amp; maybe have a "major contemporary artists" section that is policed, and then another "other contemporary artists" one at the end that you accept will have to be a bit rag tag &amp; bobtail? You also have architects &amp; doubtless other types in there; the criteria for inclusion need to be defined. Obviously the concept of the list is fine; its just the practicality. Having separate lists by century is not attractive; there are all sorts of overlap problems. It's not in that bad a state. I have problems like this at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printmaking.html" title="Printmaking">Printmaking</a> &amp; its daughter articles; better a messy list than no list.

<li>I'm up for any meaningful and usable organisation, but this is no good to anyone, apart from unknown artists sneaking their name in. I've suggested retaining smaller lists. Using dates at least gives a rigid definition so that everyone knows where they are. Dates will also do a rough and ready job of sorting out major from ragtag contemporary artists, as major <i>tend</i> to be older. Good red links provide a valuable function to show articles that need to be written, so this purpose is also defeated by the present arrangement (though the new blue links are a good way of tracking down non notable contemporary artists..&#160;;) <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you have lists (or categories) by century, you have to put loads of people in two of them.

<li>Do you mean a central list from which the specialised ones could be accessed? That would work. The real problem here is the amount of contemporary artists who swamp the rest. At the very least there should be a list of historic (i.e. dead) and contemporary (i.e. living) artists. The latter would be even better subdivided. If there was a list of people born after, say 1975, it would catch a lot of the not-terribly-notables (but just notable enough to survive an AfD) and make the other lists far easier to read. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As it stands, this list is of very little use. It is just a list of (potentially many thousands of) names, providing no context for each name—which is precisely what a category is. To be useful, the names in such a list would need to be categorized by genre of art. Moreover, the definition of <i>artist</i> is so broad that the number of people who could be listed is vast—too vast for one page. This list should be a category, and not surprisingly there already is such a category: <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_artists_c75d.html" title="Category:American artists">Category:American artists</a>. ●<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 02:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep using criterion</b>. I raised this issue on the article's talk page. Specifically: "What's the criteria for listing here? Should the artist have been born in this country? Is reputation a factor? Are we wasting our time on a list that cannot be complete?" I might suggest the following. Allow this list by do not allow names for which there is no biographical information. In this way, the user can read a bio to determine information about the artist which, hopefully, puts him/her in context. This also prevents a random list of names with no context whatsoever. For example, I added the name George McConnell, but did not add a biography. This would force me to create his bio first, and then add his name to the list. Let me also point out that there are many references to biographies of American artists that are alphabetical with no further categorization. For example, the three volume reference Who Was Who in American Art (Falk, ed.).<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnJHenderson_96ee.html" title="User:JohnJHenderson">JJ</a> 14:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>It seems to me that this page is based upon a false history which exists no where else that I've encountered. Asao Yoshida is one of the names which Choi Yong Sul's senior students say that he went by while living in Japan. Even Choi's connection to Daito-ryu is contested (To make Asao into another person who studied under Choi is a new one on me.) The name of the art seems quite unlikely for a legitimate Japanese tradition. It may be that the author is innocently conveying information which has been supplied to him through no fault of his own but I see little reason to give it further distance to run unless some sort of verification of its legitimacy miraculously appears.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMateo2006_896c.html" title="User:Mateo2006">Mateo2006</a> 02:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for a number of reasons. First and foremost, this isn't a "conflict of interest" case (the term only refers to what happens when an editor writes an entry on themselves or the small company they've just founded - so unless the article was created by one of the combatants in the war, it doesn't qualify). Secondly, I'd want proof that there hasn't been such a war. There's a reference - albeit a very scanty one - provided. Additionally, Paul Dresch's "History of Modern Yemen" refers to the war as the cause of the Yemeni Army being strengthened with the <i>jaysh difa'i</i> militia (p 46) and also mentions some of the fighting in this conflict (pp 34-35). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 03:15, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> regarding naming: it is <i>frequently</i> the case that wars are known by different names to the respective combatants. <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">Article naming</a> is supposed to favor the <i>most common name <b>in English</b></i>, and conventionally if there are alternate names we note that in the introduction to the article. I have not found one overwhelming name that this is known by, but <i>Saudi-Yemeni War</i> has the apparent plurality. <i>War between Saudi and Yemen</i> and <i>Saudi-Yemen War</i> are the only alternate ones that have any currency. Some histories seem to downplay the fact that there was a war at all, concentrating on the Taif Treaty that resolved it. But most that mention the war seem to agree that there was a significant invasion by Saudi Arabia including occupation of Hodeida. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:10, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note on renaming <small>or: <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Strangelove_67b2.html" title="Dr. Strangelove">why the article shouldn't be renamed</a></small></b> - The correct name of Yemen during the 1934 war was "The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen". However, until 1967, there was no other independent political entity known as Yemen (<a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Yemen_9863.html" title="South Yemen">South Yemen</a> was occupied by the British). Although technically, the article could be renamed to "Saudi-Mutawakkilite war", I think this would only create confusion. In addition, as <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> notes above, articles should be named to reflect their most common name in English. The only English-language designation for the war I have encountered is Saudi-Yemeni war. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:26, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Reason:This article was created "in order to provide a place for shape references to redirect to, as <a href="../../../v/-/s/V-shaped.html" title="V-shaped">V-shaped</a>, which used to redirect to <a href="../../../v/-/s/V-shaped_valley.html" title="V-shaped valley">V-shaped valley</a>." It's been copied to Wiktionary, where (as a set of dicdefs) it belongs. Why do we need this? Let <a href="../../../v/-/s/V-shaped.html" title="V-shaped">V-shaped</a> redirect to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 02:55, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b>. First, you cannot "redirect to wiktionary". Second, there is more than that explained in <a href="../../../g/l/o/Talk%7EGlossary_of_shapes_with_metaphorical_names_15b3.html" title="Talk:Glossary of shapes with metaphorical names">talk:Glossary of shapes with metaphorical names</a>: "to collect definitions of various shapes, which would otherwise have got small articles." People continue to confuse the difference between "dictionary definition of a word" and "description of a thing, notion, or a concept". The size of the description of <i>an object</i> does not matter and it belongs to encyclopedia. The description of a <i>word</i> belongs to a dictionary. Some of these <i>descriptions</i> are minor, yet improtant. E.g. "<a href="../../../i/_/s/I_shaped.html" title="I shaped">I shaped</a>" is not what you would think while looking at this word printed in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sans-serif.html" title="Sans-serif">sans-serif</a>. If you have nothing better to do, why don't you try and delete the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Steamer_8c05.html" title="Cleveland Steamer">Cleveland Steamer</a> for an exercise? `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 03:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_steamer.html" title="Cleveland steamer">Cleveland steamer</a> is a thing, not a word. Whether it is notable or real enough to have an article is another question, on which consensus has not been reached. (If there is consensus to keep this article, fine by me; but I think it should be discussed.) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 03:11, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because it borders on incoherence. If something is shaped like a U, it is shaped like a U. There is no metaphor. If something is "triangle-shaped" does that mean it's a metaphor? The entire premise of the article is untenable, and its poorly written and confusing to boot. I am not swayed by the above comment that retires to the old "why not delete all these other stupid articles first" argument.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 06:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shape.html" title="Shape">Shape</a>. For such a well used term the shape article is very brief. Shape itself is a tricky term to deal with especially in a mathematical way, and comparision with other objects is one of the major ways in which the shape of something can be described. On <a href="../../../s/h/a/Talk%7EShape_96bd.html" title="Talk:Shape">Talk:Shape</a> I've briefly outlined an expansion of the article which incorperates some of the ideas from this glossary. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 08:28, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep, rename</b> into Glossary of shapes of List of shapes. With some exceptions (most of which are in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_geometric_shapes.html" title="List of geometric shapes">List of geometric shapes</a>) <b>all</b> names of shapes are comparisons with typical "real" objects. By the way this situation is called <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/Simile.html" title="Simile">simile</a></b>, not <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a>, i.e., the article title is wrong anyway. But the content is useful and informative, in many instances goes beyond simple dictionary definition, i.e., encyclopedic. By the way, I noticed that an overview article Names of shapes or shape naming may be handy as well: a quick google search reveals that this issue is widely discussed, at least in the context of children learning. For example, there is a very interesting article "<a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa030601a.htm" class="external text" title="http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa030601a.htm" rel="nofollow">Etymology of Geometry Terms</a>" (which may suggest a wikipedia title, Etymology of shape names, in our context). <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 16:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> I keep reading this article and talk page thinking I will finally figure out what this is doing. I keep failing. It says the name is somehow metaphorical, but I cannot find it. Even if I assume "metaphorical" is misused and it's actually an example of simile or symbolism or whatever, I am at a loss. "V-shape" - I suppose that's an explicit comparison to the shape of a V, but what else would V-shape mean? Same with heart-shaped and the likes. One argument seems to be that the terms specify exactly what the shape these adjectives denote is, but if this is the intention, it is not the result. If one did not know what something pear-shaped was, for example, I do not think s/he will be helped by being told it is a comparison to the shape of a pear. Possibly housing this in some context in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shape.html" title="Shape">shape</a> or something similar would work, but I must admit this entire article continues to perplex me.

<li><b>Question</b> Where is the "admitted" aspect of this being a personal essay? Nothing on the page's discussion and the only comment on the creators talk page is that the text is his (which is simply a statement that he wrote the article, something we already know). I completely agree this reads like an essay (heck, the guy uses "I feel that politics are involved here" in para. 1), just wondering where the evidence is before I vote. The <i>topic</i> is certainly encyclopedic, even if this current article is in horribly poor form. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 15:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, and commend the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franks.html" title="Franks">Franks</a> article to User:Michael042. Might suggest that the closing admin may also want to move this text to a subpage off the author's user page. The topic is certainly worthy, and this is certainly a worthy effort towards a valuable contribution, but more information ought to be added to the article in chief before splitting off the origin as a separate article. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Has several products, and this page could be a single place to discuss them all: Super Worms, Charlie the Duck, Charlie II. OTOH, these games don't seem notable (all are AfD at this time), and "a collection of non-notable things" is not necessarily "a notable container article". So need at least <i>something</i> of notability of the company or at least one of the games before I'd say "keep". <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 06:11, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Looking through the google hits for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;q=%22Wiering+Software%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;q=%22Wiering+Software%22" rel="nofollow">"Wiering Software"</a>, all I see is the company site and a ton of freeware/shareware download sites. What I couldn't find was any newspaper articles, etc. about either Mike Wiering or Wiering Software. wieringsoftware.nl gets an Alexa rank of 473,445 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=wieringsoftware.nl" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=wieringsoftware.nl" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. A quick look at the sites linking in shows a bunch of download sites, but no magazines or newspapers. So as far as I can tell, this is just someone who's written a few shareware games, probably makes a little money selling them from his website, but none of the published works listed in WP:SOFTWARE seem to have anything to say about him or his company. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave6_6c0a.html" title="User:Dave6">Dave6</a> 07:34, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> there's a Game Tunnel review from the site's creator Russell Carroll <a href="http://www.gametunnel.com/gamespace.php?id=56&amp;tab=3" class="external text" title="http://www.gametunnel.com/gamespace.php?id=56&amp;tab=3" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I personally count Game Tunnel as a reliable source, but that's only one. There's another review <a href="http://www.retro247.co.uk/reviewcharlieii.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.retro247.co.uk/reviewcharlieii.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> from 24/7 games, with a named reviewer and a score - not the strongest source but a damn sight better than the usual blog mentions and guff from download sites. Other google results are less than promising, but with sifting could yield some more info in the future. I believe there's a nice little neutral and cited article screaming to get out of this somewhat promotional stub. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 04:29, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Also, could the original Charlie the Duck not also be merged in? They're virtually the same game by the look of things, just that the sequel has a new set of levels. An article called "Charlie the Duck" featuring both games makes more sense than an article called "Charlie II" and no mention of the first game. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 08:37, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Small company only existed ~1 year before merging into another and no notable results after that are asserted. The one product with asserted notability (UpdateWasher) has a single ref, and that is to an article that neither comments extensively on the item nor gives it especially high ratings. It's a product-roundup article whose inclusion criteria are broad: "When I first started looking at the various tweaking utilities, I downloaded each one that I found" and the item is not listed in the "recommended" category. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 06:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> (by article creator) I don't understand the viewpoints stated here. The company has existed in various forms for decades, and is well-known and respected within the American business community, dealing with some of the nation's largest corporate entities. Emmanuel Garcia is featureds because he is the driving force behind this company. Tags were added to the article pointing out areas which needed improvement. I did some work to implement them and removed the tags. If you have other observations on how the article should be changed, or how it is composed in a distasteful manner, I am happy to conduct further edits. I am writing in the style that comes naturally to me. User: Emellis (<a href="../../../e/m/e/User_talk%7EEmellis_76fc.html" title="User talk:Emellis">talk</a>) 09:42, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If this is your first go-round at the process, I can understand why it would be confusing. Nobody is saying your work was not good. The article seems to be fairly well-written. However, it seems to fail to meet the criterion on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> and is lacking <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">sources</a>. As it stands right now, this article is not something that should be on Wikipedia. Perhaps you can look for some verifiable sources and find a way to write an article that could be included here. Or, maybe you can try to get your feet wet in other articles and see what is normally included here. As it stands now, I also have to vote <b>Delete</b> on this one.

<li>Please note that accomplishment is not the same thing as notability. The criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia are not "existed ... for decades", "respected within the business community", or "dealing with major corporate entites". They are being <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable third party sources</a>. If we cannot find such coverage, it is very rare that we will find consensus on keeping an article. Writing style plays a relatively small role in this process. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:18, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Weak delete</b>. Article mentions several points of notability (oldest of its kind, notable in its geo/genre, etc). But the only references listed are the mag's own websites. It's hard to google this kind of thing, since the title is a common English expression...probably need someone who knows something about the industry or the mag to find any shred of third-party information.

<li><b>Delete</b>. In its current state, this is a clear delete. Spurious claims to notability backed up by exactly zero references.

<dd>Surely you jest. Have you actually looked at those links that you pulled out? Even if those weren't just obscure fan sites and commercial sites, your reasoning is flawed. Remember that the criterion for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notability</a> states: <i>a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works</i>. "Good Times Magazine" is <u>not</u> the subject of any of the links you pulled out. An encyclopedia is a tertiary source, and It is not incumbent upon me, the AfD voter, to do extensive research to save a dubious article; I've got my own research to do. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Train_c9b0.html" title="User:A Train">A Train</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/_/t/User_talk%7EA_Train_dd5d.html" title="User talk:A Train"><font color="DarkBlue">take the</font></a></small></sup> 16:25, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable game. The article reads like a first-person account of someone who played the game, not a third-person account of someone describing the game. I found less than 1,000 ghits, which is below the threshold of notability for a video game. Note also the well-placed cleanup tags. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I wasn't so sure of this, since the organization asserts national scope in Israel, but the parent organizations (see last paragraph) have not yet entered Wikipedia themselves.

<dd>I'm sorry if it came off as wanting to delete the batch based on who they created them. I find that none of the articles meet BIO, that is why I submited them.

<p><b>Notice</b> Per <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball">User:Bsnowball</a>'s advice, I'm abandonining the AfD. I will propose a merge for one of the articles and reconsider each of the articles individually. I asked how to do this at the Help Desk and it was suggested that I could do this myself - making a note of it on this page and reverting the templates on the article pages. If this is the wrong way to do this, please leave a note here letting me know the correct procedure. I'm also adding strikethrough to the above proposal to indicate that I am retracting the AfD. <a href="../../../n/p/o/User%7ENposs_32e4.html" title="User:Nposs">Nposs</a> 02:15, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Is Evan Siegel an Azeri? If not then I don’t see why you added Azeri tag to his biography! Siegel is one of the prominent experts on the middle east affairs and has many books and publications on the subject and well respected in the field!

It is also speculated that he is Joey Oglesby of the Chicken &amp; Pickle Guys by Dan Savage in his blog with the Stranger, Slog<a href="http://www.thestranger.com/blog/2007/01/donnie_davies_third_times_the_charm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thestranger.com/blog/2007/01/donnie_davies_third_times_the_charm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. The political content of this controversy has also attracted the attention of activists such as Heartstrong<a href="http://www.heartstrong.org/HeartStrong/DonnieDaviesHates.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heartstrong.org/HeartStrong/DonnieDaviesHates.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> and a petition has been started online for content removal from free sites<a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/pastor/petition.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.petitiononline.com/pastor/petition.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the topic’s existence as an internet spoof, with evidence of becoming widely known, it exemplifies <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viral_marketing.html" title="Viral marketing">viral marketing</a> but does not constitute spam per <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESpam_8b43.html" title="WP:Spam">WP:Spam</a> as the article itself is not an advertisement. The persona's notability is spread through the use of inflammatory content. The vast majority of the results of a Google search are blogs or forum chats. While they are not reliable sources, they are focal points of web-based interaction, and so a method of guerrilla marketing. As a viral marketing campaign, it is unique because its core communication is reliant on a pivotal point of a religious and political controversy; that is the religious contention that homosexuality is wrong. This is the root of its spread through the blogosphere as well as why the controversy over his actuality is so popular and its gain of cultural so important—particularly for people identifying with a sexually different culture. It is also why it is so culturally significant in its affect.</p>
<p>Advertising campaigns such as <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_a_Mac_3a47.html" title="Get a Mac">Get a Mac</a> have their own articles regardless of the content being true or false. Guerrilla campaigns such as the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Boston_Mooninite_Scare_d371.html" title="2007 Boston Mooninite Scare">2007 Boston Mooninite Scare</a> has been covered by Wikipedia and journalists even though coverage acts as more publicity. Personal campaigns popularized by web dissemination are also Wiki articles such as <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonelygirl15.html" title="Lonelygirl15">Lonelygirl15</a>. Wikipedia covers the mentioned topics because of their cultural significance through our measure of notability that is dependent on verification. The notability of Donnie Davies is verified through multiple sources. Those named articles about advertisement pieces do not constitute spam as they are not advertisements, but explanations.</p>
<p>If the article were to follow the guidelines as stipulated by the <a href="../../../a/t/_/WP%7EAT_9deb.html" title="WP:AT">Wiki Amnesia Test</a>, would be about this topic as a controversy and the effect of it as a controversy. Understandably it does not meet the guidelines of a wiki biography, but since that isn't the intention then the point is moot. No different from articles like <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">bigfoot</a> or <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFOs_19a3.html" title="UFOs">UFOs</a>, it does not seek to establish the existence, but explain the growing topic. The only difference is its youth. Yes, the topics of bigfoot and UFOs are well-established and certainly have countless sources that address their cultural significance, but at the speed of which Donnie Davies as a topic is growing, it seems arbitrary to use its short-life as an argument against it.</p>
<p><b>To summarize</b>: the article deserves a place because it has accumulated controversy over a heatedly debated religious and political conflict and utilizes it as an advertising campaign. It is not a biographical article, but an account of a campaign that is garnering cultural significance because it borrows from such a heated topic. It is not spam because the article addresses a variety of issues and does not seek to solely promote the persona. There are also multiple reputable sources that address the above reasons. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquatGoblin_2dbd.html" title="User:SquatGoblin">SquatGoblin</a></p>

<dd>While it may be a hoax or simply a viral marketing campaign is part of a larger picture. The article isn't simply spreading the campaign or hoax but plays a part in assembling what composes it. There are many articles on Wikipedia that cover influential advertising campaigns. This one in particular is poignant because its core vessel for communication is dependent on a controversial religious and political issues (as self-evident by the song title "God Hates Fags"). I'm not sure I understand your difference of opinion. There are reliable sources (sources that have their own Wiki articles as journalists) that address this as a controversy.

<dd>It's almost certainly a hoax, even if that can't be verified. But if it's a notable and verifiable phenomenon (regardless of whether claims of his identity are verifiable), how does this satisfy deletion criteria? Perhaps this is belaboring a point already mentioned, but wikipedia has plenty of articles where the "truth" cannot be determined and which few would suggest deleting (e.g. paranormal phenomena).

But <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> does mention "public relations pieces designed to promote a company or individual," and this could fit the bill.

<li><b>Delete</b> Beware the tendency to want to spew articles all over Wikipedia to show how much one likes something. A fictional work does not need to have every bit of its content placed on Wikipedia. The editors did a nice job of creating detailed articles about something which they like, but there are no sources independent of their original research to verify the information, and no independent sources to show the subjects of the numerous individual articles are notable to any but the diehard fans, so these articles fail <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

<dd>I suggest you view the criteria for "asserting real-world notability" in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Gundam_cc10.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gundam">WP: Gundam</a>, namely the section detailing "notability" as including having merchandise of the item in question manufactured. As far as your criticism of the article's content itself, you have valid points, but in any other situation this article would be tagged with a "needs sourcing" or "needs cleanup" tag, as opposed to an AfD which seems to be the norm when dealing with Gundam-related articles. <b>That</b> is the heavy-handedness I speak of. When a Gundam article needs cleanup, or possibly a rewrite, it gets an AfD.

<dd>(grimly) Indeed <b>almost none</b> of them belong... and will be dealt with. I plan to see if there are any available sources for any of them, then CSD most of them, because they are not sourced or verifiable. And I agree: when things aren't sourced and they can easily be sourced then the answer isn't deletion. But when you have an article full of statements, none of which can be backed up, and then someone throws a bunch of almost identical links up that neither a) back up any of these ascertations made in the article or b) prove it's notability then no, they aren't valid. To answer your point about notability, WP:FICT is pretty firm that minor characters should be merged into main articles. You should know what sourcing is. <a href="../../../m/s/z/MSZ-006_Zeta_Gundam_b523.html" title="MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam">MSZ-006_Zeta_Gundam</a> is sourced. The links added to the articles in this AFD are not.

<dd>If it's content in the article that's irritating the voters here, I would happily reword it to a more factual stance. I was operating under the impression that we are experiencing a purge of Gundam-related articles, starting with the mobile weapons themselves, for as of yet undisclosed reasons, and that no amount of cleaning up relevant articles would amount to anything. At any rate, I've provided an additional (non-Amazon.com) link with further evidence of real-world existence. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 10:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would seem to me that the article is astonishingly light on the real world notability you claim for it. The reason that you claim to see a run on Gundam articles is that , like your own notability guideline says , there are a LOT of them fail to have "any real world significant other than being one of the items in the series" , in which case "the real world impact is by the series itself instead of the mecha." An article on the various Karaba gundams would be fine, but the reason so many Gundam articles have been deleted -- in my opinion, since I only took part in a handful of the debates -- is that most of them simply don't have enough material to stand on their own. That's something <a href="../../../g/u/n/WP%7EGUNDAM_7b11.html" title="WP:GUNDAM">WP:GUNDAM</a> or even Wikia Gundam will have to consider. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 10:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, this is by no means a good article, or even a fair article. What baffles me is that, rather than attempt to improve it, the status quo here is to delete it. Presently, I am drafting a quick rewrite that will detail some of my above points (e.g. has two Bandai model kits in its likeness, appeared in the most-definately-notable <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Robot_Wars_af61.html" title="Super Robot Wars">Super Robot Wars</a> series on numerous occassions, was piloted by Gundam franchise protagonist <a href="../../../a/m/u/Amuro_Ray_e69f.html" title="Amuro Ray">Amuro Ray</a>, etc etc). I'd also like to clean up the language of the article as well, since the sentences don't flow well and are kinda jumbled in some areas. However, I really don't see much of a point in this endeavour, since far better articles have already been deleted because they do not meet Wikipedia's standards of notability, according to a select few Wikipedians with a battery of people who will support their AfDs. I desperately try to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> in these situations, but the heavyhandedness of these AfDs is really getting to me. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 10:47, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it would seem Bandai has done me the favor anyway. I forgot they had a North American English-language Gundam website up. How silly of me. The <a href="http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/uc/zeta/mechanics/ms_dijeh.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/uc/zeta/mechanics/ms_dijeh.html" rel="nofollow">relevant page</a> contains many of the contested points above. Is *this* enough of a reliable source? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 11:00, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've also gone ahead and added the relevant references, "non-reference" Amazon.com links as well as the Gundam Official page and what have you to the Hi-Zack article too. Just so we're clear on things, I believe the criteria erroneously suggested to delete these article(s) does hold true for some of the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam_X_6192.html" title="Gundam X">Gundam X</a> mobile weapons that have been AfD's above. <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam_X_6192.html" title="Gundam X">Gundam X</a> hasn't seen much exposure outside Japan, and what's more, only its title mobile weapons have had merchandise made of them by Bandai, which, as far as I'm concerned, ought to be a good criteria for notability. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 11:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Are you not even going to debate my completely valid points anymore? Outstanding. Oh well, seems this article is going the way of the <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodo.html" title="Dodo">Dodo</a> as well, seeing as the head count- I mean, "concensus" is coming up soon. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 21:04, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was busy off-wiki. I would appreciate debating the larger issues of notability, reliable sources, etc somewhere else than here, preferably where a concensus can be worked out and something positive and good for the encyclopedia can be proposed.

<li><b>Keep</b> most of the words and phrases. The ones that do not have notable history or use should be taken out, but for the most part I expect an encyclopedia to list major Latin phrases, with explanations about their past and present usage. Phrases that should absolutely be kept would be ones that now have common use; <a href="../../../e/2E/g/E.g..html" title="E.g.">e.g.</a> "quidquid latine dictum sit, altum viditur," "ad hitlerum," "fiat lux," "requescat in pace," <a href="../../../e/t/c/Etc..html" title="Etc.">etc.</a> In a point of semantics, I understand why it can be tiring to hear "it is useful" repeated <i>ad nauseum</i>. I think the <b>reason</b> an article is useful should be noted; while indeed this may be useful as a dictionary (and this earning it a place in Wiktionary), it <i>is</i> also extremely useful in helping people to understand the sociality of such phrases, how the meanings have evolved, where it would and would not be appropriate to use them, <a href="../../../e/t/_/Et_al..html" title="Et al.">et al.</a> As for "I like it," well, we all like the same thing: Wikipedia and its governing principles as an <i>encyclopedia</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - useful list, and beyond dic. def. quality, as the phrases become linked to articles that themselves are way beyond dic. def. See the recent stub I created for <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carthago_delenda_est.html" title="Carthago delenda est">Carthago delenda est</a>.

<dd>How is this <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#Purpose_of_lists" title="WP:LIST">list</a> "clearly not an encyclopedic article?" By the criteria on that guideline, it meets the three different purposes that lists (not necessarily <i>articles</i>, as it seems you have applied the criteria to) are to serve. It fulfills <b>Information</b> by providing concise history and usage of each term. It fulfills <b>Navigation</b> by providing links to the articles that have been sufficiently developed. It meets <b>Development</b> as it shows which of those articles are present, which have been considered, and which have not yet been considered. Take, for example, "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_%28F%E2%80%93O%29_b692.html#N" title="List of Latin phrases (F–O)">Non silba, sed anthar; Deo vindice</a>" ("Not for self, but for others; God will vindicate"), the slogan used by the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. Wow! They have their own slogan? And it's in Latin? That is very encyclopedic. Chock-full of history and culture, I'd bet. Eventually the phrase will gather enough information to get its own article, and the list will then be able to link to it and one will be able to read all about how the phrase came into use and what its cultural impact has been. No dictionary claims the capacity to do that; only Wikipedia can. <a href="../../../v/-/m/User%7EV-Man737_9c52.html" title="User:V-Man737">V-Man737</a> 11:18, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There is much more to these phrases than a simple literal translation that can be afforded through a dictionary. The common use as well as historical significance ensures them a spot in an encyclopedia rather than a dictionary. We must understand that some of the important dimensions of these sayings would be ignored by a simple dictionary article. The current encyclopedia article should remain as a much more in depth source aiding in the understanding of all dimensions of these phrases.Ringleader1489 02:48, 6 Feb 2007 (UTC)</li>

The fact that when this page came up for deletion it before it got squashed flat begs the question why is it up again. Its an important resource and deserves its place on wikipedia as much as it does on wiktionary. I can see this page being very useful for a great many users searching the encyclopedia.

Also I don't think that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DICT</a> argument holds much weight in this case.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The list contains historical context, and serves as a navigation aid to other articles. Reducing to a category would lose information. Latin phrases are highly notable as a class, distinct from the notability of individual phrases. The list permits browsing and comparison in a way that separate artices would not.

<dd>Without sources, it could potentially be (as Postdlf says) "the assessment of some armchair music critics".

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm not sure to what standard "Non-notable sub-genre" is being applied, but a quick look at American music includes many obscure and niche sub-genres. That said, someone knowledgeable about the genre adding sources would be a great help. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColage_c8e0.html" title="User:Colage">Colage</a> 22:54, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I understand the concerns because the article is pretty awful and is not really about hip hop musicians from India. However, the fact is that these artists <i>do</i> exist, even if there number and popularity is limited (not that I have been convinced that this is indeed the case). Perhaps the article should be stubified so that it's made clearer that the article should be about hip hop music in India. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 01:37, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article could definitely do with citations and clean-up, but topically it deserves to be on Wikipedia. It is a very large and growing genre in the Asian subcontinent and I would assign it more to the region as a whole because stylistically it incorporates traditional music from that are and not simply Indian music while maintaining a common bond. There is much to be said about describing it as <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desi.html" title="Desi">Desi</a> hip-hip. Perhaps noting artists that have a good amount of wiki coverage already like, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panjabi_MC_b569.html" title="Panjabi MC">Panjabi MC</a>? --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquatGoblin_2dbd.html" title="User:SquatGoblin">SquatGoblin</a> 17:13, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Inappropriate page. Unsourced, possible copyright violations, and it is an article for a single season of a non-notable television series. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 11:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related pages because as with the first article, they are all articles for each "season" of a television program shown in the Philippines. <b>Note</b>, in the Philippines, a "season" of a television series does not correspond to 1-per-year as it is in other countries. As seen in the parent article, <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_to_Love_%28TV_show%29_8e9c.html" title="Love to Love (TV show)">Love to Love (TV show)</a>, the show was only shown for 4 years and is not even that notable.</p>

<p>Contested prod. No assertion of notability for this song, despite one being requested from the page author. Football chants for a specific team are generally not notable, unlike well known songs/chants like <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Ate_All_the_Pies__79a5.html" title="Who Ate All the Pies?">Who Ate All the Pies?</a> <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 12:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related page for similar reasons. This one is actually a well known chant but isn't team specific, so while it may be worth mentioning in a different article there is no need for a team specific article.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'd be surprised if any proof could be found for this song originating with Arsenal fans, and even considering it from the point of view of a song sung at many grounds it simply isn't well known/notable.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - Liverpool fans sing this as well from what I recall.

<li>I've also heard it sung at Gillingham and Aston Villa....basically every team whose name can be squashed, however unconvincingly, into the appropriate portion of the first line sings it.

<li><b>Delete</b> So many clubs use this, its impossible to tell where it originated. However, if proof could be found for Arsenal starting it, then it would be a valid article.

<li>Bad idea. You should have made it a separate AfD - it is never good idea to alter the terms of reference of an AfD after a significant number of comments have been added (especially as over 48 hours have elapsed between the original nomination and the addition); despite the similarity of topics all of the comments before the addition still only apply to only the original article. All articles nominated for AfD should be given due process, and not just tacked onto the end of other AfDs. Advice to closing admin - any binding decision should be made with respect to the original article nominated and the second article should be given a separate, new AfD. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 00:06, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If it counts for anything I'd also&#160;!vote to <b>delete</b> the second article. Again there's no proof that Arsenal started that chant, it's used by many many clubs, and there isn't really anything much ti say about it anyway.. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 07:56, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm well aware all comments before the addition only apply to the original article, which is why I specificallly messaged all users involved to date as stated above. I would suggest the closing admin weighs up all subsequent&#160;!votes and decides whether a new Afd would produce a different result. There is ample precedent for Afds being closed early per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>, and in my opinion the second article has no chance of surviving Afd, whether it be one lasting for three days, five days or ten days. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 15:53, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Also it's not really sufficiently notable to warrant an article - it might deserve one line in a list of chants article. Otherwise where do you stop, do you have articles for "the referee's a wanker" or "Stand up if you hate (insert hated team name here)"? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 10:34, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Pardon me for not knowing how to comment properly on these articles. However, I'm not sure how this item merits deletion. Simply because it was not visited in the LotR in no way makes it less of an item in the Middle-Earth canon. Also, whatever 'fancrufty conjecture' is, it doesn't appear to be that. It appears to reference Tolkien's few writings on the subject. Further, I don't see how one person can say it's a plot summary and the next says that it was never visited in LotR... Which is it? How can you summarize what was never visited? Lastly, as for real world significance, this is an article about a fictional location in Tolkien's Middle-Earth legendarium.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> I find it humorous that the disambiguation page for "get down" lists several songs, many of which are excrutiatingly non notable. Yet, the article (as yet a mere stub) treating the phenomenon which is the <i>source</i> of the phrase in these songs (as well as the noun and verb in AAVE) is a candidate for deletion. Did it ever occur to anyone that people might wonder about the <i>origin and meaning</i> of that phrase -- "get down" -- which is the title of all those songs? Or, the origin of the phrase in AAVE slang? I saw the need to begin an article that would explain the cultural phenomenon, how it has survived in the African diaspora, how it has transformed Western/modern dance movement -- particularly in the U.S. -- and its related meanings in AAVE. This move to delete the article is wrong-headed and absurd -- particularly since the article hasn't even been developed yet. Yes, it needs to be expanded, but it's a definite keep. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Question</b>: Why does the dance move always seem to be referenced in double quotes if its an established move?--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 14:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps because, unlike European dance, black dance has only a fairly recent tradition, if at all, of being codified. Furthermore, "get down" is not one, specific move, <i>per se</i>; it's a posture with different variations, given the often improvisational and spontaneous nature of black/African dance. And even though the <i>posture</i> is significant and important; it has meaning, it's not rigid or codified like, say, a <i>pas de deux</i> or <i>plie</i> in ballet. The get-down in a ring shout is different from the git down in breakdancing.[User:Deeceevoice|deeceevoice]] 14:50, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Cakewalk, Black Bottom, Charleston, Lindy Hop, popping, locking, breaking, krumping, Yankadi, Macru, Moribayasa, Agbekor, Agahu, Kpanlogo. It seems like black dance is pretty well codified in both Africa and America.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Affixing titles to dances is a far cry from breaking up a dance up into its constituent parts, prescribing precisely how each movement or pose/posture is to be executed and then naming each one.

</dd>
<dd>That's what I said. And, again, get down is <i>not</i> a singular movement; it is a general posture (which has no prescribed appearance, except that it must be executed with limbs flexed/bent, the waist bent, the torso relatively low to the ground) -- which may be arrived at from/through the execution of a variety of moves. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 15:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Has anyone else noted the <i>complete absence of any discussion of this matter on the article talk page (which remains utterly, completely blank) before this AfD was filed</i>? The person who initiated this action made <i>absolutely no attempt whatsoever</i> to discuss this subject, its true nature or relevance, before taking such a precipitous action. It easily could be interpreted as smacking/<i>stinking</i> of intellectual arrogance ("I'm not aware of this, so it doesn't exist; it's made up!"), and/or bad faith! <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:25, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yale professor and authority on indigenous African cultures Robert Farris Thompson addresses "get down" extensively in his critically acclaimed <i>African Art and Motion</i> and places it within an overall framework of what he calls the "cannons of line form." Thompson addresses get down beyond physical movement and explains how it influences, and is influenced by, the music itself. Thompson states that much of West African music is characterized rhythmically by inclines and declines, both gradual and steep -- crescendos of polyrhythms. (If you've ever heard the drumming of, say, Babatunde Olatunji, then you know what he's referring to.) That's get down.</p>
<p>Thompson also notes the prevalence of the get-down pose/posture in traditional African sculpture, as well -- knees bent, some figures appearing to be squatting. In another venue, Thompson discusses "get down" and <i>capoeira</i> and likens the latter to breakdancing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the warm-up exercises, I noticed nothing special – just jumping jacks and leaps and stretches of the kind you’d see at a New York Giants workout in August. But then, in a classic coach’s voice, Vieira led them into the specialized gymnastics of capoeira, and <i>the movements entered the get-down zone</i>[emphasis added]. They looked as if they were break-dancing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others have noted the phenomenon using other language. From an article on the history of swing dance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lindy Hop, also known as Jitterbug, is the authentic Afro-Euro-American Swing dance. It is an unabashedly joyful dance, with a solid, flowing style that closely reflects its music -- from the late 20's hot Jazz to the early 40's Big Bands. Just as Jazz combines European and African musical origins, Lindy Hop draws on African and European dance traditions. The embracing hold, and the turns from Europe, the breakaway and <i>solid, earthy body posture from Africa</i> [emphasis added].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Gahu dance form referred to in the article user <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> precipitously has nominated for deletion is something called a ring shout -- it's a spiritual, transcendent experience. The ring shout is performed across black Africa and in the African diaspora, including in the American South. It's a get-down -- performed feet shuffling, arms akimbo, knees bent. Author and historian P. Sterling Stuckey, in his, IMO, masterwork <i>Slave Culture: Nationalist Theory and the Foundations of Black America</i>, also described the phenomenon of the ring shout in African-American culture, its African origins and its obvious get-down characteristics. As the shout intensifies, the dancers' movements get stronger, the rhythms beat out by the feet get more percussive, and the dancers' torsos get lower to the ground. And they always move counterclockwise. Like southern black folks in the praisehouses and hush harbors, secreted away from the prying eyes of whites and those who would rebuke or punish them for their "uncivilized" manner of worship. Like <i>African</i>-American jazz legend/genius Thelonius Monk jumping up from his piano in the middle of a song, inspired, eyes closed almost trance-like, shuffling around -- counterclockwise. White folks in the audience were amused, mystified. "What the hell's he doing?"

<li><b>Super strong keep</b> - why do we keep digging up AfDs that have failed until they pass? It's not good enough - there's no more reason why it should be deleted now than it did in the past two nominations - I call on the nominator to explain why this is any different to beforehand. There MUST be a distinction made between the individuals on this page, which are not inherently notable, and the roles that the people have held, which have aided hundreds of thousands of students and have led some notable campaigns for students' and other rights over the past few years - this is a notable organisation and its leaders are notable. Some of these people already have their own article and if history is anything to go by, some of these people will end up in high political and other positions in Australia - while that is not certain, the roles the people play make it notable enough to keep on its own merits; this article only exists because it is a subset of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Union_of_Students_f102.html" title="National Union of Students">National Union of Students</a> page, and would be too big to fit there. Let's stop this nonsense in continually bringing up articles to be deleted simply because someone doesn't like it and didn't like the previous outcome. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 12:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And conversely, the vast number will never be notable. Also the previous AfDs resulted in no consensus. So basically there was no decision made that this article should be kept. The article could be more acceptable from a notability basis if it only covered the national offices, so maybe deleting all of the state sections could help move to a consensus. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 20:27, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm happy to keep if an artist has a viable track record of milieu/shows/reviews/media mentions etc. that indicates they have some niche within the contemporary art world. Everything here indicates the artist currently does not, but is "emerging" at a fairly early stage. Even the article says in the 1990s "did not exhibit widely" and only in 2000 "began exhibiting again", while his statement on absolutearts is, "I am currently seeking quality exhibition opportunities." Sorry, that's not enough. When he gets the exhibition opportunities, then we can keep an article. This is no reflection on his integrity or quality of work <i>per se</i>, merely that we have certain minimum inclusion requirements that must be demonstrated. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 15:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. School districts, like municipalities, should be considered automatically notable as government bodies. Besides, people sometimes argue that an article on an individual school should be merged into the article for the appropriate school district, and if we start deleting school districts, it won't be possible to merge school articles that way. Besides, school districts sometimes take in several different municipalities, so they often can't be merged into the article for a single municipality or county. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 18:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) It looks like nominator's request (Femto) has little to do with the topic of the article. This is quote from the user Femto "I don't doubt that the topic is notable..." posted on December 6, 2006 on the Talk page. Now she/he contradicts herself/himself by calling this topic non notable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) This request for deletion came as a personal retaliation (WP:CIVIL) after my post on the talk page. User Beaker342 did not provide any constructive feedback even though I asked her/him to point out what can be improved or what in particular in the text does not comply. She/He initially came with the idea that this page needs to be deleted, she/he never had any improvement suggestions or intentions to do so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3). User Femto is not acting in the good faith by accusing me of intentional spamming. Here's why:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>a) External link to the inventor's site was placed to distinguish this company from a similar brand that has nothing to do with gym floor covers. Please see for yourself: <a href="http://www.covermaster.net" class="external free" title="http://www.covermaster.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.covermaster.net</a> vs. <a href="http://www.covermasterinc.com" class="external free" title="http://www.covermasterinc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.covermasterinc.com</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>b) Femto is accusing me of not having permission to use images on the site. I have such permission. I would appreciate your advice on how I can make it more prominent, so that I don't have any troubles with copyright licensing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>c) Femto is accusing me of using restrictive license for these images. I would like them to stay copyrighted in such a way that other people can use them if they give a credit to the author. Again, any suggestions on how to improve this licensing business would be welcome.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>d) Femto is accusing me of internal spamming. In fact, a message from Wikipedia bot encouraged me to interconnect my article with related topics. I posted my suggestion where I though they would be relevant. I've never spammed those locations. If editors wanted to remove those links they were free to do so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>e) Femto is accusing me of the following "testing how much promotion is too much promotion". This is definitely not acting in the good faith. This user has no insight in my intentions and should not speculate on this. At some point I've mentioned a brand of the product just to be accurate what's illustrated on the picture. My reasoning was that if you were to compare, for example, two tanks you would mentioned you're comparing T-34 and Ferdinand rather than saying "this is green tank vs. gray tank". Later, I've decided that this might be offensive to some editors and removed the brand name. Now I'm the bad person for removing this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>f) Femto suggests redirecting this article to tarp without realizing that gym floor cover is not a raw material, plastic or tarp. It is a large flat surface product that is produced with unique knife coating process that allows to blend multiple layers with different textures, colors and other technical characteristics. The inventor has patents and pending patents for this manufacturing process. This is environmentally friendly product that saves hardwood floors (read trees) all over in North America.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>g) Beaker342 refers to Lexisnexis. Can please anyone confirm this is an official tool used by Wikipedia? Thanks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With this being said, I would like other editors to read this article over and help me with improvement suggestions. Thank you!<br />

<ul>
<li>1) It is a tongue in cheek reply to your comment that the article was "<i>created to educate people about gym floor covers as a product</i>" (which may be read as "advertising"). Even so, there's a difference between something deserving a mention in an encyclopedia and devoting a whole article to it. Especially when the only major editor of that article is a manufacturer of the product. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 18:39, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>2) No it didn't. I think the article should be deleted, saw that I'm not the only one, and brought it to the appropriate place for discussion.</li>
<li>3b) There is no proper confirmation of permission, without which copyrighted company material cannot be used. I already pointed you to the appropriate guidelines on your talk page. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 18:39, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>What exact wording would be most appropriate?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>3c) This is not an accusation but plain fact. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You restrict the use in such a way that these images can only be used if your comany gets some free promotion. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 18:39, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>When a photographer takes a picture it is fair to expect he would not be happy if someone uses it without a proper credit. If a photographer transfers ownership rights to a company, they would want the same treatment. Now, what type of licensing do you recommend in this case?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not the photographer but your company that must be credited. Such images are simply not appropriate to use in a free encyclopedia, no prettified licensing can change this. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 20:24, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> From the beginning to the end, it could use a rewrite. Not a citation and plenty of subjectivity with a structure that reads like a proposal for a research project. At many points in the article, the author states things like, <i>"I expect that it would be far greater with a more complete list."</i> Statements like that alone are declare the article to be inherently incomplete and biased. It would be much different if this was an article that reviewed the economic value of the U.S. with citations and references rather than speculation. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquatGoblin_2dbd.html" title="User:SquatGoblin">SquatGoblin</a> 17:24, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<p><strike><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not geocities. Article fails to establish notability</strike> <b>Speedy Keep</b>, contributors have made a sufficient claim of notability and found a reputable source Tomstdenis 19:36, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> 4i2i Communications - this article should not be deleted, as it links to various academic resources describing the creation of hardware video codecs. In my opinion this is an invaluable addition (there are not other articles in Wikipedia that I have found thoroughly dealing with the topic) and as such should stay.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a commercial article that links to other wiki pages. Still doesn't answer the challenge of notability. The subject (4i2i) itself must be notable to be included. They're hardly the only video codec vendor or designer in the world (also, don't edit other peoples comments). Tomstdenis 15:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also what links are you talking about? They link to H.264 and HDTV. That's hardly an authorative list of video codec resources. Also, please sign your posts. I noticed that you're posting from BT (British Telecom). You wouldn't happen to be affliated with 4i2i would you? Tomstdenis 15:22, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The company is notable as a provider of <a href="../../../h/2E/2/H.264.html" title="H.264">H.264</a> hardware codecs of which there are few in the world. I agree that there are many video codec vendors, but the total number of <a href="../../../h/2E/2/H.264.html" title="H.264">H.264</a> Hardware <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_codec.html" title="Video codec">video_codec</a> providers worldwide that ship <a href="../../../f/p/g/FPGA_a1b5.html" title="FPGA">FPGA</a> compatible implementations is about two. I was referring to links to Xilinx specific academic papers in the <a href="../../../4/i/2/4i2i_Communications_bde5.html" title="4i2i Communications">4i2i Communications</a> article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.42.190.248_2cfb.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.42.190.248">217.42.190.248</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/7/User_talk%7E217.42.190.248.html" title="User talk:217.42.190.248">talk</a>) 15:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC).</small>
<dl>
<dd>How is that notable? H.264 is a new standard which is why there are few implementations of it. I seriously doubt that they're alone in that respect though. There are many companies which offer unique products, that doesn't make them notable. If you want to argue for notability, start by finding third party unaffliated references that talk about 4i2i's technology or place in society. Just listing products does not notability make. Tomstdenis 15:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Should add <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=H.264+IP+core&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=H.264+IP+core&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> to the discussion. There are <b>MANY</b> H.264 providers it seems. That 4i2i is at the top does not make them notable (for instance, nobody links to their H.264 page). Tomstdenis 15:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That only proves that 4i2i is a company in Scotland. That doesn't prove notability. Anyone with enough money for a business license can form a company. I should add that the linked articles only <b>mention</b> 4i2i, they don't discuss it (e.g. why is it notable?). Tomstdenis 15:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Though there are many <b>SOFTWARE</b> and <b>ASIC</b> implementations of H.264 there are few (only one?) <b>FPGA</b> implementations.
<dl>
<dd>So what? Why is that notable? We often test our hardware in FPGAs as well. We don't consider that a wikipedia worthy notable event. Tomstdenis 15:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reflow... The 4i2i website provides no links [I can find] to papers or open documentation about the FPGA design. It's a commercial website that sells IP. The article itself provides no information about the FPGA design other than it exists. The article either needs an incredible re-write, or it needs to be deleted. Actually look at the damn article, what information can you see from it other than it's a company in Scotland that sells video codec IP. Big deal. Not notable.

<dd>Let's see, a couple press releases and links to <b>OTHER</b> companies who also have H.264 hardware. Big deal. Google for "LibTomCrypt" Not only does it get more hits (about twice as many) but it's <b>equally</b> non-notable. Provide URLs to non-affiliated writeups (beyond a token summarization) and then maybe you'll make your point. At anyrate, you've made your case (thusfar) and I've made mine.

<p><b>Keep</b> - just my 2cents worth... The article describes part of an important new <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_fen.html" title="Silicon fen">economic driver</a> in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. I note the user Tomstdenis has posted a google.ca link, so is likely a <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_america.html" title="North america">North American</a> user - where there are a good number of <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiconductor.html" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_valley.html" title="Silicon valley">companies</a>. In <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Scotland_6397.html" title="Economy of Scotland">Scotland</a> cutting edge companies like <a href="../../../4/i/2/4i2i_Communications_bde5.html" title="4i2i Communications">4i2i Communications</a> are fewer on the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_glen.html" title="Silicon glen">ground</a>, and make a <b>notable</b> difference to the economy here.

I'm slightly biased as I did contribute to the <a href="../../../4/i/2/4i2i_Communications_bde5.html" title="4i2i Communications">4i2i Communications</a> article, but for the reasons listed above, and in this paragraph would definately <b>Keep</b> the <a href="../../../4/i/2/4i2i.html" title="4i2i">4i2i</a> article. <a href="../../../d/f/m/User%7EDfmcp_687f.html" title="User:Dfmcp">dfmcp</a> 17:49, 2 February 2007 (GMT)</p>

<p>Okay, look. The issue here is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. I'm a big animal geek, I appreciate fowl, and I'd really love to know all about the pea-turkey. Can a peafowl hybridize with a turkey? I'd like to learn about it. But I can't find any reference to this anywhere except for the author of the article saying it's verifiable per him/her. I don't doubt his/her word that the animal exists. But until there is a reliable external source verifying the existence of the Elusive Pea-Turkey of Rhode Island, it's simply not suitable for a Wiki article.&#160;:( - <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceCreamAntisocial_4a3d.html" title="User:IceCreamAntisocial">IceCreamAntisocial</a> 14:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. On the one hand it's a public company, but the article does fail to meet notability requirements, and reads like wikispam. In it's current form I recommend deletion, but given that it's a public company maybe a re-write could save the article? Tomstdenis 14:22, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi Tom... Hmm.. Do you <b>really</b> want to delete the Lattice Semi's article? In my mind Lattice are one of only four genuinely successful <a href="../../../f/p/g/FPGA_a1b5.html" title="FPGA">FPGA</a> vendors worldwide (I think the other three on that list should be <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altera.html" title="Altera">Altera</a>, <a href="../../../x/i/l/Xilinx.html" title="Xilinx">Xilinx</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcatel.html" title="Alcatel">Alcatel</a>). Certainly the Lattice article is poorly written at the moment, but deletion is absolutely not the answer. <b>Keep the article</b>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/f/m/User%7EDfmcp_687f.html" title="User:Dfmcp">Dfmcp</a> (<a href="../../../d/f/m/User_talk%7EDfmcp_0e0b.html" title="User talk:Dfmcp">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dfmcp_ab14.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dfmcp">contribs</a>) 2007-02-02 18:35:03 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li>As I said, the article requires revision if it is to be kept. As it stands right now it lacks references to prove notability. The article is also very short on details. Tomstdenis 19:40, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We call articles that are short: <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stubs</a>. The tag for such a stub is {{<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7ECompany-stub_7689.html" title="Template:Company-stub">company-stub</a>}}. The tag for an article that lacks references is {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}. The tag for rewriting is {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-rewrite_97ec.html" title="Template:Cleanup-rewrite">cleanup-rewrite</a>}}. And the tag for an article on a company that may not satisfy our <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria is {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}}. We expand stubs. Only after you've <i>done the research</i> and determined that there is nothing written about a company except its own self-publicity, advertising, press releases, autobiography, and so forth, and thus that the article is unexpandable from any <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent sources</a>, should you come to AFD. Your nomination gives no indication that you've actually done any research at all to see what sources exist. AFD is not cleanup. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:58, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Apologies. This page is over two years old. If there were many notable things to say you think people would have said them by now. I tend to think there likely is, but not knowing enough about the company (aha the catch-22) I recommended the AfD. My bad I guess. I still vote to delete unless the article is turned into a real wiki article (by someone who presumably knows the company). Tomstdenis 21:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you actually serious about the two years old bit? Do you have any idea how many articles there are on Wiki? Look at the main page and you may get a sense. Not every article is going to be FA. There are too many, and when we have to come spend time on a page like this, it takes away from spending time making articles better. Next time: 1) look at the criteria for AfD 2) research the topic to see if it is indeed an AfD. And for pittance I think you should research the company here and improve the content. Otherwise it looks like you Afd was in bad faith, like maybe you work for a competitor? Like maybe Elliptic Semiconductor Inc.? Looks like a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">conflict on interest</a> to me, point #2 on the conflict page. Just because you delete things from your talk page, doesn't mean we can't see what was there and determine people's true motives. For those who do not know who the AfD nominator is, look <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tom_St_Denis_3591.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tom St Denis">here</a>, then <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2647" class="external text" title="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2647" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

I took the liberty of inspecting the contributions of everybody who contributed to this page, and it appears that almost all of them have <b>only</b> contributed to this page (and a couple of off-shoot pages that are concerned directly with this rapper). Are all these guys working for the same marketing firm or what?

<p>not everything is internet based as these magazine scans show and there are still 21,1000 matches on google for "sizzerb" as of right now, so therefore i don't think this is a spam/vanity page and should not be up for deletion. If you're not very familiar with the mixtape game you shouldnt be deciding whats "famous" and what isnt, you saying you only found wiki pages and blogs show you are clearing lying and hating and are probably friends with the guy who originally wanted to delete because you 2 have some sort of nerd alliance...anyway if you chose to delete this i will save the information i have showed and send it in an email to the wikipedia contact with LINKS after i have had a thorough amount of time to find everything related on this artists which will clearly meet the criteria and i will suggest to whoever appointed you admin to reconsider</p>

<dd>In any case, the fact that he seems to have appeared in several published works (and has a top 20 hit in Serbia) would seem to qualify him under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. But just for the record, most of those links are dead, make no mention of Sin, or are hosted by Sin's own site. Also, a #19 hit in a small county like Serbia does not a star make.</dd>

<dd>The question here is whether or not this article is mere advertisement, or if it provides information that the general population might be genuinely interested in. This one seems to close for me to call, since I have never heard of the subject in question. (But then again, I'm not a big Serbian Hip-Hop fan ^&gt;^ ) Does anybody else have any comments about this (other than the people who have created this article)? - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 17:56, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have no idea but I looked at the history too and it seems to be quite a few different people editing the article. For example I corrected a few spelling errors of his projects and the name of his record label. Again you are telling me the links I posted are dead, well I just checked all of them like I did last night and no they're not and every single one of them has a mention of Sin. So therefore you are wrong on both accounts, again. And how can we have an intellectual debate when everything you say is simply not the truth? The one's hosted on his site are newspaper articles who's text you'd have to look up to find it on the web. Wikipedia does not have population guidelines of countries that make "stars". This is a joke, I suggest you educate yourself before you start trying to delete articles. Start by looking up rap on wikipedia then go ahead and look up mixtapes, then look up the american DJs hosting his mixtapes. You said yourself he qualifies under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. So it seems to me you are just either racist against Serbs or just have no knowlegde about the role mixtapes play in making rap "stars" as you call them nowadays.--Mistabusta 22:43, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> This article is a list of commercial IP vendors. It is without merit, without notability, and does not belong on wikipedia. The author of this article is just upset that I re-wrote the section of vendors in the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core.html" title="Semiconductor intellectual property core">Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core</a> article. You can educate the reader as to what an IP vendor is without a vacuous list of company links. Nobody is learning anything of an academic nature by reading this article. Tomstdenis 16:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> (I have created the article using the material Tomstdenis deleted - despite objections on the Talk page - from another article, see <a href="../../../s/e/m/Talk%7ESemiconductor_intellectual_property_core_0444.html" title="Talk:Semiconductor intellectual property core">Talk:Semiconductor intellectual property core</a>). The articles of this type are fairly common in Wikipedia and usually do not generate any controversy.

<li>Again, just because other (and I haven't checked all of them) irrelevant pages exist doesn't mean this one should stay. You're but one in a sea of tens of thousands IP vendors. Why is your company so notable as to be listed and not others? The flipside is to list every company that claims to be an IP vendor. The article would be very long, and totally unwikipedia. For instance, the list of IA32 processor vendors is only borderline encyclopedic by the mere volume of x86_32 processors in use today. Many of the IA32 vendors are <b>historic</b> in that their designs led to advances in computing, for instance, pipelined CISC cores, super-scalar CISC cores, OOE cores, etc. ARM Ltd (for instance) already has an article in wikipedia because of their place in modern computing. This list offers no explanation as to why they're placed at the top of the list (repeatedly in different sections). They're hardly the only processor vendor. See for example, freescale, motorola, ibm, intel, RCA, etc, etc, etc. In that this list is infeasible to be accurate, it should be deleted (much like I think a page listing all thousands of human genes would be inappropriate for wiki). Either we list ALL vendors of IP cores who have at least one product, or we list none of them. Tomstdenis 16:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Can I add my objection to the views of user Tomstdenis. The list of IP vendors is important, but should be kept short and to the point. In my view that is quite feesible as worldwide the number of <b>significant IP vendors</b> numbers in the tens not the hundreds. I'm not counting every vendor who can offer a CRC checksum routine in <a href="../../../v/h/d/VHDL_01eb.html" title="VHDL">VHDL</a>, but only those IP companies that offer large and complex IP blocks such as <a href="../../../c/p/u/CPU_2b55.html" title="CPU">Processors</a> or <a href="../../../h/2E/2/H.264.html" title="H.264">cutting edge</a> video codecs that require a significant number of man years (centuaries??) to develop. Also the focus of the list page should be on those companies that generate the bulk of their revenue from IP sales.</li>
<li>While the academic value of this list is limited, it is an excellent primary source of information about this difficult to understand area of business.
<ul>
<li><b>Remark</b> You seriously underestimate the number of competent B2B IP vendors there are out there. Sure there are few the size of ARM or ATMEL or whatever, but there are many competent businesses that are making profit in the industry. ARM already has a wiki entry, for example. We do not need another empty page that is merely a link to it. Either write a body to the article that substantiates the links (hint: the parent article has a stub in that direction) or delete this page. Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a place to put up meaningless vendor lists. And even though other lists exists, doesn't mean this one should (and perhaps some of the existing lists should be removed too). Tomstdenis 18:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Remark</b> Perhaps the list page should be changed to a category.

</dl>
<p>This is the third nomination for this article. I've read the other two, and I've yet to see a compelling reason for keeping (the first was overshadowed by a bad-faith nom). I think keeping this article is a result of systemic bias; we think it's notable because we have heard of it <i>because we are Wikipedians</i>. I'll outline the reasons for deletion below.</p>
<p>Firstly, it does not pass as notable according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. These are well-established guidelines for determining the notability of web-based concepts, and are used extensively for most web topics. The second and third criteria are certainly not passed: it has not won an award, nor been distributed via well-known independent medium. It has not been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself (the mention in <i><a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepolis.html" title="Telepolis">Telepolis</a></i> is undeniably trivial. Thus, it clearly fails the notability guidelines.</p>
<p>Secondly (and if you don't like notability), there is practically nothing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> that can be included in this article. Everything is being sourced directly to the Wikinfo domain. The article is essentially a description of Wikinfo is and how it works, with no context of why it's important in the larger world; due to the lack of independent sourcing, this can't change. If there is nothing verifiable from which to construct the article, why is it in the encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>Thirdly, to rebut an argument given in the previous AfDs for keeping; being a fork of a notable project does not automatically confer notability. That just wouldn't work. If you feel it is a prominent fork, then it would merit inclusion in an article on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, or even Wikipedia forks, but not on its own (for the reasons mentioned above).</p>
<p>Previous AfDs cited numerous other reasons for keeping the article, but none of them conformed to any guideline or policy. The existence of similar articles (<a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a> et al) is <i>not</i> a reason to keep this one. The significance of <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> within the Wikipedia community is not a reason to keep an article in a general encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>I'm aware this nomination is fairly lengthy, but that's an attempt to combat any dismissive "keep per previous AfD" replies. Consider the arguments raised and, if you still feel this should be kept, please explain why; don't simply assert that this is notable. And I would ask you to judge this objectively; if a website of similar prominence and sourcing, but unrelated to the Wikipedia community, was nominated, how would you vote? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 17:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's nothing new in this nomination, so I'll just link to my (long-winded) comments at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wikinfo_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wikinfo_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">previous AfD</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 17:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I couldn't follow your comments last time; how on earth can something "borrow" notability from Wikipedia? You are using notability in the sense of "significance" or "importance" which it isn't. It is a reasonably objective assessment of a topic, in respect of the guidelines agreed on by community consensus. If I forked Wikipedia, would my fork be notable? You said last time that you would support a move to Wikipedia namespace; is that not a tacit admission of this site's lack of notability? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 18:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you couldn't follow my comments from the previous AfD, I'm sorry but I'm afraid we'll have to leave the discussion as is. There's nothing more I can add, and we're certainly not going to convince each other. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 19:25, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well last time you seemed to conclude that it <i>shouldn't</i> be in the main namespace, and supported moving it elsewhere, so I'm not sure why you're&#160;!voting Keep now. I'll post a (neutrally worded) comment on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">Wikipedia talk:Notability</a> to get some more opinions on this "borrowing" notability argument. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 19:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is no new information since the previous Afd, and I am not comfortable with repeated attempts, as they either are hopes that by some chance there might be a different group of editors present who might feel differently. Tis is a game that can be kept up indefinitely, and most formal or informal judicial systems disallow it. This disrupts the afd process by forcing continued reargument. There is nothing new in the facts or the argument. Keeping it is just common sense. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 18:05, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, but I think the previous AfD wasn't a fair reflection. Too many people came and&#160;!voted, and then left, not responding to arguments against their POV. Please explain why we can abandon policy and guidelines to allow an unverifiable and non-notable article to exist. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 18:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>We can source two facts to sources other than Wikinfo itself. See the citations in the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, we can create an article saying it is a fork of Wikipedia with a sympathetic point of view. Nothing else seems verifiable. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 20:07, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not from <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent sources</a>, no. Those two citations are all that I've been able to discover so far. (Admittedly, this particular subject is hard to research. Looking on the World Wide Web, for example, one has to wade through a large number of copies on other web sites of this article and of <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a>, and cannot easily exclude them from a search without excluding potential sources as well.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:21, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I admire your dedication to look through sources; obviously (as with all notability deletions), we can never definitively say that there are no sources anywhere. However, given the relative size and prominence of the project, it seems unlikely there will be much else (and, as ever, the burden is on those wishing to keep). <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 20:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, no it isn't. AFD involves multiple editors precisely so that editors can find things that other editors either have overlooked or do not know about. For it to work, <i>everyone</i> in an AFD discussion must do their own independent research, so that there are as many layers of swiss cheese, to prevent an erroneous conclusion, in the process as possible (see the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_Cheese_model_1f9e.html" title="Swiss Cheese model">Swiss Cheese model</a>). <i>That includes the nominator and those that want the article deleted.</i> "Fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and I did the research looking here, here, and here but could only find X, Y, and Z." is far more convincing than "The article doesn't cite enough sources to show that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is satisfied.". If the sources exist, and it is simply the case that the nominator didn't make any attempt to look for them, then fixing the article is a matter of cleanup, not deletion.
<p>Hence: <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Giving_rationales_at_AFD" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability#Giving rationales at AFD</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>No, I'm aware that people should do their own research. But if, after this, no sources have been found, I don't think an argument for "Keep", asserting that there are sources, is very convincing. In this case, it's not really relevant, as the arguments for keeping are <i>in spite</i> of the lack of sources. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 21:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Changed to <b>delete or merge</b>: Great as Wikinfo is as a concept, Wikipedia is moving towards quality rather than quantity for articles. Wikinfo people have unfortunately not come up with any sources of significant articles, and we are nearing the AfD deadline for the third AfD. If these are found or written, we can re-introduce the article. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 11:50, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>What relevance does that have? Whether or not you like the concept or not isn't pertinent to this AfD. The fact we may have had an article on ourself too early, in no way excuses keeping this one (see <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> for fuller explanation). I don't see how your arguments excuse the fact it is unverifiable and non-notable. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 20:21, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is an expression: <i>cutting off your nose to spite your face</i>. Wikipedia is moving away from using common knowledge, where people write about what they know, to a more rigorous system of using "reliable" sources. But doing this exclusively this has dangers. Anyone who has been written about knows that even so-called reliable sources are full of simplifications and often made up "facts". My view is that reliable sources should be used to establish contended facts, but not be required for common knowledge which is uncontended. This is actually much more relevant on technical subjects, where elementary knowledge is often not mentioned in the most sophisticated sources. But as no one challenges it, we can work on more difficult areas, which benefit from references. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 21:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry, but I still fail to see the relevance to this deletion discussion. Could you link it more obviously please. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 21:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think applying the latest ideology on Wikipedian purity to all articles makes this encyclopaedia better. Many articles, for example the much edited <a href="../../../g/o/_/Go_%28board_game%29.html" title="Go (board game)">Go</a>, contain a multitiude of unreferenced facts. The question here in AfD is not about what should be in the article, but about whether there should be one. I think that Wikinfo is notable because it is the manifestation of an interesting philosophy, just as I think Wikipedia was notable even before it was widely written about. Wikipedia is not just notable because it is written about. This is a sufficient but not necessary condition. By trying to control editors decisions by imprisoning them in one-size-fits-all rules, there is a risk of driving away intelligent, thoughtful and inspired editors - the mappers - leaving just the packers (you won't find these terms here because they are banned neologisms, but you can find them elsewhere in the context of software development - perhaps I'll add them to Wikinfo). <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 22:18, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's hardly the "latest" ideology; it's been around for a while and has an accepted consensus. Things aren't notable because they're "interesting". Your comments don't seem very related to this particular nomination, they're more general comments on the system as a whole. I don't think your reasoning has any grounding in the policies and guidelines we currently use. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:28, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The evidence would suggest otherwise. After all, this article has survived two previous nominations at AfD, which would seem to contradict the assertion that the long-held consensus policies and guidelines would ensure deletion. It is true that the gist of the points above is generally applicable. In reality, almost all articles here still have unsourced material, and without it we would have a much more minimalist encyclopaedia. I'm not saying we can't move towards the ideal of everything being sourced, but throwing out common sense is something which takes time and has negative consequences as well as positive ones. In practice, the best encyclopaedia comes from only insisting on reliable sources for conentious content. Think of what benefits users the most. I'd rather have a short article full of uncontended but true facts than no article. These views are controversial, but I think it is too easy to delete (ie destroy) and things would be better if people spent more effort on creation. You will see from my AfD record that I have fixed many articles which have come up in AfD as prime candidates for deletion. Ideally, someone would spend their effort in fixing the article rather than deleting it. (I haven't yet gone as far to encourage a referencable article to be written.) In my experience, many articles are started by people who know what they're talking about, and these are fixed up later to meet guidelines and policies. Strict application of the "rules" will prevent this natural process of article creation. I wouldn't oppose a warning tag in the mean time. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 07:51, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Being useful isn't an argument for keeping. At the moment, it seems that if I created a fork of Wikipedia it would be <i>ipso facto</i> notable. Almost all the facts in the article are sourced directly to the wiki. If I wanted to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>, I could start challenging a lot of the facts for coming from a primary source, and strip the article to the bare bones. And I think that, if I did that, it would be so short as to not be worth keeping (and should be merged or deleted). This is absurd double-standards, based on "I've heard of it" arguments; we regularly delete websites with this lack of sourcing and notability. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 09:58, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And if I wanted to make a point, I could delete almost all of every article as unsourced. I think that a tag is more appropriate than an AfD as a <i>first step</i> to give people a reasonable time to source the article. For example, the people running Wikinfo may have access to lots of sources - have they been asked to provide them? This is what I mean by thinking that AfD should be more active. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 12:45, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If there <i>are</i> more sources, then great - we'll add them and I'll withdraw the nomination. But searching by Uncle G and me haven't brought up anything outside of very trivial mentions in a few places. My problem is that people are arguing to keep, <i>in spite</i> of the lack of sources, and ignoring the concept of notability (and to some extent, verifiability). The fact remains that this is a pretty minor project, and so for it to be the/a primary subject of multiple non-trivial sources seems incredibly unlikely; I'll repeat that if this wasn't connected to us, there'd be no hesitation to delete. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 13:01, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I've put some comments on my talk page. What I will do next is see if I can contact someone from Wikinfo to see if they know of any sources. As an aside, which policy says non-notability is a valid reason for deletion? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 13:04, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>None, notability is a guideline. However, there still needs to be a particular reason for ignoring it, and I don't think "connected to Wikipedia" qualifies as one. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 13:11, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>There is a reason it is not policy. And a reason for the notability guideline is to ensure articles are maintained. This is less of an issue for subjects of particular intterest to Wikipedians. And your I LIke It isn't even a guideline - it's just an essay. Anyway, I've put a post on Wikinfo asking for independent sources - lets see if anyone bites. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 13:17, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(reset indent) Yes, there reason it isn't policy is that there's a lot of dispute over how strict it should be.

<dd>That's essentially saying strong keep per the previous AfDs.

<dd>The article has had a lot of editors - this itself indicates a level of notability not picked up in the current notability guideline (perhaps we should fix the guideline). On verifiability, which is serious (being policy), the claims about facts made are pretty trivially verifiable by logging on to the system. If the AfD goes for delete, it's not a disaster, as technically this may be the logical consequence of the rules, but would be a possible over-application of rules which would see most of Wikipedia's 1.6m articles deleted. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 13:46, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It would be a bog-standard application of the rules which we would do to any other article unconnected to the Wiki. If you think the guidelines are broken, fix them, but don't ignore them as they stand. I don't care how many editors are willing to work on the article if almost everything has to be sourced directly to Wikinfo itself.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm currently producing a lexicography term paper on Wikis and wikipedia, and I've seen enough independent mentions of WikInfo to consider it notable on its own.

<dd>If Circeus were to add a citation of an offline source to the article, it would not have a link. While such a source would probably be more reliable, not being online, I would either have to trust Circeus, or look for the source myself. If my local library did not have it, I would either have to trust Circeus or not trust Circeus. Since my lack of ability to find it at my local library does not mean that it does not exist, I would choose to trust Circeus.

<dd>So you support keeping an article in spite of a lack of sources? With each successive AfD it becomes harder and harder to get something deleted as people will just point to the last one and go "nothing has changed", even if most of the previous arguments no longer hold weight. I could assert that I've looked in lots of libraries and saw no references to Wikinfo anywhere; it might not be true, but would that be enough to convince you to delete? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 16:01, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I support keeping an article with insufficient secondary sources (it has enough primary sources and a few small secondary sources) in the hope that more/better secondary sources can be added in the near future. Have you thoroughly looked in libraries and found no significant references to Wikinfo? If so, that would probably be enough for me to change to a neutral, since I really don't know whether you or Circeus is more trustworthy / good at looking for things in the library. If you say you found no references (significant or otherwise) whatsoever, I might question how thoroughly you have looked.

As to "more a POV-pushing then a real intent to discover the facts in this case", I'd say that's baseless; I was the one advocating <i>looking</i> at the results and seeing what they say, as opposed to a <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> argument of "this number is big". <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 07:39, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Marginal Keep</b>. Has <i>some</i> 3rd-party sourcing, and has already survived AfD twice. This entire 3rd AfD and its predecessors strike me as nothing but a longwinded variant of "Well, I just don't like it", and outright vindictiveness for it having survived twice already. That it has done so strikes me as basically a consensus not to delete, so this 3rd AfD is bordering on disrupting WP to make a point. I think I may have commented earlier (possibly with a "delete") something to the effect that "so what, I could fork WP myself but that won't make McCandlishPedia notable" (maybe it was in talk or on the 2nd AfD, or in CfD; I don't see it here).

<dd>Please make an effort assume good faith. I didn't participate in the previous AfDs, and they had a large number of ILIKEIT votes. So to say that I'm doing this to be disruptive is completely wrong. It's got nothing to do with me not liking it, I honestly couldn't care less. This is to do with evaluating the sources and considering it as if it were just another website, completely unconnected to us. Considering you think two of the "keep"s are not particularly substantive, and you're only voting for a marginal keep, I see no explanation for assuming my nomination was disruptive. And even if this gets kept, the article will come out better-sourced, which means this discussion will have improved Wikipedia.

<dd>OK - I'll write an essay. It's probably worth mentioning that the notability guidelines details sufficient, not necessary conditions eg <i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works...</i> and <i>One notability criterion shared by nearly all of the subject-specific notability guidelines...</i>. Thus it is a logical fallacy to say that something is not notable if it does not meet these guidelines. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 09:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because it's not a rule? The issue for me is not whether this subject is notable, verifyable or neutral, because I think all these conditions are met. Rather it is whether enough can currently be written about the subject to be encyclopaedic. I'm waiting to see what references come up. So far I've come across many many brief mentions which support the current content of the article, and many sites which independently use Wikinfo as a source. Perhaps what I'm mulling is what the minimum article size should be, as not much can be said about this other than when it started, why it started, how big it is, and what its rules are. It's interesting to compare this with what can be said about Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 16:22, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it's notable (per pretty much all my other points), and only the very basic points are verifiable to independent sources, everything else is primary sourced.

<dd>We do often use Google as a guide - mostly to prove something is not notable,in fact, when the figure is low. What concerns me is that applying the rules in the way being proposed here equally to all articles would result in huge numbers of them being deleted unnecessarily. I don't see using Wikinfo as a source is a problem - the WIkipedia article is mostly sourced to Wikis, most of those being Wikipedia itself. There are many third party sources - Alexa has 490 web sites linking in, and many of these are articles which mention Wikinfo - more than most articles in WIkipedia have. The problem is, as Trebor says, the depth of the sources. I am still happy to see if anyone at Wikinfo comes up with some more in-depth third party sources. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 17:01, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You almost say that as if you believe it&#160;;-) The reason there are so many articles not meeting this constraint is that in the old days, people just wrote about what they knew. Wikinfo was such an article. I've been helping to reference article claims and this definitely improves the encyclopaedia. But Jimbo's tag line - repeated in New Scientist this week - is that Wikipedia should contain all human knowledge. Partly for this reason, I think this level of sourcing should only apply to controversial areas. Major article "agree" with me on this, as most generally known facts are not referenced. The rigorous sourcing requirement mentioned so often is a mirage <i>in practice</i>. I can point to almost any fact in almost any article and you will not be able to tell me whether it is mentioned in any of the listed sources. As more sources are added, it gets harder to remove any statement because it gets harder to prove it is not in any source. And while I'm here, the notability guidelines are chosen <i>because</i> they allow articles liked by the authors, as appeal to ILikeIt is self-referential. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 18:26, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

My point is that it isn't much different from many other Wikipedia articles I've seen (at least it isn't a stub!) If it's trivial-coverage heavy, why not leave it there to let others improve it? It may have sat there a while in this state, but I'm guessing not too many Wikipedians have visited Wikinfo as well, as it's "competition"&#160;;).

<li><b>Delete</b> I looked at the article earlier today and somehow missed the giant AfD template. However, I was seriously considering gutting it because the majority of it is (likely unsouraceble) OR and how-to information only of interest to wikinfo contributors. If adequate sourcing can be found, I might be persuaded to argue "keep and rewrite" but right now I have to say delete. Lots of google hits <b>are</b> meaningless if they are trivial or self-referential as most of these are. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 14:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I did research the matter. There are an abundance of definitions that are more or less the same for "pure play". However, outside of a few debates/essays about whether a diverse or focused approach is better this subject doesn't have much meat. Subjects of this type, which are basically definitions, <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">do not belong in Wikipedia</a>. It's just a jargon phrase with limited scope. I also do not find the "pure play method" notable as it is nothing differant than what is done with other businesses. (That is, analysis is based on the type and market of the business.) Of course, this is just my opinion based on my research. If you have contrary sources and information please use that knowledge to <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">improve the article</a>. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 22:06, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There was no assumption of bad faith. But it is clear that this nomination and several of the opinions here aren't based upon doing research, or even upon reading the last AFD discussion, where it was explained by several editors that this is a stub with scope for expansion, with several potential directions for expansion being suggested. You are also miscontruing our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy, <i>which does not imply that stubs do not belong in Wikipedia</i>. This article is a stub. It is not a dictionary article. It is a <i>stub encyclopaedia article</i>. <i>The two are not the same thing.</i> Per our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, we only delete stubs if they have no scope for expansion. Actually reading the sources that are already cited in the article will show that there is far more to write on the subject of the "pure play method", because the sources provide more material. Your "expand the article for me or it should be deleted" ultimatum is not how collaborative editing works, nor is it how AFD works or how <a href="../../../f/i/n/Wikipedia%7EFind_and_fix_a_stub_d97f.html" title="Wikipedia:Find and fix a stub">finding and fixing stubs</a> works. The rest of us are not cleanup machines; and AFD is not <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">cleanup</a>. And, finally, whether you find the "pure play method" notable is immaterial. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. We don't base inclusion or exclusion on editors' personal opinions of the importance of a subject. That way chaos lies. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:44, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Assuming, as you continue to do, that I did not research the topic or read the last AFD is certainly <b>not</b> assuming good faith. This article was tagged for notability since June with no additions, cleanup or talk page activity. While it is definately notable as a term (making it appropriate for Wiktionary), I really found no reason in <i>my research</i> that "pure play" is notable except anything as a definition, as I mentioned. While it is a common term, the definition is fairly straightforward and leaves little room for an encyclopedia article. My research indicates the same for the "pure play method". It has a relatively simple definition and seems to leave little room for additional encyclopedia material, except in discussing the parts ("beta", etc) which are already addressed in other articles. I was providing a comment on the deletion discussion. I was not demanding people agree or issuing an ultimatum and I was clear on that point.

I can read tagalog and I can tell you, there is nothing on that page that announces this series. If it does exist, Wikipedia's still not a crystal ball. If/when this series is actually shown, then it can have an article. There are question marks all over the article. Original run says "April 2007", a long ways from now.

<li><b>Keep</b>. School districts, like municipalities, should be considered automatically notable as government bodies. Besides, people sometimes argue that an article on an individual school should be merged into the article for the appropriate school district, and if we start deleting school districts, it won't be possible to merge school articles that way. Besides, school districts sometimes take in several different municipalities, so they often can't be merged into the article for a single municipality or county. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 18:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not convinced that school districts are notable by default since they are government bodies. That information belongs on government-sponsored sites where it can be looked up as necessary. I find it hard to believe someday these school district articles will evolve to be as complete as those found on government pages, for every single school district in the world. If people need that kind of information, they would not look for it here. Should every single law ever made also be in Wikipedia? There are other repositories for that kind of information.<br />
I would argue that school districts are not nearly as notable as municipalities. How often have you heard of someone looking up a school district as opposed to someone looking up a municipality? I don't even have any idea what district the schools I went to were in, but I certainly know what municipality I lived in.<br />
As for merging schools into school districts, if the schools are so un-noteworthy as to have to be merged, why are they even here? I'm all for deleting those school articles, as well as school district articles. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcemuon_5e0d.html" title="User:Icemuon">Icemuon</a> 20:10, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Do you then propose to keep all informationless articles <i>just in case</i> they should acquire further content in the future? <i>That</i> is like looking into a crystal ball -- it is the assumption that something <i>will</i> happen to fill out this article. Note that this is different from stubs -- stubs are starter articles on topics that can be expanded to a considerable degree. But how can this article be expanded into more than what it already is? If something happens involving this school district, then an article will be written on the <i>event</i> rather than the district itself. Let's say that there is a teacher's strike in this school district. Then probably an article will be written about the strike, mentioning the school district. But an article on the school district itself won't give any more information that what would be in the strike article. If in the future something happens that really warrants this school district an article, <i>then</i> the article will be written. Until then, it is contributing nothing. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcemuon_5e0d.html" title="User:Icemuon">Icemuon</a> 12:04, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

If <a href="../../../a/c/n/User%7EAcntx_5070.html" title="User:Acntx">Acntx</a> wishes to propose the review of other school district articles with a view to deletion, at present, and until I hear some better arguments, I'd be inclined to support their removal. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:17, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> due to lack of content. As an example of a reasonably good school district article, I'd point to <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_District_39_Vancouver_3022.html" title="School District 39 Vancouver">School District 39 Vancouver</a>. The present one has so little content that it's hardly worth looking it up on Wikipedia. If more material can be found, then I think the article could be re-submitted. I'd argue that we shouldn't argue too much about notability, but we should worry more about future maintainability. So in my view it's fair to take points off for the current condition of the article. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 01:27, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There is general consensus to have an article on all school districts. Content can be filled out by adding information about the various schools in the district. While this article currently is lacking significant content, that is not a reason to delete since encyclopedic content could be added to the article. If there is concern that the article is not past a stub, then the correct action is to add the proper {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} tag rather then deleting. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 07:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

What really attracted my attention enough to nominate this is the "Synopsis" section with the only words under it being "To be announced". <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 06:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep + clean up</b> It's definitely real. But it could do with more content. However I do have to ask, a Filipino Tabloids the same a US Tabloids? Because in the UK Tabloids may be a bit dubios but there not as bad as... say... The National Enquirer. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracieLizzie_a424.html" title="User:GracieLizzie">GracieLizzie</a> 17:59, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>From my experience, Philippine tabloid newspapers tend to run gossip articles with unverified gossip (well, gossip is unverified in the first place). In some cases, a blind item would lead to a denial on the weekend entertainment news shows. In some cases, too, a tabloid item would lead to lawsuits. There are also some potential conflict of interest issues as some tabloid writers are also managers of some actors and actresses. So for me, tabloid articles in the Philippines should be taken with a grain of salt. --- <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitopao_212a.html" title="User:Titopao">Tito Pao</a> 18:06, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. If Filipino tabloids are the same as US tabloids (which I agree with), then they shouldn't be used as reliable sources for anything (not even "gossip"). Sure, there aren't many "Image of Jesus on a pancake!" articles, but equivalently ridiculous ones are published on those. The closest that I'd even <i>consider</i> accepting would be Abante (and I won't). Tabloid blogs?

<li><b>Comment</b>. If you check the history, the text "copied" from the source was posted in WP on January 31, 2007. However, the "source" article was posted only on February 2, 2007, several days after the content appeared on Wikipedia. Methinks the user is affiliated with the network responsible for the show as he has been editing/creating WP articles with text ripped directly from the network's site and has a history of uploading copyrighted images for the network's shows. User also has been "vandalizing" the WP articles of competing network's shows, by lowering their ratings as evidenced in the history of this article (<a href="../../../s/a/n/Sana_Maulit_Muli_4ee8.html" title="Sana Maulit Muli">Sana Maulit Muli</a>) I just reverted.

<p>While I do find the list useful, IMHO it is quite unencyclopedic and too massive in scope. Right now, the list has a lot of American/British/etc. actors, but the Indian ones are now creeping in. Soon, every country that has a film industry will be wanting their actors on this list...etc. We should also look at some of the lists this list is associated with, i.e. List of female film actors. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 19:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Blendo is a supremely notable combat robot. It was the first successful 'full-body' or 'shell' spinning weapon implementation. Blendo proved the utility of the stored kinetic energy weapon that has come to dominate the sport. It also promoted the development of more effective arena containment to protect audiences from flying debris. Further, the robot was deemed so dangerous that it was granted co-championship of the 1995 Robot Wars event on the condition that it withdraw to aviod potential injury to the audience. 167.131.0.153 16:12, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm with you. I agree that it's an important robot in the field of battling robots. But notability isn't "per field."

<li><b>Comment</b> I count 35 individual robot pages in Category:Robot_Wars_competitors and another 4 in Category:BattleBots. Few of them are for robots as important in the development of the sport as Blendo, yet this is the only page being considered for deletion. That puzzles me. 167.131.0.152 15:59, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a robot that competed in the notable "Robot Wars" and "BattleBots" competitions, and was built by Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage (two very notable television personalities.) Or, to put it another way, I believe the thing's been on national tv...ok, that's not exactly the same thing as notability, but it's close. In any event, it is covered by multiple non-trivial published works - it's been covered by the San Francisco Chronicle <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/20/PK138412.DTL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/20/PK138412.DTL" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>, appeared on the aforementioned national tv, etc. (And, to make a particularly weak argument, it <i>is</i> as notable as your average <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">pokemon</a> character.) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 16:29, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> by an astonishingly wide margin. No reliable sources (article is currently "sourced" by press releases and an entirely different person's IMDB entry, offered as someone Van Leer has "worked with"). The Cosmo exposure ("sourced" by part of a press release that does not mention Van Leer by name) was apparently some sort of "One hot guy from each of the 50 states" gimmick article so he was not the primary focus. His own resume on his <a href="http://www.blakevanleer.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.blakevanleer.com/" rel="nofollow">personal website</a> notes that the highlights of his acting career include such pivotal roles as "Boy" in the West Nottingham Academy production of "West Side Story." Plus he uses way too much product in his clearly severely damaged hair, but I suppose that doesn't really have a bearing on his Wiki-worthiness. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:30, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I notice some sort of nerdy "rivalry" here between some kind of online gaming group (Shadowclan) and that guys that make this Blake Van Leer topic. To my mind that puts the legitimacy of some of the keep/delete votes in question. I have no doubt that quite a few of these delete requests are just being done to cause turmoil for instance. Personally I think the article should be given a chance to redeem itself as it does sound like there are verifiable claims of notability. The problem is just that the article needs time to be cleaned up. I say "Get a life!" to all those partaking in this online gaming feud. Drouillm 20:51, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>As has already been pointed out, the much-vaunted Cosmo article, discussed at this <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_Oct_7/ai_108581053" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_Oct_7/ai_108581053" rel="nofollow">press release</a> linked in Van Leer's article, takes as its subject one bachelor from each of the 50 states. The press release for the article, which was called "Hunks Across America," lists 50 different names of people who appeared in the article. Van Leer is listed in one line as the hunk from Maryland. Even if this article is accepted as a verified reliable source (and I have no problem accepting it as such), Van Leer was <i>not</i> the primary subject of it. He was one of 50 subjects who, if this article was typical of articles of the type, had at most a single page and most likely a half- or a quarter-page as 2% of the article's subject. This does not come anywhere remotely close to satisfying the requirement that coverage of an article subject be non-trivial, and even stretching the point beyond all reasonable lebgths and counting this as one source, there do not appear to be any others. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:01, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your accusation of sockpuppetry is cute, but I actually had the Blake Van Leer article watchlisted since Blake announced in the first nomination that he would recreate this article if it got deleted.

<p>This list was originally part of <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_films.html" title="Cult films">Cult films</a> before being split off recently. Prior to being split off, I tagged this list section as being unreferenced and requested references from editors and from the Wiki Film project to verify that the list was something that was objective, verifiable and not original research. The reason is that this list of films appears to be simply an ad hoc collection of films that various editors <i>personally believe</i> should be called cult films, rather than films which published resources commonly refer to as cult films or that is based on a neutral criteria. Since the unref tag was placed, however, no improvement was made to the references or to show that the list is anything other than original research, and in fact the list has continued to grow with little to no evidence or discussion and no verification. Now that the list is in a seperate article, though, I am submitting it for <b>deletion</b> as unreference, original research. It should <i>not</i> be remerged with the main article, in my opinion, unless and until the reference and OR issues are properly addressed. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep or Remerge</b> for such a long list there is no way and is unrealistic to find reference for every one of them (and in actuality at wikipedia we can hardly find a list with all entries referenced). Also there is no universal standard for cult films, a little editorial discretion is needed. I suggest it to be kept for now or to be remerged with <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_film.html" title="Cult film">cult film</a> or <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_classic.html" title="Cult classic">cult classic</a>. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWooyi_6e7f.html" title="User:Wooyi">Wooyi</a> 21:15, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You actually are making a strong case for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> While I was persuaded by the reasons in the nomination, I was really convinced by Wooyi's comments. The fact that something cannot be verified or referenced is a very strong reason for deletion. Furthermore, just because there is an allegation that most "long lists" are unreferenced does not mean that this, or any of them, ought to be excused from the content policies and guidelines. In fact, I find that many lists nominated here at least have the saving grace of having references for the <i>individual</i> entries on the list. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:59, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But not all list <i>inherently</i> need reference, like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_women_writers.html" title="List of women writers">List of women writers</a>, it is very easy to know if a writer is a woman. And for this one, it is harder to determine, but I believe most editors can say a film is cult classic by common sense.

<dd>While it may be pretty easy to tell if someone is a woman (fairly objective criteria), I find it hard to believe that whether or not a film is "cult" is one of common sense (fairly subjective criteria). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:25, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> — Attendance was 3780 in 2006 according to Vlad Pohnert at Animethon. (I don't know where the wiki page got "4000".) 4000 seems fairly notable to me. Although the page needs references, it doesn't seem like a bad article. There are certainly other pages that are much more worthy of deletion than this. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 21:40, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems notable enough. "4000" attendance for an animecon is high. Plus the fact that it's been going on for 14 years means it has significant staying power.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is the first and only anime convention in Quebec. A first year attendance of 1800 is fairly respectable. Sure it needs more sources, but so do most anime con articles right now. However, since the nominator has no Wiki history other than nominating this and another Canadian anime con for deletion, I believe this was nominated for deletion in bad faith and my guess would be it is someone associated with another Canadian anime con. Taking that into consideration, I cannot support this deletion in good conscience. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 02:44, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEBCOMICS_2b97.html" title="WP:WEBCOMICS">WP:WEBCOMICS</a> is currently working through some new notability guidelines specifically for webcomics. The guidelines under discussion there are still preliminary, but the chances look very good that DF will meet them (easily). I really think it would be best to reserve judgment at this time. <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoyliciousDarian_63a3.html" title="User:BoyliciousDarian">BoyliciousDarian</a> 02:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree the guidelines are messy, and all webcomics should be measured by the same policy. But as of Feb4, this draft <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSparrow_Ninja_Webcomic_notability_guidelines_dfa6.html" title="User:JackSparrow Ninja/Webcomic notability guidelines">User:JackSparrow Ninja/Webcomic notability guidelines</a>, was partially merged into <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and notability criterion: <i>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself</i>, is central and needs to be shown by DF. What is <i>not</i> part of current criteria is notability on account of "a long run", which I'd think is DF's chief claim. There is of course no rush to move ahead of consensus, though. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 02:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those webcomics notability guidelines have not a snowball's chance in hell to survive wider scrutiny. If there are no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> independent sources, then no topic will be kept. There isn't even a consensus that e.g. secondary schoold which have existed for 50 years are inherently notable, so the chance that a webcomic which has existed for two years would be considered inherently notable is non-existant. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a core policy of Wikipedia, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> is the basic guideline of which all other guidelines are specific explanations, not exceptions to weaken that guideline that has a broad consensus. The only way a specific Webcomics guideline can possible be useful is to discuss which sources are reliable, which awards are indicating notability (the WCCA, which its numerous nominations?), etcetera. But if the aim is to lower the bar for webcomics (which seems to be the aim, probably because many webcomics are deleted currently), then it seems a wasted effort. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:14, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm really sorry to have to do this, as I love the comic. Sadly, we have to go with <b>Delete</b>. Why&#160;? Because it is a basic requirement of a Wikipedia article that it provide adequate references/sources, and this isn't the case here. Sure, there are references to the comic RSS feed and blog, but these are not independent of the comic itself. We need our references to be (a) independent, and (b) from a source generally regarded as reliable and reputable. We don't have this here, so the article fails our criteria and must go. I would like to say, though, that we should strongly encourage the creator to carry on with the strip: focus on making the best comic you can, and ( probably when you least expect it ) it will be recognised by independent sources and discussed and reviewed widely. Then, when you've forgotten all about this discussion, a Wikipedia entry will arise, and no-one will question it. The best role model is <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doonesbury.html" title="Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a>; Trudeau didn't seek fame, he just wanted to write a good comic: the fame came automatically as a result of his hard work and talent.

<li>We have no intention in advancing his career through wikipedia, If you would do research and see that he has been featured in filmmaker magazine several news papers and imdb. You may do what you whant, but he has more credibility then most people you have listed coming from Full Sail college. We also do not feel we need to use wikipedia to advance anyones career, we came here to post info for him. He Will have another article coming out about himself and his film in First Monday magazine next week. There have also been many press releases put out about his work. If you feel that what we are doing is wrong then take it down, otherwise there is no harm being done.

<li>Please feel free to cite references to those magazine and newspaper articles in the article. (Press releases put out by Downing himself, however, are not evidence of notability.) References to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable external sources</a> are very persuasive in this sort of decision. However, you need to give <i>detailed</i> references - for instance, what issue of Filmmaker Magazine? Simply saying that he was once mentioned in the magazine does not give the reader enough information to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the claim.

The newspapers the film and douglas were featured in are, "The Poughkeepsie Journal", "Woodstock Film Commision" and "The Hydespark Townsman". We are mostly trying to get him out there because the film he has directed is very important. It is the story of child sexual abuse and takes on the subject in a way movie has done yet. It is an incredible story how the film was made. The movie and himself have the support of 1,000's of CSA survivors (childhood sexual Aabuse). I hope now this is significant information, it will continue to grow rapidly each week. If you need more, please let us know and we will provide you with as much as we can. Thanks.</li>

<li>We are not attacking the director or his films. What's being said is that his films nor himself are notable enough to be included on Wikipedia. However, with the information that's been presented, I'm going to have to say <b>keep</b> until there's more information. It's looking like he's up-and-coming and if not now, will be worthy of an article soon.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Perhaps I should have said <i>indiscriminate</i>. The problem is not that the people within the list are trivial, but that amassing them together into a list is fairly pointless. The number of Jewish people who have served in military organisations is so vast that the list could never be complete and would need constant updating. A category would present this information much more efficiently.

<li><b>Comment</b> "a few with red links" somewhat underplays one issue here, since about half of the links are red (I got 64 red links out of 137 entries on an admittedly quick count). To me this speaks to the problem of article creep, where editors wish to continuously add names they subjectively feel are notable, as opposed to wishing to provide a navigation page for those wanting more information on the overall subject.

<p>Hmm where to start with? Unencyclopedic, Fancruft, Yet another "List of XYZ" article, and badly written also --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 22:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b><s>Delete</s></b>. I love The Simpsons. This list has no point. Sheer listcruft. As Simpsons jokes are often nested within each other, this list is arbitrary and OR. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 22:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. After reading the other Simpsons articles, I'm convinced this should stay BUT must have more references. No need for net references, just reference each episode that a gag appears, and so on and so forth. It works in context with the main article. Perhaps there should be a {main} link to the main Simpsons article on top of the page. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 20:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Which is why I specifically stated that <i>each</i> episode a gag appears should probably be referenced. Of course, we don't expect the ones that appear in every episode to be that extensively referenced, but you can count the number of episodes Sideshow Bob has stepped on a rake on more than one finger but less than ten. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 05:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>A lot are no copyvios, have information, are no blatant adververtisment and get deleted nevertheless because they are simply unfit for an encylopedia. (just an example, a cooking recipy! or some character of an episode apearing only 1 time, etc.) Please make yourself a bit more comfortable with what wikipedia is! On Topic, since this article is a border case, one can discuss. But thats it, I would not expect such a content for example in the Britannica, but a dedicated book over the simpsons. --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 09:13, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>'the Alexa rank of 2,626,889' (??) Sorry - you speak about the <b>website</b> as I guess (where the content is <b>NOT</b> published, with exception of a few sample issues) while it is email newspaper, with many of the world elite chess-players (world's numer two Vishy Anand, to name just one here) being among its subscribers. The website is mainly a place where people can make their subscriptions and read some basic info once or twice in a lifetime - so why there should be any hot traffic?! I do not see a logic here, apologies! Sorry but I will try to repeat: Chess Today readers do not visit website to find news or anything. They read content which they receive by email and which can not be found on the web by definition, with the exception of some sample issues. This in some way explains why there was no article on CT in Wikipedia until now, it is web-based but most of content is not on the web (as it is the case with some traditional newspapers).</p>
<p>Gkb123 writes: I don't think the article should be deleted. Chess Today is a Chess Newspaper that is highly respected in the chess world, that is read by hundreds of chess players from beginners to professional Grandmaster Chess Players. I think I heard that the World Chess Champion is a reader.</p>
<p>It really has nothing to do with websites and the Chess Today website is merely a place to sign up for the newspaper.</p>

<p>I disagree with deletion proposal. My argument is that if you take the same position w.r.t. similar articles, you have to delete half of the entire content of Wikipedia. One example: <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turtle_F2F_a606.html" title="Turtle F2F">Turtle F2F</a>. This is very original research. This is an invention of a single person supported by the university. No one has acknowledged this concept yet. The software was never released. And that has gained no traction whatsoever in the world outside of that university.

<b>Del</b> on this n-n bio. Scrabble, Sudoku, and crosswords are such widely practiced 1-4 person, single-game or single-evening <i>casual</i> entertainments that those who <i>create</i> the puzzles and/or <i>write</i> the books about the solving the puzzles or winning the games can be notable for doing those things. A minuscule fraction of fans engage in them as tournament competitions, and non-participants who pay attention to the tournaments probably number roughly the same as non-participant spouses and spouse-equivalents of competitors. <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wordplay_%28film%29.html" title="Wordplay (film)">Wordplay (film)</a> is the kind of exception that "proves the rule": it played in lots of theaters, and got some press attention, but the participants appear in that article as text, not bio-lks; the same is true for the participants in crossword tournaments that don't get filmed. Entering tournaments for Scrabble, crosswords, Sudoku, touch football, or other casual entertainments is fun, even admirable, but a refined taste, and the winners can only be covered appropriately by listings in articles on the events, &amp;/or lists/tables of competitive players with lks to their events. Winning the events is notable to that extent, but <i>being</i> a tournament winner is not notable to the extent of justifying a bio. (I'm not even sure it's reasonable to use their names as Rdrs to such lists.) In this case, (1) the info provided in the so-called bio is less useful in this format than in a table of winners of a given competition, with a column per winner about other wins; (2) the inclusion of a 1-sent 'graph on his winnings <i>doesn't</i> show how notable he is, but the opposite: while i don't demean the accomplishment and satisfaction obviously involved, at under $100 won per tournament, this guy is a generous subsidizer of the travel and lodging industries, rather than a "professional scrabble player", as the article at first glance suggests.<br />

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> Point taken, but World Scrabble champs seem notable enough for me, and the article is wikified and of appropriate (i.e., short) length.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Point <i>not</i> taken. The comparisons of Scrabble to Sudoku and touch football are misconceived. Tournament Scrabble play is very established and notable.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It is a genre for sure, but not simply because of the reason stated in the article. I agree with your points. A genre isn't simply linguistic trait, but it has to be a stylistic one and the bands on the page do have that in common. Artists like <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soulfly.html" title="Soulfly">Soulfly</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepultura.html" title="Sepultura">Sepultura</a> certainly have Latin music influences. While it isn't as separate as <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropicalismo.html" title="Tropicalismo">Tropicalismo</a> is from <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">Jazz</a>, it is still a stylistic difference that allows for genre distinction.

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>Latin metal</i> might be a good way to describe the music that a few band play. <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_metal.html" title="Epic metal">Epic metal</a> was deleted, and epic metal is definitely more notable than latin metal. As of today, 36 articles link to <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_metal.html" title="Epic metal">epic metal</a>, and this is after the deletion, so there must've been more in the past.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I added a reference, a recent article from Variety.com about two film executives leaving the company. Variety is the newspaper of record for the U.S. film industry. But I checked the online archive at <a href="http://archive.scmp.com" class="external free" title="http://archive.scmp.com" rel="nofollow">http://archive.scmp.com</a> of stories from the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_China_Morning_Post_ed22.html" title="South China Morning Post">South China Morning Post</a>, an English-language newspaper published in Hong Kong, and couldn't find anything there about the company. The company belongs to actor and singer <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Lau_f171.html" title="Andy Lau">Andy Lau</a>. Perhaps media coverage of the business deals that Focus Group Holdings is involved with is more likely to mention the actor's name than the company's. Still, if the company handles the business interests of a rich and famous celebrity, then it probably does some notable things. The difficulty is in verifying that notability, particularly for editors in North American who don't speak Cantonese. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 01:52, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I added some films was released by the company since 1991 under the old name and some music albums since 2004. I feel this article at least deserve some time to grow.
