<p>Appears to be a long rant criticizing a specific website. An analysis of <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBaum%27s_World_2f93.html" title="EBaum's World">EBaum's World</a> indicates that this page was created specifically because of concerns that criticism was overwhelming the rest of the article and violating neutrality; i.e. it was a POV fork. Furthermore, this website simply isn't notable enough to deserve two separate pages.

<li><b>Delete</b> You could fill half the internet with complaints and rants about EBaum.

<li><b>Keep</b> Last Malthusian is correct. Unfortunately due to Ebaum's policies there's simply far more negative information available about eBaum's World than positive. The information in this article is accurate, but if the main article consists of over half information regarding the controversies, it will be considered a violation of NPOV. Better to link to the controversy section on the main article and have it all available here, while maintaining a balance in the main article. --71.137.147.161 22:46, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ridiculous. This was already argued over at the talk page for the main article. NPOV doesn't mean balancing the good and the bad. It's presenting all of the facts without resorting to opinion. Alwarren@ucsd.edu 01:22, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The fact that there is no positive information is clearly the fault of the subject and not the editors. 'NPOV' stands for Neutral Point Of View, not No Point Of View. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 02:17, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't understand why there's any objection to a merge. If it's neutral to have some kind of "balance" of information in the main article, fine. If it's neutral to have criticism predominate, fine. But this can and should all be done in the main article. It sounds from what I read above that this article was broken off precisely to <i>sidestep</i> reaching consensus on neutrality, by letting each of two sets of editors go their separate ways. <b>That's a POV fork.</b> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:49, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: While some of the sections are essentially fully written by me, they are accurate and sources are cited.

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b>: eBaumsworld is a widely controversial topic on the internet. Particularly on large internet media sites such as YTMND, SA, Newgrounds and even 4chan. The community of these websites and their forums have taken a general consensus of mild despisal of eBaum's practices since eBaums conducted their first DDoS attacks on SA and even mildly before. When the flash animation&#160;: <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/276616" class="external text" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/276616" rel="nofollow">eBaums world dot com</a> appeared on newgrounds on Nov. 6th 2005 the controversy really flew off. Much of the content being hosted on eBaums was seen as stolen and posted up by the forum members of eBaums, which was then considered by the consensus of eBaums as freely available and held a philosophy of a copyright free internet, where the content could be taken, profited from and used on any website in the internet. Particularly eBaums. This article is incredibly important to the understanding of how much eBaums is despised by a large portion of the internet population. To say that their despisal is inexistant is wholly untrue. This article is incredibly important whether it be seperate or merged with the original, since I hold a stance against eBaums I won't edit the controversies page, but I do however think that it's incredibly important that this page exists.--<a href="../../../m/o/f/User%7EMofomojo_6e0e.html" title="User:Mofomojo">Mofomojo</a> 10:17, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
