<li>I tagged it for speedy deletion as non-notable. I did so because the sources given in the article are not about this man. This first is mainly about his son, Rahm. The second is not a reliable source and is highly anti-semitic "He has been the Acting Deputy Chief, for North America, of The Mossad, Israeli Intelligence." and the 3rd mentions Benjamin, but the focus is again on his son, Rahm. As such, he fails WP:BIO, "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person".--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 19:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"American congressman Rahm Emanuel, is the son of a terrorist.… Rep. Rahm Emanuel, the Democrat congressman for the 5th District of Illinois in Chicago is the son of an Israeli terrorist. Rahm's father, Benjamin, was a member of the Irgun, the Zionist terrorist organization that coined a new word as they blew up hotels, train stations, and other buildings in Palestine in the 1930s and 40s. …Irgun, the army of his father, is short for Irgun Zvai Leumi, which supposedly means something like "National Military Organization" in Hebrew. As a matter of fact, the Irgun was simply a terrorist Zionist group that operated in Palestine from 1931 to 1948. They killed innocent Palestinians and British soldiers and blew up buildings."</dd>

<p><i>Concerning the above question of relevance</i>: The material from the blogs isn't in the article anymore because it was removed, in the past I had removed this material citing the same standards that were used to create this current version. I did this on 19:31, 10 January 2007 but in little over an hour they were reverted back in by <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">User:Mel Etitis</a> at 20:38, 10 January 2007. Mel Etitis also took me to task on my user-talk page for "deleting large swathes of text". As I had posted my objections to the article before the edit removing the blogged material was allowed to stand, that is why it is mentioned. As the previous revision by <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">User:Mel Etitis</a> cited the bloggers belief that Benjamin M. Emanuel “participated in the assasination of Swedish diplomat Folke Bernadotte in 1948” I included the above points. I also included quotes from the blog about 9/11 being done by Irgun (of whom the blog claimed that "After 1948 they became part of the new Israeli government") to show that this source was not only unreliable but also anti-Semitic and a promoter of the generally discounted conspiracy theory that it was the Jews who were behind 9/11. I was astonished that it was being argued continually that these are reliable sources and that quoting them in any manner was acceptable according to wiki-standards. As Mel Etitis was an early contributor to the article that included the blog statements (see page history at 10:33, 7 January 2007 and 10:29, 7 January 2007) I was worried that he would simply revert <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">User:Chick Bowen</a>'s edits away to restore the blogged material and accuse him as he has me on my talk page of having "some personal or political axe to grind with regard to the articles on this family". (See also his accusation above that I'm "protecting a politician against what he sees as negative facts. he shouldn't be allowed to get his way on this.") These comments were made because I removed the same blogged statement that Benjamin M. Emanuel "was a member of the Irgun, a radical Zionist paramilitary organization" on the page <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ari_Emanuel_2954.html" title="Ari Emanuel">Ari Emanuel</a> that he allowed in his edit of that page on 10:35, 7 January 2007 and his edit on 19:47, 9 January 2007 <b>where he himself inserted</b> onto the <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahm_Emanuel_a3f4.html" title="Rahm Emanuel">Rahm Emanuel</a> page the claim that "Benjamin M. Emanuel, was a member of the <a href="../../../i/r/g/Irgun.html" title="Irgun">Irgun</a>, a radical Zionist paramilitary organization". I find it troubling that he failed to disclose any of this when he posted his response on this page.--<a href="../../../w/o/w/User%7EWowaconia_eb5e.html" title="User:Wowaconia">Wowaconia</a> 10:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
