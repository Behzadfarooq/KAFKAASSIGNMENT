<p>Operation Plan 34A was a highly classified program created by the U.S. that covertly fired at the shores of North Vietnam trying to antagonize the North Vietnamese into attacking the patrol boats. Even though in the beginning this plan failed it eventually succeded because in the early mornings of August 2, 1964 the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Maddox_5418.html" title="USS Maddox">USS Maddox</a> was attacked by North Vietnamese patrol boats in the Golf of Tonkin. This attack allowed the U.S. military to inform Congress about the "unprovoked attack" and on August 7, 1964 Congress passed the Golf of Tonkin Resolution with a vote of 504-2. The resolution gave President <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Johnson_a119.html" title="Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> extraordinary power to act in Southeast Asia. This resolutin set the U.S. into the Vietnam War because seven months later two marine battalions land to defend <a href="../../../d/a/_/Da_Nang_aab1.html" title="Da Nang">Da Nang</a> airfield on March 8, 1965.</p>

<p>Murina cyclotis is widespread in Central and Southeast Asia. It is found in Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, as far north as northern Myanmar, south through Indochina, Vietnam, Malaysia and parts of Indonesia and the lesser Sunda islands. They're also found in the Philippine Islands on the islands of Biliran, Camiguin, Catanduanes, Luzon, Mindanao, Sibuyan, and Siqujor. (Bates and Harrison, 1997; Heaney, 2005; Lekagul and McNeely, 1988; Medway, 1983; Myers, Smith, and Lama, 2000; Wilson and Reeder, 1993)</p>

<p>Murina cyclotis occurs at elevations as low as 250 m in the foothills to 1,500 m in the montane forests. Round-eared tube-nosed bats are found primarily in the tropical forests of southeast Asia. Coastal areas inhabited by M. cyclotis are bordered by the South China Sea and Philippine Sea, which suggests reliance on humid regions. (Bates and Harrison, 1997; Heaney, 2005; Medway, 1983; Phillips, 1980)</p>

<p>Round-eared tube-nosed bats range in weight from 9 to 12 g, with total length between 80 and 89 mm. Only one wingspan measurement (229 mm) has been reported for this species. Females tend to be slightly larger than males. Round-eared tube-nosed bats are diagnosed by tubular nostrils and short, round ears. They have triangular tragi, which are long, narrow, and tapering to a point. The anterior braincase is ballooned and the upper lip possesses a protruding fringe of hairs. Murina cyclotis has small eyes which are closer to the ears than the nostrils. Two different color patterns have been noted. In one color variant, the dorsal fur is a reddish-brown, with the hairs increasing in lightness from the base to the tip; the ventral fur is grayish white, with a brownish tinge. In the other color variant, the dorsal fur is grayer, without the reddish tinge; the ventral fur is grayish white without any brownish tinge. This species has a semi-transparent wing membrane, relatively long thumbs, and a tail shorter than the length of its head and body. The feet are hairy, small, and the claws are relatively long and sharp.</p>
<p>Three subspecies of M. cyclotis have been identified. M. c. cyclotis is found from northeastern India to Vietnam, M. c. eileenae is in Sri Lanka and has slightly darker and duller fur, and M. c. peninsularis is found on the Malay Peninsula and is identified by a relatively wider anterior rostrum and more massive teeth.</p>
<p>No seasonal variation in morphology has been reported. (Corbet and Hill, 1992; Lekagul and McNeely, 1988; Medway, 1983; Myers, Smith, and Lama, 2000; Phillips, 1980)</p>

<p>There is little information reported for mating systems in M. cyclotis. (Phillips, 1980)</p>
<p>There is little information reported for general reproductive behavior in round-eared tube-nosed bats. Pregnant females in Pahang, Malay Peninsula were reported to carry two fetuses in the months of February and May. (Medway, 1983)</p>
<p>There is no information reported for parental investment in M. cyclotis. However, as most bats, females primarily care for the young, nursing them until they can fly.</p>

<p>Murina cyclotis individuals feed in open forest areas, and fly approximately 1.8 m above the ground. Their flight is slow but maneuverable. They roost in large dead and dry leaves of the cardamon plant. Several individuals often roost together on a single leaf or bunch of leaves, which serves to camouflage the bats. A closely related species Murina florium has been found roosting in enclosed plant-material nests and hanging nests of bird species, presumably to provide protection where other roosting options are not available. Another closely related species, Murina aurata, is thought to hibernate in trees during the winter. This suggests possible hibernation of M. cyclotis&gt;, but this is not known for certain. (Bates and Harrison, 1997; Kingston et al., 1999; Schulz, 1998)</p>

<p>Round-eared tube-nosed bats detect their environment through echolocation and minimally through the visual field, as their eyes are small and reduced. They are also sensitive to chemical cues. (Phillips, 1980)</p>
<p>These bats make use of echolocation to avoid obstacles and capture airborne prey. Calls are frequency-modulated (FM), with low intensity and short duration. The calls are at high frequency, starting at 152 to 180 kHz and sweeping down to an end frequency of 43 to 86 kHz. This large bandwidth allows these bats to accurately locate targets in the cluttered forests they inhabit. Furthermore, the use of an extremely high echolocation frequency may reduce the need for both visual and other auditory signals. (Bates and Harrison, 1997; Kingston et al., 1999; Schulz, 1998)</p>

<p>Round-eared tube-nosed bats eat insects in the damp forests they inhabit. A closely related species, M. florium (Flores tube-nosed bats) has been observed to eat in a manner possibly similar to M. cyclotis. While eating a moth, M. florium individuals were observed perching by both feet and thumb claws. They placed separated pieces of the insect into the uropatagium. After feeding on the edible parts, they released the waste to the ground below. This posture was also used by M. florium to ingest fecal matter (coprophagy). (Bates and Harrison, 1997; Bonaccorso, 1998)</p>

<p>The reddish-brown color of M. cyclotis makes it difficult for predators to detect as they roost among dead leaves.</p>
<p>There are no known predators of M. cyclotis, however the skulls of a closely related species, M. florium, have been recovered from owl pellets. Most bats are preyed on by owls as they fly and by snakes at roosts. (Bonaccorso, 1998; Phillips, 1980)</p>

<p>Round-eared tube-nosed bats do not appear to be endangered. They are one of the more abundant Murina species, but have not been studied extensively. Although individuals are relatively rare, the distribution is very broad. Because they haven't been studied well, it's possible that distinct regional populations have not yet been diagnosed. Their occupation of tropical forests in southeast Asia suggest that they will persist wherever forests persist. (Bates and Harrison, 1997; Phillips, 1980)</p>

<p>Syed Hussam Hussaini 16:09, 19 January 2007 (UTC) Hazrat Mashuq Safi was a notable sufi saint of 20th century. His full name was Syed Shah Hussain Al Hussaini. His parents were Syed Shah Badruddin Hussaini Ula and Syeda Peeran Bibi. Hazrat Mashuq Safi was the 19th Sajjada Nasheen of famous sufi saint Syedna Nasiruddin Sailani Badesha of Koppal. His father Syed Shah Badruddin Hussaini Ula was the 18th Sajjada Nasheen, he was also a scholar of arabic &amp; persian. Apart from spreading the spiritual teachings of his forefathers, he use to teach arabic &amp; persian in his madarsah. He was a revered person of the area.</p>
<p>Hazrat Mashuq Safi was inclined towards spirituality, right from his childhood. He lost his mother in his childhood. The initial way was guided by his father. He use to clean the Masjid regularly by sending away the appointed cleaners because he had heard from elders that by cleaning the house of Allah &amp; keeping it clean we can please Allah, but when he did not notice any changes after many days he went to his father and enquired about the same, to which his father replied that, "The heart of a person is the house of Allah &amp; to please Allah, one should clean oneselves heart". Hazrat Mashuq Safi asked, how do we clean our hearts. His father said, you have not got a master, first you get a master then the master will show you the way. Untill you surrender as a servent to the master you are unable to get the guidence. So Hazrat Mashuq Safi took his father as his master (Murshid). Hazrat Mashuq Safi's initial training was carried on under the guidance of his Murshid. When he attained fullfillmint of the cause, his father or Murshid gave him the "Khilafat". But Hazrat Mashuq Safi was not satisfied, he asked his father for more enlightment, for that his father told him to surrender himself to Hazrat Khwaja Gareeb Nawaz of Ajmer as we are chishtis, Ajmer is the headquater. So on his father's guidence Hazrat Mashuq Safi began to visit Dargah Hazrat Khwaja Gareeb Nawaz for 40 years during which he got blessings &amp; guidence from Khwaja Gareeb Nawaz &amp; also the title of "Sabz Shamlewale Syed Hussaini" (The green turbned Syed Hussaini). Finally he attained his goal of full enlightment by the grace of Khwaja Gareeb Nawaz. During those 40 years of visits to Ajmer shreef, he visited other shrines of sufi saints as well and got blessings and rewards from many other sufi saints. The most revered &amp; respected sufi saint of India at that time was Hazrat Sirajussalikin of Barelvi shreef, whose deciples were lakhs together &amp; spread across the world, his spiritual successor was Hazrat Syed Shah Fateh Mohammad Ajmeri, from whom Hazrat Mashuq Safi got the guidence &amp; all the spiritual responsibilities of Chishtiya order. Hence he was called Qutab-e-Zaman by Hazrat Shah Abdul Qayoom Niazi, who was a Khalifa of Hazrat Sirajussalikin, a great missionary, a revolutionary in the field of spiritualism and a sufi saint of great height. After Hazrat Syed Shah Fateh Mohammad Ajmeri passed away, his spiritual successor Hazart Mashuq Safi carried on the work of spreading peace through the teachings of Chishtiya order. By the hard work, patience, knowledge and guidence of Hazrat Shah Abdul Qayoom Niazi, khankha's were established in Chitvadgi Hospet, Bijapur and Tenalli apart from Koppal. Many persons thirsting for knowledge of Allah, who were in search of truth floked to these places and had their satisfaction. Though many miracles were observed from the person of Hazrat Mashuq Safi, he never gave any importance to them and always showed the way to Allah. His spiritual successor (Janasheen) was his only son Badrularifin Syed Shah Badruddin Hussaini Niazi, by whom the sayings of masters of sufism were easily interprated and spread.</p>

<p>Argath are a black metal band from Finland. Argath was formed in the year 1997 by Gath &amp; W. They recorded their first demo ("Impurity and chaos") in 1999. "Impurity and chaos" was not widely spread and its very hard to find nowdays. After that, they started rehearsing for the next demo ("REMORSE"), it was never released. Then came "Argath" in 2002, it was deccribed as probably their most brutal recording ever. And finally their 2 last demos "Towards the void" and "I invoke" were released in 2003. In the year 2005, Argath released their debut album: "Societatis Draconistrarum".</p>

<p>A Case In Point is a cartoon strip created by Rob Esmay. According to Esmay "</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's the Steven Wright of cartoons... very dry. I avoid, as much as possible, the flailing arms and bulgy eyes that tell you something is funny. I feel it's better to let the humor form in the mind of the reader. Basically they're funny pictures with funny titles."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rob Esmay was raised in Tacoma, Washington, and attended college in Santa Clara, California. Esmay cites his favorite artists as Thomas Nast, Toulouse-Lautrec, Daumier, Bruegel and Goya.</p>

<p><br />
<i>Hello, My Name is "..."</i> is a web-comic started by "J.Treece" of the Novacaine Lollipop forums (www.crisishour.com/forum/). It centers around one character who doesn't even know much about himself. He has a screw lodged in the left side of his skull, a red dotted line around his cranium, a bad buzz cut, a black eye, and a wallet with nothing in it but an unmarked credit card, and a buisness card that reads "Hello, my name is "...""</p>
<p>What happens from there? That's for the open list of artists to decide. The comic is illustrated and written by anyone who volunteers themselves. They stat by registering on the Novacaine Lollipop forums, and then post a page request on the right thread. The only rules for the artists are as follows:</p>
<p>"Rule #1. - You must ask to join in. You must be given a page by a mod or admin. It wouldn't be too smooth if you and someone else did the same page number having the story go into two different directions. So wait your turn.</p>
<p>Rule #2. - Don't try to end the story.</p>
<p>This is to keep it as fun an interactive as possible. Don't ask for page 5 and then kill off the characters, or have a cosmic being eat the planet they live on or something. Let's see how long this can live.</p>
<p>Rule #3. - No pinups (except on permission by an admin*)</p>
<p>To keep the story going and as entertaining as possible, No pinups should be used. There is a four panel minimum per page.</p>
<p>Rule #4. - You control the story.</p>
<p>The person chosen for a page is responsible for that pages content, and storyline. Please try to follow any story lines or plots created before your page. You may ask any member of the board to assist you in writing or drawing your page. At the same time they also have the right to accept or deny your offer. Please respect the other members on the board as well as the story we've all contributed to.</p>
<p>Rule #5. - Go nuts.</p>
<p>Push your imaginations to it's boundaries, and then a little further than that. Let's see the best of the best here. There are no restrictions on nudity, language, or mediums. Although the line between nudity and bad taste is obvious, so if you think something won't fly ask an admin. Things that won't fly with me are - Child Porn, Excessive sexual imagery, continuous bashing/abuse of genders, sexual preferences, and race."</p>
<p>AS it stands, pages are being reserved faster than they can be completed. The project promises to be lengthy, and will most likely satisfy the tastes of any web-comic reader.</p>

It's national sport is Cross-stitch. IT is a small island on the caspian sea. It's capital Faruchnia(Fa-roo-rh-nee-uh), is less than 1200 people. The nation(meaning the nation state) is 4532 people. There are an estimated 500 Farcuhs living outside Faruchistahn, 90% living some where on the caspian coast. 25 Faruchs attempted to enter canada recently on a derelict barge, only to be turned in a decree signed by Bill Graham(though actually delivered Rick Mercer). It has been denied both CIS membership and - as a continuing sore spot among Faruchs - membership in the UN. It's other primary political issues are the controversy the cultivation and distribution of drier lint.</p>

Alan Palmieri</p>
<p>On August 3, 2006 Alan Palmieri www.jeffersoncountytn.gov/index.cfm/m/index.cfm/m/43 won the Jefferson County, Tennessee www.jeffersoncountytn.gov/ General Election for County Mayor by defeating a 20 year incumbent. Prior to this political victory, he served as Mayor of Jefferson City, Tennessee www.jeffcitytn.com/ for five non consecutive terms. One term was for two terms and the other was for three. Never defeated for his bid for Mayor, Alan elected to step down and allow someone else to fill the office. “I believe in term limits. I don’t think a person can continue to represent the people at the level needed when they serve too long.” “Starting out wanting to help solve problems, if one servers too long they become part of the problem instead of a solution.” “It’s best to server – step down and re-enter if one wants to sincerely serve the people.” “Stay too long and one starts working for his or her self instead of the people.”</p>
<p>During his five terms as Mayor, Alan never proposed or supported a property tax increase or a utility rate increase. Even during difficult economic times his tenure as Mayor was noted for financial stability. Each time he left office he did so leaving the city in better financial condition than when he entered office.</p>
<p>Being approached by residents in the White Pine community, Alan led the charge to protect the property of county residents when neighboring municipality Morristown (Hamblen County) attempted to take residents homes and land for an industrial park. He proposed, and the city council of Jefferson City supported, his plan to annex the area protecting the residents from losing their homes and land. Due to the annexation move, Morristown changed their plans and the residents of White Pine were protected.</p>
<p>Within his first ninety days as Mayor of Jefferson County, Alan proposed a financial plan to County Commission that would eliminate the county’s 65 million dollar debt load, finance a 60 million dollar school building project, develop a new industrial park and build a needed county complex, and building a cash reserve for future projects without increasing property taxes. On January 16, 2007 County Commission failed to take action on the proposal, even so far as to discuss it. Still response from the community has been overwhelmingly in support of his plan.</p>
<p>Alan has a diverse background in the private sector – international as well as domestic operation, government and politics.
