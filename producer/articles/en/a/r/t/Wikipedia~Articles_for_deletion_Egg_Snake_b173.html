<li><b>STATEMENT:</b> The tradition of the Egg snake has been enjoyed and continued on many establishments on the west coast, including, but not limited to, the South Western Coast of British Columbia. The page Egg Snake is an over-due attempt to bring light to this lesser-known West Coast marine history. Many coastal American establishments from Northern California and Oregon, including my own, still serve the traditional Egg Snake on the menu. The area's thriving most from Egg Snake popularity again seem to be located on the South Western Coast of British Columbia.
<p>The Egg Snake is very much so a real and current standing piece of West Coast heritage. Although not well known, it is my intent through this page to educate marine history enthusiasts to some of the finer points of history on the West Coast. Noting that it is in-fact a relatively unknown piece of history, I failed to realize that Google is a reliable generator of credible sources and in the duty of determining fact from fiction. If this were the case, my very own restaurant from which I work daily (which has Egg Snake on the menu), would not exist according to Google.</p>
<p>My Goal is simple: To educate marine history enthusiasts to some of the finer points of history on the West Coast. I wish to know what verification is needed in order for the page Egg Snake to stand.

<li><b>Delete</b>. No sources. I doubt the historical tale, as very few 18th century merchant sailors could afford George Foreman grills.

<li><b>Statement</b> As it seems we are both concerned for the preservation of the discussion process, perhaps I should advise you that your comments regarding the page egg snake are themselves presumptious, accusations, and harrasment. It is outside of the boundries of this discussion as to YOUR opinion of how this page was created, and insulting to assume what my occupation is or that I have "no life". I removed your comment for these reasons, as you yourself obviously did not realize this. Please feel free to critisize this page and its content, but please leave any personal feelings or opinions aside, as they contaminate the discussion process. Having said that, I would like to state that one of the sources for your earlier comment was cited from pamplet distributed by a rural establishment for the means of promoting their zest for marine tradition. thank you (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlieandeddie_8c82.html" title="User:Charlieandeddie">Charlieandeddie</a> 04:32, 13 July 2006 (UTC))</li>

This page was created on a computer, and that should be satisfactory as to how this article was created. Once again I am stating that this article is not a hoax, and is a page identifying marine heritage. I would ask you to once again re-read what has been written, as other users have also commented on how you have failed to understand what is posted. Also, your open ended babbling has become tiresome, please refrain from it in the future, and let's remeber the purpose of this afd.

<li><b>Read the whole paragraph.</b> In response to the previous comment. You probably should have read the whole article before cracking off wise comments. The author clearly stated that the early egg snakes were molded from oriental cookware, not George Foreman grills. The modern version of the egg snake is molded using George Foreman grills or griddles with grease canals around the edges, not even necessarily George Foreman grills. I've been to many small diners on the coast of BC and enjoyed this breakfast food on many occasions. If anyone needs proof of their existence visit the area and enjoy one for yourself instead of poking holes in the poor author's article. Until now, I didn't know the full history of the egg snake (besides their naval affiliation). I found this article very educational. Once I saw it was considered for deletion, I had to make an account and side with the author.</li>
<li><b>Ichthyosaurs</b> The actual date that the full fossil was discovered is irrealevant; the name Ichthyosaurs is of Greek origin for the designation of fish lizard. regardless of the popularity of the actual animal fossil itself discovered in 1840, I'm willing to bet that the greek language would have remaind the same. And honestly, an egg snake looks nothing like the actual beast, indicating that it was merely a name and not a resemblance responsible for the term Ichthyosaurs.

<li><b>Great Breakfast</b> Last summer when I was on a cruise to Alaska, my cruise had an evening stop over in the quaint little city of Victoria. The following morning wanting to sample canadian culture I had breakfast in a local diner on a quiet corner. For breakfast I ate a local favourite called the egg snake. This was one of the most delicious dishes I had during the entire cruise. After returning to my home in Cheyenne I searched everywhere for this meal, unfortunately I was unable to find it. I am glad that a local has published this meal, and hope that he may add a recipe, so others may try this fantasic dish. Anyone who says this article is a hoax should try to leave their computer for more then 5 minutes and live a real life. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDotheymakeboth_845c.html" title="User:Dotheymakeboth">Dotheymakeboth</a> 03:18, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Yes, But</b> I was both surprised and dismayed to find this article on the "Articles for Deletion" page. Although the the cooking and preparation of Egg Snakes has dipped into one of their frequent bouts of obscurity, as has occurred throughout their history, an entry on this sub-regional cuisine is long overdue. It is true, the egg snake is not widely known outside of the southern Gulf Islands of Canada. However, I am well acquainted with them. Though I currently reside in my Ontario hometown, I lived on <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Spring_Island_3a7e.html" title="Salt Spring Island">Salt Spring Island</a> from 1982 to 1994, and egg snakes were served at a couple of greasy diners in Ganges until at least the late 80s. In the mid-80s a close friend of mine, who also worked as a freelance reporter for the monthly Ganges newsletter, conducted some research into the egg snake's heritage and shared his detailed research with me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus I feel some of the confusion over this entry on egg snakes is due to the less-than-steller writing of this article's authors. Certainly I am not aware of any connection to the USS Spitfire, nor the practice of calling egg snakes "Ichthyosaurs". I suspect that was more popular in selected villages of the Oregon coast, if at all. However egg snakes had spread from their obscure beginnings in the California merchant fleet to US Navy ships by 1850. My friend shared with me (briefly) the journals of one Lt. David "Jesus" Cooke, who sailed with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_Matthew_Perry_ca9e.html" title="Commodore Matthew Perry">Commodore Matthew Perry</a>'s expedition to open Japanese trade in 1852-53. Since Cooke had grown up with a pioneer family in coastal California, he was the only officer on the flagship who appreciated the egg snakes served by the stewards every Friday. Furthermore, once the expedition anchored near <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edo.html" title="Edo">Edo</a> (modern-day <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>), several Japanese traders were "inspired" by the administration to come over and offer the Americans generic trade quotes. In doing so, they recognized the smell and sight of the American egg snakes, and proceeded to trade ideas on egg snake cooking with the American stewards. This is the first known contact between Asian and American styles of egg snakes. Sadly, the journal of Lt. Cooke, held by a private collector in Miami, were lost when <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Andrew_b913.html" title="Hurricane Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a> struck South <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.</p>
<p>Since then the styles of American and Asian egg snakes fused together during years of tentative American and Japanese trade until the Second World War, when local authorities in the Pacific Northwest suppressed the egg snake as an unpatriotic dish (an earlier version of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_fries.html" title="Freedom fries">freedom fries</a>.) The Canadian Gulf Islands, however, remained fairly isolated from such influences, despite the anti-Japanese internment across the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strait_of_Georgia_b2a8.html" title="Strait of Georgia">Strait of Georgia</a> in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and beyond. Thus (my friend concluded) the Southern Gulf Islands became the last bastion of the egg snake on the West Coast, occasionally learned by transient residents (as we called everyone who lived there for less than 10 years) and spread across the country.</p>
<p>I hope this clears up some of the record, though I am sorry I could not provide any real sources. Suffice to say I have tasted it and I miss the egg snake very much! --<a href="../../../b/e/w/User%7EBewdley_685b.html" title="User:Bewdley">Bewdley</a>23:25, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Out East</b> I don't understand why this article is being considered for deletion. Egg snake is very popular in southern New Brunswick. My grandmother used to prepare egg snake for us using an iron wood stove. She had a new-fangled electric stove but preferred the wood stove. She continued cutting and fetching her own firewood until her late 70's when we had to resort to having her committed. She has dementia now and no longer prepares egg snake. Every once in awhile one of the family will bring egg snake in for her but it is not the same without the wood stove.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I recently visited Pender Island, BC (I stayed at the luxurious Poet's Cove Resort) and was surprised to find that egg snake was on the menu on the pool deck restaurant. You can actually order egg snake from the hot tub and it will be delivered to the swim-up bar. Sweet. It is not cooked on a wood stove but it is still OK. While in BC I learned that the Yag (sort of like a Sasquatch) is very partial to egg snakes so caution is to be exercised at all times. Yags don't usually go near pools or hottubs because their reflection in the water frightens them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anyway, only a crazy person would suggest that this article should be deleted. I recommend that you busy-bodies visit either southern New Brunswick or Poet's Cove before you snap to judgement. Let he who is without sin cast the first egg snake and egg snakes who live in glass houses should be cooked with wood stoves.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax and patent nonsense. Nearly every statement above (most of them, one notices, unsigned) in defense of this sad excuse for an article is a prime example of patent nonsense. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 04:29, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
