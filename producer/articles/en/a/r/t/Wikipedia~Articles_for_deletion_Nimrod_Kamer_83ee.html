<li><b>Strong keep</b>: this guy has had plenty of genuine, mainstream media coverage...the fact that he appears to be editing his own article presents special issues for Wikipedia to grapple with, but it is not reason for deleting the article altogether.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Clearly many users of the Hebrew wiki don't think he's notable, considering his article was deleted from it. Ironically, though, this produced an article in <a href="../../../m/a/27/Ma%27ariv.html" title="Ma'ariv">Ma'ariv</a>, a mainstream Israeli newspaper, discussing Kamer's wikipedia crusade and defeat. And that just adds to his notability, along with the articles in <a href="../../../h/a/27/Ha%27aretz.html" title="Ha'aretz">Ha'aretz</a> and elsewhere on his Sudoku program. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 13:53, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You put that remark after my comment. Am I a sockpuppet? I have over 1500 edits and think this article should be <b>kept</b>. Deal with it. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 14:06, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><i>"Deal with it"</i>? Excuse me, mr. Babajobu, but it seems to me that you are unaware of this guys' true nature. you come to contradict me and others who have live in Israel all their lives <b>and</b> who know who is important in the Israeli calture and who is a no-good. So this guy had a side article in a main paper in Israel, the almost-most small country in the world. So he's directed a few unknown Israeli movies.. So what? This is an encyclopedia, and only the people who are of some kind of <b>real</b> influence should be in it. Something that seems to be getting out of this English Wiki's control. Soon you'll be editing the history of unknown starving people on Africa. Like I said below, If he's in, I'm in, and probably you can get in too. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonidebest_a395.html" title="User:Yonidebest">Yonidebest</a> 20:08, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really feel that this VfD is a mistake. All these folks from the Hebrew Vikipedia have descended on this Vfd to oust the Nimrod Kamer article. I don't know why they dislike him so strongly, but clearly they think he is a nogoodnik. The Hebrew wikipedia must have different standards for notability than the English wikipedia. Somebody who has been profiled in multiple mainstream media newspapers and who is the world's very first professional Sudoku teacher should really be a shoo-in for a Wikipedia entry. It looks like Kamer is going to lose this VfD, and I think that's a shame and a mistake. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 08:00, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> As stated he's not significant and its a vanity article. In fact its a somewhat borderline case, but I think especially the fact that he's unrelated to any larger context in a meaningful way is important.

Likewise one the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudoku.html" title="Sudoku">sudoku</a> page, if the editors there think its warranted. 149.217.50.205 10:48, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
