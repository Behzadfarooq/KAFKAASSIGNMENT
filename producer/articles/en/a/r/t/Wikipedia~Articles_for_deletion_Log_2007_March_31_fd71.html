<li><b>Comment</b>. In light of Lambiam's points below, I guess it might be reasonable to keep the article (assuming it's completely rewritten), or recreate it with new text after its deletion. But is "slave trade and nautical language theory of creole genesis" the term encountered for this theory in the literature? The name of the article should be the most common term for the theory, I think. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 22:48, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that there are several less felicitous aspects about the article. But these can be addressed by the usual wiki process of gradual improvements. I don't know of a "canonical name" for the theory, but "slave trade" and "nautical language" are certainly key elements; see for example <a href="http://www-gewi.uni-graz.at/ling/lvu/ss2002/halwachs/pidgins/02-pidcreo-origins-1.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www-gewi.uni-graz.at/ling/lvu/ss2002/halwachs/pidgins/02-pidcreo-origins-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">this slide presentation</a> giving an overview of the diverse theories of the origin of pidgins and creoles. In any case, names can be improved by renaming the article, infractions on the MoS can be dealt with by wikification, and so on. None of this requires article deletion. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:02, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This theory and several others (for example the monogenesis theory) are quite well-known and notable among scholars of creole languages, even though most (but definitely not all) have relinquished these in favour of Bickerton's theory (see <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syntactic_similarities_of_creoles.html" title="Syntactic similarities of creoles">Syntactic similarities of creoles</a>). I have even heard a lecture in which it was argued (without much evidence) that the nautical lingua franca acquired during the transport was Portuguese-based, which supposedly explained the large number of Portuguese loan words in the lexica of Carribean creoles. I don't have access to a library and so I can't check or prove this, but I'm fairly certain that these theories are discussed in several of the references given in the article. The argument for deletion that we already have articles on possibly related, but clearly <i>different</i> theories does not wash with me. <i>Possible</i> copyvio is also a dubious argument. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:42, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Why would this be original research? It is an important linguistic topic, and the article is obviously a review of research and publications by others, and clearly attributes the views and hypotheses expressed to the scholarly publications listed in the bibliography.

<li>That linguists have published and debated extensively on the issue of the origin of Creole languages shows that it is an important topic. The reason that there are no articles linking to this could be, um, perhaps that the article is brand new, written by a complete Wikipedia newbie and has a cumbersome title. As for the issue of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">synthesis</a>, well, please tell me in what way this text comes up with something new beyond summarizing the cited publications.

<p>I am afraid you don’t what you are talking about and whom you are talking about. Prof Chen finished physics PhD courses in the sophomore year. This is a fact documented in Chinese news. He is a genius of China. If he were born in the states he may have won a Nobel Prize by now. Your are right that all professors are writing teaching and speaking, but can you tell the difference? Do you know anything about his areas of research, term structure modeling. Term structure model is the cornerstone of modern finance. Many people work on it but few succeed. Are you familiar with other big names mentioned in that bio, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, Duffie, Hull&amp;White, Heath-Jarrow-Moton, Longtaff-Scwartz? Tell you what, they were all nominated for Nobel Prize in Economic Science. If you are not sure, verify it with someone having a PhD in economics or finance.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Qynrh (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Qynrh_ffec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Qynrh">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Let me get the facts straight. The references of the entry <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lin_Chen_436f.html" title="Lin Chen">Lin Chen</a> consist of five items. The first two are Prof Chen’s publications. You can consider them not independent, even not reliable. How about the other three? They are written by renowned scholars in the field. Are what they said reliable, independent and verifiable? Have you taken a look at them? Let me tell you what they are about. The third item devotes a chapter to discuss Chen model; the fourth item, a review article, devotes a section to discuss Chen model. The last one, another literature survey covering the history of modern finance, lists Prof. Chen among the leading contributors to the theory of finance. The aforementioned facts should qualify Lin Chen all the criteria, not just one or two, listed in <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Qynrh (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Qynrh_ffec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Qynrh">contribs</a>) 18:05, 3 April 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

Timbaland produces stuff on his own, as does Danja, and Danja is Timbaland's protégé.

<li>Are the things in this article collaborative works by the two? If so, there might be some added value from it, if it were re-titled something like "List of collaborations between Timbaland and Danja". If it's just a list of things that were done by one or the other, though, I agree that it doesn't serve much purpose. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 17:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I amended the article many times which is noticeable through the versions’ history. The article is still in the editing process. The page was built with reference to the articles published in the Wikipedia. We made sure that the format of the page is consistent with the way the pages are constructed and written in the Wikipedia. I think that this organization is essential for posting on Wikipedia. I would like to re-assure that we are still working on modifying it until it meets the Wikipedia policy. I don’t think that having too many external links currently on our page should cause a problem since there exists many articles on Wikipedia that contain many external links such as Aramco, Aurther Andersen and others. Those articles were not deleted or nominated for deletion. We preferred to mention the whole organization companies and give them the links from this page than create for each company a page on the wikipedia. We will also mention third party links that talk about TAGorg. If, for any other reason, you think that our article is still nominated for deletion; please assist us by providing the methods that we can use to develop the content better to certify your needs. TAGorg is one of the largest global organizations. It is very essential to have it published on the Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I suggest either a) deleting this article as a non-notable neologism per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#OR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#OR</a>, or b) redirecting without merge to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_cinema.html" title="Interactive cinema">interactive cinema</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_movie.html" title="Interactive movie">interactive movie</a> until an editor writes a sourced article that accurately reflects the term's current usage. --<a href="../../../m/u/c/User%7EMuchness_6152.html" title="User:Muchness">Muchness</a> 22:20, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have amended the article. I have removed any reference to proponants of the interactive film term. I thought by including references to the proponants that I was "attributing reliable sources". I do not think that the term "Interactive film should be removed from wikipedia. As you can see there is already a "category" called Interactive film <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EInteractive_film_40b1.html" title="Category:Interactive film">Category:Interactive film</a>, which, infact, categorizes the term <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_cinema.html" title="Interactive cinema">interactive cinema</a>. If anyone has views on what the definition for interactive film actually is then I suggest they contribute to the article. But I think it would be a serious mistake to erase the term from wikipedia. Anyone who doubts the term "interactive film" as I have defined it should maybe check this link, and the examples it provides: <a href="http://www.interactive-film.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.interactive-film.com/" rel="nofollow">2007 Links to Online Interactive Films and Movies</a> Most, if not all, of the examples supplied here fit into my definition of Interactive Film. Once again: I think I would be a gross miscalculation to omit the phrase from wikipedia. Neillodwyer 15:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>It is quite shortsighted to suggest that the term 'interactive film' is not in use and/or not suitable for inclusion in this wiki. I am the owner of an interactive film (shot on 35 mm FILM) which has 85 different permutations and was created with a $2 million budget. What should I call the final product, if not an 'interactive film'?</p>

<p>I have to say I am surprised at your ineptitude and inability to grasp this, that's right, NEW concept. It is not a neologism, it is a development a very real and quickly expanding sector, particularly in Canada, the UK &amp; Ireland. I dare say that you have not even bothered to reference the examples I have provided you with.</p>
<p>I am hesitant to merge the article with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_video.html" title="Interactive video">interactive video</a> because the article is comprised of boring, technical jargon and relates specifically to some format of laser disk, a technology which is now almost obsolete (interactive films run on the internet). Also, it refers specifically to video gaming. An interactive film is not a video game (NOT computer generated graphics). It is a film with multiple outcomes/possabilities, with which the viewer must interact. Again the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_cinema.html" title="Interactive cinema">Interactive cinema</a> article is also written with a specific leaning towards video gaming, although is closer to the spirit of what i am trying to express. Interactive film, IS NOT video gaming. It is, as one of you has put it "the sum of its parts", films that are interactive.</p>
<p>I am new to Wikipedia, so I am unfamiliar with your agreed upon codes of writing articles and referencing existing work. However, I am trying to satisfy them. I would encourage you to help me with the article rather than writing it off as noelogism and Original Research <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>. Also, in response to those of you who think it is weak, I feel that the article is stronger than much of what is already up there on wikipedia, and particularly some of the articles you are suggesting that I merge my own with.</p>
<p>Interactive film is a very real field of work, employing numerous people world wide. Please refer to the examples I have provided you with before writing your next response.</p>

<p>Non-notable Czech art critic. She wrote few essays, section of one book, manages a small art gallery and started her second PhD. No other information could be found. Text possibly written by her (user Barbara safarova), without care about diacritics or the correct letter case.

<dd><b>Neutral</b> - I just stumbled into this because it was on another person's talk page. I have never heard of Katrina Ko. However, I think wikipedia should be more inclusive than to delete things willy nilly. Furthermore, someone put some effort into writing it. Of note might be that this person is Canadian and there aren't that many Canadian porn stars. If there are, how many are Chinese Canadian? I presume that the initial author is in support because otherwise he would have never written about it. In theory, I am for Support because of my inclusion philosophy but in practice I don't care.

<p>This article entry violates several Wikipedia guidelines involved autobiographies and notability.</p>
<p>1. To be sure that David Jones wrote this page, you'd only have to look at the page history and his Wikipedia user page. He makes no effort to hide the fact that he is the creator of his own Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>2. He commonly goes by "Choronzon Club" or variants on the Internet. This can be verified by Googling and viewing his MySpace page: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/choronzon_club" class="external free" title="http://www.myspace.com/choronzon_club" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/choronzon_club</a></p>
<p>3. He seems to fancy these alleged "criticisms" in order to achieve some sort of Crowleyesque notoriety. This can be verified on his MySpace page, where he posts a link to said "Black Lodge" PDF.</p>
<p>4. His citations in other Wikipedia articles, such as on the OTO page were added by him!</p>
<p>5. Note the guideline listed on the Wikipedia page creation header: "Do not write articles about yourself, your company, or your best friend."</p>
<p>6. Please review <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest</a>, specifically sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.8, and 2.2.

<li><b>Hindutva propaganda:</b> I submit this article for consideration for deletion given that this flies in the face of <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a>,<a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>,<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The highly prerogative title of the page makes it obvious that page is primarily meant to be an attack page. <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> is described by its proponents to be a Hindu revivalist movement, it is has been often derided by its opponents to be an extreme right wing ideology. Whatever may be one's opinion about Hindutva, i believe terms like Hindutva propaganda are personal opinions and the title hardly conforms to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Much of the article consists of cherry picked quotes from two Papers by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Witzel_2199.html" title="Michael Witzel">Michael Witzel</a> and Nanda &amp; Sokal. Witzel is a Sanskrit scholar, which hardly makes him an authoritarian voice to pass judgements on Indian political ideologies. Mr.Witzel is also considered to be controversial for his supposed anti-Indian/anti-Hindu bias <a href="http://www.india-forum.com/articles/55/1/Harvard-professor-launches-anti-Hindu-Crusade" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.india-forum.com/articles/55/1/Harvard-professor-launches-anti-Hindu-Crusade" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. It is basically like writing an article on Republican ideology sourced from Noam Chomsky artciles. Undue weightage is given to Witzel and Nanda's opinions on Hindutva.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whats more, on the lines of Hindutva propaganda we donot have Redneck propaganda,Islamist propaganda,Christian propaganda,Marxist propaganda. Also the article ends up making wild allegations like: <i>during the 1930s, the Hindutva movement was influenced by Nazi mysticism, and pseudoscientific theories of racial supremacism. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader M. S. Golwalkar in 1939 he wrote that "Germany has shocked the world by purging the country of the semitic race of the Jews, a good lesson for us in Hindusthan to learn and profit by".[2].</i></p>
<p>This serious allegation against a major Indian ideology is based on untracable reference (# ^ Ruthven (2007:10ff.) ) by an obscure Scholar whose interest/expertise is unclear. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva_propaganda#History" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva_propaganda#History" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>.</p>
<p>Also the main contributor to this artilce <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> had added a statement (since revised):</p>
<p><i>Following the assassination of Gandhi by a member of the RSS in 1948, Hindu extremism was discredited in Indian society for some decades.</i></p>
<p>Its should be noted that <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathuram_Godse_b92c.html" title="Nathuram Godse">Nathuram Godse</a> (Gandhi's assasin) was NOT a member of RSS at the time and RSS was absolved by the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_India_8593.html" title="Supreme Court of India">Supreme Court of India</a> of any hand in Gandhi's assasination. Addition of content like this by Users like <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> is shocking. RSS in past has not hesitated to sue anybody accusing it of hand in Gandhi assasination. Such irresponsible behaviour puts Wikipedia in a position where it can be sued.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that admin <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> who has created this article, has also sprotected it. Isnt this unfair use of admin powers uncalled for, especially when there has been no obivous trolling on the article... Given the condescending tone of this article towards its subject, this article falls squarely in the 'attack page' category. <b><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAMbroodEY_dc79.html" title="User:AMbroodEY"><font color="saffron">Amey Aryan DaBrood</font></a></b><sup><b><a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAMbroodEY_458b.html" title="User talk:AMbroodEY"><font color="red">©</font></a></b></sup> 20:07, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>any article will rely on a "bunch of authors". The point is, these are authors published in mainstream studies on nationalism and pseudoarchaeology. As always, if you can find similar publications that <i>object</i> to the opinions presented so far, you can <i>add them</i>. The problem is that the case is really too obvious to contest, no scholar in their right mind would deny that fringe science is used for political propaganda here. Find us a criticism of the allegations by a neutral third party, preferably peer-reviewed and not published by the Theosophical Society, and we'll be able to document a controversy. So far, for lack of scholarly objection, we are just documenting a straightforward case. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 10:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Unless you can document that the BJP has been using the Indus script as a tool to get votes, there is absolutely no connection. Rather the synthesis of various unrel,ated thing, Theosophy, Vivekananda, various Indian authors, and conflating them to the BJP/VHP/RSS is obvious original research and implausible. Hindutva "propaganda" is more along the lines of "Muslims will be a majority in India in 3000C.E." or something like that, not the Indus script is Vedic post-Classical Sanskrit.<b><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman"><font color="purple">Baka</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman"><font color="red">man</font></a></b> 16:25, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. There should be a article to outline every mix of rightwing (twisting of) religion and politics. Their use of propaganda to try to capture peoples minds, from the (pseudo) christian politics of George W. Bush to lure in evangelical christians, to the extreme in other situations, such as the luring of indians of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">hindu</a> faith into anti-minority movements. Hindutva or christutva or whateverva are serious subjects that deserve their own articles as they are real and organized movements that need to be noted.

<p>Muck that a small group of people throw at each other cannot be used to paint entire populations with the brush dipped in the same muck. For all the hell that is being raised on wikipedia, the fact remains that 99.99%(I daresay) of practicing Hindus(that includes priests and sanskrit scholars) dont even know that a controversy of this nature <i>even exists</i> and are as oblivious to such names as Witzel and Sokal or whoever as they are about Frawley and Kak. 99.99% of them are even unaware that something called AIT was <i>even proposed</i> and the same can be said of their awareness of <i>OIT</i>. So in the absence of an audience willing to listen, branding a POV as 'propaganda' is far fetched. This issue if anything, is purely one that exists and is known only to people 'in the know' and should only be presented as such.</p>
<p>Just because all groups involved in this issue accuse each other of 'propaganda' doesnt mean we should have articles on their insinuations and counter insinuations. This is an article on such a POV and reads(as it was designed) as a POV fork. Just as having an article on, say, "Witzel's propaganda" is not right, having one on what Witzel characterises as "Hindu/tva's" propaganda is just not right. It is one thing to write articles by citing Witzel's(or Sokal's) <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a> and entirely another to write one by citing his gripe/angst/grievance/lamentations. In other words, to advance something like</p>
<p><i>any traditional Hindu idea or practice, however obscure and irrational it might have been through its history, gets the honoric of "science" if it bears any resemblance at all, however remote, to an idea that is valued (even for the wrong reasons) in the West.[2]</i></p>
<p>I hope that, Sokal in his book, has</p>
<p>a) Established with notable and verifiable sources that there is indeed such a practice on the Hindu/tvavadi's parts to [....however obscure and irrational it might have been through its history, gets the honoric of "science"....] b) That this kind of claiming scientific sanction for their rituals etc., is not an isolated case and that it is more often than not, the rule and not the exception. c) That this pattern is found in an overwhelming percentage of Hindu/tvavadis.</p>
<p>If on the other hand, Sokal has only studied the habits of a handful of his adversaries(like say, Kak) for his 'sample size', then it is fair to say that his results are falsifiable. One of the reasons is also because he is supposing his sample size to be the true representatives of Hindu/tvavadis. Truth to say, there is no single person anywhere in the world who can claim that. Arya Samaj for all the currency it holds in these matters, is virtually a non entity in entire southern India and in several parts of the rest of India. Vivekananda fame stems not because of his opposition of AIT but simply as an 'elightened being'/saint and as Sri Ramakrishna's student. Infact, I daresay, even adherents of the handful of Vivekananda missions across India are not aware that he even had something to say about AIT. It will be news to them as will AIT/AMT/OIT itself.</p>
<p>Propaganda is what Hitler did during World War II. His theories, that covered the entire gamut of p-p-p and much more was certainly propaganda, in that, it was concocted for consumption of a public that would readily and happily gulp it down and ask for more. Propaganda was what <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periyar.html" title="Periyar">periyar</a> did with his visceral hate campaign against brahmins. In other words, there is an active propagandiser and a proactive propagand<i>ee</i>.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> I haven't read the article yet, but I certainly have read some benighted trash produced by Hindutva luminaries, among them Subhash Kak, B. B. Lal (once a great archaeologist, who alas, in his late retirement, parted company with rigor), and N. S. Rajaram. There is a latter-day cottage industry out there producing unmitigated cultural grandiosity in the name science. Readers need to be warned of that. Perhaps the name of the article could be changed to "Hindutva Pseudoscience" or something similar, but its usefulness is not in doubt. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 04:47, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The only useful point that this article makes is that mainstream scholarship dismisses the claims made by Frawley, Kak et al. This point has already been made on several related articles <i>ad nauseum</i>.</dd>
<dd>Simply stating 'matter of factly' and dispassionately that 'mainstream scholarship' dismisses that of Kak et al., is 'warning enough'. This article, apart from making the said point, goes ahead and includes quotes by Witzel, Sokal etc., in a bid to underline and emphasise the contempt that that 'mainstream scholars' have not just for the opponent's 'scholarship' but <i>also</i> for the <u><i>opponent</i></u>. This, it does by cherry picking and quoting verbatim what is simply <i>ad hominem</i> cruft. As a student of the subject, I am only interested in the subject and not the <i>ad hominem</i> exchange of fire that takes place between people. An encyclopedia is simply not the place for such cruft.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Simply make the point of what the issue is, who holds what view of the issue and whose view has 'scholarly sanction' and whose does NOT and leave it at that. Readers are intelligent enough to read everything and make up their mind. We are here only to present the facts and not to engineer opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also once all views have been stated, there is no need to keep updating these articles with the latest scores everytime Witzel and Rajaram exchange fire. Newspapers and magazines and books and blogs will keep those scores for us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And most importantly, characterising the views of a Kak and Rajaram as being the views of 'Hindutva/vadis' is a fantastic case of generalising to suit conveniences. Hindutva/vadi itself is a term that has no definition in black and white. It was coined by somebody who himself is not seen as representative of anything or anybody, leave alone Hindus. If Hindutva is defined simply as 'being Hindu' then I am a 'hindutvavadi'(sic). Needless to say, I dont see Kak or Savarkar or anybody as representatives of my faith. Not by any stretch of imagination. Nor do an overwhelming majority of hundreds of millions of other Hindus. Hindus have no high command like the pope or the catholic church. So ascribing to all Hindus, a view of someone that not even 1% of Hindus have even heard about, is simply nonsense.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Coz, truth be told, for all the zillion hours of editing and cpediting and 'POV fighting' that editors of these articles have put in, all these articles read as confused pieces with hardly any value for the dispassionate reader. Many of these articles have derailed so badly that it makes almost no sense to somebody who has no clue of the history of edit warring that has gone in to put the article together. In other words, believe me, these articles make no sense to anybody except the dabs and the Bakas. The very purpose of wikipedia as an encyclopedia is being defeated and compromised by both parties insisting on adding every ad hominem exchange of fire that takes place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think its high time we all get together at the village pump and hammer out a policy to explicitly deal with 'controversial' articles. The policy in a nutshell should read something like <b>"Keep the facts in, keep the commentary(also read as <i>'ad hominem' cruft</i>) out".</b> <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarvagnya_de49.html" title="User talk:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 05:44, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't disagree with some of the things you say. However, "Hindutva" is not the same thing as "being Hindu." Nor is it "Hindu nationalism." Although the word has supposedly been around since the 1920s, it is political word, linked very much to the resurgence of the BJP in India in the 1990s. In the 1960s if you had asked someone what the word meant, you would have likely elicited derisive laughter, not because of the political implications of the word which no one knew then, but because the word 'Hindutva" is a portmanteau of a Persian/Urdu word "Hindu" and the Sanskrit "tatva," which only a shabby scholar (like Savarkar) could have put together. Hindutva scholarship has not only continued this tradition of combining implausibles, and created fantastic nonsense (like the Vedic Aryans solving quadratic equations in 5000 BCE), but has also aggressively insinuated itself into school curricula and so forth. This last issue is worrisome. I think we need an article that keeps tabs on the mischief Savarkar's intellectual descendants are wreaking upon us. I am sure the article can say at the outset (if it doesn't already) that "Hindutva" is a political word and is not the same thing as "Hindu" etc. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 08:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>....which only a shabby scholar (like Savarkar)...</i> - here lies the problem. It shouldnt be of any concern to the editor or the reader of an encyclopedia whether somebody is a 'shabby' scholar or a 'great' scholar. All that <i>should</i> matter is the facts. Leave the commentary out. Also if 'Hindutva' itself has no fixed meaning and depends heavily on the context and/or whose mouth it is coming from, how can terms like 'Hindutva propaganda', 'Hindutva p-p-p' or derivatives like 'Hindutvavadi' etc., have any meaning?</dd>
<dd><i>...Hindutva scholarship has not only continued this tradition of combining implausibles, and created fantastic nonsense (like the Vedic Aryans solving quadratic equations in 5000 BCE)...</i></dd>
<dd>'Hindutva <i>scholarship</i> now! Even if we were to assume that Savarkar was the high priest of Hindutva, how did you conclude that Kak and Frawley, for example, are carrying on from where Savarkar left off? It is not like say, Karunanidhi carrying on Periyar's work(that is a case where Periyar was the high priest and annadurai, karunanidhi et al form the unbroken <i>shishya parampara</i>). Kak and Frawley for heaven's sake were not even born when Savarkar was around! If Kak says something, ascribe it to Kak and nobody else. If Frawley says something, ascribe it to Frawley and no one else. If supporters of Kak's views want space for it on wikipedia, start an article for say, each of Kak's books where he has presented his views and present them <i>there</i>. Same holds for Frawley. Same holds for Rajaram. And in the AIT article, put all these articles in the ==See also== and also a SS prose under ==Criticism of AIT==. Now if you ask why Kak, who in your view is a quack should be given space in any of these articles, it is simply because he is a 'notable' critic of the AIT and associated theories. And how did I accord the status of a 'notable critic' to Kak, you may ask. I accorded the status because 'scholars' like Witzel have 'dignified' what <i>you</i> dismiss as drivel with responses. Witzel and co have unwittingly given Kak and co the 'notability' required for a wikipedia mention by choosing to respond! every bum has an opinion but then not every bum's opinion gets the audience and critical analysis of experts! go figure.</dd>
<dd>And btw, why should any claim that vedic aryans or their chinese or egyptian contemporaries or anyone for that matter solve quadratic equations be <i>fantastic nonsense</i>? If <i>homo sapiens</i> of modern day can solve quadratic equations, I dont see any reason why <i>homo sapiens</i> of 5000 years ago could not have. The science of logic and probability tells me not to dismiss the <i>possibility</i> as <i>fantastic nonsense</i> or even nonsense. Yes at the same time, do I <i>believe</i> that they did? <b>No</b>. Not until I see some proof. Do I believe that it might/could have been possible? <b>Yes</b>(I dont see any reason why <i>not</i>). So, for purposes of an encyclopedia we would have to leave commentary like <i>fantastic nonsense</i> out of the picture and simply state the facts. The facts in this case should read something like - "A claim has been made by so and so... that homo sapiens of 5000 years ago could solve quadratic equations. However, in the absence of any proof to support the claim (or because the proof provided in support of the claim do not measure up to scientific rigor), the claim has been dismissed by the scientific community at large." <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarvagnya_de49.html" title="User talk:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 10:58, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is fantastic nonsense because the notion of negative numbers (a <i>sine qua non</i> for a general solution of a quadratic) didn't exist anywhere until the first millennium CE, and because special cases of quadratics like: <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − 9 = 0</span> are not called "quadratics," but simply "square roots."

<li><b>Few comments</b> Without carefully reading the article, I have come to couple of conclusions. Some of the deletionists in this nom have made valid points though others have let their emotions totally influence their decision. These are the few points I would like to address:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The title <i>Hindutva propaganda</i> almost implies the entire Hindutva movement in based on propaganda. Regardless of whether it is or not, I ask those who voted keep to consider a more neutral title at least such as <i>Propaganda/Pseudoscience in Hindutva</i> Just like with every ideaology, there are moderates and extremes. Saying propaganda is central to a former ruling party in India is quite harsh, no matter who you are.</li>
<li>If this article is kept, it will allow the creation of other "XYZ propaganda" articles. Possible which may be created is Indophobic propaganda, [[Islamofascist in opposition to this one. And here is something interesting. What does everyone here think of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_propaganda.html" title="Nazi propaganda">Nazi propaganda</a> article? Does it suffer the same problems of <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>? I doubt anyone here approves of Nazism here but the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy states all views have to be represented equally, no matter how evil they are. The French Enlightenment philosopher <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltaire.html" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> once said, &lt;quote&gt;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it&lt;/quote&gt;</li>
<li>I encourage both sides to simply state their reason for deletion/keeping rather than accuse the other side of stupidity. It doesn't matter whether the "other side" is stupid and politically motivated. Neither <i>The people voting delete are all zealots</i> nor <i>The people voting keep have an anti-Indian agenda</i> are sufficient arguments. It is best just to say <i>I believe the article should be kept/deleted because it (/doesn't) adheres to Wiki's policies of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</i> <b>Leave it there</b>.

<dd>At the moment I am leaning towards a <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>, though still likely to change, mainly because I believe the term "propaganda" is too subjective. Propaganda is defined as providing misleading information to influence the opinion of people but what is misleading depends entirely on one's point of view. Similarly, I believe all propaganda articles should be deleted including <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_propaganda.html" title="Nazi propaganda">Nazi propaganda</a> unless the idealogical group which believes that it is propaganda is explicitly stated throughout the article. Here it is Western academics and scholars who support the AMT and dismiss Vedic Science as pseudoscience.

<dd>A appreciate the concern over wanton "XYZ propaganda" articles. But the precedent is already in place anyway, with articles like <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_propaganda.html" title="Nazi propaganda">Nazi propaganda</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_propaganda.html" title="Soviet propaganda">Soviet propaganda</a>. This is similar to "persecution of XYZ" or "criticism of XYZ": A certain amount of vigilantism is required to prevent the creation of unwarranted articles. One example would be <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Jews_75db.html" title="Historical persecution by Jews">Historical persecution by Jews</a>, which, it was argued, was "not pov" because we have <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Persecution_by_Christians_3cbe.html" title="Historical Persecution by Christians">Historical Persecution by Christians</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Muslims_d2ab.html" title="Historical persecution by Muslims">Historical persecution by Muslims</a>. But, it simply turned out that there was practically no material that fit the article title. Thus, deletion of "persecution by X" or "Y propaganda" must have a case by case basis. The article under discussion here presents plenty of academic sources that document the rise of "Hindutva pseudoarchaeology" since the 1990s, so that there can be no doubt that this article is valid. Other creations like anti-Hindu propaganda would need to meet similar standards of an academic basis. Surely, such an article cannot be justified by citing the propaganda/counter-propaganda machine itself. But if the phenomenon is substantiated by Cambridge, Rutgers, and Routledge publications, there can simply be no debate over article validity. Before we harp on the question of titling too much, note that I have moved the article and was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_propaganda&amp;diff=119300979&amp;oldid=119272017" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_propaganda&amp;diff=119300979&amp;oldid=119272017" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> by AMbroodEY for taking away his pretext for calling for deletion. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 13:03, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nazi &amp; Soviet propogandas were not religious one.So, comparision is just not proper.See yourself that there is no article named Christian Propoganda or Muslim Propoganda on WP. Hindutva is IA term meaning "being Hindu" or Hinduness in English. And, to tell that `being Hindu' or Hinduness is propoganda&#160;; is blatant lie for the world's oldest religion or spiritual force.</p>
<p>One should remember that it was `being Christian' feeling that got united to draw Islam out of Europe. Or it was `being Muslim' feeling that made all religious conversions out of Arabia. So, would you say that as Chritianness or Islamness Propoganda&#160;? One can see that the creator &amp; main writer is trying to do propoganda to denigrate Hinduism. First he should write Christian Propoganda article ( one who is not allowing traditional presentation of <a href="../../../r/i/g/RigVeda_f045.html" title="RigVeda">RigVeda</a> and names section as `Vedantic and Hindu reformist views'. It misrepresents traditional Hindu views about Rig-Veda. And, telling traditional Hindu views as reformist is also misrepresenting the fact. If RigVeda is just ritual based text then Hindus would not have revered it as a seed of all Indian wisdom, be it spiritual or other sciences. Veda itself means knowledge in Sanskrit. So, I strongly object mis-undestanding &amp; hence mis-representation of Hindu texts by materialistic goggles wearing western eyes. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWIN_8a28.html" title="User:WIN">WIN</a> 05:29, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nazi propaganda and Soviet propaganda are not valid analogies here. Both 'Nazi' and 'Soviet' are well defined entities. And there, the propaganda stemmed from the establishment. That it was propaganda is also well attested. Not just esoteric academic journals but every single newspaper and magazine and tabloid and TV channel has called it 'propaganda'. That said, an article about it in an encyclopedia should be balanced and present both/all sides.</dd>

<dd>otoh, here, neither is 'Hindutva' itself unambiguously defined nor has it been established or demonstrated beyond doubt that it is propaganda. And I cant imagine that it ever will be. For, if it is propaganda that Kak and Frawley are upto, they're doing a very bad job. Nobody outside academic circles even knows their names.</dd>

Also, "might" is generally preferred over "may" when referring to events of such uncertainty.

As far as the merge discussion concerned, I don't think that AfDs are healthy environnements to discuss it, and should be handled in the talk pages of article concerned. However, if things come to a standstill then AfD can rule on a merge (I am assuming that is the case here). I am not against a <b>merge</b> since the article seems to confuse criticism of Hindutva with Hindutva propaganda - the only true "propaganda exposé" I could make out was the last section (about education). In that context, it can be renamed or merged - it just depends on if the editors will be able distingiush criticism (which belongs in the main article) with "propaganda" (act of proliferating the ideology and the tactics used to achieve that end).. It would be better if the regular editors could iron it out between themselves - however a delete seems unnecessary. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 03:30, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The article was initially a redirect page that I nominated. Before any decision was made, it was converted from a redirect to an article. The 1st AfD was by a known sock-puppeteer and was speedy closed. The second time, the article was moved. This caused confusion and no decision was taken anyway<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Scheibenzahl#Re:_Hindutva_pseudoscience_redirect" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Scheibenzahl#Re:_Hindutva_pseudoscience_redirect" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. The article at the time of 3rd, so-called "finally correct", nomination was a bunch of quotes from unknown papers by Witzel and Nanda I couldn't find, and filled with POV/weasel words like, "the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Aryans_ff63.html" title="Indigenous Aryans">Indigenous Aryans</a> ideology insisting on fantastic antiquity of an <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_race.html" title="Aryan race">Aryan race</a> in the Indian subcontinent". Gross accusations without a citation, disputed to be in violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The article was in such bad shape as if created by someone who just found about a wiki. Kind of hard to expect from an admin. While still up for AfD, the article was moved and moved back. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">User:Rudrasharman</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">User:Hornplease</a> didn't have a problem then, now they are blabbering about "article being edited after AfD by &lt;insert POV defamatory terms here&gt;", "bad faith nomination" etc. I edited it and removed such POV words. Wikified it as much as I could understand, and got tired in the middle of the article because of lack of citations. My request for paper has not been answered yet, instead people are calling me a part of "Hindutva brigade", "zeolot" etc for no reason except <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear%2C_uncertainty_and_doubt.html" title="Fear, uncertainty and doubt">FUD</a>. Then I was edit warred for "bad english". It is clear there is a cabal calling every one "Hindutvadi", "Nazi" etc. for no reason other than discrediting those who say "Delete". I personally see absolutely no reason to keep an article about a term which is not even used anywhere. Yes, NO WHERE. People here, in the disguise of having <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, are trying to create a counter propaganda article, by coining a new term.

<p><b>Reply to Scheibenzahl's Comment</b>: Well, it may be that "Hindutva propaganda" is a term that is not widely used, but the subject of the article could still be noteworthy. Here is what I mean: the so-called Out-of-India or Indigenous Aryan perspective is to be found expressed (or at least attempted) on a number of Wikipedia pages. However, if you scour mainstream academic literature (peer-review internationally-recognized journals or internationally-known academic/university publishers) this perspective is conspicuous by its absence. None of the other tertiary sources (Britannica, Encarta, World Book Encyclopedia, Columbia Encyclopedia) say a word about Indigenous Aryans. Why is this the case? One could of course dream up conspiracy theories, that "Euro-centric" academia is anti-Indian etc., but from what little I know about the academic scene in the West, the competition for jobs, tenure, and the 15 minutes of fame is so great that if there were a realistic chance of the Aryans being indigenous, people would be lining up to write papers about them, regardless of the prevailing orthodoxy in the field. The alternate view is that the movement to claim the Aryans as indigenous to India is a partisan one, with more belief than hard facts on their side. That is what pseudoscience is. I quote from a paper of Sudeshna Guha that I just finished reading,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Wildness</p>
<p>This article as presented is almost entierly speculative, containing many subjective assertions about a variety of things. The final part of the article is particulary unencyclopedic:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Due to its pursuit of unshielded possibilities, wildness encourages parsimony during the development and coordination of one’s understandings, instincts and emotions. It is a cutting process (like Occam's Razor) that exposes bare bones and truths, with no room for pretence and favourites. This feature can make wildness seem tough, but it also provides a stable foundation upon which nature can build. A sense of accomplishment or eureka can be the reward for using wildness, when it finds a simpler way through a complicated maze that was inhibiting life."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Essentially this is not an encyclopedic definition of "Wildness", it is merely a particular person's "Philosophy of Wildness". <a href="../../../o/r/g/User%7EOrgone_7563.html" title="User:Orgone">Orgone</a> 06:47, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it can be easily rewritten to sound more encyclopedic. A change in title will help, once the AfD is concluded. I think it actually is sufficiently encyclopedic, and is not a how-to manual. A how-to article on the subject would go into considerably more minute detail, with --at the very least--socket wiring diagrams, as it would not be of much practical use without. The US-centric orientation of the early section should be specifically noted.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:00, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi Joshua, long time no see. You didn't even try to take part in a consensus about redirecting my latest, completely kosher page, titled "Gravitational attraction" to the Newtonian <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">gravitation</a> with attraction instead of curvatures and I thought you should be the first one to cast a vote. Physicists were represented only by one guy from Harvard who unfortunately was also against GR since he didn't even know that there is no gravitational attractive force in GR. He thought that there must be since otherwise <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitons.html" title="Gravitons">gravitons</a> would be unemployed. That's how prejudice controls science even at Harvard. At the end GR lost 9:1 in favor of Newtonian attraction. Now this consensus is about <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feynman.html" title="Feynman">Feynman</a> being for flat spacetime (like <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narlikar.html" title="Narlikar">Narlikar</a>) in which curvature of space compensate for time dilations. So I think Feynman is going to lose this one too since no one might have ever heard about the guy (I put a link to him and Narlikar hoping someone might click it to learn that they were/are no dummies, even if I'm one for wanting to save science against uninformed editors). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 16:24, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Should we then look back and say "darn, we should have kept this one when it was a permastub with a MySpace page and a single article in a local newspaper announcing their gig?" Also, you say the band has been around for ten years.

<dd>I read the page wrong re: the ten years statement. Onto more substantial arguments: I realize that we delete non-notable bands each day. My argument was that obviously the band is notable as it fulfills <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. Or at least that seems to be the consensus of everyone who has voted thus far. Why delete a band that all the editors above claim to be notable? It seems like deleting a band that fulfills <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> just because no one's heard of it or because they haven't been in the NY Times is leading down a slippery slope.

<dd>The argument, as far as I understand it, is that they might barely meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> although I'm not convinced that the band has really been the "subject of multiple non-trivial published works". <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 22:18, 31 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At least they meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. As far as I can see, the only reason for deleting is because people feel as though it *might not* become anything but a stub in the foreseeable future. But it seems that they're releasing an album, so why can't it become not a stub? If I am convinced otherwise, trust me, I'll switch my vote -- I have no personal feelings towards this band. But as it stands, the only reasons for deleting have been: "they meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but the article probably won't be much more than a stub, so we should delete." That argument is not nearly enough to convince me to delete the article. But again, I am very open to have my mind changed. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 22:27, 31 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He he he... if you're open to change, let me give it another try! First, I'm not saying that they meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: it all depends on what one thinks constitute significant third-party coverage. If you look at the actual references, they're pretty minimal and uniformative and in my mind (but I do see how others might find otherwise) they fall short of what we need. As for the upcoming album, well we have no indication that it's anything other than a self-release. If you go to their website and actually listen to the two tracks they have there, you'll see that the production is pretty minimal and I think it's safe to assume that the album (if it ever comes out) won't be sold commercially on a wide scale and, consequently, it would be a stretch to think significant third-party coverage will result from that release. Of course, I wish all the best to the two girls but chances are we'll never get more than a permastub. I have no problem with re-creation if things evolve differently and deletion of an article is not a catastrophic thing, especially when it has as little content as the current one. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 05:30, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ha! You won me over with that one, and I changed my vote accordingly. The more I thought about it, the more I realized you were right -- there's not enough context to keep the article as is. If the album release garners any attention or further press, then we should go ahead and reinstate the article then. Do you think we could possibly keep a cache of the page if the latter does in fact happen, thus making the recreation less of a pain? I should commend you, by the way -- I'm generally difficult when it comes to changing my mind.&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 05:44, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And thanks for keeping an open mind. As far as keeping a record of the current content, this actually is done automatically (in some weak sense) because admins still do have access to articles that have been deleted and their history. As I'm not an admin myself, I don't really know the details of t but I'm sure someone can fill you in on that and, like I said, any re-creation of the article in the future is bound to contain all of the pretty slim info that's already in the current stub. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 05:56, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not a problem, re: my open mind.&#160;:) In the end, you're right -- if we need to tackle the recreation of the article, then we can get an admin to help or we can just rewrite it entirely. I'm not that worried as is, considering the current content on the page (or lack thereof). <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 05:59, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I don't agree that they coverage is non-trivial, and thus I <i>don't</i> think they meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Two of the articles are properly about the TV show, and only mention the band in passing. (And I'm not sure HBO counts as an independent source for information about an HBO show.) The third article appears to be a very brief summary of a very brief interview with one of the girls in a local paper. Even if we stretch a point and consider that last an acceptable source, that's only one, and it doesn't seem likely that any more will turn up. I think it's pretty cool, but I don't think it's notable. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 14:11, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, actually... on that note -- I do think that their HBO coverage fulfills #11 of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. They weren't the subject, per se, but they were part of the doc...

<dd>No, it was a half-hour show featuring six different performers. They weren't the subject, so they don't meet the criterion. On top of that the HBO article mentions Úna, not Blübird (just like the Williamette Week article). What I'm sseing is that Úna Rose is almost-but-not-quite notable enough for a Wikipedia article, but Blübird definitely is not. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 17:36, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

However, the "advertisement" seems a bit odd of a reason for terminating an article.

<li><b>Reply from author</b> Hi, guys. AFAIK there is no lawsuit. There is the patent issue that has raised its ugly head again, and the "implied threats" of defending IP rights (again, I don't work for Morfik in any way, shape or form, so I don't know this for sure). I was going to add the patent stuff today, though, since I'm out of time, and haven't had three seconds to rub together on the article until today, though. MikeyTheK 23:17, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

There is a claim to notability, however spurious it may be, so I have completed the AfD procedure for the anon.

<li>Wikipedia is not spamming the DVD releases. What the article does is acknowledge that the DVDs exist and describe them. I don't see how that's any different / more "commercializing" than articles on albums or any other product you can buy. The article doesn't say anywhere that "you should buy this" or "here's where you can buy it". THAT is spam and should be edited or removed.

<dd>To counter that outrageous statement that its the same as a music album i'll say:a music album is art,because the word album does not refer to CD but to a collection of songs put together like a montage in a film.While this articles about DVD series releases doesn't refer to an artistic object wich would make a valid article,but to a products marketing.Besides when have you seen something like that in an encyclopedia--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_rojas22_68ef.html" title="User:Andres rojas22">Andres rojas22</a> 23:45, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One could consider the collection of episodes on the DVDs an artistic collection. The writers of the episodes most likely consider them a form of art. Re: "when have you seen something like that in an encyclopedia", when have you seen a CD in an encyclopedia? Furthermore, the representation of albums here could just as easily be considered marketing. Most album entries contain track listings, genre, artist, release date, label, and other facts that could be considered "trivia". I see the same information on the Lost DVD Releases entry. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarry2385_f3e0.html" title="User:Darry2385">Darry2385</a> 00:39, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Every article starts somewhere. If someone makes a contribution to a stub and that stub is deleted. Then the next user with a piece of information will create the same stub and it'll be deleted again. Or... as paraphrased on the mandate of Wikipedia, its a collaborative effort to build an encyclopedia of which will ultimately never be complete due to continous addition. Take a look at the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Portal%7ECurrent_events_bb60.html" title="Portal:Current events">Portal:Current events</a>. Each month starts off blank and on the first day an addition is made to it. Do we delete it because it only has one piece of information? Do we delete all stubs? Perhaps these should be questions we ask ourselves before deciding to delete something that will obviously be contributed to in the future. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 09:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. You cannot delete an article with out cause and so far the only argument is that this article is about the future and that its a stub. Firstly, you don't delete stubs that meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, to which this article does, and you don't delete future articles for the sake that they are about the future. Examples include: <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010.html" title="2010">2010</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010_in_India_d8c0.html" title="2010 in India">2010 in India</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010_in_sports.html" title="2010 in sports">2010 in sports</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010_in_rail_transport.html" title="2010 in rail transport">2010 in rail transport</a> and the full list <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllpages_2010_29d7.html" title="Special:Allpages/2010">Special:Allpages/2010</a>.

I would say this article has a <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> chance of being deleted on the basis that 'it hasn't come yet'. Again, Wikipedia is not a democracy. It has its policies.

<li>For the sake of clarity, note that <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010_in_India_d8c0.html" title="2010 in India">2010 in India</a> is in fact a redirect to the article on the Commonwealth Games of that year, which is slightly a different kettle of fish than just a straight-out article on that year in that country. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:41, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In honesty, I don't think you could truly call them a different 'kettle of fish'. One is about a future event in a calendrical year, the other is about a future calendrical year in a country. I see a profound similiarity. It would be like calling the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Portal%7EChemistry_846d.html" title="Portal:Chemistry">Portal:Chemistry</a> and completely different 'kettle of fish' and asking for different criteria for the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Portal%7EPhysics_f2f2.html" title="Portal:Physics">Portal:Physics</a>. Their topic may be different, but if you say one cannot exist, then all the articles about a future event should be deleted upon your argument. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 08:19, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a false analogy. My point is that there is in fact <i>no article called "2010 in India"</i>. Type it in or follow the link and you'll end up somewhere different to where that article title would otherwise take you. You'll be in a related place, for sure, and it may well be that the only significant event currently programmed for 2010 in India <i>is</i> the Games, but you can't claim that "there's an article called '2010 in India' so we should keep an article called '2010 in Canada'". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 08:42, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

All the other votes have simply been of a personal opinion which are immediately elminated for the fact that future articles do exist (<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">User:Royalguard11</a>), and that stubs are stubs (<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">User:Bearcat</a>) <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 09:06, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair enough, there are more articles which do this particular sort of thing. However, two quick points. Firstly, 2008 is significantly closer than 2010, so such material as can be added is likely (at least in theory) to be more easily sourced than it would be for an article about 2010. Secondly, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">the fact</a> that there are articles (many of which look in pretty terrible condition to me on first pass) which do this is not a good reason that a specific exemplar thereof should stay. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:16, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Its lack of proximity to the present is not grounds for it to be deleted. If it were, then I don't see how that would be an advantagous policy in the spirit of knowledge as it seems shortsighted and articles such as <a href="../../../2/0/2/2025.html" title="2025">2025</a> would not exist. Also, the fact that an article is difficult to contribute to or source should also not be grounds for its deletion. Could you imagine? Many articles are in need of expansion of wikification: <a href="../../../a/l/l/Category%7EAll_pages_needing_to_be_wikified_fc1c.html" title="Category:All pages needing to be wikified">Category:All pages needing to be wikified</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_Stub_types_99e7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Stub types">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/Stub_types</a>, etc. etc. It has useful information, it can be expanded, it will be expanded, and I don't think we should give up on it because we think it doesn't look complete, pretty, or hard to contribute to. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 09:31, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying that it should be deleted because it's difficult to expand or source. What I'm saying is that <i>because</i> it's difficult to expand or source at this particular point in time (the better part of 3 years before Canada experiences 2010), it will run a greater risk of being used as a crystal ball than will an article on a point closer to us in time. The argument is thus that the articles on "2008 in X" are not quite on all fours with this particular article, although they're close. Regarding the lack of wikification etc, with respect I think that's a potential red herring. My point is that the existence of other articles talking about likely events in a given country in the future is not a reason to keep any specific article talking about likely events in a given country in the future. Neither is it a reason to delete it, by any means, but this isn't the clear-cut <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> case you were originally advocating, I'm sure you'll agree. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:09, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please elaborate since articles such as <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010.html" title="2010">2010</a> and even <a href="../../../2/0/4/2040s.html" title="2040s">2040s</a> and <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_millennium.html" title="4th millennium">4th millennium</a>. So if its a matter of proximity then you cannot say this article should be deleted and another 2,000+ articles about future events beyond 2010 can be kept. Again I say, this article meets all of Wikipedia's policies and criteria for notability. This process is not about people thinking one way or another with their own personal opinions, but to judge articles for or against the fact that it has either failed Wikipedia policy or not. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 06:55, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For starters, neither 2008 in Canada nor 2009 in Canada exists yet. For another, while there are enough things already known about 2010 in <i>general</i> to justify an article, as of right now <i>all</i> we know about 2010 in Canada is that there'll be an Olympics, a fact which is already covered by the article <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010_Winter_Olympics_897b.html" title="2010 Winter Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a>, and a couple of elections. Beyond that, the article otherwise consists of a list of conventions scheduled by non-notable organizations. "National Realtors Association Executive Institute"? "CMS Summer 2010 Meeting"? Why on earth would or should Wikipedia <i>care</i>? It's not that this should <i>never</i> exist; it's just that there's no particularly compelling reason for it to exist <i>now</i>. It'll certainly be valid in the fall of 2008 or early 2009, but there simply <i>isn't</i> sufficient encyclopedic content for it yet. You know you're on shaky ground when you have to list <i>real estate agency</i> conventions just to break ten items, you know? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 21:41, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This software was just released recently, therefore it doesn't <i>have</i> any reviews by well known computing magazines. Not to mention that it is an opensourced project. Opensourced projects do not generally recieve magazine articles, nor software reviews. I have also noticed that CocoModX, another opensourced Mod Player, has an entrie (Actually a stub) despite it's lack of reviews. I fail to see the problem with mine. --Neilt6 17:59, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I still fail to see why it is mandatory for something to be popular before it can be entered in Wikipedia. Opensourced projects generally do not gain public interest very quickly, therefore since my page has been flagged for deletion so quickly based on it's lack of public mention I also fail to see how any other software project has ever recieved mention on Wikipedia. --Neilt6 18:10, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> I'd personally accept an Ink Nineteen <i>interview</i> as press coverage, though I don't speak for anyone else; but what was there was simply an article about Alternative Tentacles re-releasing their earlier records. In indie rock terms, a record review (of a re-release) in a minor pub like that would probably be considered "trivial" here - it's terribly easy to get that kind of press. As for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>'s secondary criteria, I guess they may count under point 4 (release of several records on a notable independent label), but nowhere else, and it looks like re-releases only, and I guess the secondary criterion only are there to identify bands who may therefore have had non-trivial press coverage. If you can find feature-sized interviews in the major indie press (not zines or websites but people who have to sell ads to survive), that would certainly count for a keep. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 23:22, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Right, before I start saying this, please understand that I hadn't heard of the band before I came across this debate, and I am not into this kinda music, so I really don't read those kind of magazines. In defense of the Ink19 page- it wasn't a reprinted press release; as far as I can see, it was written by Stein Haukland, who appears to work there. Whether it is easy to get or not puts them well ahead of many band articles that we get submitted every hour, (as a new page patroller, I can voich for that) and, as far as I can see, it <i>does</i> meet all the requirements for one of the multiple, independent, reliable, non trivial sources required. It is independent of the band (and not a reprinted press release) it is from a good source, and the whole article is about the band, it isn't just some mention. <a href="http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/skaterock/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/skaterock/index.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> article interest me a lot. It gives the impression that they are VERY important in the <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skate_rock.html" title="Skate rock">skate rock</a>/<a href="../../../s/k/a/Skate_punk.html" title="Skate punk">skate punk</a> scenes, and, they are linked to from the skate punk article, but as <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drunk_Injuns_5798.html" title="Drunk Injuns">Drunk Injuns</a>, which is the correct title, not <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drunk_injuns.html" title="Drunk injuns">Drunk injuns</a>. (This leads me on to another point- this needs to be capitalised, I'll do that when I have finished writing this.) I admit that the In Music We Trust article is COMPLETELY useless, it doesn't even mention Drunk Injuns, except in the title. The final article looks reliable to me, but it confuses me the way that it cites another website. In any case, I have now realised that this band is an older one, perhaps even not in operation any more, making sources hard to come by, and making Internet sources even more valuable proof of notability. Well, that's what I reckon, anyway. I'm standing by my keep vote. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 09:56, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> - as you say, a review in Ink19 puts this article ahead of most. (However, trust me, it's easy to get a record review in the second tier - I've had a couple, and my music won't satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.) Sure, you could argue they may have gotten a feature 20 years ago in Maximum R&amp;R and we won't find it on the internet.

<p>This article has turned into nothing but a promotional piece for the Scuderi group. Its is written from the perspective of the company and likely by members of the company. Its only source that is not the company's web site turns out to be a reprint of the company's own literature so is hardly <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>. The Scuderi engine exists only in theory, as a working prototype has never been produced. Acces to the computer simulations the company claims shows their engine is a major breakthrough are apparently only available if you sign an NDA first. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a crystal ball</a> nor is it an appropriate place to promote a speculative technology. Until independent and reliable sources have had the chance to review a working engine and report their findings, I don't believe we should be hosting this article <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 19:35, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tricky one, and I'm glad you are watching this article. It undoubtedly is a technology that is being worked on very seriously, and for all I can tell may well be viable. (he said politely, I doubt it actually). As such, there is no doubt in my mind that it deserves an article. BUT. The behaviour of the current active editor is extremely poor, in a Wiki context. Obviously actions like deleting the AfD and No Sources boxes are completely unnacceptable, and many of their other edits have needed reverting. So, perhaps we have an editor problem more than an article problem? Deleting the article to punish a rogue editor seems spiteful more than helpful. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreglocock_2608.html" title="User:Greglocock">Greglocock</a> 21:58, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree this one is tricky. I started working on this article in June 2006, so I have some history with it. Unfortunately it is increasingly becoming clear that the claims made in the article are currently unproved. It might be possible to reduce this to a stub, containing the bare minimum of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information and removing all <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enot.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wp:not">future predictions</a> of performance, but I fear it would soon be overrun again by the Scuderi company. If the community would prefer that approach I'm happy to jump in and do the trimming work. The question is, would there even be enough left to have a viable article? <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 22:10, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ok I understand the position you are stating but please try to understand that because this is so new and there is no prototype completed YET! I cannot prove to you it's legitimacy. I was simply just trying to spread the word about the new technology becuase it has such great potential to revolutionize the engine market. I am not part of the company either I am engine buff that reviewed the technology and invested in it because I see a homerun on this technology. Having said that if you still feel it needs to be removed then so be it, but just remember what the Scuderi Engine is.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Rewrite</b> It <i>does</i> read like an ad, but the split-cycle engine concept does exist. The removal of 99% of the mention of the Scuderi Group would make this ad closer to being an article.

<ul>
<li>It may seem like an ad but that is not the purpose. The true reason why Scuderi Group is mentioned so much about this specific design is because out of all split cycle designs in the past this design has many different features that that cannot be compared to older split cycle designs. Their name is used a lot simply to show credit where credit is due. No other person has done what the Scuderi's have done and I think they should be given credit for that. News articles about this specific technology can be added if neccessary.--sg300c 03:41, 1 April 2007</li>

As time goes on it will get better and better especially with a prototype on the way. For the time being I have referenced all the claims as by Salvatore Scuderi to a video that explains the technology in a creditable way. I also agree Megapixie that for the time being your revision to the listing was well done. As the technology becomes more established it can be transistioned back into a more verified state.--sg300c 21:37, 1 April 2007</li>

All the information in this article are claims by the Scuderi Group themselves and is verified by themselves.

<dd>First please <i>read</i> the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest guidelines</a>. They say "you should avoid or exercise great caution when editing articles related to you". You've admitted you have a financial interest in the Scuderi Group. That's a classic conflict of interest. On the subject of sources, material provided by the Scuderi Group does not count as a reliable source. Please read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">our guidelines on reliable sources</a>. The subject of an article is not itself a reliable source. You have not verified the information because the <i>only</i> source are the claims of the Scuderi Group. Until there is <b>independent</b> sources that confirm these claims, they cannot be reported in Wikipedia. Again an encyclopedia is a summarization of the opinions and facts collected by independent authors about a subject. If an article could be "verified by the ones who created it" we would have to publish everything, with absolutely no quality control and no way for readers to find out if what was included was true. There are hundreds of free web hosts where you can add this kind of information.

<li>It seems silly to delete the article because the prototype has not been completed. A respected think tank with expertise in engine technology (Southwest) has weighed in as has the industry press. The article needs to make clear a working prototype has not been completed but deletion is not the answer. If Wikipedia existed during the Apollo mission, would it have been inappropriate to have an article on it prior to landing on the moon because up until then, it was theoretical.

I am in favor of the Scuderi Group and hope their technology takes off successfully but the other's on this site are very closed minded and want 100% clear cut data proving it before it's listed and are fighting to get it removed. I don't really care anymore since it's not important to have it on here for the success of the technology anyways. I was just trying to provide some more indepth information about what I know.

<li><b>Delete</b> Reasons: 1. It is clearly a future product. 2. The fact that there is no prototype is especially significant in light of the fact that it is claimed to be "easily manufactured using existing processes." If it would be so easy to manufacture in series production, it seems fairly strange that they have yet to manufacture <i>one</i>. 3. NPOV is impossible when the source of ALL the information on this engine is from Scuderi Group, and one must sign a non-disclosure document to even view the full range of this information. If one has enough information to criticize the model, one can't discuss it, so we're limited to all the news Scuderi's PR people deem fit to print. That's simply not what this venue is for; the Scuderi booster/investor crowd is confusing Wikipedia with PR Newswire. Until they finish their prototype and/or supply enough data to allow honest debate about the engine, it should go.Meersman 00:17, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

It would need to be linked from a non-scuderi website.--<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcause365_3c3a.html" title="User:Lostcause365">Lostcause365</a> 23:31, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hang on, the file is hosted at scuderi, but the original article is from an independnet source. I think that's OK <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreglocock_2608.html" title="User:Greglocock">Greglocock</a> 01:24, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response</b> Yes Greglocock is correct. It is only hosted on Scuderi's website because it is a scan of the magazine article, but yes it is an independent source. I also have an article from popular mechanics with their technology listed. I will try to get it on soon if I can. I'm taking all your advice by getting more independent sources listed because the sources are there. Sg300c 18:52 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Although the article may be <i>said</i> to come from Techbeat, it <i>still</i> does not meet the independant source argument <i>because</i> it is hosted on the Scuderi website. Anything posted on a company website can and usually will be biased towards that company. Just like you wouldn't trust a tobacco company to represent their products in a fair, unbiased and equitable manner, the Scuderi group website cannot be counted upon as a source of unbiased coverage. Who is to say that the article wasn't modified? Not that I believe is was, but the fact of the matter is that any website, company mailer, internal document, or other media with a direct connection to the Scuderi Group cannot be considered an independant source. I am still sorry that this response (and many of my others) sound like personal attacks towards sg300c. I apologize. It is just that all of your arguments are ripe for rebuttal. I still think the article is deletion-worthy, however your repeated efforts to improve the article may yet save it. It is still in need of major revisions and independant sourcing.--<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcause365_3c3a.html" title="User:Lostcause365">Lostcause365</a> 17:30, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Clarification Response</b> The name of the magazine is “Tribology &amp; Lubrication Technology Magazine “ (Techbeat is the section) which is published by Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers.

<li><b>Response</b> I've read every article that's been linked to in relation to this article in talk or in this deletion discussion, including this "Techbeat" piece. Each has done one of two things, either: 1. Uncritically put out the Scuderi Group talking points, citing the easily solved "problems" with the concept while ignoring the more significant and obvious ones, or 2. Put out the Scuderi points and had a critic talk about how hard it will be to commercialize the engine because of how the industry is structured, which has nothing to do with the concept itself. The weight of Scuderi's tearsheet file isn't relevant to the existence of independent analysis of the concept; the ability of their PR flacks to get stuff placed doesn't mean an independent source has ever looked at it critically. (Again, the root of this problem is Scuderi's non-disclosure agreement. If you have the data to criticize, you can't do it publicly. Why such secrecy if the concept is so well patent-protected?)

<dd>I am astonished to hear that the webhost is a consideration when considering whether an article can be considered as a source. Can you point to a policy that states that the website hosting a reproduction of an article in an independent magazine is important? FWIW at considerable expense I could order up that copy of AE and check that it does contain the article, but that is not the problem is it? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreglocock_2608.html" title="User:Greglocock">Greglocock</a> 01:01, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did you know for the longest time I thought your handle was <i>Greg O'Clock</i>?

<p>Non notable perhaps in Pjacobi's mind, but not to this user, nor in in the mind of many others. Deletion of this entry will not add to the body of knowledge, but merely to the power of the "tyranny of the mob" of the self-appointed intelligentsia. If the theory is found lacking, truth will out. Until then, it is a competing theory to Einstein's.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>; This is one of several related tax protester articles and admittedly has received the least amount of attention when compared with all the other articles in the group. I believe this article has potential. The sourcing for the various theories needs to be beefed up. As ridiculous as the theories are (for example, the argument about the defendant's name in all capital letters), these theories actually are raised in real court cases (I've studied the cases). The fact that the theories have no legal merit or factual merit and are uniformly rejected by the U.S. courts does not mean that the phenomenon is not worth an article, at least in my opinion.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> A summary article of this sort is highly appropriate. Yes, the quality of the article is variable, and some parts are better sourced than others, just as some of the WP articles summarized here are more complete or more accurate. But there are no lack of possible sources: everything discussed has been actively brought to public notice, and most of it to legal notice, and the new accounts and legal proceeding are available.

<li><b>Keep</b> The fact that some theories aren't sourced is an argument for improving the article, not deleting it. The nominator's comments are curious—the capital letters theory <i>is</i> sourced, and the fact that this theory was mentioned and dismissed in a published opinion would seem to be evidence of its notability. — Mateo SA (<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMateo_SA_7201.html" title="User talk:Mateo SA">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mateo_SA_ff08.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mateo SA">contribs</a>) 04:06, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>The only sources are a couple of anti-tax websites and court opinions. The anti-tax websites are not <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">reliable sources</a>, and while the court opinions may be reliable (it's hard to confirm considering they don't link to anything) they alone do not establish notability; plenty of people make outrageous claims in court on a daily basis, and there's nothing that asserts that these particular claims are noteworthy. <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_sources" title="WP:ATT">Exceptional claims require exceptional sources</a>.

<li>The article is not attempting to prove that the tax protesters' claims are correct; it is documenting that those claims have been made in court and have been rejected by the courts. Are you saying that that it is extraordinary to claim that those arguments have been made?</li>
<li>My previous paragraph notwithstanding, here is a reliable source I believe establishes the notability of the capital letters claim: IRS <a href="http://www.irs.gov/irb/2005-14_IRB/ar13.html" class="external text" title="http://www.irs.gov/irb/2005-14_IRB/ar13.html" rel="nofollow">Revenue Ruling 2005-21</a>, regarding "Frivolous tax returns; use of “straw man” to avoid tax." This argument is also referenced in <a href="http://www.irs.gov/irb/2007-14_IRB/ar20.html" class="external text" title="http://www.irs.gov/irb/2007-14_IRB/ar20.html" rel="nofollow">IRS Notice 2007-30</a>, which describes a number of theories ruled frivolous. These include some of the theories mentioned in our article, including the Admiralty Courts claim (item #33 in the IRS Notice), and the Federal-Reserve-notes-are-not-money claim (item #11 in the IRS Notice).</li>
<li>I definitely agree that the article needs improvement. Probably it would help to add those IRS notices as references to the article. — Mateo SA (<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMateo_SA_7201.html" title="User talk:Mateo SA">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mateo_SA_ff08.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mateo SA">contribs</a>) 15:24, 1 April 2007 (UTC).</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I agree that anti-tax (tax protester) web sites are, by definition, not reliable sources for statements about <i>what the law is</i>. These sites are, however, reliable sources for showing that tax protester do raise these arguments. Regarding the separate issue of <i>notability</i> and the assertion that there is "no evidence provided that this is more than a couple guys who made weird claims in court and documented them on their websites" -- well, we agree that more sourcing needs to be added to the article. If only it were only a "couple of guys" who were making these kinds of legally frivolous claims, both on tax returns and in court proceedings. As I recall, only about 7% of all reported Federal taxation decisions in a recent year involved dealings with tax protester arguments. However, seven percent is still (in my view) a sizeable chunk of legal system time wasted on tax protester nonsense. This has been such a problem that in the early 1980s the Congress even enacted <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Revenue_Code_08f6.html" title="Internal Revenue Code">26 U.S.C.</a>&#160;<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6702.html" class="external text" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6702.html" rel="nofollow">§&#160;6702</a> to deal with the problem of people raising these claims on tax returns. Also <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Revenue_Code_08f6.html" title="Internal Revenue Code">26 U.S.C.</a>&#160;<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6673.html" class="external text" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6673.html" rel="nofollow">§&#160;6673</a> was enacted for the problem of people raising these claims in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Tax_Court_94be.html" title="United States Tax Court">United States Tax Court</a> (imposing a penalty of up to $25,000) -- and the district and appellate courts regularly impose penalties for raising the arguments as well. Indeed, just a few months ago (in 2006) the Congress changed the law to <i>increase the section 6702 penalty from $500 to $5,000</i> (note: the text of section 6702 at the Cornell Law School web site linked above has not yet been updated for the increase to $5,000). In enacting these <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Revenue_Code_08f6.html" title="Internal Revenue Code">Internal Revenue Code</a> provisions, the Congress arguably is treating this as a "notable" problem. I think that's good enough for Wikipedia. Yours, <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamspear_93da.html" title="User:Famspear">Famspear</a> 20:35, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br /></p>
<p>I should point out at the start the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxim.html" title="Maxim">maxim</a> that AfD is not a vote, but a debate. Whilst the weight of numbers will often be an essential part of a determination of consensus, particularly where questions of personal judgment are involved, mere weight of numbers will not overbear weight of arguments grounded in policy.</p>
<p>In determining the final consensus, the arguments of all unregistered users were disregarded.</p>
<p>The main arguments in favour of keeping the article were:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the article was adequately sourced,</li>
<li>that the subject was notable, and previous AfD debates had recognised this (some explicitly noted improvement in the article since the previous debates),</li>
<li>that the subject's lawsuit against the Wikimedia Foundation either made her notable, or was the cause of an invalid nomination for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main arguments in favour of deleting the article were:</p>
<ul>
<li>that Wikipedia demands a stricter standard of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourcing</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality of writing</a> with respect to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living persons</a> than it does generally,</li>
<li>that the subject was of marginal notability, having attracted no major media attention, and the article was of no importance within the encyclopaedia, being essentially an orphaned page,</li>
<li>that the sources used were either broadly unreliable sources such as blogs, message boards or rumour-based websites, or primary sources,</li>
<li>that the article did not present a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, in that it wasn't a "balanced biography" and was essentially "a recollection of a negative event".</li>
</ul>
<p>There was significant debate over whether Writer Beware constituted a reliable source or not. This was regarded by participants on both sides of the debate as a crucial source. Arguments included that the SFWA organisation behind the Writer Beware project had an existence as a reliable source beyond the Writer Beware blog, and that the blog was a "pet project" of a small group within the SFWA used to advance an agenda, and that Wikipedia risked becoming a soapbox for that agenda.</p>
<p>In determining the final consensus, arguments in relation to the lawsuit were given no weight. Arguments in relation to notability were given some weight, but given the strength of the positions on each side with respect to this point, these arguments had little substantive effect on the outcome. The most weight was given to arguments about the quality of sourcing of the article, and arguments based on other key content policies (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>).</p>
<p>Distributing weight accordingly, the outcome was in favour of deleting the article. The concerns about the quality of sourcing, and issues of NPOV and BLP, were not answered in the debate, and outweighed any weight of numbers in favour of keeping the article.</p>

That <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barbara_Bauer_bf62.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Bauer">AFD</a> discussion came to a clear keep discussion. Shortly after she filed a lawsuit against several parties including the Wikimedia foundation (and the article was updated to reflect this), it was deleted again as "per WP:BLP article is a bloody disgrace. Full of 'allegations" of who said what on message boards . No mainstream media interest." Another <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_March_25_7998.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 March 25">deletion review</a> was started and aborted to wait to see if the foundation/<a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> would take official action.

There was enough concern about notability raised that the article is coming here for its second deletion review. There is quite a bit of discussion about reliability of sources in both of the two most deletion reviews. This is a technical nomination on my part, I have no opinion. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 23:54, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very strong Delete</b> utterly not notable - no mainstream media interest. She got a bad write-up from a writer's guild? So bloody what?

Bauer is also <i>alleged</i> to have made legal threats ... <i>especially on web sites</i>. <i>Reports</i> of this behaviour are <i>usually found on sites</i> maintained by people who <i>claim</i> to have received such threats.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> There is no RS for the matter at issue. The SFFWA site does not show anything except the inclusion of her on a list. Similarly for the NJ courts--the complaint would be a RS, but the site shows only the name on a list. This is not suitable under BLP. I think she is N, and I think the threat is N, and I think a well-thought of blog can be a RS for some things--but not for BLP. And there's no reason to think her N otherwise. There are still a few days for a source to appear. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:17, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The SFWA site makes general statements about all the names on the list, including Bauer. Those statements are quoted in the article, and are the basic source material. The Writer Beware blog is also a reliable source, being another publication of the same organisation, and supports the assertion that Bauer regularly makes legal threats and that her actions were involved in the (albeit temporary) closure of Absolute Write. These two sources are reliable and are adequate between them to support almost all of the information in the article. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 07:52, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's possible (though I don't think it's happened yet) that the suit will indeed make her notable through coverage in the media; not necessarily due to the Wikipedia/Wikimedia angle alone, but because of all the other defendants; if any of them put up a big fight it could throw off lots of sparks.

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I can't really venture a definitive <s>vote</s> opinion one way or the other. A previous AfD found her (barely) notable enough, though it's fairly marginal. The lawsuit may increase her notability, but this hasn't yet actually occurred. There's a decent chance that the article will some day need to be resurrected if deleted, but we're not a crystal ball. However, she does have some degree of notability / notoriety, so keeping the article isn't a completely bizarre choice now either. Any deletion now should be without prejudice, given that circumstances may (even quite soon now) necessitate overturning such a decision. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 15:51, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Utterly unnotable. There is no indication of notability present in the article. Blog mentions are not basis for notability, and according to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> are not reliable sources and should be removed from the article altogether. A lawsuit that has no coverage by any secondary sources is not even remotely sufficient to make her notable, or we'd have to include every single person on the planet who has ever filed a lawsuit. The fact that it was made against the Wikimedia Foundation is meaningless. There are people who have sued far more important organizations and companies than the WMF who don't have articles. The top twenty listing does not in and of itself make her notable; in fact I haven't been able to find articles for any of the other 19 companies listed. If policy is followed and the information cited to the blogs is removed, than the only information remaining would be the mention in the top twenty listing and an nonnotable lawsuit. That doesn't even come close to warranting an article at all.

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b> The lawsuit is a direct result of Jules H. writing this article in the first place. It's defamatory on its face. He used Wikipedia for his personal crusade against non noteable literary agents who haven't legally defrauded anyone to date. That may be a small point to a partisan, not not in the law. This is all about blogland, Internet writing forums and cliques of users who want to score points with blogging editors at publishing houses under the guise of ridding the world of scammers who charge fees and perform badly in the business. This just isn't a crime or a notable person in the way Amanda Urban is a notable literary agent. My protests have been steadfast on this issue alone from the beginning. I was blogswarmed by this same blogging group. Jules H. has left me a warning of being blocked for reverting the page to the warning tag. That'a exhibit A of just how far he is willing to go.</li>

<dd>Nor does it make a reliable source on its face and since it's a volunteer job, it's not an actual business with telecommuters. It's a vanity effort, no matter how valuable and just. The fact in contention here is notability. Bauer is a small time agent with no clientele of note in publishing. Therefore, she is not notable. You saying she is doesn't make it so. Maybe Jimo Wales will thatnk you for getting him sued? By the way, these are all the very same players as before on the keep side. Expect more because they'll bury everyone else with their partisan club. It's a number game really, and all of one mind from the home office in Brooklyn.

<dd>Folks, can we please end the sniping here? If Doc says he did not notice the mention of the lawsuit when he speedied the article, then a protracted argument over what happened, when and why is irrelevant to the issue at hand (i.e. whether the article should be kept or deleted on the basis of notability, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> etc.), and needlessly pushes the boundaries of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. That also goes for arguments about why it was written in the first place. Clearly, there is room for reasonable, intelligent Wikipedians to strongly disagree about whether the article should exist, and what it needs to make it acceptable if indeed it is retained. That's plenty to deal with without dissecting each other's actions and presumed motives.

<li><b>Keep.</b> - as others have mentioned, Bauer was considered notable in the first AFD, and since then the article has improved considerably, with more balance and reliable sources. The most important source is SFWA's Writer Beware site, which although it has an official blog as an outgrowth is not a blog in and of itself. The fact that Bauer has sued WF, SFWA and others is part of her notability, since her reported past attempts to suppress unfavorable attention with threats of legal action were what originally set her apart from the other agents on the Twenty Worst list. I suspect it is early days to expect mainstream coverage of the lawsuit, and I understand that we cannot decide on the basis of a prediction of future press attention. However, the sources already given in the article should be more than sufficient to establish notability. As for much of the article being negative, it is nevertheless scrupulously sourced, stated as neutrally as possible, and offset by as much positive material as could be reasonably found. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is not, I think, intended to require that no negative material ever be mentioned under any circumstances. -- <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 00:32, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Exhibit A as provided in the above link bears repeating in this light: "keep deleted. The Barbara Bauer article was one of several articles created on Wikipedia in May 2006 by User:JulesH for the stated purpose of, "I just feel that the information about them provided by the SFWA should be disseminated more widely". The sole basis for these articles (the others have been deleted) was a list on a website that does not provide data to back-up their claims, thus making it impossible for Wikipedians to verify the website's claims. This one website source is not the basis for posting rumors about a living person on Wikipedia, even if the claims are true. I do not understand all the "inside" talk (by Wikipedia editors who know the parties involved in real-world disputes with Barbara Bauer) on the Talk:Barbara Bauer and related pages, but it is clear that there is a group of editors who have collaborated to keep negative information about Barbara Bauer on Wikipedia, using only blogs and other unreliable internet sources in their citations. These "owners" of the article have been repeatedly challenged by other Wikipedians who pointed out that use of unreliable sources is a violation of Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons. The original attempt to delete the Barbara Bauer article was held off under the condition that the article would be built using reliable sources (Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Bauer), however the unreliable website sources were retained. The only reason this page exists is to repeat the claims of an unreliable website source that does not provide evidence for its claims, only a set of conclusions. There is no reason for Wikipedia to repeat these conclusions other than the desire of a few Wikipedia editors to use Wikipedia as a mechanism for amplifying the conclusions of the other website. This is not a basis for building a Wikipedia article about a living person, even if the claims are true. This has nothing to do with responding to "spurious legal threats". There are thousands of webpages that make unverifiable claims about living people. Wikipedia is not here as a mechanism for amplifying those claims. In my view, the link to "Writer Beware" at Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America should be enough coverage of this issue for Wikipedia. --JWSchmidt 18:33, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The stated purposes of wikipedia is to collect information from reliable sources into a single work to make them more readily accessible. The fact that the reason for creating this article was to include some particular information from a particular reliable source is reason to delete it how? Again, I repeat my comments from the deletion review: Wikipedia does not require its sources to provide hard data. It only requires them to have checked the data themselves and be reputable and trustworthy. The condition you mention was not actually imposed as a condition of the previous AfD discussion: the result was "keep" not "keep pending improvement of sourcing". <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 15:01, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> references provide enough depth to back this. I've personally heard of her referred to as "satan in a skirt" in conversations during NANO. That makes her pass my personal bar of notability. She also appears to pass our WP:BIO guidelines. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a> <span style="font-size:130%; background:yellow; border:1px solid black;">☢</span> 06:07, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see how this person meets any of the standards set out in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Inclusion on a list does not establish notability. Filing a lawsuit does not, by itself, establish notability. While some of the references used are reliable (a college alumni magazine, for example), they don't establish notability. The simple fact is that literary agents are not generally notable unless they've been the subject of articles. There are twenty entries in the "Writers Beware" list, and I don't think anyone would argue that we should have articles about each one. This person has only been the subject of blog entries that aren't reliable sources. Regarding a comment by <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">user:Crotalus horridus</a>, I dispute his contention that <a href="../../../t/e/r/Teresa_Nielsen_Hayden_5a69.html" title="Teresa Nielsen Hayden">Teresa Nielsen Hayden</a> is a reliable source. She is an expert on the topic of editing, not on the topic of literary agents. Furthermore, she has used Wikipedia as a soapbox to disparage some people in violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (See <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Elwood_0945.html" title="Roger Elwood">Roger Elwood</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Elwood&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10692310" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Elwood&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10692310" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>) and to promote others, including herself and her husband, in violation of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. For those reasons we should be very careful about using Nielsen Hayden as a source or a judge of notability. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 18:53, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm afraid I don't see the relevance of somebody's past infringements of Wikipedia rules (presumably due to ignorance of them and a simple desire to improve Wikipedia: the content I see introduced seems not to be disputed by anybody, only the lack of sourcing is inappropriate) to whether or not something they have published externally to Wikipedia is an acceptable source. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 20:57, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Blogs are not normally considered reliable sources. Some folks, here and elsewhere, have asserted that Nielsen Hayden is an exception and I disagree with that assessment. Her agenda-driven behavior on Wikipedia mirrors her blog writing. While her blog is certainly a good reflection of her opinions, it should not be used as a source for objective truth. And the fact that she has written about this subject does not, by itself, make this subject notable. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 21:32, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
