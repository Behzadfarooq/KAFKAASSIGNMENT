<li><b>Keep</b>, reluctantly. I think the general precedent for keeping schools is nuts, but they are generally kept.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. I would love to save this school, but this is blatent advertising and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> at the moment.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>clean-up</b>, per Squiddy. The word "we" should generally not appear in Wikipedia articles (outside an acknowledged quote, of course.) Also, check for copyright.<a href="../../../b/j/o/User%7EBjones_50e8.html" title="User:Bjones">Bjones</a> 14:07, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> this school seems to defend a certain idiology, this is not what I will call a universal and humanist education, to say the least. This looks to me like a <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrassa.html" title="Madrassa">Madrassa</a> or kind of, though they seem to give modern teaching too, not that there is inherently something wrong with that, but the subject has been lately very controversial, in <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> for example, but elswhere in the muslim world too (see also <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>) --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhalid_hassani_3476.html" title="User:Khalid hassani">Khalid hassani</a> 14:49, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It has nothing to do with it being an Islamic School.

<dd>If we keep it, then we would have no reason to refuse any and every other private school&#160;! everyone must be treated on equal footing. This seems to me clearly an advert with no Encyclopedic content, and should go into places like this <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowikis.html" title="Yellowikis">Yellowikis</a>.

<li>Why don't you read the deletion notice, on the article which clearly states "<i>You are welcome to edit this article,...</i>". What part of that do you not understand?

<dd>This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use. This is the baseline consensus that I feel was reached at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 22:39, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
