<p><b>It is likely that this will be moved to '<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hadith_cd90.html" title="List of Hadith">List of Hadith</a>' if kept. Please take this into account when voting.</b></p>
<p>The title of this article is problematic, its scope is potentially enormous, and there is no NPOV criterion for choosing which "reports", or <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a>, are notable.</p>
<p>The title is problematic because "Muslim reports" is a very poor translation of "hadith". Hadith, or formally collected oral tradition, is an accepted, widely used term in Islamic studies. The user who created this article seems to prefer NOT to use Arabic terms of art in discussing Islam-related articles. Anyone searching for articles about hadith would not find this one.</p>
<p>But there are bigger problems than the title. There are many thousands of hadith. Bukhari and Muslim, the first two books of the Sunni canon, contain over 17,000 hadiths. There are four other Sunni books, as well as Shi'a collections. Is this article going to contain them all? The creator of the article says that only "notable" hadiths should be included, but he offers no criterion for notability. All the hadiths he has selected so far have to do with the long tradition of Sunni-Shi'a polemics, and prominently feature hadith used by the Shi'a in attempts to prove that the Shi'a are right and the Sunni are wrong. (The editor is a Shi'a.) However, hadith cover hundreds of other topics as well. If we included the most cited hadith for each of these topics (such as salat, zakat, hijab, inheritance, etc.) we would have an article as long as a book.</p>
<p>I asked the creator to consider picking another title and narrowing the scope of the article. An article on Hadith from the Sunni canon frequently cited by the Shi'a would be manageable and perhaps even useful, since the Shi'a editors keep listing the same hadiths, over and over, in various Islam-related articles. However, the creator -- with whom I have not been getting along -- refuses.</p>
<p>If someone else could persuade him to change the title and narrow the scope of the article, we could drop this whole AfD. Can anyone do so? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:15, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zora said that i have only included narrations that are relevant to Shi'a Sunni discutions. Well, that makes them notable, doesnt it? Wikipedia is not a paper encylopedia, we dont delet lists only since they could be big. In fact, just the fact that it could become big makes it notable. IF it gets to big, will create breakout articles. Regarding notablility and NPOV, its the usual WP rules.</p>
<p>I did not choose "Hadith", since it would exluded non-"hadith" material, for example "Sira", letters and sermons. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 05:31, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> and delete most of the individual hadith entries. This is completely unmanageable. There is no systematic way to choose what should be on this list given. There is no systematic naming or scholarly precedent that is being followed for this. I understand the inclusionist impulse. I really do. However, it cannot be used for this article. Renaming to "List of notable hadith" is not enough. How do we set notability in an academic matter? Are Shia hadith inherently less notable because there are fewer Shia? How is the naming of the individual hadith done? At last resort I'd deport the various hadith to wikisource if their translations are in the public domain. An article like this removes any academic credibility from wikipedia. It exemplifies our bias problems and violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> in so many ways. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 03:49, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Gren, you know that many of this hadith are very prominently used in many articel around in Wikipedia. In this articles we can elaborate on their credibility, how they are sourced, whar different scholars have said about it and so on... We can drop "notable" and move it to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hadith_cd90.html" title="List of Hadith">List of Hadith</a>. I mean, we have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools.html" title="List of schools">List of schools</a>, and given that i do not understand how we can not have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hadith_cd90.html" title="List of Hadith">List of Hadith</a>. Notability is judged on a case-by case scenario, its like sayin "its hard to decide if a school is notable, so lets delet <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools.html" title="List of schools">list of schools</a>". that does not make sense. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 04:52, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, as there exist no standard to what can and cannot be included in this list. Furthermore, it can be argued that every hadith is notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Let's start thinking about overcoming systemic bias here. If the "notable" in the proposed title irritates, move it to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hadith.html" title="List of hadith">List of hadith</a> then. This is a commendable attempt to create a directory of articles and links to important Muslim texts, categorizing them by the authority cited and by which branches of Islam accept them. The info actually here is verifiable and NPOV, and doesn't present particular problems as to what to include. I doubt we will ever have to face this issue, but if (God willing) we end up with articles on each reported hadith, so be it. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 05:43, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Smerdis, there's no systemic bias in removing a junk article. I'm one of the editors working on Islam-related articles (which I suppose is overcoming systemic bias) and we have a lot of work to do ASIDE from dealing with thousands of hadith. Hadith aren't "texts", BTW -- they're often quite short -- sentences or paragraphs. Do you really believe that we should include 17,000+ hadiths in Wikipedia? That's a reductio ad absurdam. If someone wants to put all of Bukhari or Muslim into Wikisource (if they're not already there), fine. Do dip into some hadith collections (<a href="http://members.cox.net/arshad/hadithcol.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.cox.net/arshad/hadithcol.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) before you insist that it would be just fine, really, to have articles for every single one of them. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:19, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

This vote is not about weather WP shoudl have articles on hadith, only about linking to the existing hadith from a list. Nothing more. You dont like the hadith in the list? Add some of your own.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't feel the need to vote, but I will say that the hadith are so voluminous and so important that I would think they deserve their own wiki, and they can't really be done justice within WP. I would suggest to the authors that they consider developing a hadithwiki and then linking it where appropriate in WP. As with Bible verses, I think only the most important and best-known really deserve their own articles on the main WP. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 17:09, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, bro nobody is going to bother to copy random hadith here, it takes effort. Remeber that every single entry needs to be encyplopedi notable, otherwise it will be deleted. That ensures the notability of the entire list. The only reason Zora and gren are voting delet is that the list contains many Shi'a haidth at the moment, and they cant stand it.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 03:51, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It takes effort? So does compiling a million-page online encyclopedia, but there are plenty of people interested in doing it, and I still think a hadithwiki would be an important project. Regardless, I'm now voting keep, above. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 18:58, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this and all lists on that list of lists... if that made any sense. Lists are useless and are better served by categories.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:43, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Bah! How come we only see you in this vfd and not in one about any other list? If its about not liking lists in general, you go and try to change the WP policy about lists, not vote down individual lists. You dont like this specific list, since it at the monent containst Shi'a hadith, you said it in your nomination at the top! At least be honest about that.

<li>Sheesh! I said that I thought that the article ought to be renamed, to something like Hadith from the Sunni canon frequently quoted by Shi'a and that it should contain only Shi'a-preferred hadith. In fact, I think it should BE the hadith, not just a list of hadith. I don't quite get how wanting Shi'a-preferrred hadith re the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> (which seem to be the ones you're citing) in an article constitutes prejudice against the Shi'a. At least that cuts the whole project down to a manageable size. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:58, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. A systemic bias it is indeed. We can have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_apes.html" title="List of apes">list of apes</a>, but we cant have a list of hadith.

<li><b>Keep</b> and move to List of Hadith, but we should also have categories for each hadith. A basic overlaying "Hadith category" subdivided into smaller categories dependant on who recognizes which hadith. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> 23:38, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
