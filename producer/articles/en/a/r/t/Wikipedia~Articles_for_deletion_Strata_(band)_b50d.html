<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - They have an album on a notable label and their work has been featured in notable movie and video game releases. May not meet the letter of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as far as having TWO releases, but seems to meet the spirit of what Wikipedia is trying to accomplish. The inclusion of the article feels written in more good faith then these kind of AfDs are. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 23:02, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> -The label is more of a "anyone can produce their album" here kind of label. Their sole notability is as a local band that occasionally plays at small clubs. There is a reason for the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> policy. It is important to keep Wikipedia a serious encyclopedia, rather than a catalog of pop culture references and pages about our friends bands. Until they release a second album they should use myspace as a place to post their band info and promote their album. Wikipedia is not for promotion. The band does not have enough notibility to have had a page authored by someone who isn't a fan or acquaintance. If a member of the band, an acquaintance, or fan authors a page about someone it is possible vanity. Delete on grounds of non-notability of music band per Wikipedia itself, as well as Vanity, and self-promotion rather than informative content. If everyone puts up a page about themselves or their favorite local band against Wikipedia standards then Wikipedia will cease to have any order and serious content.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_hornet_0ed2.html" title="User:Green hornet">Green hornet</a> 23:48, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The band's site makes a vague reference to an international tour: "Sept. 6, 2005: The past year or so has been a lot of fun - touring in support of our album, shooting videos for 'the panic' and 'never there' - getting out there and meeting all of our fans, friends and supporters across the US and Canada."

<li><b>Keep</b> Per their tour page, they've done many national tours with many notable bands. That more than passe WP:MUSIC. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 11:58, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia. Put Elvis in there. You can even put Rev. Horton Heat in there. Those fellows were famous. They had a lot of music released. This band isn't notable according to Wikipedia policy. They have one release? How did it chart? Did it chart at all? Because anyone can have a cd out these days on certain labels. International tour? Maybe Canada is technically international. Its within walking distance of many American cities though. And playing all-ages venues that fit 50 people is a far cry from the kind of international tour that an actual notable like U2 puts on. Let's keep Wikipedia clutter free.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> confirm this band's claim of notability: we can't really assess if their tour was significant enough per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> since it is only mentioned on their own website. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxSem_bf93.html" title="User:MaxSem">Max<font size="+1"><i>S</i></font>em</a> 18:41, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I live in Los Gatos near where the band is from, and I follow the local music scene. This band isn't that big even in the local scene. Non-notable. friedchicken, maxsem, and hornet are right about <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<li><b>Keeep</b>. Claims to notability are valid, notable label, notable game, and the tour is just one more thing that achieves <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I did the google search and the results included their wikipedia article, which would be an absurd result to justify itself, as well as their own webpage, which anyone can have and will come up in google, and then a couple hits for the same local entertainment paper for a city that I had to look up. I don't think that google can be an exhibit of notable-ness unless the standard for notable is very low. I looked my own name up and came up with dozens of hits for myself, and dozens for other people with my name, despite its uncommonness. In the case of Strata also, many of the hits did not directly pertain to them, but pertainned to other things 'strata' since it is also a common word as well as their proper name. Google is easily misconstrued as a clue to notable, which it can never be- anyone can show up dozens of times. Try typing in your own name. Likely you will find comments you made in usenet, or a review of your high school football skills from 1989, or mention of you in the local Rotary chapter's web newsletter, or your myspace page. etc. Bluetie46 01:39, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
