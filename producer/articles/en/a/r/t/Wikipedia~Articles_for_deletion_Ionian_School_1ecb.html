<dd>The fact that this article was in several encyclopedias does not mean that it is not inherently misleading. Referring to any group of philosophers whose only common attribute was geography as a school is misleading--they didn't all agree with each other, and were from several different time periods in Ancient Greece. Perhaps this usage is sufficiently common that it should be retained in Wikipedia as a stub to point at schools of philosophy which are not arbitrary classifications. Anyway, I challenge anyone to come up with a different reason than geography for including all these philosophers in a 'school'. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteC_f18a.html" title="User:WhiteC">WhiteC</a> 02:23, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Let me retiterate and summarize, there is no Ionian school. I have no idea who on the Internet is promulgating the notion, but you know, once something gets said once, it gets repeated over and over. The pre-socratics are not physicalists, neither are they all monists. As for the panmetabolists, that term is incomprehensible to the general public and certainly is not ancient. Wikipedia seems to be having a lot of trouble with its philosophy. I suggest that getting back to basics will improve things considerably. Don't we have to think about the public? As a bottom line, I would like to say, if you have to start out by saying there really is no Ionian school, you aren;t building any confidence that what you say is true.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 19:28, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>PS</b> I'm really talking to you, aren't I , Karol? No, the reasons you cite are not enough to distinguish an Ionian school. The coast of Anatolia was diverse, Different dialects of greek and different languages were spoken there. So there is no geographic unity. As for the cultural background, it was Hellenic. The Ionians came from Attica and bronze age Peloponnesus. Why not call the Athenians Ionian? And the mythology, they didn't believe anything no other Hellene didnt believe. Where's the distinction? And physicalist? A very obscure neologism I dare say. It is nowhere defined. I don't see ANY method at all here, sir. No way to distinguish an Ionian school is presented.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 05:11, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am replying upon request. I don't doubt there were substantial differences between the particular Ionian philosophers, and we know they didn't "collaborate", but they <i>had</i> alot in common, at least in my view of them. I can't argue specifically about cultural backgrounds and history, because I don't feel knowledgable in that area. In any case, grouping philosophers into schools is really a <i>post factum</i> job, chronologically speaking, so the concept of "school" goes beyond who they were and what they spoke/wrote/thought to include our contemporary interpretation of their philosophies. I'm probably writing more than needed. Let me just add that <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physicalism.html" title="Physicalism">physicalism</a> is not a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> (you can also find references outside Wikipedia), and I know I used the term "off limits", but that was intended, becuase I couldn't find a better one at the moment - perhaps materialists? <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarol_Langner_26da.html" title="User:Karol Langner">Karol</a> 08:19, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. The discussion seems to be centering on the concept of materialism. See the next comment. My main doubt is that I do not see the "materialism" as distinctively Ionian.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 18:27, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The "Byzantine Empire" never considered itself that. To it's subjects, it was the Roman Empire, and they considered themselves Romans. They preserved Roman culture for nearly a thousand years after the Western Roman Empire fell. But historians have a problem with calling it the Roman Empire, because the original territory of the Roman Empire was lost. Oh well. They can call it whatever they want. It's a convention. That's what names are. Conventions. "Byzantine" makes it easy to differentiate the later Roman Empire from the earlier. Which brings us to the distinction of the Ionian school of philosophy. So what if it's geographically based. It's also called the Melesian school, also a geographical distinction. It was started by Thales of <i><b>Melitus</b></i>, so go figure. Thales had a couple really cool disciples (well one disciple and one sub-disciple), and some contemporaries who no doubt benefited from all their wisdom. Between the lot of them they pumped out enough philosophical <i>material</i> to be considered a school. For this, maybe we should call them "materialists". Hey, I can make any distinction I want, but that won't get it in an encyclopedia until it becomes some kind of consensus. But they are already materialists by another more popular distinction, and Ionians, so let them stay in our wonderful encyclopedia!!! We can work on my new definition of materialism later. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 16:18, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I recognize that the term 'Ionian School' has widespread usage. But I thought that since the 1911 Britannica article recognized that the term did not refer to a coherent classification scheme, perhaps it might be time (after almost a century) to remove it. I suppose I will have to keep the article, and try to stay NPOV in a (hopefully brief) discussion of classification schemes for philosophical schools in the article. I will start a discussion over on the Philosophy tasks, since this seems to be more specialized than just deletion.</dd>
<dd>Out of curiosity, what kind of criteria would an article from 1911 Brittannica have to meet in order for it to be deleted? Factual error and/or extreme bias? <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteC_f18a.html" title="User:WhiteC">WhiteC</a> 17:30, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More on materialism. I like the way this discussion is centering in on materialism, which is partly at the heart of the problem. I grant you many of the philosophers - Thales, etc. and the pluralists - DO seem to be concerned with the explanation of nature. 1) What do we moderns call their interest? I'm not sure materialism does the job, as our materialism (I think - maybe I'm wrong) implies that there is no spirit, no God even, and that matter and the laws of matter are supreme. None of the philosophers thought that. Also, we want to avoid any connection with our physics, as the only one who thought numerically was Pythagoras, and he is not an Ionian. 2) What do you do with the incipient skeptics - Heraclitus and Xenophanes etc. The latter is not in the article but he was an Ionian. Is Ionian to include all Ionians or just some of them?<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 18:27, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
