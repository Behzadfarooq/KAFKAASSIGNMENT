While I'm among the group that beleives that <i>no</i> individual episode of any television show (unless it changed history in some significant form or fashion) deserves an encyclopedia article, fanboys obviously beg to differ. However, articles for episodes of <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> ususally have at least some sort of encyclopedic information on production, referecnes, etc. These articles do not do such (they read very much like cut and paste jobs from TV.com or somewhere similar). Although I've loved <i>Scooby-Doo</i> cartoons since I was a baby, there's no way (without serious reaching and/or original research) that anything sufficiently encyclopedic could ever be drummed up for individual articles for the show's episodes. There's nothing to distinguish each episode from another on any artistic or scholarly level, and therefore there is no point in writing seperate articles for them. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 01:28, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Exactly my point. Can you imagine three-hundred and seventy-one articles about <i>Scooby-Doo</i> episodes? They fcould all be written with a template, with next-to-no modifications. And this is coming from someone who's probably seen at least three-hundred of those episodes. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 02:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd imagine that notability isn't an issue when it comes to <i>Scooby-Doo</i>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Badlydrawnjeff_6552.html" title="Special:Contributions/Badlydrawnjeff">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Notability is <i>always</i> an issue in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 02:08, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, somewhat unfortunately. To thnk that it's seriously an issue with episodes of <i>Scooby-Doo</i>, however, is somewhat hard to swallow. It's not like we're talking a little-known <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showtime.html" title="Showtime">Showtime</a> series or some incredibly minor actress. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 02:10, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...but this is supposed to be an <i>encyclopedia</i>, not a repository for episode synopses. If that's the case, I'll quit right now and contribute my writing skills elsewhere. I beleive that <i>Scooby-Doo</i> is, of course, a notable enough show to deserve an encyclopedia article here, but sepearte articles for each episode of this particular show, to be nice about it, absurd. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 02:18, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Aside from notability, it's always a good idea to <b>merge</b> related, stubby articles. I don't see any reason why these brief synopses warrant independence. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 02:15, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Expanding the episode guide to include short synopses would eliminate the need for idividual episode articles. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 02:18, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, I see your point. You're right, the most famous episode of the most famous TV show was a bad example. My problem with scooby is that all the episodes have the <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_scoobydoo_episode_9420.html" title="User:Mangojuice/scoobydoo episode">same plot</a>, and there are hundreds of them. Other shows' episode pages just seem to provide much more information and potential for expansion. Am I off base here? --<a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey"><font color="#000080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>N</strong></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>scheffey</strong></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/s/c/User_talk%7ENscheffey_d4cb.html" title="User talk:Nscheffey">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nscheffey_b4d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nscheffey">C</a>)</sup> 15:01, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>You make a perfectly valid point, certainly. The point, however, is that, yes, right now they're kinda short and arguably crappy, but this isn't some random show that no one knows, it's <i>Scooby Doo</i>, arguably one of the most popular cartoons of its time, if not all time. I'm inclusionist when it comes to television shows, yes, but this isn't, I dunno, <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_Monkey_0397.html" title="Love Monkey">Love Monkey</a></i>. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:10, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Important to note that all Scooby Doo,Where Are You! episodes are very similar to each other to the point of generating a kind of brainwashing effect <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:08, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>, second choice <b>Delete</b>. The show is notable. However, as many have mentioned above, any descriptions of the episodes not only are, but would have to be, very similar to each other. There is no point in having separate articles that say essentially the same thing. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:45, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge all</b>; the only thing that splitting information up like this does is make it harder for people to read.<br />
Some people may think that popular topics somehow "deserve" to have a lot of distinct articles. They don't: what they deserve is <i>high quality</i> articles, of whatever number is needed to provide that quality. Where an article is so long that it becomes awkward to read it, it is an improvement to break it up; when articles are so short that it becomes awkward to navigate them, it is an improvement to merge them. It's not like merging these would even result in any information being lost, let alone any knowledge.
