<li><b>Keep</b>. Obviously notable. There's unfortunately something missing in WP:BIO regarding non-sport competition, but she won the damn thing, how is that not notable? Besides, the Spelling Bee is also newsworthy, and she qualifies there, too. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:24, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weakest possible keep</b> Notwithstanding <a href="../../../n/b/d/WP%7ENBD_62b7.html" title="WP:NBD">WP:NBD</a>, the Rageshree Ramachandran discussion Zalgt adduces would seem to militate in favor of deletion, and the arguments made there are compelling. Nevertheless, I am inclined to think that, applying the <i>sportsperson</i> criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the subject is notable. The arguments of the many anons that the article ought to be kept because it's likely that many will search for Close in the wake of her victory not only fail to assert that the subject is notable and encyclopedic but also, in view of their insistence the temporal propriety of our having an article, seem to evince that Close will not be perceived as notable in the future and seem not to comport with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, viz., that Wikipedia is not a news service (cf., Wikinews). I think this to be a very close call; if Close is notable only per the <i>sportsperson</i> criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, then so too would be several <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Chess_Federation_9133.html" title="United States Chess Federation">United States Chess Federation</a> junior/amateur champions. For me, though, the decisive factor is the particular role of the spelling bee in the American media; Close has been sufficiently well-publicized as to merit <i>keep</i> (see, e.g., <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kristi_Yamaoka_%28second_nomination%29_2f2a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kristi Yamaoka (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kristi Yamaoka (second nomination)</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:39, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Since there is nowhere else for such information to be found, the article <i>should be kept</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. In addition to winning the Bee, she is a main subject of the book <i>American Bee: The National Spelling Bee and the Culture of Word Nerds</i> . Being the subject of a book is not sufficient reason to keep an article, but this is a notable new book about the history and culture of spelling bees and adds to Close's recognition. In any case, winners of the Bee are notable. Finally, the argument that not all winners have articles and she is notable for only one thing is absurd. The other winners also deserve articles and many biogrphical entries in Wikipedia describe people who are notable for achieving only one thing. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 02:26, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep this page. This girl deserves to have a page to herself. She should be and inspiration to everyone!</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Having this 80-year-old abecedarian competition televised on ESPN for a dozen years and now primetime ABC validates this event albeit endorsing the perverse compulsiveness imposed on these young competitors (and fostering the peculiar spectacle of adult pundits watching puerile antics produced by naive nervousness). Ms. Close, a five-year(!) competitor obviously worked long and hard for this victory and deserves all of the accolades she has received, including the posterity, such as it is, of a Wikipedia entry. --John 20:32, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> or <b>Redirect</b> Not notable enough. Working hard at memorizing dictionaries and winning at a spelling bee does not mean you deserve a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:55, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I can't believe you can be so disregarding of Close's efforts. I was an active participant of spelling bees until this year, and you will not believe how much stress these competitors have and how much nerve they have to even participate in the national spelling bee.

My stance is that every one deserve his/her own article. For spelling, the bee is the biggest event in the world; there might be a bit less fanfare (and a lot less prize money), but in this sense, the event is absolutely equal to winning the main event of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_of_Poker_0f50.html" title="World Series of Poker">World Series of Poker</a>- so long as they're of a certain age, absolutely anyone can enter, have a chance to win, and be known as a champion of said event for the rest of their lifetime.

For instance, one winner is now a ########## for the Bee, so he has one. She is significant because she won the first primetime spelling bee.</p>
<p>Keep it. The Bee is now prime-time, big-time, with books and movies. The winner is a culturally significant person.</p>
