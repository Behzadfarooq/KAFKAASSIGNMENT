<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. Though ostensibly there is a huge delete consensus, many of the delete voters seem to believe that content could be merged--since there is more than one article author this is not possible. Another reason for deletion given is the name--this can be solved by moving the article. One delete voter wanted deletion "per nom" although in fact the nominator was asking for merge suggestions.</p>
<p>There is therefore no consensus on a course of actions that can be performed under the GFDL. I therefore invoke the cornerstone of our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a>: <b>When in doubt, don't delete</b>.</p>
<p>This is a problem that cannot be solved by AfD. I ask those who think the content is useful to find a suitable article and merge, and those who think the title is wrong to move it to a new title and delete the redirect.</p>
<p>Closing is difficult, and it's easy to get it wrong. I would not oppose an early relisting of this article if anyone feels strongly that I have got it wrong. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 11:06, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not persuaded that the title is problematic enough to warrant deletion. On the presumption that the article is true, and items have been returned, they must have been at the least <i>taken</i> from Asia, and they certainly weren't <i>borrowed</i>! If they were 'taken' during conflict, they were probably stolen under any common definition. That the word might cause offense to some doesn't make it POV.

<li>Well, he will be releasing his second album in November.

<li><b>Comment</b> As I read this article, I am curious as to when these mixed teams were eliminated from the Olympics, and how the 1900 Summer games compare to other Olympics in this regard. (Were there mixed teams in 1896?) But I can't learn that from this article. Is there an article on the general phenomenon of mixed teams? If so, could it be linked here? If not, it should be written. Perhaps this article should be <b>moved</b> there and expanded to include mixed teams from other years. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 04:35, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The page consists entirely of arguments, polemics, and opinion. Where there are facts mentioned they are used as support and are incidental to the purpose of advancing the author's POV, and in any case are not supported by any references. The overall tone does not appear to have ever been intended to be encyclopedic. I do not see how anything could be salvaged from the article as it stands.

<li><b>Keep</b> users:sin-thetik 11:38 August 2005 (EST) the Sin Star page lists a CD released on a record label credited as Mind Pollution. I also will find the others if possible. The Writer did not place it on the Mind Pollution page for some reason. It also states there is no known discorgraphy left for Mind Pollution however as with Sin Star I am very familliar with this band. I can correct the rumors from the facts , rephrase the writing , and get it all within the guidelines.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - DavidConrad , you obviously aren't checking the sources out for one thing. You keep complaing about all of these external links when they go right to several pages on the net with information about them. Why don't you use your head and Google the names Davien Crow , Alison Bordan , Darien Starr , Nancy Marzulli , and so on and so forth&#160;? For Both Sin Star and Mind Pollution. Davien Crow returns some decent hits. <b>AND YES THE TOURS ARE VERIFIABLE&#160;!</b> all you have to do is use the Internet Archives to visit their former pages. These pages were cached several years ago and you can't alter them past when they are. There is a link to the internet archives (the way back machine) in the sources.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> They can both be found on [BYOFL.org BYOFL.org]. Honestly the number of sites with info on them is numerous. Perhaps they just arent at the top of the results list&#160;? Especially since they've been broken up a while. I might also add that Davien Crow is a member of <a href="http://bmi.com" class="external text" title="http://bmi.com" rel="nofollow">BMI</a>. There is a link on the Sin Star page. However you can look up Crow , Davien using the correct paremters (songwriter I think) and it will show up as well.
<ul>
<li><b>EDIT</b> I have overhauled the entire page. Fixed information, removed promotional or biased language, corrected spelling mistakes (that I found). I added more information and properly cited all references. Hope you guys reconsider. If anything it may be wise to merge Mind Pollution with Sin Star but both currently fit the guidelines under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and I beleive all of the other broken guidelines have been corrected as well. I am new to Wikipeidia , so please be more constructive with your criticism so that I may donate to articles correctly and provide Wikipedia with new information that it does not yet have.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The link you provided "that appears to be another artist" is to an amature-semi-pro porn star. Not a band. Those quotes can easly be derived from the News section at <a href="http://sinstar.net/community/" class="external free" title="http://sinstar.net/community/" rel="nofollow">http://sinstar.net/community/</a> , their main site is currently under construction (though a version was up some time ago). The entry is made by a fan , however I have been working to try to get it "corrected" to fit the guidelines get the sources correct. One important source that seems to have been missed is <a href="http://www.mushroomcloudrecords.com/wwbhvol2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mushroomcloudrecords.com/wwbhvol2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mushroomcloudrecords.com/wwbhvol2.htm</a> which I will be adding myself to the Mind Pollution page and Sin Star page. This article is worth keeping , The number of external links is to site the sources .. ALL of the other links are links to the sites promoting sin star since one of the accomplishments of Sin Star (an important fact) is the internet promotion with these sites &amp; people (such as <a href="../../../g/i/d/Gidget_Gein_afd5.html" title="Gidget Gein">Gidget Gein</a> whom have done so stricly out of charity. SMNnews.com is one of the largest sites on the internet for Music News. So is Blabbermouth.net .. Marilyn-Manson.net is listed on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> page. The promotional items are still viewable on those sites and on <a href="http://smnpromotions.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://smnpromotions.com" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. <a href="../../../g/i/d/Gidget_Gein_afd5.html" title="Gidget Gein">Gidget Gein</a> whom is <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a>'s former bass player has varifiable connections with Sin Star <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0311988/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/name/nm0311988/bio" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> , <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> has verifiable connections with sin star <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/daviencrow/9948.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/daviencrow/9948.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Another link between them and manson is the fact that their manager (voluntarily) was Nancy Marzulli , whom is itnerviewed in VH1's Manson Biography for being his Editor at the magazine 7th Parallel. Her involment can be viewed by visiting by seeing some of the drama unfolding after they let her ho <a href="http://www.sinstar.net/community/showthread.php?t=782" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sinstar.net/community/showthread.php?t=782" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> or on several other topics containing "Clasmate" or "Nancy" in the subject line in <a href="http://www.sinstar.net/community/forumdisplay.php?f=17&amp;page=2&amp;sort=lastpost&amp;order=&amp;pp=20&amp;daysprune=-1" class="external text" title="http://www.sinstar.net/community/forumdisplay.php?f=17&amp;page=2&amp;sort=lastpost&amp;order=&amp;pp=20&amp;daysprune=-1" rel="nofollow">The Recycling Bin</a> for the sites old posts. Her name is also in the MTV Article as the author , she is after all a journalist. Tons of info can be found here <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/sinstar/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/sinstar/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> with links and sources. I hope you reconsider the signifigance of the links listed on the page , they aren't spam. The phrases contained within the page that are "promotional" could easily be edited out by onw of you as well.
<ul>
<li><b>Edit</b> I have done a complete overhaul of the page , added all missing information I could find , correctly cited my references , added some more information I came across (related to media appreances and relationships with bands such as [marilyn manson] and artists such as [gidget gein]) , and well just look for yourself. Most of your complaints are now taken care of. Oh and honestly , how do you expect fan pages and music sites to compete with Porn sites selling amature porn&#160;? 04:22, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus.</b> Vote as I have it is 33 for delete, 22 for merge and 19 for keep. So 52 of 74 votes want it to be deleted in some way. If you discount some of the anon votes, the percentage is higher. The problem is whether to delete or merge. For now, let's wait. I will put a note on the talk page about the vote. Once the target article is made, then we can merge and redirect or just delete the article. We do have similar memorials for 9/11 at [<a href="http://sep11.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memoriam" class="external autonumber" title="http://sep11.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memoriam" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>].

<li>Just because notability initially stems from someone being dead or missing does not mean that notability is not warrented.

See <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Sheehan_da7a.html" title="Cindy Sheehan">Cindy Sheehan</a>. 64.59.209.89
<ul>
<li>Point, but Cindy Sheehan practically has a daily column in a number of newpapers and is <u>protesting</u> the death of her son, whereas Harvey Jackson's wife died in a natural disaster, had a 2-minute piece on some television channels, and he's not protesting anything or otherwise doing anything notable except having a wife who died in a hurricane. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 19:47, September 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree he is not as famous as Cindy Sheehan. However, it's arguable his story has been covered by as wide a range of media as Mrs. Sheehan, if not as repeatedly.

<li>He's not doing anything, nor has he asked for coverage within or without of Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>O.K. He's not doing anything special, so what makes the world's response to this paticular interview special? Why shou;d this interview be mentioned in the response to Hurricane Katrina? Isn't it just another survivor story? As far as I can tell, all that should remain of this article is a sentence in the Effect of Hurricane Katrina article saying something like, "The world feels great sympathy for the sufferers of this hurricane," and have this as a source.

But where should we merge it too, we have to figure that out now. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 21:09, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why not remove the vfd notice from article and leave it until the destination article is written? As of right now, there is no destination article but the consensus is we want to save this material 69.142.21.24 22:08, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps we should postpone this decision until things have settled down; at the time being, it's difficult to keep any article detailing rescues/evacuations in order due to the constantly changing nature of events. I'm guessing that in a couple of weeks, the dust will have settled some and things can take a more coherent order. In any case, by then it'll be easier to understand the notability of Jackson's story in light of other survivors and integrate it into wherever it ends up. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadsalmon_0aca.html" title="User:Deadsalmon">Deadsalmon</a> 06:12, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I think a strong argument can be made that tables of contents and similar material would fall under Fair Use, at least under U.S. law, considering the statutory criteria for a Fair Use balancing test. Also, WP routinely features lists of music recording tracks (CD contents, etc.), which are part of the copyrighted work, but also, to my mind, fall under fair use. In this specific case, however, even if permissible under Fair Use, I agree that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 18:57, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just count the keep votes, Zoe. If I'm on my own in this, where did those keep votes come from? And don't say it's because I added a bibliography. The original article already enumerated her published works. At the very least it should have been listed on VfD, not speedied.

<li>Then I take it you agree we can skip the unnecessary <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">instruction creep</a> since I almost invariably only rescue and improve articles that are capable of surviving a VfD. I refuse to get involved in VFU because (1) Wikipedia undeletion policy says I don't have to and (2) it would be asking people to vote on the status of an article few of them could see and none of them could edit. It would be silly to engage in editing an encyclopedia with one hand tied behind one's back. Arbcom can make arbitrary decisions, we grant it that right. I won't grant <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVFU_e156.html" title="WP:VFU">WP:VFU</a> the right to make arbitrary and unaccountable decisions, permitting it to rubber stamp a deletion by one sysop, without the right of general scrutiny by all editors.

<li>One thing which you <i>can</i> do if you are worried about other users not being able to see the content when listing things on VFU is to make a temporary undeletion. That is, undelete, replace with a {{TempUndelete}}-template, and protect. That way, the voters on VFU will be able to make a fully informed decision. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:04, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> and <b>delist</b> from VfD. —<b>RaD Man</b> (<i>talk</i>) 06:59, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">Kiss</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">L</a> 09:50, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Guys, I'm lucky enough not to know much about either Tony or Aaron or any of the others involved in the above discussion. What I <i>can</i> see is this:
<ul>
<li>The page was created with enough content for a stub and two assertions about notability ((1) the subject having published poetry and (2) her having translated the Epic of Kings). Note that <i>assertion <b>not</b> proof</i> of notability is required.</li>
<li>The page was speedy deleted per criterion A7, although it does not fulfill that criterion (because there <i>are</i> assertions). <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> explicitly states: <i>"If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to VFD instead."</i></li>
<li>The page was directly undeleted by Tony Sidaway. Given that the deletion was out of process (as shown above), this action is acceptable. The <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">undeletion policy</a> explicitly states: <i>"If the page was obviously deleted "out of process" (i.e. not in accordance with current deletion policy), then a sysop may choose to undelete immediately. In such a case, the sysop who deleted the page should be informed of the undeletion and the reason for it. If deletion policy dictates that the undeleted page is a VfD candidate, please list it there."</i> From his contribution list though, Tony seems to have failed to inform the deleting sysop of the undeletion; also, he didn't immediately list the page here.</li>
<li>The page was deleted again (this time by another admin) with the rationale "Undeleted out of process", which is not a speedy deletion criterion. Tony restored it again, which is therefore again acceptable; but he did not inform the deleting sysop, which is again a mistake. This time, he listed the page here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So, the three sysops involved all made mistakes. But I think those mistakes alone haven't caused much harm to Wikipedia (we are here discussing the article, a consensus is going to emerge, and that's that). I think the most harm is caused by the above <i>violations of <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> by <b>sysops</b></i>. Please. This kind of discussion would have belonged to your user talk pages, or nowhere. I'm amazed that a plain editor like myself has to say this. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">Kiss</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">L</a> 09:50, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're right. I shouldn't let myself be provoked into responding. On the idea of listing the page the first time I undeleted, I don't think that would be in order. Since the article was obviously a good one and the precedents strongly suggested notability, there was no reason at that time to consider a VfD listing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 11:03, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You could try to play well with others. User:Lucky 6.9 deleted two articles which I thought should be kept, and I wrote him a note asking him if he would mind if I undeleted them, giving my reasoning. He agreed and thanked me for asking beforehand. If you had just communicated with the other admin involved beforehand, giving your reasoning, none of this kerfuffle would have occured. But you prefer, as you indicated above, to score points against others instead of working as a community. You are on record as having nothing but scorn for the VfU process, which others feel works just fine, and prefer to cowboy it alone instead of trying to garner consensus. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 19:49, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The thing is, the only factually correct information this article contains is (1) that MSZP (<i>not</i> MaSZoP: this is a twisted version of the name which sounds similar to "it sucks", used colloquially by those who dislike that party) won the elections in 2002 (though <i>not</i> with 52%, see <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Hungary_ac95.html" title="Politics of Hungary">Politics of Hungary</a>), and (2) that Péter Medgyessy (<i>not</i> Medgyessi) resigned in August 2004, and was subsequently replaced by Ferenc Gyurcsány (but there was nothing like a "coup"). Both points are pretty much covered elsewhere. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">Kiss</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">L</a> 11:06, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. I'm being generous here, and considering the commentary by Grey Pursuit to likely be the anon who had previously been editing the article; it seems fair to allow the principal author to want to keep. I'm also considering OmegaWikipedia, they aren't a AfD regular, but that is no disqualification and they edit extensively in pop music articles. The comment by Rightsaidfred was their 8th edit and disregarded. At raw vote count, that's 11d-5k and just above the traditionalish 2/3 threshold. Reading the debate, there are many delete votes that feel this is either a collection of indiscriminate information or a 'meta-article', and the few reasons associated with the keepers don't persuade me that the ordinary thresholding is not a useful guidance here. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 01:27, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's quite a bit of precedent for keeping discography info, and since Carey is undoubtedly a popular singer with a considerable history, we can afford to have some detail in this area.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Besides which, something like <a href="http://www.discogs.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.discogs.com/" rel="nofollow">Discogs.com</a> is the best place for this kind of thing; once this article is up, people will create remixographies for everyone, including themselves, non-notable artists etc, because it's much easier to do than researching the life and times of King Henry II etc. Perhaps there could be a separate music Wikipedia. In the scheme of things, Mariah Carey is a transient phenomenon. After she grows old there'll be nothing left.

<li><b>Keep</b>, if the title of the article is changed to a 'List of Official Remixes' instead of 'Remixography', then the debate over whether it is a discography or not could be settled. However, if some still believe that the article should be deleted, wouldn't that put into question other articles such as the 'Videography of Mariah Carey', where the information included could be found in detail in the individual singles articles, and the 'List of Songs By Mariah Carey', which can easily be found through articles based on each of her albums? Both of those articles also happen to be 'meta-articles'. On the matter of whether it is necessary of not, considering the miniscule impact made by pop music on the world, isn't a strong enough argument; it isn't the only thing that is unimportant, on a global scale, featured in this encyclopedia. An encyclopedia is a 'general' compendium of knowledge, that is not limited to 'worldly' information. At this moment of time, Mariah Carey, unarguably, is a well-known icon and if ever they'll be "nothing left" of her legacy, then the existence of not just this article, but a large portion of her encyclopedia entry could be debated. Surely, that itself would be unnecessary, wouldn't you think? Grey Pursuit 17:27, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>You know, I would not have thought that an article on a ham and cheese sandwich could have been encyclopedic, but this is actually pretty darn good. It's not a recipe, it's a full description, and it relates it to other types of food.

<li><b>keep</b> This article is a good description of a ham and cheese sandwich. Something has to distinguish wikipedia from standard boring encyclopedias and to me this is it. It's also worth noting that while the big events of the day are recorded everywhere, the minutiae of everyday life aren't, and it's the minutiae of everyday life that can prove the most interesting to people in the future.</li>

What are you talking about. THis is the best band around. DO you even live in melbourne. dont give me that -'no discography to speak of'- posh tone. just say they have no cd out yet... its not that hard... say it with me... they have no cd out yet... just wait till you see 3xc on the front cover of a mag saying "Best of the Best". Get with the times.... Posted by Raph <small>(previous unsigned comment by user:138.217.52.192)</small></p>

<dd>I never said that 3XC is not the best band around. That is your personal opinion and I will not challenge it. Anyway, please have a look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for Wikipedia's policy on the level of notability required for an article. 3XC appears to qualify for none of the criteria mentioned in that article. Finally, I would like to suggest using Talk:3XC for discussions regarding the band, as well as regarding the policy in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<p>Everyone deserves a chance so I'll support you guys *ary is standing behind me with a gun*. But for the public to decide, if you have noticed, half of the entire 3xc team(including people like producers etc..) are asians!When have you ever seen an asian group reach the number one charts? But then again because you haven't you might want to support it for that reason...Jay-T</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. For those of you who say that we in Jews Against Circumcision are not really Jews, I hate to break it to you but all you need to be Jewish is to have a Jewish mother. That's Jewish law. Circumcision IS NOT required to be Jewish. My mom is Jewish. I had a Bar Mitzvah and I had a Jewish wedding. So guess what guys, I am a Jew. Now, about the subject matter. Why are you all so threatened? Is it because you don't want to have to be faced with the decision that mutilating your baby's penis is barbaric, mean, wrong and against the mitzvot (we are commanded to not mark our bodies or hurt others - remember that?) It's a no-brainer. Mutilating your son's penis and damaging his future sex life is despicable, and all of you are smart enough to realize that. Yes it's difficult to deal with the fact that our people have been wrong all of these years, but guess what, they have been. Think about how easy it is to look at other religions and see how their practices are wrong (like africans and female genital mutilation, mormons and polygamy, the lack of women's rights in all religions, etc,.) and then take a step back, look at your own religion, and realize it's shortcomings. Circumcision is wrong. Judaism is in your heart, not in your penis! Jews Against Circumcision 02:54, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Was that a personal attack? Is your vote based solely upon your dislike of the nominator?

<li>Not only was it a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>, it is also an example of failing to <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">assume good faith</a>, and demonstrates complete ignorance of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, which means that no article should be for or against anything. <i>Sigh.</i> - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 11:51, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is not a personal attack, but an observation. Another observation is that when someone points out observations like this, you write personal attack.

<li>Does this not just state that you're not considering the significance or non-significance of the article to Wikipedia, which is the question here, and rather taking a POV on the issue discussed in the article and using that as the basis for your "keep"? I was the one who proposed a VfD, although I did not create it, on the talk page in question, and I did not propose it because I disagreed, but rather because I think it does not need its own article, at least at this stage, and would much better be found in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brit_milah.html" title="Brit milah">Brit milah</a> where the information is already available in no less quantity than this article. Furthermore, the concept is much more important than the organisation itself. --<a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 01:51, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Walabio, my personal feelings towards 'genital integrity' do not and furthermore should not make the slightest bit of difference. The same is true of your feelings towards 'circumcisionadvocates'. They are <i>irrelevant</i>. Wikipedian <i>actions</i> are all that matter, and here that means just the vote and reasons stated. Your observation that personal attacks are noted for what they are should come as no surprise. Neither, for that matter, should an RFC on this behaviour if it continues for much longer... - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 09:28, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Location Located on the vibrant street of Ford Road in the midst of a heavily saturated Arab and Muslim population, Fordson High School presents the epitome of immigration assimilation in America. Whether its G-Unit apparrel being worn in the newly constructed cafetria or a white Bentley with 22 inch chrome wheels, the stigma of modernization has truly spread across the students of this school. Thus, identity crisis has persisted due to lack of understanding of who they really are. Academics Fordson offers a dual semester program, with classes ranging from How to Cut a Knife with Purcell or Literatue/Philosophy with Misiakian (which offers nothing except nothing!)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - this vote is precisely why you deletionists are losing vote after vote after vote. Your criteria is simply ridiculous, and this childish delete vote comment demonstrates the problem. Many inclusionists believe that schools are inherently notable. While that is a debatable hypothesis, the obverse is simply not true. I can obviously hold that a school should be included because it is a school on the basis that schools are inherently notable, but it is ridiculously absurd to suggest that any given school should not be included on the basis of it being a school. <b>Some</b> schools are notable and encyclopaedic by even the most restrictive standards.

That is very helpful and a Good Thing. Factionalizing the debate and repeating stale old assertions over and over again is not helpful. Making general remarks about how all schools in general should be handled is not helpful.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I hadn't even noticed that the article was authored by user Jouk pleiter, and openly states that the "declarative programming" model of Ajax was "introduced in a vision paper by Backbase's Jouk Pleiter." This pretty much seals the spamminess of this all for me; I've changed my vote to a strong delete. (And note that the only editor of the page other than the VfD nominator is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.58.16.163_915d.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.58.16.163">62.58.16.163</a>, who acknowledges that he is Jouk Pleiter in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ajax_%28programming%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22245904" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ajax_%28programming%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22245904" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Why Keep this Article? Of course I'm open about my identity. The programming model of Declarative AJAX is very different from JavaScripting AJAX. If you look at declarative GUI programming models like <a href="../../../x/u/l/XUL_0f40.html" title="XUL">XUL</a> (mozilla foundation), <a href="../../../m/x/m/MXML_9c72.html" title="MXML">MXML</a> (macromedia), <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laszlo.html" title="Laszlo">Laszlo</a> (OpenLaszlo) and <a href="../../../x/a/m/XAML_8cbf.html" title="XAML">XAML</a> (microsoft) it is very logic to have a dedicated page on Declarative AJAX. I agree with you that it is a sub flavor of the overall AJAX trend. But I don't see the argument that sub-flavors cannot have their own article. The fact that the previous mentioned declarative GUI programming models all have their onw article, justify (in my opinion) the reason for a Declarative AJAX page. Regarding to your point that at this moment there is only one contributor: it seems to me that there are many pages on WP that have only one or two contributors. The Ajax page seem to have a limited number of contributors as well (one being yourself and sleepyhead if i'm right). If I understand it correctly any topic should have the right to be listed on WP (as long as it follows the guideliness) and it also should have the chance to allow other people to contribute. Jouk pleiter</li>

<dd>Jouk, please only vote once. In addition, nobody's arguing that the fact that the article has only one author is an issue, but rather that the article acknowledges that that one author -- you -- is the originator of the concept of "declarative programming" in Ajax. (I point you again to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>, the vanity guidelines, that frown upon article creation under these pretenses.) In addition, absent any discussion of who authored the page, the concept that has no notability whatsoever (see the Google search above); if it takes off and becomes something huge, then perhaps the article will resurface at that point. I just posted a note to <a href="../../../j/o/u/User_talk%7EJouk_pleiter_c37f.html" title="User talk:Jouk pleiter">your account user page</a>, in the spirit of helping you understand a bit more what Wikipedia is about and what the guidelines are regarding behavior here; I am being honest in my offer to help you understand why creation of an article like this isn't the best thing to do, and likewise, why the addition of links all over Wikipedia to the company you're CEO of isn't the best thing to do. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelfuego_f845.html" title="User talk:Delfuego">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Delfuego_af3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Delfuego">c</a></small> 15:15, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologise if this page breaks the sites T's &amp; C's. I did check before I made it and there are other pages descibing websites. Google for example. I would like to see it remain but if it must be removed then fair enough. Or maybe I could change it so it complies with your rules.</p>
<p>I feel I must point out that I am not the owner of the site so I am not getting any personal gain from posting it on here. The site is a useful tool for pool players not just in the United Kingdom but all over the world.</p>

<li>According to the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">proposed Wikipedia importance policy</a>, an article should not be deleted on the basis of notability if one of the following is true:
<ol>
<li>there is clear proof that a reasonable number of people (eg. more than 500 people worldwide) are or were <i>concurrently</i> interested in the subject.</li>
<li>the subject has been <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer-reviewed</a>.</li>
<li>it is an expansion (of reasonable length, not a stub) upon an established subject.</li>
<li>discussion on the article's talk page (using this policy as a guideline) otherwise establishes its importance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Of these, I think that there is a chance that point 1 could be true, and points 2-4 are most certainly not true. But point 1 requires "clear proof." Can anyone supply this?</li>
<li>There's another factor, however. The article as it stands today is uninformative but not otherwise terribly offensive. I suspect we wouldn't be having this discussion if not for the sockpuppets on both <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_ANTs_Data_Server_4657.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/ANTs Data Server">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/ANTs Data Server</a> and the fact that some of those same sockpuppets repeatedly posted fiction to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_relational_database_management_systems.html" title="Comparison of relational database management systems">Comparison of relational database management systems</a> while making threatening comments to people who reverted their changes in the edit summaries. The sockpuppets, the threats, the posting of fiction, and the stealing of content from other user pages are clearly wrong, but that's not what we're being asked to vote on.</li>
<li>I suppose the implication of this vote is that if the ANTs page goes away then ANTs could be permanently removed from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_relational_database_management_systems.html" title="Comparison of relational database management systems">Comparison of relational database management systems</a> and thereby stop or reduce the sockpuppets posting fiction to that page. Nobody appears to want to actually do the research to make the ANTs content accurate — I certainly don't. I personally believe that it would be fine to include ANTs if someone who cared would look up the real answers to the points on the comparison chart, but until that is done it is better to have ANTs not included than to have misleading / incorrect info on the page.</li>
<li>At any rate, I'm not passionate about the 500 people interested limit, but I am passionate about issues of fact in article content, so I will decide my vote in the following manner: If the folks posting the ANTs content will remove the hyperbole from this article and fix the factual errors in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_relational_database_management_systems.html" title="Comparison of relational database management systems">Comparison of relational database management systems</a>, then I will vote to keep. If the articles remain the way they are I'll vote to delete on the basis of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Spam</a>. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 16:38, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Tony, I sincerely apprecite the clarification regarding <i>proposed</i> policy. But I don't see how merging my paragraphs, which were a single comment and not a vote, into multiple bullet points in the list <b>with the votes</b> improves readability. I put the separator in the original version to make it clear that the discussion was separate from the list of votes since I don't intend to vote until the folks who submitted the ANTs material have a (second, third, whatever) chance to fix it.

<li>The article is semi-literate and of poor quality, with many misspellings including the title (<i>-craty</i> vs. <i>-cracy</i>). The only support for it here is from the same IP address as the creator of the article, and is written in the same style -- presumably the writer of the article, but he or she distances him- or herself from the "writher". Is the article then quoting some other work? Who is the "writher" of that work, and is it copyrighted? All of these problems could be resolved, but what would we be left with? An article on an unheard-of neologism that is unverifiable.

<li><b>Delete</b>...The Quick Index pointed out by <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">User:Titoxd</a> renders this page obsolete and redundant. <s><b>Keep</b></s>. I am the creator of this particular page, and I appreciate the input from folks who wish to delete it as well as those who wish to keep it. This and related pages serve two purposes. First, a technical purpose: to assist in keeping disambiguation pages from showing up at <a href="../../../l/o/n/Special%7ELonelypages_2fac.html" title="Special:Lonelypages">Orphaned pages</a>, which therefore means it assists in the goals of the pages related to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Wikipedia%7ELinks_to_disambiguating_pages_8688.html" title="Wikipedia:Links to disambiguating pages">Wikipedia:Links_to_disambiguating_pages</a>. Second, a content purpose: considering Wikipedia's role as both a comprehensive encyclopedia as well as a repository of almanac-like content, pages of this kind assist in determining the extent of coverage and point toward gaps in article coverage, particularly with regard to disambiguation and acronym-based redirects. I would suggest that if there is a consensus to delete, which I doubt will emerge in the end, that rather than being deleted outright these various pages be transwiki'd to Wiktionary as appendices (similar to the appendices <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Names" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Appendix:Names">Names</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Types_of_companies" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Appendix:Types_of_companies">Types of companies</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Concordances" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:Concordances">Concordances</a>). Another option that is actually more consistent with the two points I made above is to move these into the Wikipedia-namespace, where they would serve their technical and QC/administrative purposes outside the main article space; this change would be accomplished by a simple move-action, an action that I would consider taking if a delete consensus is reached. Considering these alternatives, I would appreciate your not acting to <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now#Dialogue" class="extiw" title="q:Apocalypse_Now">"terminate with extreme prejudice"</a> this and related pages. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 00:17, 1 September 2005 (UTC) <i>I made a modification that conflicted with the edit/comment below ... it doesn't impinge on the interpretation of the edit below</i>

The technical issue around appearance of pages on Orphaned Pages remains, but that could be dealt with by another means, such as altering the mechanics of Orphaned Page detectection, such as excluding articles with titles of 1, 2, or 3 characters (just a thought). <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 11:52, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>KEEP</b>. The nominator has changed to allow a keep (there being no other support for a merge). Also, the TIME article appears to have only been pointed out after the first two deletes. Thus, the suggestion of nonsense doesn't hold and the question of national secrecy is answered (but wouldn't be a reason anyway — meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> means it can't possibly be secret).

<dd>Using Nakapoopoo's lemma, it is clear that this value must be positive, unless it's negative or zero. Next consider primes in an arithmetic sequence and correlate them with the lattice polygons and their associated toric varieties. You may be saying, how does this relate to algebraic potato? Well, the mirror partner to the given toric variety is exactly the potato in question. The proof is long and complex but very enlightening.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is very serious fraud. Dpbsmith, thank you for writing an email to Morgan. You are very important! And I believe - as most of us - that the undergraduate evil-doers should be severely punished. Taking down the pages is not enough. Let's waste more time from Columbia professors and make sure they identify these underlings and turn them in, to the Wikicourt, where these overpriviledged ivy-leaguers will have to explain their malignant summer activities.

<dd>(Shrug) When I don't know about something, I ask. My experience is that most professors are pretty amiable and willing to help out. I was always willing to "waste" professors' time by asking questions when I was in college, and I'm willing to do it now. Professor Morgan lists himself as the contact for the department, and I think it's perfectly appropriate to contact people who have indicated a willingness to be contacted.</dd>
<dd>I <i>don't</i> think the students should be "forced to take those student pages down," since those pages <b>don't</b> make any claim of being endorsed by the institutions hosting the pages.</dd>

<dd>An article was recently contributed to Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, entitled "Algebraic potato." Most of us think the article is patently a joke or hoax. Wikipedia gets these all the time and doesn't regard them as a serious matter.
