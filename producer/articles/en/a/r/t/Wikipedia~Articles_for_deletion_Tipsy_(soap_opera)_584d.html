<li><b>Delete</b> no assertion of notability, appears the huge article was copy and pasted from a website due to the mutated formatting.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndypandy.UK_6e9d.html" title="User:Andypandy.UK"><font style="background:white">Andeh</font></a> 21:30, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'not for things made up in school' principle has been taken out of context. Tipsy should not be compared to yo-yo crazes and the like. Simply, some aspects of school life provided the creative inspiration for Tipsy, but it was no more 'made up in school' than Harry Potter or Malory Towers. Admittedly, the wording of the article is misleading, suggesting that the actual soap opera began as a joke, rather than the concept behind it. There could be case for reducing the size of the article as it is certainly quite lengthy, but not for its deletion as Tipsy is a fairly well-known and significant soap opera. A recent edit does assert its notability. The 'episode guide' was in all likelihood copy and pasted, as Andypandy suggests - not, however, from a website, but from Tom Lane's original notes that he wrote while planning plot outlines and subsequently sent to various local media establishments for their use. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.134.80.113 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.134.80.113_92a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.134.80.113">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> In regard to the notability of the soap, I can confirm, as a resident of west London, that 'Tipsy' has caused a large stir locally, through word of mouth more than anything else. The gung-ho deletists need to remember that it is difficult to determine the notability of local matters from afar, and as most wikipedia regulars know, the google test is not foolproof. The 'made up in school' debate seems irrelevant - the Beatles originated from a group of school friends, but I'm sure we all agree they deserve an entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.134.80.113 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.134.80.113_92a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.134.80.113">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Its fairly clear that a soap with 500 episodes of information this does exist. I can understand why someone in Canada might not be able to appreciate quite how popular a soap is within a certain region of the Uk but it has certainly progressed beyond any notion of being just a school joke. I beleive that most episodes of the soap were viewed via a direct line to the host server which was only available for short periods of time. It was notoriously difficult to watch episodes at the time and it is unsurprising that they are hard to come across now. However, I noticed that the article actually now has a link to the a site withe several transcripts with almost 40,000 words which provides pretty good evidence.

<li><b>Delete</b> "tom-lane tipsy soap-opera" gets one ghit, this article,so it misses <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> by miles but not <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>.

<p>Comment: Tipsy's success continues to grow and, as a recent edit shows, it is currently in negotiations with a national network for screening. Even if it didn't pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> before, it certainly does now.</p>
