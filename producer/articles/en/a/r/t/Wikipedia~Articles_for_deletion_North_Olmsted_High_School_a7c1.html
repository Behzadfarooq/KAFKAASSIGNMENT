<li>I was referring to the creating (or expanding) of articles on schools; surely you're not suggesting that the WikiProject Schools is responsible for the school deletion nominations? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 14:16, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, actually I wrongly thought that this is what you were suggesting. Nor does that WikiProject govern the creating and expanding of school articles. They seem to be largely spontaneously occurring wikifauna. Their may be a fairly strong sieve effect favoring the deletion of schools outside the developed world, even taking into account the geographical concentrations of Wikipedians; less verifiable information is available. Ideas on how that might be counteracted would be welcome. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:38, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See, that is precisely the problem. I'm talking about expanding or creating articles on schools outside of the US/UK area, and you are talking about countering the deletion of them. I've asked the very same question at WikiProject schools, but it seems that project is mostly inactive these days. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 08:44, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Schools are inherently of little notability and have no encyclopedic value. An exceptionally small number, around 20, may have notability owing to age and quality of alumni. The rest are simply entirely insignificant. Worse, 99% of these articles exist merely to burden WP servers, because they contain only non-encyclopedic information you're supposed to get from the directory.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not a notable high school, and the only people who would look this up are the people that live in the area and went to the school. Their only claim to fame is that they won a soccer championship and was attended by a semi-notable historian. My high school was visited by a president and won dozens of state titles, but that doesn't mean it deserves an article, because nobody cares about a little ol' school in the suburbs of a big city.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think this is very interesting. I haven’t been here in over six months when there was a pretty even chance of this breaking even for keep/delete. Back then i was a deletionist and i am not going to say that the big shift in community opinion comes as a pleasant discovery. However, if our space ever outgrows our resources and something such as downsizing is necessary, i think you can rest assured that non-notable schools will be at least looked at as a target. if nothing else other people who arnt in support of these articles will jump at the chance. After this in time iv found that i dont really care and just wish this amount of energy could be focused don bringing our species description articles as up to date because were sorely lacking support in that area. Since species are more important than a simple human institution, the vigor of the support for the articles somewhat mystifys me. <a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFledgeling_731d.html" title="User:Fledgeling">Fledgeling</a> 04:34, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unlike schools, species articles are not "endangered" (as it were) on wikipedia, and therefore do not need so much support. Since storage space is essentially free, the online version of wikipedia will never run out. Cut-down versions of wikipedia would however be useful for distribution, and for providing random page users with a more educational experience. These versions can be provided in a non-destructive way by rating or tagging existing pages, e.g. the recent <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/En_validation_topics" class="extiw" title="meta:En_validation_topics">validation proposal</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:16, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Why are so many suggesting that they stop being nominated "until consensus is reached"? I suggested not nominating them because they won't be deleted; in other words for practical, not philosophical reasons. There is <b>no current discussion</b> on consensus. Wikipedia Schools is dead. There is <b>no ongoing effort</b> to reach consensus, since the pro-school faction seem to resent any effort to put a bar on notability, as is their right, since they view all schools as notable.

<li>I agree. There's no ongoing effort; all talks have broken down. Until and unless the strongly inclusionist trend of the past four months either declines significantly, or solidifies into a consensus to keep schools, we'll have an impasse and VfD will be the appropriate forum for resolving the matter.</li>
<li>I'd observe that those supporting the existence of school articles have become better at concentrating their energy on nominated school articles, using the five-day lag time to research and clean up articles. Those opposing school articles have only one realistic response to this: to concentrate on preschools and other more controversial entries. This could be a realistic way of building support for the case that there should be some kind of boundary (which I would support--unverifiable entries, which preschools tend to be, shouldn't be on Wikipedia). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:10, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The only real hope for those opposing school entries will be a serious decline of 'inclusionism'. Supporters will eventually turn to preschools and other institutions which may be less notable and research and clean up the articles in the same way now being undertaken for other schools. The view that schools are inherently notable includes private schools of all shape, preschools and other forms of schools. All VfD does at present, is force the cleaning up and researching of school stubs within the five-day lag time. In the meantime, the only sensible thing is continue VfD and for the 'inclusionists' to continue suggesting "stop nominating". This will be my vote on all schools I vote to <b>keep</b> from now on (or <b>Bicycle</b>).--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 20:37, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>So you're saying that <i>all</i> schools are important and deserve articles. Nobody's going to be writing a paper about school in metro Cleveland, where this information would be needed. The school has no importance, like many schools, and the article is useless. Should I make an article about my preschool, because our restroom had only one toilet and many kids, or how we couldn't go outside for our picnic because it was raining... no. It's pointless information, and nobody cares. The line has to be drawn somewhere.
