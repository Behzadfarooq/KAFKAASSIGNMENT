<p>The band in question is sometimes difficult to perform notability searches on, and its popularity has only been weakly asserted in its article. The notability of the band has been argued according to four criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=milemarker+music+%28%22jade+tree%22+OR+%22stickfigure%22+OR+%22paralogy%22%29" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=milemarker+music+%28%22jade+tree%22+OR+%22stickfigure%22+OR+%22paralogy%22%29" rel="nofollow">A Google search</a> using the search terms "milemarker", "music", and the requirement of having at least one of the band's past record labels in the results (excluding the badly-searched label name "Eyeball"). This gave me about 44,800 results as of September 1, 2006 and 39,000 as of November 11.</li>
<li>The Alexa ranking for their Jade Tree Records label, whose website's ranking was 273,376 as of November 11, 2006.</li>
<li>Milemarker has toured nationally and internationally <a href="http://www.eyeballrecords.com/artists/milemarker/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eyeballrecords.com/artists/milemarker/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which may mean they pass according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html#Musicians_and_ensembles" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)#Musicians and ensembles</a> bullet #3.</li>
<li>Lastly, label notability. <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Tree_Records_bd0a.html" title="Jade Tree Records">Jade Tree Records</a> has an established mainspace article that asserts notability and has notable artists signed. By extension, it was asserted that Milemarker should be acceptable as per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html#Musicians_and_ensembles" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)#Musicians and ensembles</a> bullet #4:</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> White Thunder is not a story made up in school one day. If this band was imaginary how would we have recorded songs? White Thunder is a real band, and a real story. The history of the band is quite interesting and the band is fairly well-known regionaly. This is an example of racism toward hispanics and death metal in general.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mystery dragon (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMystery_dragon_c4e2.html" title="User talk:Mystery dragon">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mystery_dragon_7798.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mystery dragon">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<ul>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> So because they are "extremly thin" means they can not participate in legitimate bands? I will admit I can understand why you may be concerned abou the seriousness of the band, the bands age has gotten younder considerably, avereage age being 16. The band has also taken a less serious route to music, but how does that exempt them from being a legit artist?

I'm inclined to say that <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu_Brahmins_f713.html" title="Telugu Brahmins">Telugu Brahmins</a> is little more than a self-serving fluff piece for a very small subsection of people. That said, we need an article about the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> caste, and I don't see the harm in having a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu.html" title="Telugu">Telugu</a> subsection in it. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnicholls_421e.html" title="User:Knicholls">Kevin</a> 03:21, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm still not seeing where this crosses over from an arbitrary subgroup, and in to something notable or distinct. For all intents and purposes, this is no different than an article entitled <i>"<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Catholics_in_the_United_States_f30a.html" title="French Catholics in the United States">French Catholics in the United States</a>"</i> (e.g. a redirect to a more general cultural page), or <i>"White-collar people from the United Kingdom who speak Welsh"</i>. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnicholls_421e.html" title="User:Knicholls">Kevin</a> 07:27, 12 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply:</b> With all due respect, does anybody familiar with the subject matter agree? There's a real risk here that people who don't understand the cultural distinctions (I include myself) may undo the work of people who do with broad-brush analogies that don't apply. There are 80 million <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu.html" title="Telugu">Telugu</a> speakers. We're not talking about a small group of people. There aren't that many Catholics in all of the United States, let alone in North Carolina. Or people in North Carolina, for that matter. Or Wales. Or the entire United Kingdom. According to the article, the Telugu Brahmin tradition outdates the United States by some 500-700 years. Is it so hard to believe that a people speaking a distinct language might develop a recognizable tradition over such a period of time? -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 04:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC) <b>P.S.</b> I've edited out the most obvious redundancies with Brahmin. <b>P.P.S.</b> According to <a href="http://www.vedah.net/manasanskriti/Brahmins.html#Brahmins_of_Andhra_Pradesh" class="external text" title="http://www.vedah.net/manasanskriti/Brahmins.html#Brahmins_of_Andhra_Pradesh" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, Brahmins make up 2% of the population of Andhra Pradesh.

<li><b>Delete</b>:Lots if not most of the content can already be found in the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> article. This is not a sub-group of Brahmins in that they do not have a different belief system from any other Brahmin group. This is a sub group of a sub group, and doesn't merit it's own article, unless more unique content can be provided. Alot of Brahmin subgroups have articles dedicated to nothing but a list of surnames, or "famous Brahmins" whichprovide no information on the subject, and are generally unsourced. <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaraama_Dravidulu_323b.html" title="Aaraama Dravidulu">Aaraama_Dravidulu</a> is an example of this. These articles should be amalgamated, if not in one article, then at least not disparate and vaguely connected sub categories. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfacets_25b2.html" title="User:Sfacets">Sfacets</a> 05:54, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Finally, an argument in terms of Brahminism instead of Catholicism! Thank you! If the subgroups don't merit their own articles, perhaps they could be merged up into Telugu Brahmins?

<li><b>Keep</b> Just because it "seems to be a non-notable game" to one person doesn't mean that it is. The nominator needs to provide a better explaination to delete it then just a gut instinct.

<li><b>Boldly redirect</b>. The article was already merged to a new draft of the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Coverup_Scandal_1551.html" title="Franklin Coverup Scandal">Franklin Coverup Scandal</a> article, which is a grand merger of all the articles on people/books/etc. mentioned in the whole conspiracy theory. That draft was being prepared before this AfD was opened; it has now been installed as the main article. The idea is to redirect all the minor articles, which had been subject to all sorts of conspiracy cruft, bizarre allegations, biased and weak sourcing, to the main article which adheres strictly to well-sourced facts. The film gets a couple of sentences there, which is about what it's worth. So unless there are strenuous objections I'm just going to perform the redirect along with the others (there are 3 or 4 total) and save us waiting out the AfD.

If, however, the FCS reference is simply a place-holder which will be deleted as soon as this article is, then my view would be that this article should remain, as a means for future researchers to know what the film was, what it was (allegedly) about, and that it was never aired. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 08:34, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I'll admit that I can't find any reputable reviews on it, but I do believe it is much more notable in Korea and the Philipinnes. I also spent a lot of time on the article in the past, rewritting a lot of content located above the Classes section, thus I'm a little biased. I was refraining from voting but looking at the votes now, there doesn't seem to be a strong support for deleting. <a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirbelwind_a23d.html" title="User:Wirbelwind">Wirbelwind<small>ヴィルヴェルヴィント</small></a>&#160;(<a href="../../../w/i/r/User_talk%7EWirbelwind_25ad.html" title="User talk:Wirbelwind">talk</a>) 05:04, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

And as someone who has never played it, I personally found this a decent article to learn more about Flyff. <b>However</b>, it is written like an official guide. The "Versions" and "Updates" sections, as well as the first part of "Flying," are good examples of material that belongs here. A lot of the other material needs to be scrapped or changed dramatically--for Game Mechanics in particular, the focus should be on how unique mechanics affect players and their experience. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Crest_6a7d.html" title="User:Blue Crest">Blue Crest</a> 06:09, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are many, many songs that can be interpreted to be about drugs without explicitly saying so and there'd be NPOV and OR arguments about each and every one.

To the nominator: there <i>is</i> some precedent for deleting certain song lists in the namespace search link you provided, but there is also considerable precedent to <i><b>keep</b></i> in that same list - did you check them all?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Either all of these articles should be kept, or all should be deleted. People are arguing that there's too many up for deletion, but I don't believe this is the case. Either we're going to accept all lists of songs based on topic or we delete them all; there is no logical means of saying some song topic lists are ok while others aren't so we can't justify keeping some and excluding others. Personally, I have already stated that I strongly support deletion; this is a terrible precedent to set and leads to totally random lists that aren't worth having. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 02:18, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, much as I despise pointless and unverifiable listcruft, this nomination is far too broad, and I can't possibly check all those articles.

<dd>I figure the results would be fairly similar if this batch of lists were nominated separately, and the fact that over a third of the articles were kept (some repeatedly), should give the nominator pause for thought that mass nomination is really inappropriate and unsuitable in this case.

<li><b>Technical Keep</b>; this one bundles altogether too many articles. please renominate individually over a longer period of time, or at least grouped in bunches of no more than a handful, grouped by theme (e.g. nomination of lists of songs about various wars). I have no opinion about the articles; it's just that in order to put some sanity to the AfD process you <i>don't</i> bundle bazillion and six articles with exceedingly little in common with each other in one AfD. Remember the esoteric programming languages AfD that went bazquoncs. And that "all 200 articles in the Naruto episodes category" one. If you bundle AfDs, please at least make sure it's entirely possible for an editor to take a look at each of the articles in one (quick) sitting.

<p>Contested prod, removed because they thought they were notable enough to keep. I disagree, I don't think the claims to notability are strong enough. Was a member of several NN bands and was a POW. There were tons of POW's during WWII, being one alone does not make you notable enough for Wikipedia.

<p>Thank you for your clarification, VegaDark, but I still have to respectfully disagree. I think Pearce's story (and perhaps your own) show a slice of life people of my generation (and beyond) may not see otherwise. JABPP 10:02, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, sadly. None of this is referenced in the way Wikipedia NEEDS things to be referenced; to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable, unrelated secondary sources</a>. The only reference given is a book written by the subject's <i>son</i>, which concerns me as there could be a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> - a loyal son may be less than forthcoming about negative character traits, and may see his father as more notable than he was. Unfortunately, since that's the only reference given, there's no way to check on it. If the writer of this article could locate and provide references to Romney Lyle Pearce written by unrelated third parties (Portland newspaper archives, for instance, or the published writings of local historians) and write the article based on those sources, it would be acceptable. Just because something is true doesn't mean it should be in Wikipedia: it has to be supported by reliable, unrelated secondary sources. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 10:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> unless verifiable, reliable sources <i>and</i> evidence of notability are provided by the end of the AfD process. Do not prevent re-creation, in case reliable sources are found later. Unfortunately, the present article simply isn't appropriate for an encyclopedia, and the lack of on-line documentation for that era makes it unlikely that the article can be fixed without some moderately serious research. It will do us no harm to live without the article until (if) someone is able and willing to do that research. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 11:46, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I'm a Portlander in college, so I have access to several relevant databases. Two of the databases cover newspapers: one archives <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Oregonian_e46c.html" title="The Oregonian">The Oregonian</a> (Oregon's largest newspaper) and the other archives headlines in a large variety of Oregon newspapers. Neither came up with a hit for "Romney Pearce" or "Romney Lyle Pearce." They only go back to 1988 (five years after he died), but I would think that there would be at least one mention of a sufficiently prominent musician. A search through Cascade, an interlibrary loan system for universities and colleges in the Pacific Northwest, came up with no results for "Autobiography of a Father." The same with the Clackamas County and Multnomah County library catalogs. If VegaDark, an Oregon State University student himself, has never heard of him, I doubt he was very famous there either. As much as I like Oregonians, I can't see how he is notable enough for inclusion. - <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPingveno_6d12.html" title="User:Pingveno">Pingveno</a> 12:11, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> the references to his supposed notability as a musician date back more to the thirties (which presumably would not show up in your search). On the other hand, your inability to find any reference to the book supposedly used as the sole source for all of this is far more troubling, and even raises the possibility that we're dealing with a hoax here. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 03:42, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As a player of the game as well as a citizen of the web, I can understand both points of view being expressed. As a member of the web community, I can understand that Wikipedia has a definite criteria that determines what should and should not be placed on it's site. Reading over <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> shows me that Golden Crop does not meet those criteria. As a player of the game, I know this was not meant as an advertisement, just the expression of pride in a game that is rather unique and very fun. I hope that some or all points of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> will one day be applicable to this unique game, but until then, I can live with the fact that a page on Golden Crop does not yet belong in Wikipedia. --MrAutomation 24.67.4.192 19:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Hold on</b> - What makes Wikipedia great is that it is comprehensive and has the potential to include different points of view. This article is written to add to the history of the Vietnam war, that it did not end when the US withdrew in 1972. Biographies of each of these soldiers may be insignificant. But including them together is significant. This article helps depict the hopelessness of the South Vietnamese at the close of the war. My newphew was asked by his high school history teacher to write about the war from a personal point of view. He was born in this country and had a hard time finding information of that time. It will take time for me and others to add sources to the article.

<li><b>Cruel April</b> is what the South Vietnamese themselves call the events that transpired that month. The communists call it Liberation. Of course you will not see the term when you google it. I agree the article needs work. But can you find anything that ties together what happened when in the course of one month, a nation of 20 million people fell to the enemy in the span of one month.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Vietnamese Google talks about the events that unfolded in a propaganda style. No mention of the poor South Vietnamese, of the killings and the suicides. Like I said before, this article will eventually include the totality of the month and not just what happened to the soldiers. I do have some articles from the New York Times that can back up some of the contents. The rest about the soldiers, the Pentagon did a debriefing of the South Vietnamese political and military leaders in a series called Vietnam monographs shortly after the fall of Saigon. I will cite the sources and add footnotes and references (these are in storage right now).</p>

<dd>No, you don't understand. We are not talking about the notability of the people (if they are notable, they should be separate biographies). You specifically lumped all of these suicides into a name called "cruel april". If this term is notable, then the article's title is appropriate. Otherwise, the article should be deleted, and the people in the article should be evaluated for their notability.

<li><b>Delete</b>. In order to qualify as notable, you have to be signed to a major record label, or one of the more important indie labels. Guidelines say it must be "an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable." Or Music's only really notable performer is Matisyahu, and their history goes back barely three years. The only other qualification Adam Richman even comes close to is a national tour, so his notability is quite shaky. Give him a few more years, and see if he makes it. Then we can write an article about him. <a href="../../../m/d/h/User%7EMdhandley_23b3.html" title="User:Mdhandley">Mdhandley</a> 01:40, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

That's three notable performers besides Richman. And I'm not sure how he "comes close" to a national tour, when he criss-crossed the US for three years straight.

<p>original resarch and listcruft. Onknkrpwxq 15:19, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> What makes you think this list is Original research? I've looked over the page, I can't see anything that isn't from Tolkien's material. Listcruft isn't a valid objection either, as the Middle-Earth series is clearly important, therefore a list of characters in it is not cruft. And that's even assume listcruft was available as a reason to delete in the first place. It's not. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:41, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Again, Listcruft is not actually a valid reason to delete. It may be a widely used term, but that doesn't make it acceptable, let alone desirable for an AFD. You can see a caution about its use on the page for listcruft. It's much better to explain why you think a list of characters in a notable series of books is undesirable instead of just saying "This is listcruft" . Furthermore, which of the entries at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a> do you think this list violates? Clearly, it's not 1-6, so the best you can get is 7. And even then, this isn't a plot summary, just a list of characters in the book. There are other Tolkien characters listed. For example see: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves_1275.html" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">List of Middle-earth Dwarves</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hobbits_75c1.html" title="List of Hobbits">List of Hobbits</a> or even <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_of_Middle-earth_f5a2.html" title="Horses of Middle-earth">Horses of Middle-earth</a>. Not to mention the dozens of other series with lists for their characters. Like: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Arthurian_Characters_1fa5.html" title="List of Arthurian Characters">List of Arthurian Characters</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Garfield_characters_3b01.html" title="List of Garfield characters">List of Garfield characters</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Honorverse_Characters_d3fa.html" title="List of Honorverse Characters">List of Honorverse Characters</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Passions_Characters_9b9f.html" title="List of Passions Characters">List of Passions Characters</a>. Sorry, but I think it's clear that there's a general desirability to have lists of characters in various works on Wikipedia, as it helps avoid having stub-entries and provides one convenient place to find information. This includes characters in Middle-Earth, whether they be men, dwarves or horses. BTW, I see at least four with their names linked, and several of the rest actually do have articles, but haven't been properly linked. So, at most, this page is incomplete. Big surprise. There's a lot of Tolkien material out htere. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:29, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not original research - it's all from Tolkien's writings. Obviously the list is currently vastly incomplete, which is probably why it is being called listcruft - it seems that the final goal of the page is to have information for every character, which would not be listcruft. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 21:52, 12 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. How many of these entries can actually have something written about them? Theres over a hundred entries on this list; just HOW can you have info on every single character? Unless you copy the entire article directly from Tolkeins' writings, this will be nothing but a large collection of names with minor and sporatic information. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinach_Dip_4b8e.html" title="User:Spinach Dip">Spinach Dip</a> 00:24, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If any of the entries can't have anything written about them, they should probably be removed, but I'd say based on what I know of Tolkien, you could easily populate over four dozen of the entries with some detail. I'd suggest somebody good at scripting to auto-link all the entries on this page, then working from there. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:40, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Categorize</b> I'm sure it's all verified, but there are a lot of men in Tolkien's Middle Earth. Maybe have an article on notable men in Middle Earth (ie, mentioned more than a few times/chapters). Otherwise, the list will just get huge. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><small>(<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_Desk_a7bb.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11/Desk">Desk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_ER_5b7b.html" title="User:Royalguard11/ER">Review Me!</a>)</small> 01:05, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This needs to be deleted becuase it is only a giant list, no attempt at providing encyclopedic information about these charcters is made.

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I don't agree that this is software - it is an input method implemented in Windows, not a separate product. The reason I think it should be kept is that the article on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_input_methods_for_computers.html" title="Chinese input methods for computers">Chinese input methods for computers</a> has wikilinks to this and a number of other wikipedia articles on input methods, and many of those other articles are good: <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cangjie_method.html" title="Cangjie method">Cangjie method</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boshiamy_method.html" title="Boshiamy method">Boshiamy method</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayi_method.html" title="Dayi method">Dayi method</a>, to pick just three from the top of the list.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's ok, he's been busy calling me a troll on my talk page as well. I've been trying to avoid getting involved in any character debates. SearchIRC shows 141 users over 18 channels. This is a textbook definition of "small" IRC network.

<li><b>Comment</b>: So the fact that it is the only one out of 3,834 that specificly tailors just to the MMA community isn’t notable at all? There are several other articles, related to the same subject, on wikipedia with the a similar amount of users with no specific network type making them notable and they are allowed to stay, why should this be any different? Shen420 20:45, 12 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right, that isn't notable at all. The others probably just haven't been put up for deletion. Just because there currently is a page on Wikipedia doesn't mean that community consensus agrees it should be there.

<ul>
<li>When did I say that? I only said that just because a page exists doesn't mean that everyone agrees it should exist.

<li>Nope its not for vanity, for one thing he is an actor for two films, La funeraria toti under <a href="../../../g/m/a/GMA_Films_342a.html" title="GMA Films">GMA Films</a> which was an entry for the Pink Film Festival and Candle Light Fil Festival, and Room Boy which was entered at Cinemanila the previous year, you could even check <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Varsitarian_0bf4.html" title="The Varsitarian">The Varsitarian</a>'s website and see that he is a writer and a photographer there. --Thomasian2011</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The movies he is listed as appearing in are in the Internet Movie Database, but he isn't listed in the cast of either film there. Granted, the films don't appear to have their full casts listed, but apparently he is not one of the main actors in either film. He has no IMDb entry at all. Thus, he should not be considered a notable actor yet under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Furthermore, being a writer/photographer for a student newspaper at a university is not a claim to notability. A new article can be created about him later if he does someday attain notability. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 17:26, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Vanity is not the sole issue here. I share nearly all of a name with another academic, who has apparently had his Prof. Bio placed here (Wikipedia). A search of the literature would confirm one of the most highly cited authors in the field of Information Science (according to SCI and several research papers on the topic), a number of awards, and a biography that appeared in Who's Who in America, and in Who's Who in the World. But, in the final analysis, of course, it is up to you. Drop me a line please. Paul B. Kantor 17:31, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The site purports to have the same name as a Wichita wrestling show that closed down in 2002, but despite the article claiming that the show was promoted by Fox, there are no Ghits for the wrestling show itself, only the online gaming site. That seems extremely unlikely to impossible for a wrestling show that took place in 2002.

The technology does not get mentioned in the journals "ITS Journal - Intelligent Transportation Systems Journal"/"Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems" since 2002 (the name changed in 2004), "<a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers_99f2.html" title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">IEEE</a> Proceedings: Intelligent Transport Systems" in 2006, "IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine" in 2006, or the "IEEE transactions on intelligent transportation systems" since 2000. It does not appear in the U.S. DOT's National ITS Architecture Version 5.1 (latest, dated 10/20/2005). There is no google hit for "floating cellular data" that doesn't link back to Wikipedia.

<p>This article is unsourced, contains unverifiable and likely false information about the phenomenon (thousands of rivers flow north in Asia, North Africa, Europe, Canada, Australia, and the Indonesian archipelago), contains unverifiable claims about why the supposed phenomenon exists, and does not assert the notability of the phrase "devil's river". For all the article says, the phrase (and the explanation) could have been created by the article's original writer out of thin air. If "devil's river" really is a commonly used term, the article should say <i>at the very least</i> who uses it, why they use it, and whether the belief is supported by reliable sources (and if so, those sources should be given). <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 18:49, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This description of a river was mentioned in a college level geography class that I had (c.1985) and the reference was made to a local river since I was a young en' back in the 70's; It could be it has fallen in to disuse or would require a long trip to the library to veryify? Either way I dont care enough to do the leg work to source it out. Just delete it if you must but dont just accuse people of making stuff up because you can't easily verify with a search engine, the internet is not the be-all-end-all of human knowlege and experience. There is no such thing as the tide either, water just goes where it wants to. 70.35.199.57 16:06, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is not a well noted piece of software (even its inclusion of Google Earth which I'd forgotten about is not a pronounced point of Google Earth's features). Within its limited genre of geo-location software it holds its own, but its general notability is highly limited and the first 20 pages of Ghits are primarily mirrors to download it than they are non-trivial publications (none that I skimmed) related to it.

<p>No indication of significance for this theater group. The article does have as sources newpaper pages stating that they have performed, but to me this is not the nontrivial kind of coverage we'd want to have an article about this. Author's explanation of the notability of this group is "I believe an article is required as it an Irish Theatre group and contributes to Irish Theatre in general." However, there's nothing magical about Irish theatre groups that gives them automatic significance. As far as I can tell, this is what we'd call a "community theater" here- every town has several of these but they aren't generally significant. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:16, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

All of the other external links in the article are to work he did as a member of an organization (Connect UK), some back as far as 2001 - when he was 15 and (I think this is obvious) not in charge of anything at all. With less than 300 google hits, I think it's safe to kill this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> -- the expansion request seems to be requesting that the specific section (which is the "supported under" section). But considering the current length of /proc/fs, and the fact that I don't care to write any more at the moment, I'd be happy to consent to a merge (at least until there's more material).

<li><b>Comment.</b> Actually, it matters quite a bit; these are major-label bands on national and international tours. As I see it, Chiodos clearly passes clauses 3 and 5 of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and should at this point be properly verified with citations.

<li><b>Strong Keep All</b>. Large band and easily meets number four on the Criteria for musicians and ensembles in WP:Notability which is defined as "Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)."

<li>Not to be argumentative, but they've only released one album on any record label, according to the article.

<li>I think at the very least the separate album and band member articles should be <b>merged</b> into the main article.

John Legend is "huge". While I'm willing to concede that these guys are notable, maybe even well-known, "huge" is going a little too far.

<p>This looks like an excuse to link Wikipedia to some videos of someone swearing rather than an attempt to contribute encyclopedically. This person is hardly notable and the tone is hardly NPOV. Seems we would be better without the article - especially as the links to the swearing have been removed for copyright reasons. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 22:11, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not only is this page painfully POV in its eulogy, with quotes such as "He would have been champ for the entire seven weeks", and "the New York Police picked him up for being in the wrong place at the wrong time", but the subject of the article would appear to be non-notable. "Twilight rapper" gets a grand total of 2 Google hits, while his nickname "Tha Futcha" gets only 140, a large whack of which would appear to be Myspace. Basically, being a contestant on a couple of radio shows does not give sufficient notability for a reputable encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> 22:16, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom; the article reads like a bling-bling inspirational tale: 'the little homeboy who didn't give up'. Maybe if he could spell his own nickname correctly I might be more sympathetic. Incidentally (I speak from experience), there is a 'speedy delete' category for bands etc. without any album releases or other claim to notability (criterion A10 if I recall). It might save an acrimonious AfD — it's so much easier on everyone if these sorts of articles just slip away quietly... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 21:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is not about making corrections to the article. It is about getting rid of an article about someone who, at this stage in their career at least, does not merit an encyclopedia article, according to Wikipedia's policies. I see that you <i>did</i> get rid of the 'grey thing at the top' (i.e. the deletion notice). Please don't do that again. It is very disruptive, and likely to be regarded as vandalism. This discussion lasts about 5 days (so till the 17th, then), and after that an administrator will review the arguments and either keep or delete the article, accordingly. It's best to say your bit, and then sit tight till the decision comes in. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 09:01, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia; its strength is that it holds information on things that no other encyclopedia does. Famous works of art are in Encyclopedia Britannica; not so famous are in Wikipedia. I say this as a historian (no, really, I am one): wikipedia could be an amazing source for historians of the future. But not if it plays fast and loose with the delete button. This comic existed, it had readers, it is worthy of inclusion. By deleting an article on some arbitrary standard of "notable", you are destroying future historical records. <a href="../../../2A/j/b/User%7E_jb_3e3c.html" title="User:*jb">*jb</a> 23:55, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>This article was created in October 2006 and incorrectly tagged as reposted AfD content, for which I deleted it. It has since been pointed out that the article was not a direct repost of the deleted content, so I have recreated it.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that it fails Wikiepdia's notability rules. It does not verify any of its claims of notability, nor does it provide any external sources which suggest that it has had the impact it claims.</p>

<ul>
<li>KDB is notable for its wide spread use in the financial industry.
<ul>
<li>KDB is the most common solution for implementing a ticker plant, an application that stores trade and quote data from an exchange.</li>
<li>KDB's performance when handling large amounts of financial data is orders of magnitude better than a standard relational database such as Oracle or SQL Server</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fact that KDB is proprietary is not a reason for deletion, Wikipedia contains numerous articles on proprietary products, in particular SQL Server, Sybase, DB2 and Oracle.</li>
<li>The fact that KDB lacks third party support is not particularly relevant given it's dominance in its niche.</li>
<li>While it has some of the same functionality, KDB is not a Stream Processing Engine (SPE). An SPE works by querying streaming data as it arrives without the need to first store the data; KDB first stores streaming data in an in-memory database for it executes queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The entry could be improved and certainly it is lacking references. It might make sense to merge this entry with the one on <a href="../../../k/_/%28/K_%28programming_language%29.html" title="K (programming language)">K (programming language)</a>. The K and KDB are tightly linked: KDB is developed in K and K itself is little used outside of KDB applications.</p>
<p>I do use both K and KDB and I am a fan of both, but I have no association with either Kx Systems or First Derivatives. Some of the points mentioned above might be difficult to document and I wouldn't include them in the actual entry. They are nonetheless true; I think anyone in the financial industry who deals with trade and quote data would find them uncontroversial. -- <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbcarter_3034.html" title="User:Abcarter">Abcarter</a> 18:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article has two inherent, uncorrectable problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the criteria used for determining what "endorsing the Democratic Party" or being a "Democrat celebrity" could be interpreted vaguely. This could encompass asking for votes for the Democratic Party, a number of Democratic candidates, or a single Democratic candidate in public or private, in either an official or unofficial capacity. This could be interpreted as including celebrities who have voted for Democrats (just once or consistently) or celebrities who have registered Democrat. This could include celebrities who have given money to the Democratic party. This could include a person who appeared on the Tonight Show in 1976 and told Johnny Carson that he or she was voting for Jimmy Carter. The possibilities are endless.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, the criteria used for determining what a "celebrity" is can be vague. This apparently includes actors, comedians, and writers, and it could include atheletes, TV chefs, journalists, businesspeople, and possibly even politicians (such as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>). Quantifying the degree of fame that someone needs to appear on this list is impossible. Does a minor actor in a TV series count as a celebrity? What about a local comedian? A backup player on an NFL team? A pulp fiction writer? The owner of a national supermarket chain?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for these two reasons, the article and the list should be deleted. (I would also advocate deleting the Republican equivalent of this page, in case people wonder about my political leanings.) George J. Bendo 23:17, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no List of Republican celebrities and there shouldn't be. "Republican" has various meanings in various parts of the world. In the Commonwealth a republican is one that advocates the dismantling of the monarchy; <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherie_Booth_a0ba.html" title="Cherie Booth">Cherie Booth</a>, the wife of UK Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, would be considered a republican celebrity, as would members of the left wing of the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Quebecois_abf5.html" title="Bloc Quebecois">Bloc Quebecois</a>.

<li><b>Very strong Rename</b> Why does every category or article with slight flaws have to end up in the scrap heap? There is a case for keeping this article and any equivalents in some form or other. Perhaps List of US Democrat celebrities would be better. To delete this entirely would be drastic. Moreover, any person with an article in their name on Wikipedia would have to be a reasonably well-known "celebrity" or they wouldn't have an article in their name. If there is sufficient evidence to suggest a person should be included in an article like this, then I see no reason why those names shouldn't stay. Delete the unsourced ones by all means! --<a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovea_3426.html" title="User:Dovea">Dovea</a> 17:11, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete - use a category instead</b>. I agree that it's interesting to know which celebrities endorse multiple Democratic candidates and contribute large sums of money to Democratic candidates and the party (as opposed to someone who endorsed his/her local candidate or even a candidate for the U.S. Senate), but this can be done with a category (Category:U.S. celebrities who endorse Democrats, for example). It's certainly verifiable, and limited in number. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 22:42, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The equivalent categories for the Republican and Democratic Parties (and several British parties) have been nominated for deletion. (I found the Wikipedia article through the category discussion.) George J. Bendo 02:00, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Vauge criteria, what consitutes endorsement? Even if that could be solved, it should be a catagory, not an encyclopedia article as it is simply a list. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 00:09, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Maybe a renaming is in order instead, like Dovea said making it the List of US Democrat celebrities. Plus it would be quite easy for somebody that leans to the Republican and or conseravite side of issues to vote to delete it just for their own personal reasons.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - This proposed renaming still leaves open the problem of determining what is a celebrity. The only criteria proposed for determining whether someone is a celebrity (inclusion in Wikipedia) does not seem like a viable one. George J. Bendo 09:46, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - the words "celeberty" and "star" are being given to every B-list movie actor and 70's sitcom star in the world now and days. Just look at VH1 reality shows and Dancing with the Stars. Their is no criteria for determining who is a celeberty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New proposal</b> - change the article name to List of people who have endorsed the US Democratic Party. All the names in the list would need to be cited. That would put paid to the word celebrity and yet not tear the article to shreds. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovea_3426.html" title="User:Dovea">Dovea</a> 19:11, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - This does remove the issue of "celebrity" from the article, but it still leaves open what the term "endorse" means. Does it mean endorsing the whole party, individual candidates from the party, or issues that are generally supported by the Democratic Party? Does donating money or appearing at a Democratic Party event in either an official or unofficial capacity qualify as "endorsement"? Does membership qualify as "endorsement"? If politicians from the Democratic Party campaign for each other, does that qualify as "endorsement"? This problem is still unsolved. George J. Bendo 19:47, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps I'm crazy, but I don't see that the instant page might significantly be differentiated from List of celebrities with links to the U.S. Democratic Party, which, with its Republican and Libertarian counterparts, was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_celebrities_with_links_to_the_U.S._Democratic_Party_5760.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of celebrities with links to the U.S. Democratic Party">AfDed</a> in late July, such that the present article might well have merited <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#General_criteria" title="WP:CSD">G4</a> (irrespective of the July AfD, I'd surely support <i>deletion</i> here in view of the sundry fine arguments advanced supra, but I suppose I mean in specific to ask those who support <i>keep</i>ing whether they think there to have been some deficiency in the arguments advanced either there or at this AfD or, in the absence of such deficiency, how the present article might be understood as better to address those arguments than did the deleted article). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:38, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Page created by self-professed organizer of the event. Numerous POV/advert/style problems resulting from autobio nature of the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> and clean up.
