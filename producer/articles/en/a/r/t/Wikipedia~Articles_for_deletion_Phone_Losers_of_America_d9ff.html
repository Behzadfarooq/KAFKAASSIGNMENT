<li>Then they should be added and referenced in the article, not alluded to vaguely.

<li>Am I missing the point? I thought I had grasped it rather well: the existence of other similar articles does not mean anything other than that they, too, may be candidates for removal or merging - depending of course on whether the judgment of theiur relative worth is objective. And I was being entirely serious: if you think they are less notable than this, please do go ahead an nominate them. Alternatively, if this group are notable, feel free to include citations to back it up. Right now the article describes them as a small phreaking group, and makes it clear that they were never widely known. Some of the hard data is uncertain (e.g. founding date), calling into question the verifiability of other parts, and much of the article is given to spamming the e-zine. In fact, pretty much the whole article is actually about an e-zine of which few people have heard. Seriously. If the subjects want it kept, fixing the article would be a much better way than recruiting meatpuppets (and I'm not saying you are, only that they are clearly in evidence here). Perhaps they could start by removing 95% of the links. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 21:48, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I think you are missing the point. Also, I didn't say that they are more or less notable than the other articles mentioned. Those articles are actually irrelevant to this discussion, as I'm sure you know. My point is that this article clearly needs work, but the PLA are sufficiently notable to not delete the article altogether. Of course, that's just my opinion. I agree that removing the majority of the links would be a good place to start in improving the article. However, your statement that "pretty much the whole article is actually about an e-zine of which few people have heard" is subjective. How do you know how many people have heard of it? I have no interest in debating this further. But what's wrong with the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat_Puppets_2e33.html" title="Meat Puppets">Meat Puppets</a>? I wish I was one of them.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> They are definitely notable in their specific field. Elements of the article seem inappropriate to me, but that's not grounds for deletion, as anyone rationally would realise that the PLA still warrant an article about their exploits, irrespective of the content. Deleting a page just because you object to elements of it's content is an unnecessarily simplistic manner of dealing with the perceived problems. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHauser_43ca.html" title="User:Hauser">Hauser</a> 10:24, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>PLA is a significant site for phreak culture. This significance only increases over time as phreaks and phreaking fade from the popular memory, and are gradually replaced by other [more current] cultures. As an encyclopedic instrument, WP owes it's readership the preservation of this significant subcultural history. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.216.71.179 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.216.71.179_32b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.216.71.179">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Wikipedia has Zerg rushes. Wikipedia has lengthy articles of Starcraft strategy and the origins of every computer game known to man that DOESN'T MEAN A DAMNED THING. PLA doesn't meet the exacting standards of a website that half-believes Star Trek is real? Having a small article about PLA is somehow worse than devoting pages to gaming strategy and science fiction?
