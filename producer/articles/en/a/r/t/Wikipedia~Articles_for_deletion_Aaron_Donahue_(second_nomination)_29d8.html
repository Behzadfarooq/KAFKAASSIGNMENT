<p>Aaron Donahue is apparently a "remote viewer" who posts his predictions to his website (alexa rank ~300,000). Guess which is the top website linking in to his site? You got it: Wikipedia. There are 982 Google hits for Aaron Donahue, and even combining all plausible mis-spellings still gets very few hits (around a third the number of hits I get). Occasional radio appearance is also no big deal since I've been interviewed on national radio as well. It is uncritical in the extreme, though has been worse in the past (see Talk:Aaron Donahue).</p>
<p>Previous AfD: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aaron_Donahue_2646.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aaron Donahue">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aaron Donahue</a>, kept on the basis of three "votes", but that did include MgM and Andrew Lenahan. Nonetheless, and notwithstanding my usual practice of agreeing with MgM in particular, I still say this is a hagiography of a person of no apparent notability - a reasonably skilled self-promoter at best. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:36, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>I do not understand why the article about Aaron Donahue is a problem and a insult to your policies.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>He has been on TV several times, including on TV Asahi´s S.O.S, and the in search of... Paranormal investigation programme.</li>
<li>He has been in the movie Suspect Zero</li>
<li>He has been on Coast to Coast several times, where he talked about his idea´s and those of others.</li>
<li>He has been on many other radio shows including The Bull in Canada and a esoteric radios how in South-Africa</li>
<li>He has hit the news with his auction of the pope´s soul, which got him banned from E-bay.</li>
<li>He is the ´´leader `` of a small ideology, which has several web sites, a message board and the ability to host a independant, good quality radio show.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find it rather insulting that some local TV minister, or university professor would be able to to get on this web site without any serious problem. But someone who is out of the mainstream is being haunted by Christian or otherwise anti-esoteric individuals. This has nothing to do with the article being used by the luciferian order to spread there word, if you are unsatisfied about the article you could post a message too improve it.</p>
<p>This article was for the most part written by me, and a individual of Christian denomination. This is NOT fandom written by just luciferians, but it is a way to spread our world view as much as the article on Christianity or Islam is.</p>
<p>RGTraynor: using wikipedia as advertisement has nothing to do with the validation of the article Deizio: same for this gentlemen here, not to mention you don't have to have been on opera to qualify as a remote viewer or a person of special important. JerryOrr: writes and i quote him ´´Don't let this get through`` sadly this sounds more like someone who lets his emotional side rule rather then his logic. The above mentioned facts are more then enough to grant Aaron a article. RPIRED: Sock puppets? How childish and that for someone who calls himself a Bachelor of Science.</p>
<p>Nor does it mean the other luciferians who want to keep the article make very good points, either. It does mean that most of those people are unlike me. Not intellectuals. We are people who sense the world via experiences and emotion.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but this article needs serious attention. There's a lot of info in there, none of it sourced, and it seems likely a lot of it comes from inappropriate sources. Nonetheless, he's at least notable in his (weird) field. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:01, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

An Alexa of 300K with Wikipedia as the main feeder sucks -- you would think, if he were actually notable in his field, he wouldn't have to rely on Wikipedia for advertising.

<li><b>Keep</b> I might be able to scale it down. not to mention that this article is written by a luciferian and a christian, any other luciferian involvement after that was small. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECro..Scream_1835.html" title="User:Cro..Scream">Cro..Scream</a>
<ul>
<li>He was on coast to coast several time. he made tv several time and gave one mayor tv station in japan one of its biggest rating in years. he is a leader of a ideology or however you want to call it. he has been in the news. all these things give hime the right too a small article.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Needs a serious clean-up. Also, this was written and edited by people who are involved with Luciferianism including myself. This is not in any way some sort of plan for promotion. Aaron himself probably cares less about this article and <b>does not rely on Wikipedia for advertising</b>. He is very well known within the world of remote viewing because of the controversial statements he has made, his involvement with Luciferianism, and his accuracy. All the information provided in the article came from word of mouth (probably right directly from his mouth) or from personal websites. <a href="../../../o/u/b/User%7EOublier_852c.html" title="User:Oublier">Oublier</a> 23:08, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
