<li><b>Keep</b>. What is at stake here is a case of censorship - this video is being attacked left right and center whenever it is put online. It is information that the public deserves to have access to, and if the video is not going to be able to be shown because of threat of lawsuit then at the very least we should have a Wikipedia article that discusses its content and the situation around it. It should be noted that whenever the video is put up online the relevant site is threatened within two weeks, forcing the information that it contains about the insidious group that is Landmark Education into the dark. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 144.82.194.252 (<a href="../../../1/4/4/User_talk%7E144.82.194.252.html" title="User talk:144.82.194.252">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_144.82.194.252_b1d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/144.82.194.252">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This article was put up as a smear campaign. The content is in French referenced is in French and only selective parts are being quoted. Where this video has appeared on the Internet, it has been taken down for <b>copyright infringement</b>. Wikipedia has been used to promote copyright infringement, not by hosting the copyrighted content, but by serving as a marketing and promotion link source. That is a major intent of this article. It's fine to reference the film from the Landmark Education wiki page because it is controversial and because of the effect it had on Landmark Education France. Note also that France 3 (when searching on "Landmark Education" on their web site) no longer maintains information about the broadcast, but only a reference to the Landmark Education web site. So, in summary, its fine to report the controversy, but the promotion of copyrighted material and the selective nature of creating articles to support a point of view that is part of a larger smeer campaign needs to stop (over 3000 edits by Smeelgova in three months), no matter how cute the articles look. Note also that all of the photographs are used without permission, in this article and several others. Furthermore, the reference is to a version with English subtitles. Who added the English subtitles? The video does not say--which is supreme evidence of copyright infringement. <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 16:35, 15 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/1/User_talk%7ESm1969_2d2b.html" title="User talk:Sm1969">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sm1969_8748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sm1969">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>Finally, even the French language Wikipedia does not have an article on either A) Landmark Education or B) this episode "Voyage Au Pays Des Nouveaux Gourous."

Sadly, the French Wikipedia has long lagged in the insertion of articles, but that by no means implies that the English Wikipedia should neglect the Francophone world. Think of the present article as a service to Anglophone readers and to viewers of a French-language broadcast with English-language subtitles, making the backgound and the materials less "difficult to find". (That charitable <a href="../../../g/f/_/WP%7EGF_4344.html" title="WP:GF">good-faith</a> interpretation would fly in the face of the allegation claiming that the insertion of the article aimed "to put forth negative evidence on" Landmark Education, though.

<dd>The article is relevant only in the context of Landmark Education. The French Wikipedia says nothing about LE and nothing about this video. The article was created to put forth negative evidence on LE. What's worse--the underlying source is all in French language and any disputes to it would be in French, so they are difficult to find. We do know that France 3 was fined for violating media ethics. The film should be given a paragraph on LE's main web page, not its own article with selective quotes and ongoing advertisements of links and directions on how to get copyrighted material without permission. <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 19:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)<small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/1/User_talk%7ESm1969_2d2b.html" title="User talk:Sm1969">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sm1969_8748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sm1969">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<dd>Ok, let me address the <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> assertion I made. I has more to do than with just POV fashion. For it to be a POVFORK, it must be a POVFORK of something. I assert that the article would have no merit outside of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html" title="Landmark Education">Landmark Education</a>. The French Wikipedia has (last I checked) neither an article on Landmark Education nor on this particular episode nor on the series in general: Pieces A Conviction. In fact, before this Wikipedia article and a few discussions on the Rick Ross message boards, there is little to no English language discourse on the episode. We can't tell what is said about it in France, because we can't read French. That's my evidence for the POV FORK--it should go to <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html" title="Landmark Education">Landmark Education</a>.</dd>

<ul>
<li>All of the quotes in the article are taken from <b>anonymous</b> translations of English subtitles of the episode. We don't know who did the translation.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_3.html" title="France 3">France 3</a> web site that broadcast this episode no longer mentions it, but does put in a link to Landmark Education's French web site.</li>
<li>There is zero evidence that <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_3.html" title="France 3">France 3</a> released copyright, and considerable evidence that they did not: the video was taken down from YouTube, Archive.org, Google Video. User:Smeelgova has been putting links in several Wikipedia articles to the purloined content, and I have redacted them. The lack of telling who did the English language subtitles and the lack of all the other "credits" in the video are further evidence of an unauthorized translation. User:Smeelgova has gone so far as to put up links to piratebay.org on how to get the video, and there are two different versions of the video going around: one split into six pieces and one that is whole, but neither that tell who did the translation or any of the other "credits" information. We don't even know if we are seeing strategic excerpts.</li>
<li>Landmark Education's French web site notes from a Google-automated translation that <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_3.html" title="France 3">France 3</a> was fined for violating the French media code of ethics.</li>
<li>Landmark Education also likely has copyright over the extensive sections of their courses that were secretly filmed, and the journalists signed "copyright acknowledgement" forms as a pre-requisite for being in the course.</li>
<li>This is a case of Wikipedia making news, rather than reporting on news (original research).</li>
<li>Finally, I assert that all of the content of this article has problems with 1) <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> because we don't know who did the translation, 2) copyright and contributory copyright infringement, 3) the refutations and responses would be in French and we don't seem to have French-speaking Wikipedians that can translate the responses and refutations, and if we did, we would have the problem with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</li>

<dd>As an issue of verifiabilty (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>): the article concerns a broadcast by reputable information-provider (France 3 and <i>Pieces a conviction</i>). There seems little doubt that the broadcast took place: the response to it by Landmark Education itself confirms this. The article correctly attempts to link to on-line copies of the video where available, in an effort to provide verifiability. Even if complaints force the video out of publicly accessible space, the fact remains: the broadcast took place, the France 3 channel effectively and thoroughly published the content of the video by broadcasting it, and it aroused and continues to arouse interest. This makes it a legitimate subject for a Wikipedia article. -- <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 13:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt they are *veiled* at all. Landmark Education owns the copyright and that's the end of the issue. France 3 also has copyright. This is about obeying the law--whether you like it or not. The version with the English subtitles does not even identify *who* put in the English subtitles. Clearly, they are not translating the whole video, but selective parts of the video. We seem to acknowledge that the video was taken down from both YouTube and from Archive.org for copyright violation, and the only entity that can make that request is the copyright owner.

<dl>
<dd>(1) This is a investigative artical on something that may have been contriversal, in 2003, in France. <i>It turns out it was not</i>. (It does show a significant bias however. <b>It is also noted that France 3 was fined for this Film</b> and the only contriversy, seems to be made up by France 3) (2) It is only one episode, I wish we could do a page on every Simpsons episode, but that is left to other sites. (3) The artical could (IMHO should) be condensed on the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html#France_3_documentary" title="Landmark Education">Landmark Education</a> Page (which it currently is)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whether or not the French public found the video controversial in 2003, the broadcasting of that video certainly appears to have played a role in the closing down of Landmark Education activities in France. Any French controversy may have cooled; but other countries still hosting Landmark Education activities have a potentially more lively interest in Landmark Education methods and practices. -- I understand that the France 3 channel paid a small token fine only -- more like an insurance payment in case of invading privacy -- and does so regularly for its broadcasts. -- <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 13:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>IF</b> the artical is <i>kept</i>, IMHO, we need to remove a lot of the quotes, shorten it and include some references on what impact it recieved in France. (Other than the easy to find ones kept by <i>anti-cult</i> sites, written by <i>anti-cult</i> magazines)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for <i>Copywrite Violation</i>, I originally posted that as I have a concern about the significunt number of <i>block quotes</i>. If the artical links to a copywrite violation, that's not our problem. That's the problem of the hosting site. I do have a concern about the number of inclusions of links to the "copywrite violation" on Wikipedia. At last count it is over 20. It appears that <i>every and any</i> page that has any link (even by 2 or 3 degrees of seperation) with Landmark Education has had the link included.

<p>The above statement by Sm1969, as well as the attempts by Landmark campaigners to falsely and defamatorily:):) claim the article and film in some way break their copyright, shows the legalistic bent of Landmark. When a person writes 'cult' they mean in common parlance, as normal people would use the word. They use it to mean a destructive group. Anyway, I'm not going to get into a debate here about the worth or otherwise of the Forum/EST (strange they have to rename themselves so many times- as if their previous name they have to obscure from new recruits due to obtaining a reputation as a destructive group.)</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for your comment Smeelgova. However I'm ok:) I don't consider the comments of Sm1969 to be biting, he's entitled to his legalistic viewpoint, as others are entitled to disregard it as irrelevant to everyday use of the term 'cult' to mean 'destructive group.'<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkinsmum_5c9a.html" title="User:Merkinsmum">Merkinsmum</a> 07:25, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's a way of giving extensive coverage to minority opinions about <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html" title="Landmark Education">Landmark Education</a>, and cloaking them in unwarranted authority. It's perfectly ok to report the fact that some population (as long as you can identify them) hold the opinion that Landmark is cult, or that its programs harm people, or that it exploits its customers. So long as you also report the fact that other (much larger) groups hold the opposite views, give due weight to each side of the debate, and don't advocate that either opinion is factually correct. All this is already reported in the Landmark Education article itself (at perhaps excessive length already). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveApter_966a.html" title="User:DaveApter">DaveApter</a> 18:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)<small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveApter_966a.html" title="User:DaveApter">DaveApter</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveApter_c506.html" title="User talk:DaveApter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaveApter_ea57.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaveApter">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>This is not minority opinion. Landmark, like Scientology, can't take criticism. This topic has seen a lot of "throwaway" accounts created just to support what is truly indefensible.

<dd>The concern about minority views gaining expression seems particularly apt in this case. By artificially regarding those who have "done" Landmark Education courses as experts or as a privileged body, one can give the impression that large numbers of people support or endorse Landmark Education. This non-consensus view, misrepresented (I believe) on the current <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html" title="Landmark Education">Landmark Education</a> talk page, stands in contrast to counter-arguments on archived talk pages. The subject of the article currently proposed for deletion, the film <i>Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous</i>, casts a wide net during its hour-long run, presenting views from supporters as well as from detractors, from participants as well as from commentators, from Landmark Forum Leaders and a Landmark Education representative to "assistants". It does the film, the broadcaster and the article a disservice to suggest, one-sidely, that this coverage may constitute "extensive coverage to minority opinions about Landmark Education, and cloaking them in unwarranted authority." -- <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 13:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As far as I'm aware the -majority- opinion is that Large Group Awareness Trainings such as Landmark are somehow 'iffy'. I don't imagine the average man in the street would rush to say they're not a cult and are lovely, unless he happened to already be a believer. Most people when told what landmark does, would probably suspect a financial motive behind the organisation's trainings<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkinsmum_5c9a.html" title="User:Merkinsmum">Merkinsmum</a> 03:16, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. We actually do have whole sets of articles about episodes of TV series. <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, etc. This article appears to be about a documentary that is actually notable. It is well-sourced and the subject appears to have had an influence on the outside world. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 07:26, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rework and Keep</b> There are sections that would only make sense to people who know about the show already. For example, the text below reads like Uncyclopedia. Also, the article structure is idiosyncratic. Show is notable since was broadcast to a significant audience in France and because it was controversial. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonrojo_cf86.html" title="User:Antonrojo">Antonrojo</a> 12:49, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>(section title)<i>Jokingly refers to Landmark as "Cult"</i> And it’s useless to formulate the idea that this mumbo-jumbo clouds the thoughts/ideas, Alain Roth will not hesitate to impose his truth: "I’m the boss. So show yourselves to be trainable!" Total submission required. But the absolute weapon of Alain Roth is humor. You ask yourself if you are not in a cult? Any occasion will be good for joking on the subject. "Especially, when going to dinner, don’t forget to take off your badge. Otherwise people will think that you are in a cult!"[4]</p>

<li><b>Cleanup</b> and <b>keep or merge</b>. There is definitely much that needs cleanup in the article -- it looks as if people from both sides have tried to make sure there are sections which reflect their POV alone (Antonrojo has posted perhaps the worst-offending section here) and the article devotes too much space to <i>conveying</i> the content of the program rather than <i>describing</i> it (quotes might be appropriate in <i>some</i> places to precisely represent a particular point being expressed, but I doubt they are needed as much as they are used here.) However, what certain people have described as a reason the article should be <i>deleted</i> -- the fact that France 3 was made to pull the report under pressure -- is actually a strong reason it should be kept: like <i><a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_Honor_0dcd.html" title="Stolen Honor">Stolen Honor</a></i> or <i>The Road to 9/11</i>, the controversy around it has made it itself notable. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:05, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not find myself agreeing with Anateus often, but I would do this time. If the closing admin provides a strong suggestion to cleanup the article, so that it describes it rather than attempt to convey its contents, and the OR and POV (both pro and anti) cleaned up, then the article should be kept.
