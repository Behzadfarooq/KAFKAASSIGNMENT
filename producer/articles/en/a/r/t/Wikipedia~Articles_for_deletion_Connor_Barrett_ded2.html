<li><b>Keep</b>. A useful article on a minor artist, but nevertheless one who had a part to play in culture. I suggest more caution is exercised with regard to the arts, as verification of notability is often less forthcoming than with those of equivalent stature within other fields, e.g. sport and music. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - as the primary author of the piece my vote is probably not surprising but for me to discover that any athlete who has played professional sports, any song recorded by the Beatles,and a host of lesser acts for that matter, and any character - and probably any actor from any TV show is okay here but an admitedly minor artist is not is mildly disturbing, since much of my wikipedia work involves minor sculptors who did great work and who should not (<a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinion</a>) be forgotten. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 00:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC) Oh yes, I have a lot of pictures of Barrett's work, along with his poetry that I was on my way to add to the article when it showed up missing, but am not going to post it until this tempest is resolved.</li>

<ul>
<li>I think it's a wider issue than just admins involved, as contemporary values mean in a play-off between minor rock stars or minor cartoon characters and minor artists, the latter can't compete to the same PR standards, although they hold an equivalent place of repute in their own field. The new edition of the reference work <i>Artists in Britain since 1945</i> will be published in the Autumn with 14,500 entries, so if wikipedia wishes to compete with that, there's going to have to be a bit of a cultural rethink on what makes artists worthy of inclusion. Let's not give admins a hard time over one decision, when they've doubtless done hundreds of unnoticed, unthanked, worthwhile tasks. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 07:55, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I tend to agree, this was a minor speedy-deletion accident.

Imho, this would have been a simple case of 'sorry, my mistake, thanks for fixing'. If we can get pages of debate over a case like this, it is no wonder issues that are genuinely controversial are bogged down as they are. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>My point is that the book was being used as a reference, but nothing in the article said that he illustrated it. I am not denying that illustrators can meet notability guidelines. I am contending that the references were not explained. Calling the speedy deletion bad faith is bad faith. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 03:02, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have made it clear that I am not myself accusing anyone of bad faith, and I think the less that is mentioned the better. However, in the light of remarks on this page, it is only fair to the article creator to show the books and references that were on the page, when the article was deleted, and it is clearly shown that Connor Barrett was the illustrator (my underlining). <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:53, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
