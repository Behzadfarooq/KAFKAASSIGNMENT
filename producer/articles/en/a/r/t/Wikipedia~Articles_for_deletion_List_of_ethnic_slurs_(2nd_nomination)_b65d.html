<p>Ethnicity seems to be a troublesome word for the editor of the article. Although they Wiki-link to <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a> they seem to make a prejorative that includes anybody who is not them same as you as being "ethnic". That would go to include a supporter of a football team, political party, style of dress, who happened to live in the same household as oneself. <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinship.html" title="Kinship">Kinship</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-culture.html" title="Sub-culture">Sub-culture</a> all become this big set of ethnic pigeon holes of taboo identity. As such, the list goes beyond anything it implies it is going to list. It redifines the scope of the criterea so that neologism and made at school could easily go unnoticed there. i like lists, lists are useful, if i can further research entries, but they are few and far between. Some groups are described as Black or white when there is cross cultural identification between members of different races. I list the <b>Afd</b> purely because the amount of editors involved would take months to resolve.I will not give any opions on its right to be a constituent part of Wikipedia. However, if it were to remain, discussion should be made on "What is ethnicity", because I think the editors have it very wrong. Based on that discussion, the article needs to be throughly edited to remove neologism, POV and slurs which are kinship/locality rather than generically ethnic. <s><b>NEUTRAL</b></s> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 17:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please forget about earlier meanings of "Ethnic" to describe outsiders. yes that would be an all inclusive word, but with that definition where would you stop? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> editors would be searching all day.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Worthwhile topic. AFD is not a clean-up request service. My only concern about this article is that the slurs listed need to be genuine, and not just something a user has made up.

<p>Any editor who <i>keep</i>s here should commit themselves to cleaning the List or at least help to formulate a standard meaning of <i>Ethnic</i>.

<dd>Bias? compare the opening paragraph:</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>The following is a <b>list of ethnic slurs</b> that are, or have been, used to refer to members of a given <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> in a derogatory or <a href="../../../p/e/j/Pejorative.html" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> manner in the English speaking world. A</i> slur <i>is a remark another person finds insulting. Ethnicity can be determined by either race, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a>, region, orientation, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socioeconomic.html" title="Socioeconomic">socioeconomic</a> class, because an ethnicity is a community of people possessing common physical or mental traits as a product of their common heredity or cultural tradition. Each term is listed followed by its country or region of usage, a definition, and (where applicable) a reference to that term.</i></p>
<p>With a problematic definition of <i>Ethnicity</i> from the UK census department.</p>
<p><i>How do you define ethnicity?</i></p>
<p><i>Definitions of what constitutes an 'ethnic group' or an 'ethnic minority' are subject to much discussion. In fact, there is no consensus on what constitutes an 'ethnic group' and the terminology used to describe these groups has changed significantly over time.</i></p>
<p><i>This is because membership of any ethnic group is something that is subjectively meaningful to the person concerned, and can be based upon a combination of categories such as:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>country of birth</li>
<li>nationality</li>
<li>language spoken at home</li>
<li>parents' country of birth in conjunction with country of birth</li>
<li>skin colour</li>
<li>national/geographical origin</li>
<li>racial group</li>
<li>religion</li>
</ul>

<p>As far sighted as you may well be, the opening paragraph redefines <b>Ethnicity</b> in a way that does not match literary convention. Notice the way that <b>Because</b> is used. Given that the first amendment doesn't apply in the UK, ethinicity should not include <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socioeconomic.html" title="Socioeconomic">socioeconomic</a> class or orientation. The correct heading would thus be <b>List of hate slurs</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 03:07, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>. As long as all info is cited, it should be ok. If someone wanted to look up what one of those words mean, this would be helpful. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_caterpillar_5cd0.html" title="User:Green caterpillar">Green caterpillar</a> 01:46, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure if you had cared to look at the <b>List</b>? The opening paragraph explains that some words are uncited (personal research, neologism, made at school). So definitions are very unhelpful as the list stands at the moment. A helpful list is a cited and research list. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 03:24, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>. Deletion based on content implies censoriousness; deletion based on incompleteness or difficulty of editing suggests laziness. Horace Worblehat 02:02, 12 August 2006 (UTC) (Sock puppet? only contribution to Wikipedia was this? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 03:33, 12 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not about content. I have never mentioned content. I have only spoke about ethnicity. how it should be used and how the word is defined in the list leads it open to abuse. Editors who contribute to Afd and who can not be bothered to help edit a 215kb list, should be considered <b>editorially lazy</b> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 03:24, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Keep</b>. Slang and slurs are not just a thing of the past. They are a thing of today still. This article can be very useful for educational purposes, and help provide a better understanding of what words are not acceptable to certain races and groups. Often times, what a word means to my race or group, could be a derogatory slur against your race or group. It's the trouble with langauges that have common words with different meanings. Even if some of the slang being posted is not a historically used word, and is a relatively new word, it is still appropriate. It can let others better understand where racial/religious slurs originate from and later identify these words if you are subjected to them. Also, I agree with <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a>, this would be a form of censorship if you removed this article. The way to deal with hatred and racism, is not to just ignore it and delete it. You have to face it, and knowledge is power. This list of ethnic slurs is not an article of racism or hatred, as it is not directed to someone nor encouraging negativity. It is clearly posted as an informational article and I believe that it should remain that way.<br />

<p><b>Keep</b>. This is simply a case where an editor is unaware of (or unconcerned with) the proper forum for voicing his/her concerns. Also, as a point of information, this is FAR more than the second time that this article has been nominated for deletion. P.S. Mike33, if the definition of "Ethnicity" in the article intro bothers you, change it. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 16:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep, but probably move/split and cleanup</b> The article may be able to be split into A-G, H-M, N-S, T-Z etc. However, all of these issues should be brought up on the article's talkpage, or even an Rfc if worst comes to worst. I have seen no effort to communicate on the article's talkpage in order to change it. <a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>Â·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>Â·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>) 23:09, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Nominee has a final say</b> ~ I never suggested that the article should be deleted because it included controversial terms. My Afd was based on ethnicity including socio-economical class, political affiliation and village/town/county to mean region. The vote is undoubtly against my nomination. Serious editors of wikipedia should help me redifine a new opening paragraph and remove all of the uncited entries and phrases which could be moved. I have never suggested deletion. Afd seemed a way to engage editors. Afd should not be abused, but discussion in the lists' talk page would take weeks or months and perhaps never be resolved. As an editor has mentioned above, this list has been used as source. <b>All editors have a duty</b> that sources on wikipedia can be tried and tested. Editors who keep should also edit this article/list. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 09:02, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
