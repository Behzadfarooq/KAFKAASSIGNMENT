<ul>
<li>I do not, <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a>; you are quite right to point out that the existence of <i>Leatherwood Online</i> does seem to be verifiable. However, simply because the <i>existence</i> of something is verifiable does not mean it deserves an entry in an encyclopedia. The concept of <i>notability</i> is often used to determine "encyclopedia-worthiness" on WP; as you can see from the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> page, this concept as understood on WP derives a lot from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Something, such as a newspaper, that is truly notable will likely have multiple secondary sources which an editor wishing to write a scholarly article on the subject may reference. No secondary sources, or a small number of poor quality ones, is a very strong indicator of non-notability. This is not a trivial point, for it lies at the heart of what we all do (or are trying to do) at WP: write articles for an <i>encyclopedia</i>. A good encyclopedia article cannot be written without good secondary sources (and at WP that is an absolute requirement, for <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">primary research is forbidden</a>). Let's take an example. If you wanted to write an article on the <i>New York Times</i>, you will have at your disposal thousands of secondary sources of all kinds, including best-selling books, scholarly articles, monographs, journalism and media studies dissertations, documentaries, editorial commentary, even websites. The <i>Times</i> is a highly notable subject that has been the focus of an immense amount of primary research; hence the great number of secondary sources. Now, I've used the <i>Times</i> as a particularly clear example of a notable newspaper, and do not mean to suggest that every article we write must have an equally prodigious number of sources; however, the requirement for at least some good, reputable sources is clear. What are the secondary sources one may use to write an article on <i>Leatherwood Online</i>?—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 15:10:08, 2005-08-21 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes. Name an item on that article about which it can be said that the diagnosis of ADHD is original research, and I personally will removed it with great delight--better yet, remove it yourself! And then change your vote to keep, if only because without breaking a sweat I've added nine indisputable characters who within the context of the fictional works were diagnosed as having ADHD. Well some of them were ADHD-diagnosed Jumpy Elephants and whatnot, but that's in the nature of psychiatric literature for children. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:46, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In other words some of you are in such a hurry to delete pages you can't wait for them to be put up before you mark them for deletion -- <i>Unsigned comment by RkTect</i></li>
<li>As a separate and related point all of these pages are being edited with references content and wikification being added, but then reverted by the people voting against them (<b>Egil, Ken, Gene, Drini and Zoe</b>) to fraudulently give the impression that they are insubstantial. Egil was supposedly to have been constrained from changing them because we entered into mediation on this issue but he has contacted, Ken, Gene and Drini among others to ask them to act as his agents in deleting and reverting these pages. -- <i>Unsigned comment by RkTect</i></li>

<li>Well, let's see. We have Egil, Ken, Gene, Drini and Zoe working together to destroy Wikipedia content in any way possible, making patently false allegations of original research and throwing around unsubstantiated lables of pseudo science, marking dozens of pages for deletion, then systematically stripping them of their content, removing images, references, tables, repeatedly reverting them to earlier versions so that what is voted on is never the best or latest version of a page, and misusing administrative powers to mark as copywrite infringements quotions from free source sites, or images already registered with wikipedia with written permission for their use. I know that might be standard operating procedure here but that doesn't make it right.<a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> 02:36, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have added further to the article including the meaning of the song. Move and redirect might be appropriate if we deem that the song is notable enough. In its favour as an article, it did make some charts in the US and Papa Roach is a reasonably well-known band. On the other hand, there is a case for a merge with the <i><a href="../../../g/e/t/Getting_Away_with_Murder_1ddf.html" title="Getting Away with Murder">Getting Away with Murder</a></i>. This is that it certainly wasn't a major hit nor has it won any notable awards such as a Grammy etc. Nor is it a landmark record such as the first rock and roll record believed to be the version of "<a href="../../../t/h/a/That%27s_All_Right_bea0.html" title="That's All Right">That's All Right</a>" recorded by Elvis.

<li>No vote. I will note the explanation is not so much wrong, as grossly incomplete. It's a fairly common <a href="../../../2A/n/i/_nix_b2f0.html" title="*nix">*nix</a> error message indicating that a user is logged in under a <a href="../../../u/i/d/UID_e7d2.html" title="UID">UID</a> without an appropriate user entry in /etc/passwd or equivalent. I memorably saw this after one of my housemates attempted a "sudo rm -Rf /" on a Linux install just prior to reformatting, just to see what it really <i>would</i> do. After enough system files were removed to cause the removal process to crash itself, he attempted a directory listing; the error message resulted, to our amusement. We rebooted, got a kernel panic, and wandered off to find more booze and snacks before reinstalling. <a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbb3w_fbee.html" title="User:Abb3w">Abb3w</a> 07:24, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

Khaosworks and Harro5, should I tell users: Uncle.bungle, Daniel Quinlan, Maveric149, Ed Poor, Jengod, Khranus, Oliver Crow, Hephaestos, Punarbhava, Hierarchypedia, TheGrza, and Fox News, NBC, Time Magazine and dozens of others that you consider their writings to be BJAODN-worthy and fringe conspiracy theories or shall you do it? -Wiffle0rz 03:11, 20 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, in case anyone is too lazy to even do their research, I included links in the actual page which feature video and pictures. Here is a simple googling of the matter: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Cremation+of+Care%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Cremation+of+Care%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Cremation+of+Care%22&amp;btnG=Search</a> . -Wiffle0rz 03:14, 20 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have removed my delete vote, but still feel the subject of this VfD is a conspiracy theory. "The Cremation of Care is a Druid ceremony practiced at the Bohemian Grove <i>with former US Presidents of the Republican party usually presiding as the main Druid masters</i>." This actually reads as the single stupidest thing I have ever seen! Where's the proof Presidents were involved? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> 03:17, August 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Harro5, I have changed the article to better suit this. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_9070.html" title="Alex Jones">Alex Jones</a> has said that it was Presidents presiding over the ceremonies, but since this is only one source I have removed it and said that Presidents merely participated in it, which is something other sources have verified. -Wiffle0rz 03:22, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Futhermore, if you beleive that Presidents do not engage in weird things then I suggest you look up the initation ceremony to the skull n bones fraternity at yale, it is freely available on Yale's library index and reported elsewhere on the net, if you read it you will see both John Kerry and George W.

<blockquote>
<p>[There are] three major stage events at each Summer Encampment. The first, called "Cremation of Care," is a bizarre production on the opening night of every encampment, a ritualistic ceremony involving hundreds of participants. It ends with the symbolic burning in effigy of a wooden skeleton in a coffin that represents the end of the cares of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
That seems perhaps more reasonable. Stating that ex-Republican presidents float corpses down a "make-shift" river is totally unacceptable. <a href="../../../m/m/m/User%7EMmmbeer_c9c3.html" title="User:Mmmbeer">Mmmbeer</a> 03:44, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I spent an hour sifting through many sites, and found a reference to this ceremony that seeems legit (to me, anyway). A author/journalist named Philip Weiss has written for the NYT and Slate. In 1989 he published an article in Spy magazine about the Bohemian Grove. There is a reprint of an article at <a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NWO/Bohemian_Grove_Spy_Magazine.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NWO/Bohemian_Grove_Spy_Magazine.htm" rel="nofollow">Conspirancy Archive</a> that describes this ceremony. I don't have access to Spy magazine back issues to check the original publication matches this "reprint", but it looks legit to me. I've not seen anything from Philip Weiss that claims this article was not written by him. Now, closer to the article at hand, his account of the ceremony differs from the article in <b>many</b> respects, but it's my understanding that this alone is not a reason for deletion. Would somebody like to try revamping the article from a NPOV, and citing sources?

<li><b>Keep</b> I rewrote the article to include what is more or less verifiable. Sorry didnt include sources although Im sure most of it is available online. Sorry also if the writing sucks, first Wiki article ive done. Oh and this definitely isnt nonsense, the original guy who wrote it just apparently couldnt tell the differene between an actual event and something that is merely a play/production. Although there is some concern to be had over why US Presidents are attending an event where the effigy skeleton of a child is being burned, fake or not&#160;:-/. This could go intot he Bohemian Grove article but atm that one just has a quote on this and not an actual description per se so I can see why the article was written. I say keep. -TruthTeller 07:53, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

The term "Judicial tyranny" gets over 50,000 hits on Google.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This should not be redirected to judicial activism; the two epithets are not synonymous, but refer to fundamentally different ideas. The charge of "judicial tyranny," in its basic/traditional form, is based on the idea that non-elected judges should not be allowed to overturn the policy decisions of elected officials. The charge of "judicial activism," in its basic form, allows that non-elected judges may make such decisions, but that a particular decision (or decisions) lack(s) an appropriate constitutional basis. The epithets are often used interchangeably by partisans of the extreme right, but their usage should not be governing. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudge_Magney_f9c8.html" title="User:Judge Magney">Judge Magney</a> 01:21, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is an entirely pointless neologism. No need to redirect. It's also sort of any oxymoron.

<li><b>Keep</b>, this article is about a very notable grocery store that serves and provides food to thousands of people. Alot more important and notable then some Elementary school. And yes this is <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, and a very valid one at that. Most of the critera used for keeping worthless elementary school articles applies to this store too (eg: It's a physical place, has four walls, impacts the lives of thousands of people and it vital to its community). <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 14:06, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Why not? We create dozens of articles about dozens of schools and other places that have no notability. Not to mention that Wikipedia isn't paper.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 21:32, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though I understand your desire to frame this debate around the school argument -- it doesn't wash. A place that children go for 6 (or 7) of the most vital years of their lives -- to get knowledge that will last them a lifetime, does not compare to a place people go to buy a can of tuna fish.

If you came to this page because <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jenlight/661360.html" class="external text" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jenlight/661360.html" rel="nofollow">this LiveJournal post</a> told you to come and "Do your part", please <i>don't</i>. Despite what you may have been told, it is <b>not true</b> that everyone who shows up to a VfD discussion gets an automatic vote just for showing up. The VfD process is designed to draw on the judgement of experienced Wikipedians who understand what they are voting on and how it fits in with Wikipedia's overall policies; for this reason votes from users whose histories do not show that experience, including those who sign up for accounts after the vote started, are traditionally <b>discounted</b>. You are not barred from participating in the discussion, no matter how new you may be. However, unless you have a point to make in the discussion that no one before you touched upon, it may not be worth it; merely saying "me too" or reiterating an already-raised point is unlikely to sway anyone. Please remember, if you comment, that the discussion is not about the merits of "Flying Spaghetti Monster" as a <i>concept</i>, but <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> as an <i>article</i>.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Whether FSM is a minor blip on the culture screen or becomes a larger touchstone of the ID debate, it IS a legitimate phenomenom whose record should be preserved. This sort of historial incident is gold for researchers; if I were to study 14th-century Venice, I'd have to spend many years combing through mouldering papers in state archives. If I wanted to study the rhetorical tactics of anti-creationists, I'm going to have a much easier job thanks to Wikipedia. The arguments that FSM is mocking religion are misplaced; Wikipedia should certainly work to ensure objectivity, but when that call goes so far as to demand that topics of offense not be included, it has gone far beyond that standard.--</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Thats an important and famous piece in an ongoing discussion abou relgion and freedom of speech --213.144.15.2 13:04, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> What about the freedom of speech?! This is not about mocking the religious beliefs of people, but about the fact that science and religion doesn't go that good together and should be seperated in school. And that the people who take everything in religious books as facts, are sometimes the same ones that crash planes into buildings, because they don't try to question the things they hear.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, it is part of the intrnet history now, and as that it deserves a place in the wikipedia, it is something people want to know about (just look it up in your favourite search machine)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Theres nothing wrong with it.</li>
<li><b>DELETE</b> This whole 'phenomenon' started at as a typical atheist jab at religion, and while I am not religious myself, I find it insulting that this sort of behavior is acceptable. Seeing as no-one can prove 100% where we come from (or how), creation and evolution theories are both worth learning about. If this topic is worth keeping, I'm sure some wiki's based on the evolution of dinosaurs to humans can be added.. it worked for Mario Brothers the Movie.</li>

<li><b>KEEEEEEP</b> - This is notable as an important cultural backlash against Creationism. More notable is the internet origins of this concept and its rapid ascent to the forefront of the internet debate on Creationism. SPOILER WARNING: We evolved from lower primates. 23:50, 22 August 2005 (UTC)Alan J. Romero</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> FSM is an important internet meme, but unlike many of the others cited, it's not just a joke. FSM is a direct response to the movement to teach Intelligent Design in schools. As noted in the article, "U.S. President George W. Bush and U.S. Senator Bill Frist have publicly supported the teaching of non-evolutionary theories". The ID debate is a serious issue in America today, and the FSM is a humorous but sincere response to that debate. This article clearly explains the issue &amp; deserves a place in the Wikipedia. 67.171.35.234 22:52, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -It is an internet meme that requires explanation, and Wikipedia is exactly the kind of place to provide that explanation--my submission to World Book Encyclopedia was rejected. While it may be offensive to some, its parody of religious faith is impossible to argue against--just like religious faith! Fancy that. And it is timely; a deft, modern arguement in a debate which, for some reason, didn't end at the Scopes Monkey Trial. You want to delete it?

The subject may be satirical (which I don't believe is grounds for deletion to begin with), however the events surrounding and leading to its inception are actual. One researching this period of time who manages to stumble upon this page (or any given article in tangeable press) will discover the circumstances that brought this joke to life and furthermore won't be mislead into thinking FSM is an actual deity. The article is clearly prefaced in this way. The FSM phenomenon actually took place and it deserves a home in Wikipedia. Jack Driscoll 21 August 2005</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Removal of information decreases the relevancy and therefore the value, of Wikipedia. One of the promises of an open source archival system is its ability to encompass information not traditionally found in an encyclopedia, to be a knowledge repository, and by doing so becoming more useful and relevant than the limited scope of a traditional encyclopedia. The function of the moderators should simply be to ensure that such information is described and categorized properly, as is done here, with the description of the FSM as a parody religion. As such it can only serve to increase knowledge, not obfuscate or confuse. This entry, as current August 22, 2005, should be retained. JLF, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is not really the same as a printed encyclopedia. Extra articles (especially of this quality) don't cost anything (apart from size, which is negligible) and people can find articles here that they can't find in any other encyclopedia, or even in webpages.

Heavens know, I dislike Republicanism and Rap music, but I would never support information on them being deleted from Wikipedia. If nothing else, the theory of the Flying Spaghetti Monster stands as a modern, if sillier, version of Swift's "A Modest Proposal", highlighting an equally stupid idea currently afflicting the Kansas Boards of Education.</li>

I suppose I'd like to know where I should be expected to learn about the FSM, its history, and the part it has played in the circus of pop-culture, if not from Wikipedia. I am certainly not a seasoned Wikipedia editor, but I feel very strongly that the topic of the FSM must be addressed here in some form.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am not surprised that there is a LiveJournal or other blog entry drawing people to here to vote "keep", but I am not one of them. I believe that this article is legitimate. What started off as a humorous open letter became a notable Internet phenomenon and was mentioned on various high-traffic websites; the vast numbers of e-mails and comments on its own site, as well as references to it all over the Internet, show this clearly. This article is as legitimate as, say, <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Badger_Badger_29ac.html" title="Badger Badger Badger">Badger Badger Badger</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Your_Base_Are_Belong_To_Us_29f4.html" title="All Your Base Are Belong To Us">All Your Base Are Belong To Us</a>, which are wholly unnotable things <i>in themselves</i>, but become notable due to the attention they receive on the Internet and the impact they have on Internet culture. – FSM is even more than this because it forms part of a huge controversy in contemporary American society: the Creationism debate. It is a beautiful illustration of how the controversy is seen by one of the two camps. If this article isn't notable, I don't know what else. – <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimwi_eb8f.html" title="User:Timwi">Timwi</a> 11:10, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> for all those LJers out there who are being abnoctious. you should know that the VfD process is not just a vote. The votes and comments are looked at until general concensus is found. Also the focus of this is wrong on both sides. whether or not Spagghetti monsterism is a legitamate reigion is not the question. The question is whether o not wikipedia should have an encyclopedia article on said religion. at the moment I don't think the article is up to wikipedia standards but that could be fixed by some1 who knows more about it than me. if we can keep it encyclopedic, its good with me.

There's a link to <a href="../../../s/i/l/SIL_9319.html" title="SIL">SIL</a> in the infobox, but their entries are on written standards of Norwegian which are not used by people speaking certain dialects, but are up to the discretion and language-political views of the individual speaker. The classification is founded on the fact that Norwegians wrote in Danish when Norway was part of Denmark and that Bokmål is based on written Danish. However, to use this fact to support the claim that everyone who <i>write</i> Bokmål actually <i>speak</i> Danish (or a language derived from Danish) is pretty far-fetched. The Ethnologue entry does not mention anything about the spoken dialects in this article.

<li>Hi there. VfD is <i>not</i> the place to complain about article quality. It is the place to call for the deletion of an article that you think should not exist. Please <b>be bold</b> and just fix or completely update the article.

<li>Hey whats up? Im not fuzzy about the nature of VfD, just ketting everyone express their opinions whether this article should go or not then I can prepare a more informative one. Don Antonio is a Mexican music legend and well loved by most of us <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_ff02.html" title="Puerto Rican">Puerto Ricans</a> as well, he lived for many years in our country. Of course, my article would be facts and not opinions about his career. Thanks for your imput, through.

The USENET II network was an ambitious project of several longstanding news admins including Russ Allbery, Usenet admin at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>, and for a brief period when the spam situation on Usenet, particularly the classic "Big 8" groups, looked absolutely dire, it seemed like the only way forward would be to completely replace the existing machinery that allowed unauthenticated injection of material into the system to one that had "sound sites" (mutually validating peers) and only permitted posting from a valid authenticated email address. It enjoyed some limited success, and the "sound site" concept pioneered there has been adopted by small-scale closed networks that use the NNTP (Usenet) transport. I'll expand a bit with whatever I can come up with. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:56, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're looking in the wrong place. A search on "usenet-ii" in Google Groups (the Usenet archives) gives 5770 hits. You get even more if you go for usenet2 but some of those references are to the kind of vague handwavy notions you peak of. In any case Usenet II did operate for a while and was seen as a possible way forward if the spam situation got worse. In practice evidently the spammers realised they were choking Usenet, decided not to kill the goose that laid the golden egg, and ramped back their operations so as to avoid a catastrophe, so the pressure driving Usenet II project was released and it withered. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:38, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

As for Larry King, are there any accounts of his behaviour indicating that he has displayed any of the traits or clinical symptoms of Antisocial Personality Disorder?<a href="http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/428/428lect16.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/428/428lect16.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> At least for some of the listed people, they have displayed a disregard for the well-being of others, they have lacked remorse despite being convicted and sentenced and their lives have been marked by impulsivity and drifting (none of them got away with what they did). If anyone wishes to dispute such traits and symptoms in some of the individuals listed on the page, then they are most welcome to do so. Furthermore, it is a very important note on the page that these people's behaviour has been by far more the exception rather than the norm for those afflicted with APD. Of course Wikipedia is not a psychiatric registrar and this should be made clear to all users. However, if the fact that Wikipedia does not have any professional authority means that it cannot make observations in people's behaviour for example, then how do we know that Wikipedia</li>

<dd>"An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> "While <b>you are free to write about yourself or projects you have a strong personal involvement in</b>, remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other. A very few somewhat famous Wikipedians have significantly contributed to encyclopedia articles about themselves and their accomplishments, and this has mostly been accepted after some debate. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is not acceptable." That's a quote from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. There is nothing against an owner writing an article about something. The motion to delete is therefore invalid. As for the "not notable" charge, according to WP:NOT <b>there is no practical limit to number of topics we can cover</b>. There is nothing against articles being posted that are "not notable". Now before you try to bite my head off about conflict of interest, I declare quite freely that I am a micronationalist, but I am not associated in any way with Anthelia. The google reference is irrelevant, and it seems that there is NO AD POLICY in wikipedia. - Graius
<ul>
<li><b>Do not Delete</b> Actually there is a no-ad policy as follows: "<b>Advertising.</b> Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs." However, as the 'Anthelia' mentioned is neither a company nor a product (unlike the unconnected hotel mentioned above), it cannot in any way violate the above policy, and therefore there are no grounds for this vote. In conclusion I recommend that this vote is removed immediately and that people should check their facts rather better in future. <i>Iain</i> - 13:48, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Darcy, I am pursuing this earnestly because I am a dedicated <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedian</a>, and I intensely dislike the use of sockpuppets and meatpuppets. Many people and things far more notable than your hobby have been deleted on here, and this article basically seems to be little more a bio on your hobby. If there are independent legitimate media pieces on your hobby or reasons why your hobby is unique, I wouldn't have a problem with it. There currently is none, and I believe it is doubtful that there ever will be considering that there are many other pretend nations such as yours on the internet.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, the main reason why Wikipedia is not a Democracy(see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) is because of the potential of meatpuppets and sockpuppets. I am not an admin, I cannot trace the IPs of the meatpuppets. However, when an anon IP or user account with single digit edits votes on a VfD, especially when it is the user account's first edit, it's usually considered highly likely that it is a sockpuppet/meatpuppet. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 03:28, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your dedication as a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedian</a> is not in dispute. I intensely dislike your accusation that I am using puppets of any description, although I concede that I did post a message in a micronational forum to complain about the VFD. Certainly, there are many other micronations on the internet, as well as a strong core of people such as myself who are interested in making the hobby more respectable. There are a number of independent commentaries on micronationalism, although not on Anthelia specifically. I put it to you that you know as much about micronationalism as I do about New Hampshire politics, but this is irrelevant to the issue of deletion from Wikipedia. It is about time the admins made some sort of decision here. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarcyj_c22b.html" title="User:Darcyj">Darcyj</a> 06:03, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

However, Darcyj, since I voting to KEEP your article, can you support me in the Kaafirphobia/kafirphobia sub-article in <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafir.html" title="Kafir">Kafir</a>? Sadly, it got deleted by a bunch of Islamists who dislike the term <i>kaafirphobia</i> which means irrational hatred or fear towards non-Muslims by Muslims. Kaafirphobia is the opposite of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarywbush_6e2f.html" title="User:Garywbush">Garywbush</a> 13:15, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Alright, this is getting out of control. Gary, if you'd like to contact Darcyj about advocating towards your article, please do so on his homepage, this vfd is about "Anthelia", not "kaafirphobia". Darcy, this isn't anything personal towards you. There just isn't any indication that your micronation is any different than the thousands of other micronations out there, making it eligible for a list at best. If you want to make it notable, do something to make it <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unique.html" title="Unique">unique</a> from other micronations. A good rule of thumb I have when there's no guidelines for a certain subject is asking if I was a editor of a newspaper or director of a radio or news organization (i've been the first and second in the past), is if a general, random user of my medium would ask themselves "why the hell is this important or interesting?" Check out <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutt_River_Province_3c5c.html" title="Hutt River Province">Hutt River Province</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a>, or any of the other entries on the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a> article. They pass that test for most people. I think the main problem with your micronation is that it's in a vacuum, so it can't have any real relevance to anybody other than you. Get out there do something to make it stick out. I'll vote for keeping it then. Wikipedia's an encyclopedia, not a PR device.

<p>This article is signed by the author of the book. Although not a blatant advertising pitch, the content is similar to a Amazon.com info page. The purpose of the entry is of course to boast recognition and sell the book. This article is representative of a worsening vanity problem. Now subjects that may lie in the periphery of inclusion are vanity works. None of us wants Wikipedia to become overtaken by self promoters, so hopefully, we can establish more strict standards for commercial products.</p>

<li><b>Marginal delete</b> Self-promotion but not blatant, possibility of some original research. Book may be useful for a small group of people making a very restricted class of business decisions - that's not enclyclopedaic. I think the onus is on the author to justify its notability. Agree better definition of standards for commercial products is needed e.g. in an ideal world a notable book should only be proposed by someone other than its author. In the real world though that's unenforecable. Is the only workable criterion sales rank?</li>
</ul>
<p>In an attempt to open discussion on the criteria I'm going to list the author's self-created page Mark Kobayashi-Hillary for deletion also. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> 14:29, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>delete</b> If we can spot an autobiography, we should feel strongly compelled to delete it. I think we need to break biography standards of living people into areas. Entertainers (people who have a fan base) will pass through the softest standards. But for non-fiction writers such as most journalists and authors, we should bar entries for because there is no one else but them with the motivation or information to write an article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" rel="nofollow">lots of issues</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">leave me a message</a> 22:50, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Vanity articles are certainly worthy for consieration as long as we apply the title correctly and they are not notable by commonly used criteria.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There may be a significant amount of vanity, enough to delete this, however, I just wonder if these accomplishments are noteworthy enough to keep.

Zero Google hits. Also, there doesn't seem to be a "Reynolds, North Carolina" or "Reynolds County, North Carolina".

That is an absolute requirement to writing a serious (non-op/ed) article. 35,000 porn sites with pictures of someone's boobs are not source material. I truly believe that verifiability is the <i>least</i> understood policy on WP, even among many admins. Has someone studied this person in a serious book, or journal article, or film documentary? Has anyone even written about her in a newspaper article? No? Then how can <i>even the thought</i> of including this in an encyclopedia cross our minds? The concept of verifiability is the conerstone of WP; Jimbo has made it's importance clear repeatedly. And yet, daily, it is being violated both in the encyclopedia and on the VFD pages.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#FF0000"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 01:22:17, 2005-08-21 (UTC)

<dd>I missed this. I understand the difficulty that these decisions entail, Kappa. On a spectrum ranging from <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_literature.html" title="Augustan literature">eminently encyclopedic</a> <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almost_surely.html" title="Almost surely">articles</a> to clearly unencyclopedic fare, there is a line that divides the two worlds. The problem is that there is no agreement between some editors about where precisely that line should lie. IMO, the Farivar article teeters right at the lower edge of what is acceptable for WP; he is, if you take an extremely broad view of notability, mildly notable, and there is one reference that I can see that one could use to write about him. The fact that it will be difficult to produce a decent article on him however is the big clue: if it's hard to write about someone because there are almost no secondary sources, that's telling you something. I honestly suspect that many contributors who vote to include almost everything on WP have never written a scholarly article, or a good encyclopedia entry, and do not understand how difficult it can be to write thoroughly referenced and reliably sourced material. This is not surprising: there are 700,000 articles on WP. Do you know how many are of sufficient quality that they are considered "featured"? About 700.</dd>
<dd>Clearly, you and I understand the verifiability requirements differently. Your reasoning, from comments both here and elsewhere, indicate that you believe that anything and everything should have a place on WP if it can be verified in some way. That is to say, you take the verifiability requirement to mean simply verifying <i>existence</i> of the subject, and little else. If this was the standard, it is very difficult (for me) to concieve of the product as an encyclopedia, and I am unable to understand some of the decisions made using this criterion. For example, Kappa, you've just woted on VfU to keep the Marvin Lara article deleted. Yet, conversely, you also voted to keep articles on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Doody_Trap_6087.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Doody Trap">Doody Trap</a>, and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anna_Taverner_0092.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anna Taverner">a nude model/"actress"</a>. Lara has appeared in bits of many movies seen by millions of people; the model has appeared once or twice in bits of a newspaper seen by millions of people. Why the difference? What is transparently clear of course is that <i>neither</i> of them is even remotely remarkable; no one has produced any study of either, there are no reputable sources focusing on them that form a biographical nexus around which an encyclopedia article can be written. And that's the crux, Kappa. You never seem to acknowledge that this is an <i><b>encyclopedia</b></i>. What you wish to do here is suited for Everything2, which doesn't call itself an encyclopedia. But WP does, and <s>is</s> aims to be. I think it is impossible to reconcile your beliefs about verifiability with your decisions, and with the encyclopedic nature of WP, without resorting to cut-offs which are enormously arbitrary.

<li>Thank you. Upon investigation into how information is categorized in Wikipedia I'm sure what I've posted as an article is actually a "stub". I do however believe that this info is of relevance contextual to International Typeface Corporation, in a subtext category (currently there is nothing there). Without boring readers too much I hope, and briefly, International Typeface Corporation is an institution that should be expounded on now before chance that they go out of business, and through consequence our culture potentially losing a vast database of contextual history in development of typographic forms and excellence, where these font designs came from and ultimately where the design influences came from and how they've been influenced by culture. Fonts that we see every day and take for granted, the fact that they're an artform as well as a facilitator of commerce is important. Anthropologists and typophiles in ages to come will research this topic, and they will have to research International Typeface Corporation if they're going to want to get to the heart of this subject. I'm not sure where to put this tiny little piece of history of this company. I also have letters that deal with the negotiations and design concerns and how they were resolved that would add further to this but there's no structure on their page to begin this process of elaboration. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinb3_a4c6.html" title="User:Kevinb3">Kevinb3</a> 01:58, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Developed over a period of three years ITC Bailey Sans was the first typeface family designed by Kevin Bailey. The genesis for the design came in the early 1990’s when he was looking for a subtle humanistic block serif face for a design project but failed to unearth one. Perceiving a need for a design that reflected these attributes Bailey began work on a block serif face. The exploratory design process eventually lead down diverging paths. Finding that the framework of the new design worked well as a unique humanistic sans serif, and because a sans serif generally has more utilitarian use, this direction was pursued. The design expanded to a complete family of complementary weights and styles including a true italics variant. The period during this fonts development included a relatively few number of true italics to select from the given cadre of sans serifs; many variants that were labeled as italics were technically obliques or slants. Other features of the design include open counters on the bold weights which increased their legibility.</p>
<p>ITC Bailey Sans was licensed and published by ITC (International Typeface Corporation) in 1996. The Design includes four weights: book, book italic, bold and bold italic. In addition a companion serif display face ITC Bailey Quad Bold was published. ITC Bailey Quad Bold reflects the early development and original inspiration for the sans serif family variants. Three other block serif variants: book, book italic, and bold italic were submitted but not published by ITC at the time. ITC Bailey Sans was recognized by the Type Directors Club of New York in a 2000 judging of fonts developed during the 1990's as representing a distinct and unique design from this prolific period of type design.</p>

<li>Interesting. I wonder how many people that voted here understand enough about typography to cast an informative judgement on this subject, what is valuable and what is not. I dare say most here have never heard of ITC, not a faux pas by any means, but this plays a role in the culture that exists today. Something more than broadstrokes need to be included. Although most here I'm sure have heard of IBM, look up their site here, you can drill down a mile to find arcane facts. I would propose to all the academics and elitists to keep an open mind to allow Wikipedia to flourish so that it has value to all interests and be careful to judge things outside your knowledge too frivolously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The beauty of this medium is the ability to drill down deep in a subject, far deeper then you would be able to afford in print. There will continue to be books on typography, but they can be more informative in the future with a site such as this that is agnostic to proprietary concerns, such as if a company goes out of business and some history is lost.</p>
<p>The first step here would be to allow some depth to develop around ITC where stubs of relevance can be attached and other typographic contributors can add relevant information. Then typographic academics themselves can police what is worthy or not on this subject and make the furure edits. Let this medium breath. The font you're now reading has a good chance of being an ITC font. When you pick a font to produce a paper you pick one that conveys a certain mood you want to express, and much of this is culturally driven. The medium's a tool. How many millions have been spent trying to figure out undocumented arcane facts from the past.</p>
<p>I read the boilerplate on Wikipedia again to make sure I didn't miss something, I don't think so. I agree a line needs to be drawn about what is accepted. I would suggest if the information has been allowed to be published through due diligence by an educated and distinguished group of authority on the subject, and thus becomes part of the public domain then it's worthy. I would draw the line on i.e. freeware fonts.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Its not that a typeface can't be notable enough to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia, but absolutely nothing that has been presented so far meets that test of notability. It's not a common typeface. It hasn't as far as I'm aware been used as part of notable production. There's nothing in the article as is that it has had a significant influence on anything of note whatsoever. Probably would eould be worth an entry in an article about him if he can be shown to be notable enough. (The existing article at <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Bailey_3932.html" title="Kevin Bailey">Kevin Bailey</a> should probably be moved to Kevin Bailey (typographer) as even if Mr. Bailey is noteworthy enough, the member of the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_House_of_Representatives_3665.html" title="Texas House of Representatives">Texas House of Representatives</a> by the same name is certainly more noteworthy. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 19:36, 21 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lastly, I realized that this was not an "article" but a "stub" early on. A stub, whether it's "notable enough" or not would only be a question if in consequence the article it's attached to is relevant, correct? Bailey Sans is indeed a very small part of the legacy of International Typeface Corporation. Maybe not today, but someday, if this online encyclopedia concept has any legs (which it should), there will be much more elaboration on the art, craft and influence of typography on culture and the important foundries that published and created fonts, if this is the case then ITC will at some date have more then a single sentence declaring its existence. An article about the foundry would necessarily elaborate and expound on its contributions to the typographic field. If this holds true then all of the contributions of ITC will be touched on through the use of stubs. This is why early on in this thread I was requesting more thought, that this important foundry deserves an in depth article with relevant stubs for future typophiles and other academics of typography to peruse. The idea of a particular font being notable or not is misguided thinking, I would however as stated before, draw the line here with shareware designs because it's an open can of worms. As often is the case fonts move in and out of favor as time rolls on. As designs reflect a cultures tastes and expectations they're resurrected or serve as the framework and basis for new concepts in type. It's relevant to understand the pedigree if one ultimately wishes to understand the history. I can name notable uses of ITC Bailey Sans, I would think that would be a bit over the top. Finally, an online encyclopedic reference has an important advantage over print, one isn't confined to edit to fit a given number of pages (a condensed font only helps so much!). The beauty of this medium is there should be room for arcane but relevant information where a scholar, various academics and professionals etc., can drill down as deep as they need to find a necessary reference. Anything ITC is relevant on the subject of fonts and typography to those that study it, as boring and obscure as it might be to those outside related disciplines.<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinb3_a4c6.html" title="User:Kevinb3">Kevinb3</a> 21:06, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Kevin's articulate defense is stirring, but not notable is not notable. I am not sure that the <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Bailey_3932.html" title="Kevin Bailey">Kevin Bailey</a> entry is notable either. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> While electrons don't take up as much space, they do take space and server space is not free. (Otherwise why the need for the current fund drive?) While this font familiy is probably notable enough for a <i>encyclopædia of typography</i> that is not what Wikipedia is. It's a <i>general encylcopedia</i> and so far all that has been shown is that it probably deserves mention in an expanded article on ITC. Wikipedia could also use an article on the Type Directors Club. Perhaps once there is some context, there might be enough to indicate that this typeface family deserves a separate article, but based on what I can find by googling on "ITC Bailey Sans" I don't think so. 165.247.168.56 20:58, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Being Swedish, I have never heard of this Swedish-Russian grungeband, which the article has claimed has existed since 1986, and released three CDs and two DVDs. Furthermore, I can't find a single Google hit that in any way confirms any of the alleged facts in the text. In fact, I get zero non-Wikipedia Google hits for all the CD titles and most of the names of the band members. The interwiki link to the Russian wikipedia seems to go to an unrelated page.

<p>Hello. I wrote the article. If by non-notability you mean that not enough people have heard of this zine, I'd point out that it was easily one of the most well-known zines of the 90s and was featured in Time Magazine, CNN, etc. If a smaller zine like Cometbus rates an entry, I'd say BID definitely does. I was an occasional contributor so I'm not unbiased, but I'm approaching this more from a fan perspective.</p>

<p>I'm not so sure that the "continuous cleanup" done by user Hyperbole is the correct procedure. It separates comments to the votes from the votes and adds some more votes where Hyperbole assumes how they are intended. (Assumptions might be correct, but I'm not sure if this counts as a vote). Only comments as to who is, in Hyperboles view a possible sockpuppet included in the votes section. Revert would delete some valid votes. On the other hand, the present state of the page makes it near impossible to find out who said what in reaction on what. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 11:31, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I was simply doing my best to keep this page coherent - and I think the fact that I specified two "assumed" votes against my own position and only one in favor of it speaks to that. I won't do any more reformatting; I'm fairly certain I've honestly and accurately represented the vote count, but upon reading the guides, I realize that the vote counts aren't even the point here, and that admins don't necessarily make decisions based on their quantity, so obviously what I did was pointless at best.

<dd>The article is not a FAQ, a list of quotes, a travel guide, a memorial, a news report, genealogy, a dictionary, or any of the other "indiscriminate information" listed in the policy page. Rather, it is a page on a forum populated by nearly 200 members, without which an NPOV examination of <a href="../../../c/a/r/CARM_dbc3.html" title="CARM">CARM</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Slick_77f4.html" title="Matt Slick">Matt Slick</a> would be impossible. There is an ongoing campaign of attempts to censor any perspectives on those subjects that are not POV-in-favor (see the discussion pages to those articles), and as this is a subject that is of interest to hundreds of people, and improves the NPOV quality of discussion of the aforementioned articles without necessitating burdening the articles themselves with all this information, I would strongly advocate keeping it. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 20:10, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the fact that some people feel their views are censured because they are banned from a moderated forum for violating the forum rules is about as uncommon as an umbrella in rainy weather - and it happens in discussion boards of every worldview. And that such people then move to a forum or open up a forum with different rules is also nothing new or special. Any moderator of a moderated forum could tell a dozen stories like that. (BTW I'm neither moderator nor registered user at the CARM discussion boards nor in any other way affiliated to CARM). --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 21:21, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I 100% agree with Irmgard. Having moderated forums for years, AARM is one of thousands of insignificant rooms set up for attacking other boards where they were removed, etc. It seems that the AARM participants, hyperbole as an active member, are seeking to promote their chatroom in self-promotion, also against the rules, in linking the boards constantly to wikipedia articles, which is against the rules and guidelines. There are no articles written on the AARM forums, or papers written by experts in the field. It is a chat room and does not deserve any attention. I vote for its removal and for an admin to please review the behaviors of the editors to CARM, Matt Slick, John W. Ratcliff sections with the editors constantly reverting to linking to aarm discussion boards in all the articles, attempts to attack Matt Slick by linking to chatrooms containing anonymous users, and using wikipedia as a soap box for a group of posters removed from discussion boards for rule violations.Interested Party 21:50, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me remind you that I wrote the first draft of the 'Matt Slick' article - all the uncontested bibliographical information, the sections on Slick's websites, the original perspectives, were all a collaboration between Falphin, mdavidn, and myself - and you showed up later. So the idea that I'm stalking you here on Wikipedia is nothing short of silly. And the notion that someone named Jen, who I've never heard of, and whose description resembles no one I've ever met, would suddenly show up and call me a "stalker" and say she's "tired of my demonic games" is incredibly strange; I continue to think she's another Diane sock puppet.

<p>It will be used, just give it time...please? All it needs is a chance to expand. This isn't self promotion, or advertising or propaganda, so it's not a soapbox. This is an article about a new phrase. If we didn't have new phrases then we wouldn't have phrases at all. I'm not predicting a future event, it has been used and is being used, but it's not hugely popular yet.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just thought I'd mention that severe bias or POV <i>on its own</i> is not usually sufficient reason to vfd. Articles that lack a NPOV, but which are nevertheless on encyclopedic subjects and in line with other WP guidelines, should usually be worked on to bring them toward the NPOV standard. However, in the case of the Kellmeyer articles, the subjects 1. do not appear to be of suficient notability to warrant inclusion in an encyclopedia, and 2. are intrinsically flawed because of their apparent authorship by an interested party; the few sources that are available because of the subjects' nn are non-independent and non-neutral, thus making it very difficult or impossible to use to write an encyclopedic article.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 01:44:53, 2005-08-23 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Cool Tapes is too insignificant to be noted on Wikipedia. This fictional band was introduced in a cartoon this past Monday, and is not likely to make another appearance or become a major arc in the site. The purpose of Homestar Runner-related articles on Wikipedia is to explain the most essential parts of Homestar Runner to the general public. <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="hrwiki:Main_Page">HRWiki</a> is intended to cater to the fans. Thus, it contains all of the <i>hundreds</i> of more obscure bits to the site, such as the relatively small article for Cool Tapes. Homestar Runner is already too long of an article to catalogue such a minute part of homestarrunner.com. Granted, Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, but with that in mind, would it be practical to copy everything from HRWiki onto Wikipedia? —<a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazookaJoe_466f.html" title="User:BazookaJoe">BazookaJoe</a> 01:02, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
