<p>Unencyclopedic list of dictdefs, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. Has been transwikiied to Wiktionary. The previous debate is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Latin_phrases_43f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Latin phrases">here</a>, the number of "I like it!(tm)" votes was rather shocking. And my purge of idiomatic lists has indicated that <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus has changed</a>, somewhat.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> most of the words and phrases. The ones that do not have notable history or use should be taken out, but for the most part I expect an encyclopedia to list major Latin phrases, with explanations about their past and present usage. Phrases that should absolutely be kept would be ones that now have common use; <a href="../../../e/2E/g/E.g..html" title="E.g.">e.g.</a> "quidquid latine dictum sit, altum viditur," "ad hitlerum," "fiat lux," "requescat in pace," <a href="../../../e/t/c/Etc..html" title="Etc.">etc.</a> In a point of semantics, I understand why it can be tiring to hear "it is useful" repeated <i>ad nauseum</i>. I think the <b>reason</b> an article is useful should be noted; while indeed this may be useful as a dictionary (and this earning it a place in Wiktionary), it <i>is</i> also extremely useful in helping people to understand the sociality of such phrases, how the meanings have evolved, where it would and would not be appropriate to use them, <a href="../../../e/t/_/Et_al..html" title="Et al.">et al.</a> As for "I like it," well, we all like the same thing: Wikipedia and its governing principles as an <i>encyclopedia</i>. Not only do I expect this article to stick around, I expect it to become the <i>summum bonum</i> encyclopedic Latin article. I like it.

<li><b>Keep</b> - useful list, and beyond dic. def. quality, as the phrases become linked to articles that themselves are way beyond dic. def. See the recent stub I created for <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carthago_delenda_est.html" title="Carthago delenda est">Carthago delenda est</a>. Many of these Latin phrases, because of their antiquity, have attracted to themselves their own little history and have become encyclopedic. A list pulling them together is great. NB - I don't doubt that there are many entries that could be removed from each of the lists, but that's no argument for deletion. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 09:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Very useful article while is arguably outside the scope of a classic encyclopaedia, Wikipedia is not a classic encyclopaedia. Wikipedia is in my opinion far superior. the scope of Wikipedia is without any doubt wider than that of a classic encyclopaedia. this article is also arguably outside the scope of a classic dictionary. most references have a historical and interesting background. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jonnbo (<a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonnbo_c2d7.html" title="User talk:Jonnbo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jonnbo_bdfa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jonnbo">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Individual Latin phrases can have articles if they're notable and there is something interesting to say about them, like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carthago_delenda_est.html" title="Carthago delenda est">Carthago delenda est</a>. Those articles can be grouped into <a href="../../../l/a/t/Category%7ELatin_phrases_c87c.html" title="Category:Latin phrases">Category:Latin phrases</a>. This list is bloated and unencyclopedic and properly belongs at Wiktionary only. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 11:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per V-Man and Dweller. Not a dicdef; highly encyclopedic, as many of these Latin phrases have a long history and are used regularly in conversation. This is emphatically not a <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> argument; there's nothing in <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> that applies directly to this page, nor should it come under <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>. Some of the entries could be removed, but that isn't a reason for deletion per WP policy. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 11:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not arbitrary <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTCRUFT_7e76.html" title="WP:LISTCRUFT">listcruft</a>, and the phrases have some historical significance, e.g. "<a href="../../../v/e/n/Veni_vidi_vici.html" title="Veni vidi vici">Veni vidi vici</a>". Jonnbo's point that Wikipedia is not a classic encyclopaedia is true. This isn't an <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> vote, more a reasoning as to why the article should be kept. It does have encyclopedic significance. --<b><a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunStar_Net_0f71.html" title="User:SunStar Net">sunstar net</a><sup><a href="../../../s/u/n/User_talk%7ESunStar_Net_e180.html" title="User talk:SunStar Net">talk</a></sup></b> 12:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, encyclopedic list of phrases. With articles of a couple of Latin phrases, this list does have some encyclopedic value and its totally just not a dicdef like list. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a> after all. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Terence Ong</a> 12:25, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> although this is an interesting page it is not encyclopaedic - wiki or otherwise. It is a series of dictionary entries and as it has been transwikied to wiktionary it should now be deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmedea_0f30.html" title="User:Madmedea">Madmedea</a> 12:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The explanation of literary or historical allusions is encyclopedia material, not dictionary material. Many of these items link back to articles on their origins; and for those that don't yet, this is likely because no such information has yet been added to them, not because they are incapable of further expansion. This list also serves valuable indexing and browsing functions. Please do not try to subvert consensus by <a href="../../../b/a/s/WP%7EBASH_32b5.html" title="WP:BASH">pre-emptively declaring certain opinions to be invalid and ignorable</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but get out the weedwhacker. Many, many Latin phrases have made it into modern culture, particularly in law or politics. Most of these phrases aren't, though. Keep the notable ones (like E plurbius unum or quid pro quo), hack out the rest. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 17:51, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How is this <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#Purpose_of_lists" title="WP:LIST">list</a> "clearly not an encyclopedic article?" By the criteria on that guideline, it meets the three different purposes that lists (not necessarily <i>articles</i>, as it seems you have applied the criteria to) are to serve. It fulfills <b>Information</b> by providing concise history and usage of each term. It fulfills <b>Navigation</b> by providing links to the articles that have been sufficiently developed. It meets <b>Development</b> as it shows which of those articles are present, which have been considered, and which have not yet been considered. Take, for example, "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_%28F%E2%80%93O%29_b692.html#N" title="List of Latin phrases (F–O)">Non silba, sed anthar; Deo vindice</a>" ("Not for self, but for others; God will vindicate"), the slogan used by the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. Wow! They have their own slogan? And it's in Latin? That is very encyclopedic. Chock-full of history and culture, I'd bet. Eventually the phrase will gather enough information to get its own article, and the list will then be able to link to it and one will be able to read all about how the phrase came into use and what its cultural impact has been. No dictionary claims the capacity to do that; only Wikipedia can. <a href="../../../v/-/m/User%7EV-Man737_9c52.html" title="User:V-Man737">V-Man737</a> 11:18, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would like to see all lists like this moved out of article space, into "List:" space if you wish. This list is a (rather good) list of dictionary definitions and Latin idioms including their use, which does fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DICT</a>.

<dd>That's a good idea. I suggest you pursue it if you're not already, and I do agree there's way too many lists (and as I pointed out, this one is waaaay too long). I don't agree, though, that just because you believe <i>no</i> list should be in Wikipedia is a good reason for deleting it. <a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 18:56, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's why this should be trans-wikied to Wikiquote which is a better catergory for these phrases. Doesn't make any sense for it to be in a dictionary.

<li><b>Keep</b> There is much more to these phrases than a simple literal translation that can be afforded through a dictionary. The common use as well as historical significance ensures them a spot in an encyclopedia rather than a dictionary. We must understand that some of the important dimensions of these sayings would be ignored by a simple dictionary article. The current encyclopedia article should remain as a much more in depth source aiding in the understanding of all dimensions of these phrases.Ringleader1489 02:48, 6 Feb 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> First I'm going to say 'because its useful and because I like it' lol. The fact that when this page came up for deletion it before it got squashed flat begs the question why is it up again. Its an important resource and deserves its place on wikipedia as much as it does on wiktionary. I can see this page being very useful for a great many users searching the encyclopedia. If i went to find a phrase for the State motto of South Carolina I would search for it on wikipedia. Also I don't think that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DICT</a> argument holds much weight in this case. It seems to me that its for prevent individual words with a definition being added as an 'article'? Thats not the case on this page its a translation for an entire phrase many of which have historic and cultural importance. -- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimirel_0763.html" title="User:Shimirel">Shimirel</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimirel_847c.html" title="User talk:Shimirel">Talk</a>)</sup> 20:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The list contains historical context, and serves as a navigation aid to other articles. Reducing to a category would lose information. Latin phrases are highly notable as a class, distinct from the notability of individual phrases. The list permits browsing and comparison in a way that separate artices would not. As for encyclopedic nature, the 14th edition of the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Britannica_9113.html" title="Encyclopaedia Britannica">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a> had an article on legal maxims that was not much more than a selection from this list in paragraph format. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 01:51, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Apart from being useful and likeable (yes, I've read that essay), I think the list has encyclopedic merit as well; to elaborate: the introduction of Latin terms into the English language is a significant part of our coverage of the languages themselves. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:30, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
