Just another one of the mixed breed. From the first set of RfD -</p>
<p><i>There are 500 breeds of dogs. Any of them can be mixed and anyone can name the mixes anything they want. (E.g., see American hybrid "registry" and Poodle hybrid and Dog hybrids and crossbreeds#Casual crossbreeds.) I realize that WP is not paper, but mostly what can be said about mixed-breed dogs is that they might have some characteristics of either parent, or not (if you also look at Maltipoo and Schnoodle you'll see what I mean). We've discussed this within the dog breed project before and feel that all these do is create multiple mixed-breed-dog articles. We're leaving in Cockapoo because it's been around long enough to be the only mixed-breed name to make it into the dictionary, and Labradoodles are so common as to be found in just about every puppies-for-sale list everywhere, with Goldendoodles getting pretty close, but I'm hesitant to open the floodgates for articles about everyone's mixed-breed dog with an invented name</i></p>
<p>In this case, various google searches involving boggle and various other dog articles show many thousands of hits, but these hits are related to the game or being confused about the dog - not about a dog breed itself. Doing a search on "boggle boston beagle" gives 13k hits, the first page is for sale ads for the dogs - the remaining pages seem to be simply word lists for attracting search engine hits or are otherwise unrelated. There is no registry for these dogs, it's less notable than the yorkipoo which we deleted earler.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. OK, here's a turnabout for you. I wrote the original text (above) and in very short order what I've noticed is that, e.g., <a href="../../../p/u/g/Puggle.html" title="Puggle">Puggle</a> has been removed I don't know how many times and even turned into a redirect and listed in the hybrids page with no link and then, wham, someone comes along and recreates the article anyway. I think it's going to happen with any of these that show up with hundreds or thousands of occurrences on the web. I've been very active in the dog breeds project area for eons by WP standards (Jan '04) and I think we're going to end up being better off having the articles and just making sure that they make it clear that these are invented "breed" names, they're really just mutts and you don't know what you're going to get. It pains me but I think that's a better strategy. E.g., see my edits to the Boggle article. I might still be outvoted by my dog-project pals&#160;;-) but this is how I'm starting to think about it. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 22:31, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that this is a bad precident. Simply allowing any invented breed without any notability requirements - that's asking for trouble. In this case, there are not thousands of web site hits. Besides, this has happened 5 times in the past two years. It really isn't too much trouble to rfd them away. - <a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETrysha_c63a.html" title="User:Trysha">Trysha</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../t/r/y/User_talk%7ETrysha_3f4c.html" title="User talk:Trysha">talk</a>)</sup> 22:54, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm inclined to agree. 150 years ago, some crazy German tried mixing mastiffs, bulldogs and Great Danes. I have a pair: they're called boxers now. Some hybrids will catch on, and become quite popular; many have already. Most of them will never even reach the status of passing fad, and are not worth recognizing. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 23:36, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I wouldn't have added a dog that was just a boy dog meets girl dog on a lonely night either. Local pet stores are pushing these and Puggles in their stores for last 3 years. Some breeders of Boston Terriers have begun intentionally selling them and not because they were accidents. They may turn out to be a fad that passes and may not. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_arrow_efd9.html" title="User:Black arrow">Black arrow</a> 17:04, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
