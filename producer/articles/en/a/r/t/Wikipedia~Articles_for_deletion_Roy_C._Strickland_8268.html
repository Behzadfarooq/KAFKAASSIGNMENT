<li><b>Delete</b>. Subject seems to have two primary claims to notability. Firstly, he ran for Congress as a Republican nominee in 1972. However, he did so in a distict in which it didn't even matter who the Republican nominee was, because the district was drawn so strongly in favor of the Democrat. The Democrat won with almost 70%. Not only did Strickland not win, but he didn't even come in second. So seems to fall short of the politician guidelines in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Secondly, there is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_29/b3741618.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_29/b3741618.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> article in <i><a href="../../../b/u/s/BusinessWeek_6dfe.html" title="BusinessWeek">BusinessWeek</a></i> about him. Definitely a quality secondary source. But per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, if coverage in a single secondary source is not "substantial", then multiple secondary sources are required. Does the coverage in this article meet the standard of "substantial"? (Note: Strickland is quoted extensively in the Wikipedia entry, but judging by the listed sources, those quotes may simply be from personal e-mail exchanges between Strickland and the creator of the article.) <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 01:25, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Wikipedia is one of the premier places where a lot of people go for elections data and to learn about political figures. Even if this guy didn't win, this was still an important step when talking about how the Republican Party performed in Louisiana and specifically in this seat which would go for the Republican candidate a few years later. Also, the larger page for Gillis Long doesn't include all of the information about his challengers, something which would appear to be very useful to anybody who wanted to know about his actions during campaigning, given that he was a major politial figure in Louisiana's history.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Mr. Strickland was an early pioneer in the Louisiana GOP resurgence though he later moved to Texas. The article is well-written and has political information about the 1972 congressional election.It shows how Republicans did poorly in many of those races even though Nixon was winning 49 states at the top of the ballot.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It has been generally accepted that major party candidates for election to the national legislative body are N. This may sometimes been problematic in the case of nations with multi-party systems, but in the US it is clear that there are two generally accepted ones. (Whether candidates from other parties are N might depend on the votes). That makes only about 500 defeated candidates every two years (actually fewer, many people run more than once)&#160;; it also means that the people who do get that far are among the 1,000 most prominent politicians in the country. I think that is clear and undoubtable notability. Quibbling about the details of a career or how many votes someone got is irrelevant/That's for the election campaign, not for use. WP is indeed one of the places people go to for general information, and this includes politics--certainly it includes national politics. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:43, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If that line of reasoning (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is satisfied by being a major party candidate for national legislature) is going to be followed — and, at first consideration, I actually would not have a huge problem with that idea — then the politician guidelines laid out in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should reflect that. It shouldn't have to be a matter of you (nor me nor anyone else) in a delete discussion claiming that it's "generally accepted". It should be in the guidelines. I'll see how this debate comes out and if that argument is accepted, I'll bring up the issue on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> talk page for a possible change there. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 20:36, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In researching the archives of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> talk page I found three different occasions on which the issue of whether a <i>losing</i> candidate should automatically qualify for notability was discussed. Two of those three times, it being specifically identified as the losing candidate in a congressional election. All three times, the sentiment expressed was that the losing candidate should <b>not</b> automatically be considered notable. So I'd challenge your assertion that it's "generally accepted that major party candidates for election to the national legislative body are N". That statement does not appear to be true at all. If anything, it appears to be "generally accepted" that if the <i>only</i> claim to notability is being the losing candidate in a congressional election, then they are <b>not</b> N.

<li><b>Keep</b> The problem with this article is that the sourcing could be better, but there is no doubt that multiple reliable non-trivial sources exist for the runner-up in a major election. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 10:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If such sources are found and cited, then fine. But no one has done so (besides the <i>BusinessWeek</i> article, which isn't even about his congressional election) to this point, and I'm not sure I believe there is "no doubt" that multiple, reliable, non-trivial, secondary sources (something <i>about</i> Roy C. Strickland, not just something that shows there was a name of "Roy C. Strickland" on the congressional ballot in 1972) and retrievable for someone who came in third in a virtually uncontested 1972 congressional election. And according to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, the burden of proof, with regard to whether there are adequate sources, falls on those who wish to add or retain the article. <i>So far</i>, I don't see any proof of such sources besides that one article. So it still seems to me that as things stand right now, this guy would satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> <i>only</i> if we accept the proposition, per <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a>, that losing congressional candidates are inherently notable, even in the absence of the availability of those such sources about them. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 22:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Question</b>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Williams_Hearn" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Williams_Hearn" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Williams_Hearn</a> -- Here is a defeated congressional candidate with a Wikipedia story, but it is only a stub. The Strickland story is detailed. Does Gloria Williams Hearn have notability other than her losing campaigns for office? Are full articles on Wikipedia judge more strictly than stubs?</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Hathorn_ca3c.html" title="User:Billy Hathorn">Billy Hathorn</a> 00:41, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. As far as her notability, you're correct. If there isn't any more to her than what that article says now, and no other <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>-acceptable referneces to be found for her, then she's even less notable than Strickland. No argument there. But that doesn't necessarily make Strickland a keep (see <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a>); I'd say it makes hers a candidate for deletion. The discussion as to whether losing congressional candidates should be automatically notable or not is still on-going on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html#Politicians:_Losing_congressional_candidates_automatically_notable.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">WP:BIO talk page</a>, so I'd hold off on nominating her for deletion pending that outcome. But if the outcome of that is "no, they are not", and if no one can demonstrate further notability for her article either, I'd absolutely say that one should go too. As for judging of full articles vs. stubs, <i>everything</i> that's presented as factual and could be challenged must be so judged. A full article, by its nature, though, has a lot more info in it that needs to <i>be</i> verified by <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> standards. Since a stub doesn't say much, there's not much that might be challenged. A couple of pointers to official election results would provide adequate verification of almost everyting that's in the Hearn stub right now. In Strickland's article, however, there is a great deal of info who's <i>only</i> verification we have is either primary source and/or original research. That's why, even if we decide Strickland's notability as a Republican congressional nominee is sufficent for a keep, I still think the retained article would then need to be significantly gutted unless other independent, secondary sources about Strickland can be found. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 01:04, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. Above the special notes about politicians at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is the suggested inclusion criterion "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." Strickland would appear to be borderline with respect to this criterion. In fact, the statement in the opening sentence of the article "who was a pioneer in the development of the Republican Party in Louisiana" would seem to be in conflict with Strickland's repeated failure to achieve elected office. If some citation could be found that either indicated that Strickland's "struggle" helped to shape the state party (currently lacking) or if some citation could be found that could insert Strickland into the paragraph at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party_0712.html#Realignment:_The_South_becomes_Republican" title="History of the United States Republican Party">History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party#Realignment:_The_South_becomes_Republican</a>, that would suffice to support retention of the article, I think.
