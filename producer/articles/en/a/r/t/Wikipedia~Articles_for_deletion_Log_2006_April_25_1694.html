<dd>I don’t see how Matthew being in Hebrew has any real bearing on Markan priority. So what if Matthew’s author translated into Hebrew or didn’t when he was copying from Mark, if that’s what people want to assume. I don’t find any reference in the article as to where in the authorship order the Gospel falls. I know I didn’t put in any reference to it. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunckennedy_def6.html" title="User:Shaunckennedy">User: Shaunckennedy</a></dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I noticed this article when it was first created. It seems to cover two topics. The hypothetical notion of an 'original' version of Matthew that was in a Hebrew language. And the actual fact that there are some medieval manuscripts of Matthew in Hebrew. I tried to expand the content and neutralize some POV <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebrew_Gospel_of_Matthew&amp;diff=46962373&amp;oldid=46952994" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebrew_Gospel_of_Matthew&amp;diff=46962373&amp;oldid=46952994" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I believe that this article may still be salvaged. Perhaps the hypothetical early hebrew Matthew portions can be removed or merged with <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_primacy.html" title="Aramaic primacy">Aramaic primacy</a>. Then this article would focus on the existing hebrew manuscripts, and then perhaps more sources than just George Howard could be brought in to expand and neutralize content? Alternatively, I wouldn't be hurt if it was deleted either.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 18:13, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You mean something like Hebrew manuscripts of the Gospel of Matthew&#160;?

<li>Conditional Keep, need to evaluate sources, esp. George Howard. I'm not very knowledgeable in this area. I found the article interesting and I made a few minor edits which is why this is on my watchlist. If there is a reasonable, verifiable source that claims the existence of a "Hebrew Gospel of Matthew", then this article should be kept. Who is George Howard? Does he have academic credentials? Has he published in a scholarly journal? His theory may not be "mainstream" and the "mainstream" arguments against his theory should be presented but, in general, NPOV argues that verifiable non-mainstream theories should be documented with appropriate skeptical caveats. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 19:12, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Further comment. Can you point us at the debates on the previous articles that were deleted? Why do you want this article deleted?

<dd>My understanding is that Dr. George Howard got many of his ideas from a Dr. Marvin Arnold, but I haven’t read anything about or by Arnold, and he isn’t mentioned that I remember in Howard’s book. I could dig it out and look again. George Howard himself is a published authority, with publications in I believe Mercer University Press, and I know that the University of Georgia was involved in the publishing of his book on the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunckennedy_def6.html" title="User:Shaunckennedy">User: Shaunckennedy</a></dd>

<li><b>No vote for now</b>: my preference would be to have a page for the Shem-Tob Matthew, a page for the Munster Matthew, and a page for the DuTillet Matthew. If these are all on the same page, perhaps have it titled "The Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew" for less confusion. There is a so-called <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a>, but the term "Hebrew Gospel of Matthew" belongs to George Howard, who publicized a reconstructed text based on the comments of the 14th century Jewish author Shem Tob in the polemical work <i>Evan Bohan</i>. There is no need to exclude these materials from the Wiki (the text underlying Shem Tob's comments and the other two); only to have them properly placed and accurately described. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Kirby_9469.html" title="User:Peter Kirby">Peter Kirby</a> 09:43, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>I vote no for deletion.</b> I may be an avid critic of the Hebrew gospel of Matthew, but it does need a place for discussion. The Hebrew Gospel of Matthew is a valid concept thought up by, among others, George Howard. The idea that Matthew was originally penned in Hebrew is by no means original to him though, and yet it is distinct from the Gospel of Matthew as we know it. I say keep it separate.</li>

<li><b>I vote for a conditional keep.</b> I've tried to clean up some of the references. I was half tempted to delete the second paragraph of the intro that is so heavily set with citations needed, since I don't personally agree with that, but I replaced a redirect to the Gospel of the Hebrews, so someone surely has references for those statements. If not, go ahead and delete that paragraph. I don't think this article should be rolled into the Matthew page. It gives it too high of a visibility and makes it look like mainstream critics give it a lot of thought. Maybe roll it into the Augustinian Hypothesis. I added one citation needed because I know I’ve read that some people can’t see the Greek Matthew as coming from a Hebrew original based on linguistics, but I couldn’t find the reference and can’t remember if they mentioned what linguistic evidence made them think the Greek was original.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunckennedy_def6.html" title="User:Shaunckennedy">User: Shaunckennedy</a> 20:20, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Comments:</p>
<p>How is this article OR? There's a guy out there (George Howard) who has published a book pushing this theory. Now admittedly, it may be the case, as some editors above assert, that this theory is "very non-mainstream". If so, where are the sources that say so? Is there nobody out there who has published an opinion critical of George Howard's theory? I don't have a problem with an article (or a section in the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> article) that lays out a popular but kooky theory and then explains why all the pre-eminent scholars of the day think it's off-the-wall. What isn't clear to me is how "non-mainstream" this theory is. Let's see some sources to prove the assertion that it is "non-mainstream".</p>

The main author of the page seems to be determined, as Clinkophonist says, to ignore the scholarly consensus, and has adamantly refused several requests for specific citations which I've made on the talk page. As I noted there, he seems to be determined to present the debate as though it is one between fundamentalists and radical Jesus-myth type theorists, ignoring (or at least downplaying) the academic mainstream consensus - note the statement that the Gospels could have been written any time between the crucifixion and Irenaeus, for instance. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 19:44, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just don't see the <i>consensus</i> you folks seem to. The topic is heatedly debated, with a lot of conservative scholarship placing the Synoptics between 40 and 70, while more liberal scholarship tends to put them somewhere between 65 and 130. I've heard people declare that the so-called consensus is 65-70, as if the overlap of the two camps gave us the actual dates. The Catholic Encyclopedia, for example, tells us Mark was written c. 50-67 AD. Earlychristianwritings.com, a secular site, gives c. 65-80. With Matthew and Luke the differences are often quite a bit more marked. I don't see any consensus at all, just a jumble of hypotheses and speculation. --hurtstotalktoyou</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, I agree the article could use some improvement. I would appreciate some help in that, but instead it gets defaced by citation needed tags after nearly every sentence, including those which already have a citation! The talk page is decorated with the ever-constructive "this article is bollocks," and then it gets put up for deletion, with reasons wiki standards indicate require merely revision. --hurtstotalktoyou</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia needs an article that discusses Synoptic authorship in detail. I understand some of your objections, and I've already re-written it (nearly from the ground up) once, which seemed to be a step in the right direction. I'd love to work on it some more, to the point where most reasonable people can agree on its content, and the disputed tags can be removed. More than that, I'd love some help, which, with few exceptions, is the exact opposite of what I've been getting so far. --hurtstotalktoyou</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but none of those articles discusses the dates of authorship--they don't even mention them in passing! That's not surprising, since none of them need to do so in order to investigate their respective topics. See, the reason I began this article is because I was curious about what wikipedia had to say about dates and authorship. Much to my surprise, the only mention of dates I could find were on the individual Gospel pages themselves, and not in great detail. I also noticed two articles on Johannine authorship and Pauline authorship. So, thought I, I'll write up a little piece of Synoptic authorship. It's a widely discussed topic, I mused, so I'm sure I'll get lots of help and input. At first I did get some help, albeit very little. Now I'm fighting off vandalism from the guy who wants the article deleted. Fantastic. --hurtstotalktoyou</dd>

<dd>Don't AFDs normally get more votes than this? At any rate, I kind of agree that there's no particular reason not to have an article on this topic. None of the articles Clinkophonist cites deals explicitly with this issue, and it seems plausible to have an article with that title. That said, the current article is completely inadequate. Clinkophonist, why don't you work with me to try to make the article decent and have it cite mainstream scholarship, instead of trying (fruitlessly, it would appear) to get it deleted? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:23, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds good to me. Heck, we could turn it into a stub and build off that, if you folks are so unsatisfied with its current state. I'm honestly not working off any bias or OR, here. I'm just interested in the topic, and I thought it would be fun to work on a page that seems needed in the wiki world. --hurtstotalktoyou
<dl>
<dd>It would be better to put the material in <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Problem_e2b5.html" title="Synoptic Problem">Synoptic Problem</a>, which is entirely about their authorship, which dates they have etc. The Synoptic Problem is completely affected by the order of the dates, what circumstances they could have been written under (i.e. the issues during the time they were written), and who could have written them - if they were actually written by Matthew-the-apostle and Mark-assistant-to-Simon-Peter then an interdependence would be unlikely, bar what would be expected for reporting the same events, so they are clearly issues that belong in that article. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 22:10, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep, improve</b> Reviewing the edit history shows that there is general improvement over the less than two weeks this article has been in existence. It would be helpful if more users were contributing (not reverting). While the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Problem_e2b5.html" title="Synoptic Problem">Synoptic Problem</a> could discuss the dating issue, it does not do so at all, and need not do so. The subject matter is of sufficient significance to have an article in Wikipedia. Specific discussion about how to improve the article is better left to the talk page for the article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:38, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The fact that the title and focus of the article has changed is, in my view, strong evidence that it is poorly concieved and unnecessary. This topic is, and should, be covered in the entries for the seperate books. There is not enough commonality to justify a sumary article. While there has been improvement in quality, the basic redundancy of the article makes it a prime candidate for deletion. Any important information or references can be merged into the appropriate articles. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 21:38, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's really not true. The article began as a personal essay on Synoptic authorship. I worked in some material for John just before I submitted it as a wiki article, forgetting it was already covered in the Johannine article. I was in the process of removing references to GJohn when I realized I should probably include Acts, since it is so closely related to the Synoptics. Throughout it all, the focus has remained on the Synoptics. In any case, the individual Synoptic entries don't cover authorship with much depth, nor should they. This article is a collection of hypotheses and theories regarding the composition of four works which are extremely closely related. Inserting those discussions into every one of the Synoptic entries would be extremely redundant and somewhat distracting, in my opinion. --hurtstotalktoyou
<dl>
<dd>Questions of relationships between the synoptics are and should be covered in the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_problem.html" title="Synoptic problem">Synoptic problem</a>. There are no issues of authorship common to them (and not common to the rest of the Biblical corpus) not best covered there. There dates are also not necessarily closely linked. The order of composition is covered in the Synoptic problem while manuscript and patristic evidence is unique to each book. The real issue here, in my mind is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The article seems designed to synthesize the <b>actual evidence</b> fo the dates of the Gospels rather than simply record what previous scholars have published. That's not what wikipedia is and on such controversial subjects is guarunteed to lead to edit wars as people fight about what 'facts' are true.<a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 18:56, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Oh, I wouldn't worry about edit wars. That's common with a lot of wiki pages, but it's never any reason to delete an article. Moreover, it usually seems to result in a better article. Most importantly, though, I cannot stress enough I am not trying to advance original research. I know better than to think my opinion trumps an entire field of scholarship. All I'm trying to do, here, is document the gamut of scholarly opinion, from the minority Christian fundamentalists to the extremist secular scholars. I do believe that's appropriate for wikipedia. --hurtsotalktoyou</dd>

<li>Every previous AfD was screwed up by something if you disagree with it. It takes time and effort to handle pages on AfD, and if it made it past one AfD, it's not an awful page that just must be deleted. Backing off reduces stress on people and the number of pages on AfD.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 21:45, 11 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Read the last AFD. It degenerates into an argument about the nominator's motives, and begins with a "this isn't my pop culture, get it off my wiki!" argument. Heck, I may have voted keep if I had seen that last AFD first. Why is a precedent set because of a bad nomination more important than the merits of the article? Are you planning to address the merits (or lack thereof) of this article?
<ul>
<li>Because the precedent means we hashed through already, and not asking people to argue over an article over and over is more important than deleting a marginal article. I addressed the merits of this article a week ago; why shouldn't that be enough.</li>
<li>As for this article, half of Wikipedia is an indiscriminate collection of trivia. This article was probably created by someone wanting people to stop adding it to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marduk.html" title="Marduk">Marduk</a>, which probably worked pretty well. Having this article lets a few new editors add something to an article and not get immediately reverted, and it saves the experienced editors sheperding <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marduk.html" title="Marduk">Marduk</a> some trouble. At the cost of letting a moderately unencyclopedic and moderately interesting and frequently read article stick around.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> as stated previously, the article itself was only recently nominated for the same reasons, and the conclusion at that time was that the 'keep' arguments were sufficient to save the article. It is, imo, unfair of you to nominate the same article again, for what essentialy amount to the same reasons behind the previous AFD, albiet written in a more eloquent fasion.</li>

<dd>While the discussion seems a bit too fargone by now, I will none the less add my two cents: For unrelated reasons, I had become aware of the name 'Marduke' as a curiously repeating name in fiction. Namely, I noted at the time that he was a summon in Seiken Densetsu 3, was somehow related to the selection of the Evangelion pilots, and simultaneously lent his name to a dual-wielding demigod and a race of singing space warlords. In the end, my experience tells me that this information is significant, as it led me to seek out information on the character to whome the name originaly belonged, is that the sort of scenario wikipedia should strive to avoid? is the accumulation of knowledge so undesirable? --KefkaTheClown 06:52, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Except the article you've linked to states quite explicitly that <i>Like most Wikipedia policies, No original research applies to articles, not to talk pages or project pages.</i> And since my statement was testimony, rather than an unverifiable theory, I stand by it.--KefkaTheClown 17:38, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>(de-indenting)</i> <b>Comment</b>: To summarise here, and to (try) clear up the confusion, Kefka's just stating his reasons why the article should be kept.</dd>
<dd>To Kefka: however, for the article to be kept, this claim would have to be <i>in the article</i>, and with a source (as indicated in the NOR policy you have cited). It is not enough for you to mention it here. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimchi.sg_9ead.html" title="User talk:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">sg</a> 08:16, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. The <i>basis for the article</i> is original research. Unless this can be shown to be not true, the article will have to go. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 22:15, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For what it's worth, my intention was to provide an example of how the page in question (and truly, any 'x in popular culture' page out there...) would be put to service, and not to imply that this would be the sole excuse to keep the article around, which seems to be the way it was interpreted. An another note, does the material not count as a source? I mean, if we're going to rely on a published work to verify that say... Marduk is referenced in Septerra Core, can't we cite the game itself as a source? Anyway, I'm too sick to argue the point, I still think that the article should stay, but uppon reflection, I don't see a reason for it not to be <b>merged</b> with the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marduk.html" title="Marduk">Marduk</a> article proper.--KefkaTheClown 01:34, 16 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think using the game itself can't be used as a source. The only thing is we'd have to show that the name "Marduk" is actually a reference to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marduk.html" title="Marduk">Marduk</a> and not a coincidentally chosen name. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 18:33, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Since he's treated as notable/authoritative by news media like the BBC and Business Week, he's presumptively notable. Russian economic issues aren't exactly well-covered by web-based news media, but he turns up relatively regularly in articles that do appear <a href="http://news.search.yahoo.com/news/search?p=%22igor+yurgens%22&amp;c=" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.search.yahoo.com/news/search?p=%22igor+yurgens%22&amp;c=" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Whether the BBC or other should treat him as notable is a different issue; once he's been treated as notable in major media, and mentioned with some frequency in news articles, whatever the sources, he's someone who a reader might quite reasonably want more information about, and therefore notable for Wikipedia purposes.

<li>This page is accessible to any member of the public and I think that a level of argument which describes the mention of an organisation's official as "a buncha crap" is far more likely to discredit it, as are spelling mistakes such as "creditble".

However, if we are to achieve this, then it is necessary to address the arguments, and my previous points have been ignored, not answered. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 18:22, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ok. For the record, I wasn't referring to IY as "a buncha crap", but to a theoretical unworthy article. Misspelling has been corrected. This is in the project namespace. It's ok to say "buncha crap" here. Doesn't discredit WP. And as for creating an article for the Union, upon further review, I could go for it. We can then extend a redirect from IY. <i>Go ahead!</i> - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 18:44, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>By that logic, we don't need to have <b>any</b> Gundam content at all. Or Star Wars or Star Trek, for that matter, since they've got Wikis too. For that matter, nearly everything on Wikipedia can be found somewhere else on the Internet (though not necessarily on a Wiki). If information being available somewhere else is in and of itself a reason for deletion, then Wikipedia serves no purpose. Also, the fact that people went to the trouble of creating a Wiki solely to contain these articles certainly can't make them <b>less</b> notable. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 09:48, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If anything, you're being too specific with your delete requests... By that logic, you'd have to delete every Gundam article on Wikipedia, along with most other Anime articles - in fact, there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first. And I'm not in favor of that - I enjoy having the information on this and other series all available in one place. Furthermore, varying amounts of data on the subject (Gundam) are found on the Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and German Wikipedias shows, in my opinion, that at least the general subject deserves coverage here.

<li><b>Keep it</b> these articles violate none of wikipedia's article rules, there is no reason why they should be deleted.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - for the reasons described above, as well as the fact that Wikipedia is a vertiable Hitchiker's Guide to Earth - 'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless. For example, in the early Middle Ages, no one in Western Europe could read, save those outside monestaries... and even then, reading was still a rarity. Said monestaries were full of old parchments and books - some dating back to when Aristotle and Socrates were philosophising about reality. The church could easily have tossed it all out - because all they needed was the Bible, and the rest was basically 'cruft' to them. Yet they kept the knowledge, because they knew it'd be important to someone some day. What is being done here may just be with pop culture - but it is still information to be noted, logged and provided for everyone in this Hitchiker's Guide to Earth. Aside from all this, the only reason the Gundamwiki exists is to hold these articles that are being nominated for deletion (in such a way that abuses Wikipedia's regulations, might I add) in case they actually are deleted - not because someone made their own Wiki.

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the church did have a reason to keep all the old stuff around: Classical education was important for the churchmen, who had to know the historical context of the scriptures they were reading, even if the historical context was seen in a light that glorified the Christian church above competing schools of thought. 'Bible only' is a relatively modern invention in the history of Christianity. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 12:57, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b> the current form and make a <b>true redirect</b> to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>. (There seems nothing to merge, as pointed out below). While the intention of spoiler prevention is a good one, this case really seems to be stretching things. It's quite common knowledge and hard to avoid at this point: anyone searching Google for <b>Tom Riddle</b> is going to see the WP article <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> as the first hit. Search for <b>Tom Marvolo Riddle</b> and it is the second hit. This soft redirect seems like far too much trouble for the very unlikely case that someone comes across the term "Tom Marvolo Riddle", and decides to jump to that page on Wikipedia, without consulting any other sources, without searching Wikipedia, and without looking at any other Harry Potter pages on Wikipedia. Once they do hit this page, all they find out is that Tom Riddle is a character in the book, one short sentence of content about him, and that he is important enough to warrant some sort of spoiler (which is a type of spoiler itself). If they follow the spoiler link, then the soft redirect was not needed. If they don't follow the link, it begs the question as to what they were hoping to find, if not information about the character that they might not know yet. Finally, arguments for a soft redirect might have more weight for a more recent spoiler, but the book revealing the connection was released in 1998. - <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 17:00, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I'm generally more of a deletionist, or at least a mergist, but my abhorrence toward undesired spoilers trumps those right now. It's an odd little article, but it has some value. I'm going to make this a weak keep, however, as I remember the dispute over whether or not certain characters should have a heading titled "Death" in their articles, lest the article's very table of contents contain a spoiler. I agreed in those cases that after a reasonable amount of time, certain information changes from "spoiler" into "common knowledge". In those cases a quirky soft redirect like this wouldn't be possible, so it's not a perfect comparison. So in consideration of these factors, I'm making this a weak keep vote. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 05:32, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure I understand your question. What that has to do with this is that this article exists primarily as a way of avoiding the inherent spoiler that would come from redirecting it to Lord Voldemort. That's why I was talking about spoilers. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 07:30, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> As this is a perfectly valid name for a major character, I think that even if the consensus is that this article has no place here, it should be turned into a redirect (or deleted and recreated as a redirect, if there's any reason do to so) to the main Lord Voldemort article rather than being totally deleted. If nothing else, this might serve to protect against re-creation by someone who discovered that there was no article of this name, but who did not know that there had once been. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 07:30, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>redirect</b> as per aeropagitica. Seriously, nobody would ever bother to learn about Lord Voldemort on Wikipedia first before reading the books, and to purport otherwise is dumb.

<dd>To clarify - this should just be a straightforward (ie, not soft) redirect. This was tried with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> being a soft redirect to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, but was eventually overturned and the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> just states what happens (following a spoiler warning). This is different, though, as this article is two lines, not a lengthy article, and it may as well just be a redirect. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 09:21, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I considered this very example when deciding how to vote, but decided that it's different because the Star Wars spoiler is over 20 years old at this point. I don't know where I'd draw the line, and made my vote weak because a case could be made for this spoiler being too old to be a real spoiler too, but for what it's worth, I thought I'd just mention the huge difference between a 20+ year old spoiler for a trilogy that was finished 20 years ago and a more recent spoiler for a series that isn't done yet. (Hm, maybe that's where I'd draw the line... Except for serieses that have no set ending point, of course.) --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 19:01, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> – Unlike Grandmasterka, I don't think this is a "plot detail". If you read <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> front to end you expect to encounter possible plot spoilers, but if you innocently just look for "Tom Riddle", it is potentially a major spoiler to be redirected to You-Know-Who. The article should be rewritten a bit, making it more like a typical article, and I think it is safe enough after a plot spoiler warning to say something like: "More about his identity is revealed in the article on <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>." --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I really don't understand some of the recommendations. "Merge"? There is nothing to be merged. Have those recommending this even looked at the situation? "Delete"? So do these users propose that the next user looking for "Tom Riddle" gets to stare at a page stating: "Wikipedia does not have a page with this exact name. *Start the Tom Riddle page or add a request for it."? I can assure you that such a page would be started in essentially zero time. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:25, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>. I've never seen a "soft redirect" before, and it's a little fishy, but for someone as culturally big as Lord Voldemort I think this is a reasonable use. This should not be construed as an invitation to create soft redirects for every minor character in every fantasy series; I would reserve this sort of thing for only the biggest exceptions. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 15:20, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> If having extra information on Tom Riddle is the reason that people think this article is somehow hurting Wikipedia, the info can always be deleted as long as the spoiler and soft redirect stay. A soft direct is better in this instance because it doesn't spoil an important part of the story while there is no reason for a hard redirect over a soft one here. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 02:38, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this soft redirect. The fact is to simply redirect Tom Riddle to Voldemort would reveal a spoiler to someone who is simply asking for information on Tom Riddle. Suppose someone hears the name from a friend or is in the middle of reading the Chamber of Secrets. They could possibly believe that Tom Riddle is a minor character and is not any more complicated then what they were reading at the time. It is simply safer to include the soft redirect, then not too. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 16:28, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't have the book in front of me, but I seem to recall that "Marvolo" is introduced as his middle name, like, three sentences before he's revealed to be Lord Voldemort, so the chances that anyone who knows enough to search for all three names wouldn't already know his true identity is extremely small. It might be more justifiable to <b>move</b> this soft redirect to <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Riddle_60ba.html" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a>, and have <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Marvolo_Riddle_06fa.html" title="Tom Marvolo Riddle">Tom Marvolo Riddle</a> go ahead and redirect to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> (although personally I think that anyone who uses Wikipedia to look up stuff about an eight-year-old book <i>while reading it</i> deserves what they get). --<span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif"><a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 22:37, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - With great respect to everyone, I wish Americans and Canadians would keep out of debates like this. I don't think you guys know much about <a href="../../../c/i/t/CityRail_4b83.html" title="CityRail">CityRail</a> (if you do I am very sorry), but I wouldn't just jump on US and Canadian votes and randomly vote for their deletion for reasons that I may not know anything about. Anyway, the train types which the Sectors determine are listed on CityRail's webpage and the sectors are not obscure as people have suggested. However, I will agree that the five articles don't warrant their own page each - one page will suffice when the <a href="../../../c/i/t/CityRail_4b83.html" title="CityRail">CityRail</a> article is improved and that information doesn't need to be on the front page.

<p>Fancruft, original research, speculation on a supposed Ewok holocaust, niche interest. From what I've heard, there are already two Star Wars wikis, so Wikipedia isn't the place for this. I'll apologize in advance to all the teenage boys, video store employees, and comic book collectors that this nomination offends and insist that this isn't anything personal. I don't expect this to get deleted, but it would be such a happy, joyous day if it did.

<li><b>Comment/Question</b>. About the Endor Holocaust stuff, that originally had its own page, but I nominated it for AfD, and it got deleted. Since it was deleted, the stub on the Endor Holocaust in the Endor page has grown from people merging stuff from deleted page back in. Your reason for deletion seems to stem entirely from that section though, so instead of deleting the entire Endor page, why not just delete that section? The topic of the Endor Holocaust has already been deemed unworthy of being included in wikipedia, so the Endor page could be fixed quickly and easily by removing the offending info. I do believe that the Endor page deserves to be <b>Kept</b> though <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeedubber_00ec.html" title="User:Geedubber">Geedubber</a> 03:34, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

I see AFDs being for the purpose of deciding whether a topic belongs in the encyclopedia at all, not for details of placement/presentation. A reason for me making my comment, is sometimes, some peope cite the AFD "keep" result, as a way of preculding any merge. I just wanted to be clear my keep vote isn't expressing an opinion, one way or the other, on the matter of amerge. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:50, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I brought this to AfD for deletion because the guy lives in my neighborhood, and I've waved at him a few times, so I guess this could be considered a controversial deletion. I don't know him personally, but I do know what he got his press coverage for. In short, he was mayor of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logan%2C_West_Virginia_1524.html" title="Logan, West Virginia">Logan, West Virginia</a> (appox. pop. 3000) for sixteen years and was used by the FBI to ferret out political corruption in that town during his run for the W.Va.

I don't think he's of any national importance, and I'm pretty sure he's not going to do anything more to achieve notoriety, since he's now a convicted felon and can't run for office again. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

Minor characters should be places on a list per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. <a href="../../../d/s/p/User%7EDspserpico_ef61.html" title="User:Dspserpico">Dspserpico</a> 05:36, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>So, do you think it's ok to take multiple full-length articles and make super-long composite articles? That seems to be a downright lousy system of presenting information. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> is an out-of-the-way guideline, that reflects the "consensus" of a limited number, and doesn't reflect long standing consensus expressed on AFD results, for a long time. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:43, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> you may be right on Soong, I was staring at the article seeing if there was any good way to pare down the article, there really isn't. Perhaps there's a better way to fit WP:FICT into this, espeically when dealing with a long running TV series. But there is still plenty of stubs of truly minor characters that need to be merged into a TNG list. I guess I just found myself a project. <a href="../../../d/s/p/User%7EDspserpico_ef61.html" title="User:Dspserpico">Dspserpico</a> 05:52, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I tried starting a discussion at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_32c8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (fiction)</a>. I'm not anti-merge per se. But, we need to think up some better criteria for them. I do agree with you, that there probably are some other TNG stubs that need merging. But, the question to ask, is where to merge them to. I'm not sure another "List of loosely related characters" is the way to go. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is also a photo that matches the description that was given on an earlier version of this page. The problem is that the site itself looks an awful lot like a hoax. Google makes HRH Prince Michael of Albany look like a real person, though. Also, this is the only reference to the award that I could find, excluding Wikipedia mirrors.

<p>-Do Not Delete- it, as it is my creation, how does wiki define the THEORY of general relativity- it never ceases to amaze me that arrogance in the tech world-"dug your own grave"-that kind of arrogance does not belong on wikipedia. Furthermore as personal digital liquidity is not a theory and is in fact an ability that anyone can have and if you know an inkling about economics, you know what liquidity is. There are other writers who comment about this quality without coining it, I have a specific definition it is spoken about in PC MAG and other major publications. They speak of the value in flexibility etc. with regard to software hardware. They do not create an all encompassing phrase or go into as much detail about what it encompasses, I thought wikipedia was all about this to include what others dfo not and to stay on the cutting edge, perhaps I am mistaken. Do I really have to have my clients comment on PDL for you to accept it- so far, as it is not a position, and is based on fact, and simply locks in to a definition that others have been working with in terms of the technical world. I do not see any reason to delete this submission. Do I really need a technical .com address to be able to submit- do I really need to have others write about it-just because you have a hard time googling it-doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have broader concerns about how Wikipedia handles notability when it comes to crime victims (versus criminals). We have many articles on Wikipedia about notable <a href="../../../c/r/i/Category%7ECriminals_c838.html" title="Category:Criminals">criminals</a>. If not for the criminal act or incident that gave them notability, they are not notable. This is the case for each of the 19 hijackers. But, somehow Wikipedia judges them <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notable</a> because of their criminal act is highly notable. Under the very same standard, the victims of these notorious criminals/incidents are also notable. I disagree with the double-standard applied to criminals of notorous crimes versus their victims. If we delete this article, then perhaps the hijacker articles should also go, except maybe <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Atta_1743.html" title="Mohammed Atta">Mohammed Atta</a> which is more a familiar name than the others. And in some cases, Wikipedia has allowed articles on <a href="../../../m/u/r/Category%7EMurder_victims_by_nationality_de6e.html" title="Category:Murder victims by nationality">crime victims</a>. For example, we have an article on both <a href="../../../l/a/c/Laci_Peterson_cec6.html" title="Laci Peterson">Laci Peterson</a> (and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Peterson_18fa.html" title="Scott Peterson">Scott Peterson</a>), as well as <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandra_Levy_52b3.html" title="Chandra Levy">Chandra Levy</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/JonBen%C3%A9t_Ramsey_b118.html" title="JonBenét Ramsey">JonBenét Ramsey</a>, and others going back to the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Category%7EJack_the_Ripper_victims_640f.html" title="Category:Jack the Ripper victims">victims</a> of Jack the Ripper. None were notable until their murders. I disagree with the double-standard applied here, with these <a href="../../../m/u/r/Category%7EMurder_victims_by_nationality_de6e.html" title="Category:Murder victims by nationality">crime victims</a> versus 9/11 victims. If we delete this article, then the articles about <a href="../../../l/a/c/Laci_Peterson_cec6.html" title="Laci Peterson">Laci Peterson</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandra_Levy_52b3.html" title="Chandra Levy">Chandra Levy</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/JonBen%C3%A9t_Ramsey_b118.html" title="JonBenét Ramsey">JonBenét Ramsey</a>, and other <a href="../../../m/u/r/Category%7EMurder_victims_by_nationality_de6e.html" title="Category:Murder victims by nationality">crime victims</a> need to be deleted. In all we need more uniformity in how we apply <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to both criminals and crime victims, as well as among victims of various notorious crimes. Of course Wikipedia is not a memorial. Any crime victim articles on Wikipedia need to be handled in an encyclopedic manner, be properly <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 14:54, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>In the case of 9/11, I understand that people object to having nearly 3000 individual articles, and object to treating 9/11 differently than other terrorist incidents. (e.g. American invasion of Iraq). Perhaps a solution would be merely a list of victims (rather than 3000 articles), similar to <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casualties_of_the_7_July_2005_London_bombings_233a.html#Fatalities" title="Casualties of the 7 July 2005 London bombings">Casualties_of_the_7_July_2005_London_bombings#Fatalities</a>, with a brief one-liner (e.g. "Lee Baisden, 34, an accountant from Romford (East London)") for each. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 15:08, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have been working on Wikipedia since 2003 and I seem to recall that we had a huge problem with memorial sites created for 9/11 victims. Also I must register my disagreement with Kmf164: we cannot reasonably list every victim of Pearl Harbor or other incidents on multiple pages. Contrastingly, many, many criminals are highly notable for their crimes and do deserve their own articles. - <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbscissa_152a.html" title="User:Abscissa">Abscissa</a> 15:38, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Also note that victims are listed in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_massacre_3e4b.html" title="Columbine High School massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a>, among some other articles. I understand complications of having individual articles for each victim (due to the shear number for 9/11 and many other incidents). But, somehow we need to find a place at least for a list. I would find such a list to be a helpful, encyclopedic reference.

<li>Is having a certain Alexa ranking an official Wikipedia policy? 2 million seems arbitrary. What is the basis of that cut off point? I think the site is certainly notable enough for inclusion on Wikipedia, despite not being referred to in a published source. In my experience with debate sites over the years, I have found that ODN is a unique phenomenon. It is a well-moderated site which manages to keep a good balance between a friendly atmosphere and disallowing excessive spam. I have found no other broad topic debate sites with a comparable consistent membership and member satisfaction. All other comparably popular and professional debate sites I have found are focused on specific areas, such as religion only or politics only. It is also notable for being founded as a private individual venture, rather than by a large company. Since the disputed NPOV sentence has been removed, and the article has been expanded and reformatted, I believe the current Online Debate Network entry is an acceptable one for Wikipedia. However, if it's decided that it should be removed, I will not argue further, as I respect the Wikipedia project and its organizers. Thanks for considering allowing it to remain. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinbrowning_8920.html" title="User:Kevinbrowning">Kevinbrowning</a> 19:45, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Having a high Alexa ranking is not necessary, however it is a guideline when it comes to popularity. If the site is not popular and nobody (in the media) has heard of it, how can we find sufficient reliable, third-party sources to write an article about it? <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 20:00, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the site is relatively very popular, for the type of site it is. Although it is being edited mostly by site members rather than a third party, I believe all NPOV sentences have been removed, and the general tone has been made more neutral. As long as it is written sufficiently impartially, I think it should not matter who writes it. To demand a certain person write it, even if the current writers have written truthfully, seems like the ad hominem fallacy. Thanks for your following up on this. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinbrowning_8920.html" title="User:Kevinbrowning">Kevinbrowning</a> 20:32, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You're right that it doesn't matter who writes the article, as long as it is written from a neutral point of view. We're discussing whether the site merits a Wikipedia article at all. In theory, the content of the article on this subject shouldn't matter, because even if this article were not neutral, it could be changed into a neutral article if the result of the discuss were to keep the article. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatusRoma_4ae1.html" title="User talk:NatusRoma">Talk</a> 05:43, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>While the Alexa ranking is clearly over the limit, I'm poised to ask, since it's not an official rule regarding Wikiarticles, doesn't that seem a tad arbitrary? Because something isn't as popular as you feel it should be, does that really mean it should be deleted? I'm sure there's a lot of unpopular events, places, or people out there that deserve an article about them. If Wikipedia only hosted the "popular" things, it would be less worthy to come to than Google. Why come here if you're only going to find popular things? What happened to it being a "Free ENCYCLOPEDIA"? An encyclopedia houses unpopular information WITH the popular. Why not let it stay for a little while, allow it to be further revised, and then if it doesn't work out, remove it?Whitestone</p>

<li>You're right that the Alexa ranking doesn't violate a specific guideline. However, the fact that the Alexa ranking is over 2,000,000 means that this really is not a very popular website. Other evidence for this is that many of the top Google hits for "Online Debate Network" -wikipedia (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=dAc&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22online+debate+network%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=dAc&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22online+debate+network%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>) are mirrors of the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debate.html" title="Debate">debate</a>, which contains a link to the forum. Furthermore, this search reveals only 40 unique hits, which is very few. There are many Wikipedia users who believe, like you, that what sort of splash a person, event, or entity has created shouldn't matter for whether Wikipedia has an article about it. There are also many Wikipedia users who believe, like me, that the amount of fame or notability that something has generated is important in determining whether there should be a Wikipedia article about it. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatusRoma_4ae1.html" title="User talk:NatusRoma">Talk</a> 05:43, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well (NatusRoma), if this article doesn't "violate any specific guideline", then it shouldn't be deleted...period. After admitting that it doesn't violate any rules, you then went on to complain that the site isn't very popular, but this shouldn't matter as this appears to be a matter of your personal bias/opinion, not of Wiki policy. You said it yourself, there are many Wikipedia users who don't care if there is an article about an unpopular site...but there are some who do. Personal preference shouldn't determine deletions, Wiki rules should and you have admitted that this article doesn't violate any such rules. nickmanderson</li>

<p>Do all Wikipedia entries have detailed notability guidelines, or only Web sites? It seems to me that what's notable to one person may be of very little import to another, and vice versa. I must raise the objection of a double standard applied to Web sites but not other content, if the latter.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> is my final vote after reading and considering the arguments of those who believe the Online Debate Network article should be deleted. After reading the notability guidelines, I have decided that it is really quite vague and arbitrary, and in fact many topics other than Web sites are not submitted to nearly as stringent notability requirements, or sometimes none at all. Through personal experience I believe that ODN is a unique and important part of the subculture of online debating, and I think an article explaining what it is and why it has become popular is a credible topic for an online encyclopedia which attempts to cover all areas of knowledge and relevance. I will not argue the point further, as I think there is nothing left to say, and leave the final decision up to the longtime editors and moderators of this resource. However, I will say that several new members have joined since ODN was added as a related site on the main Debate entry in Wikipedia, and the evaluations have been uniformly positive. I leave you with this quote from a recent new member, "paintist," who found ODN after trying and being dissatisfied with several other online debating sites, and then found ODN through Wikipedia's Debate article: "It'd be pretty unfortunate to see this get deleted. As far as I can tell, this is the strongest forum available for online intellectual debate/argumentation on the internet... granted I've only been a member only a few hours. And if that's true (is there anywhere else?), then it seems like good enough information to be rooted into wikipedia." Thanks one final time for actually considering this entry's legitimacy, rather than taking immediate elitist action and removing the entry, as so many inferior Internet communities tend to do. - Kevin Browning, devoted user of both ODN and Wikipedia <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinbrowning_8920.html" title="User:Kevinbrowning">Kevinbrowning</a> 03:30, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Do not delete: My verdict after reading over and considering the arguments here. The Online Debate Network is a type of site of which there are very few and and given that it is a not for profit site, its Wikipedia article can hardly be considered advertisement. The entry seems fine to me. Arguments against it seem very vague and ambiguous, setting double standards that don't seem to apply to any article here except this one. Further, the popularity of the site seems irrelevant to Wikipedia's giving information about it. Or do those who oppose this article think that Wikipedia should not give information about unpopular books, movies, shows, places, games and products as well? - Starcreator <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarcreator_18c7.html" title="User:Starcreator">Starcreator</a> 12:11, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> is my vote. I don't understand WHY this article should be up for deletion if it hasn't broken any rules, this is supposed to be a site about open information. Popularity doesn't have anything to do with this at all, many things in history aren't popular to look up, many can even be considered irrelevant to history, but it's in there for our use. Keep the article up I say, there is nothing wrong with it. "ShadowKnight 06:51, 30 April 2006 (UTC)"</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. Discounting anons and new editors, and with 2 extra delete voices since relisting, I think consensus is clear. I probably should have closed as delete rather than relisting in the first place but now there's no excuse not to close it that way. Furthermore, as for arguments raised, he would appear to be borderline on notability and most editors felt that he wasn't quite there yet. He's a young man and maybe he will become more notable in the future, there's no rush. This is an enyclopedia and it's meant to stand the test of time. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 06:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. This is still advertisement or sycophancy. It remains strong POV. It is all written by Dezhnev (a new user), who is probably the same person as Macaroni. 84.70.175.84 10:52, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sepentrionalis/Pmanderson is acting like a spoilt child who cannot get their way. Maybe, just maybe the above is normally signed in but this time wasn't, maybe they didn't realise they were logged out, or maybe this is the only time they've felt strongly enough to want to post here. You are also lying that eBayVP's previous edits are all incomplete nominations, as his two deletion requests had been deleted. Stop trying to judge people on how many times they have posted, that is completely irrelevant and discriminatory. <a href="../../../d/e/z/User%7EDezhnev_08f7.html" title="User:Dezhnev">Dezhnev</a> 08:50, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Much of this comment speaks for itself. It may well be true other edits by EBayVP have been deleted; but if he's not Dezhnev's sockpuppet, how does Dezhnev know? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:56, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no doubt that EBayVP is Dezhnev's sockpuppet and Dezhnev has acknowledged he is a close relation of Kirill who is proud of Kirill - which is just fine. I think he would be better off watching this space; it is hugely relevant that EBayVP and Dezhnev are virtually non-contributors to other entries. They have staggered into the room for this topic alone and it would be strange indeed if their views were not discounted accordingly. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 17:58, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Goodness sake. Highest calibre graduate in the entire UK is certainly more notable than half the people entries on this site. And no, before any pedants step in, I am not a "sockpuppet" and have not met Kiril in person. <a href="../../../g/o/y/User%7EGOY2006_2dd4.html" title="User:GOY2006">GOY2006</a> 03:20, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - My objection is to Kiril inserting himself as one of the great people of St Johns College, Oxford. This link is what I have a problem with. Kiril is obviously a gifted and well positioned young man. It may be a little preemptive to call him one of the greats of a very old college. Metaphorically, when one's child pronounces that s/he wishes to be an astronaut when they are grown up, it absurd to expect their name to be immediately added to NASA's astronauts list. Let Kiril live his life. If it turns out as he hopes, it will be added. If not, he will avoid embarrasing himself. Oxford is not going anywhere, it can afford to wait - commentator, St Cross College, Oxford and former member Darwin College, Cambridge</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - achievements to date include going to school, university, and playing games. Well done him. Now he should go and do something worthwhile. I dispute that he <i>is getting huge coverage [...] everyone knows who he is</i>: what is he supposed to have done - and no links are included in the article. Precisely the sort of self-aggrandising rubbish that should be saved for his User page rather than the main Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> 20:44, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>those speaking negatively are posting hilarious comments not based on facts and not in the spirit of wikipedia. how do you know kirill added himself as a great of st johns? or even contributed to this article? or cares whether he's on here or not? i suggest commenting only if you have access to facts, in an objective manner and on him personally only if you know him well. Just as should be the case for everyone on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I feel the need to defend myself here.

The JT article has no online sources at all now. A Modest Video Game Proposal was entirely online-based, with Thompson issuing his ultimatium through the Internet, the "I'm O.K" guys developing and releasing their game on the Internet, Penny-Arcade (online website) giving the $10,000 check, reporting online, and GameSpot picking up his complaint to the Seattle police department. If isn't allowed in the JT article itself, why should it belong on a sub-article, a fork of the article? Hbdragon88 05:23, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> If this sort of thing is to be Jack Thompson's M.O., absolutely we should keep this information on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> The sourcing is better than in the original Jack Thompson article and is easily verifiable, and due to Thompson's own heavy-handed tactics relies to a great extent on documents of public record.

If he'd ever successfully prosecuted a case against a videogame maker, or successfully used a videogame defense, or even brought a successful lawsuit against one of his "stalkers" (his supposed reporting of Texas kid to the authorities is completely self-reported if I'm not mistaken) it would be something worth writing about, but 90% of the content here is about totally pointless chatter that has no discernable effect on the real world. 3 (+?) articles about forum trolling, legal threats that evaporate on scrutiny, hyperbolic polemics, and public responses to Mr. Thompson seems to be vastly overstating his actual ability to influence the videogaming world.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:51, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge if possible</b>, although likely, it won't be, as most of the references are to deleted GamePolitics posts. The accusations of an "industry conspiracy to shoot the messenger" I think are important, because he accused the porn industry of the same back when he was trying to get all sorts of music banned for obscenity.

<li><b>Merge</b> whatever can be reliably sourced into <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Thompson_%28attorney%29_1506.html" title="Jack Thompson (attorney)">Jack Thompson (attorney)</a>. This smells like a fork to get around the sourcing rules on the main Jack Thompaon article. From a quick read of the Jack Thompson talk page several things removed from there seemed to have ended up here (like the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Talk%7EJack_Thompson_%28attorney%29_c45d.html#Metalgearsolid.org" title="Talk:Jack Thompson (attorney)">Metalgearsolid.org stuff</a>). <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a> 22:50, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> FYI this fork was created long before the current sourcing issues came up. The original reason for the fork was because the main article was being considered for deletion due to it's length. This and other sub-articles were a result of an attempt to short the main article, while keeping notable events consolidated. However it never went through the same sourcing review that the main page did after Thompson's complaint. Jabrwock 18:59, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

The existing Jack Thompson article is too big already. Instead I think we should take all such scenarios (specificly, of Jack making dick of himself on the internet) here and on the main Jack thompson article, and organize it into a single large article entitled 'Jack Thompson and the Internet' or something to that effect.--KefkaTheClown 03:52, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> OR AT LEAST MERGE, this article seems to be more like a section of the Jack Thompson article sliced up and given its own section I think the sources are perfectly fine. The article is supposed to show Jack Thompson's relationship with gamers and for that I think that his posts on a gaming forum that he trolls at all the time would be a perfect source. Besides gamepolitics doesn't take up THAT much space in the article.<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFather_Time89_1834.html" title="User:Father Time89">User: Father_Time89</a></li>

He hasn't really done anything amazing on the reserach side (he still hasn't got his PhD!) but he did make a splash by picking up the ***first*** MQ Computing university medal in 91. That is probably his only claim to notability though. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovacatz_2388.html" title="User:Novacatz">novacatz</a> 02:42, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because he's simply going through the contribution list of several editors, myself include, who have been actively reviewing and challenging prods, and bringing the articles to AfD without regard to the merits of the dispute. In some cases, it appears that he hasn't even read the reasons for deprodding. He's said that his standard is whether the original prod makes a "prima facie case," indicating that the other side of the argument is irrelevant to his decision. ANd I think that can fairly be characterized as bad faith, or disruption, or <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, or whatever. It's indiscriminate action, no more appropriate than me nominating for deletion every article created in a particular one-hour period.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete.</b> The only keep argument is somewhat negated by the fact that the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Lord_63e6.html" title="Dark Lord">Dark Lord</a> article itself does not limit itself to people who are actually called "Dark Lord".

<p>This looks as if it's a real and notable subject, but on closer investigation things might not be all they seem. For example, the books mentioned appear to be either free e-books or published by Philip Communications (i.e. self-published). Google shows under 600 hits, with Wikipedia top of the list. No citations are provided outside the subject's own websites. I can't decide whether the problem here is systemic bias or whether the guy simply is not as important as the article would have us believe. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:48, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> sadly. This person would easily be notable, if we could verify the information that is contained. Without independent sources, this article will always be POV. It will always be either used for promotion or for attack. We already have a problem of discussing something as basic as his education in the article, due to the lack of independent sources writing about him. It's to important to not mention, yet we haven't the sourcing to do it verifiably, neutrally, and completely. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:33, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am the person who last worked on this article. I notice that some of you who want deletion are not presenting the whole fact. For example, one of you say that bibliography leads to the personal sites of this person. You ignored several regular commercial publishers who are listed there. Similarly none of you is ready to consider the definition of "accredited" other than the American model, though mosts older institutions in India work under a British model and do not come under this classification. Some of our greatest scientists, doctors, lawyers, journalists, and ALL theologians come out of these "older" institutions patterned after the British model that are not listed as "accredited" yet they find no difficulty in getting admitted or appointed in the newer institutions that are pattered after the American system and listed in many places as "accredited". Institutions within India know about the British and American models that work here. Since it it difficult to work against so many people who simply are not willing to consider these points I raised, I too recommend that this article be deleted. If this guy is really of any importance let someone else write about him somewhere else. --Nonikay2k</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - is this some sort of joke? This page is for an extremely popular beer in the Republic Of Ireland. "no particular assertion of notability". You can clearly see in the pictures that it is indeed a genuine type of beer. If you delete this particular beer, then I assume you'll be deleting the pages of every other produced beer on Wikipedia? Heineken, Carslberg etc? utterly ridiculous. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayteecork_56dc.html" title="User:Jayteecork">Jayteecork</a> 11:51, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's not really possible to pass an opinon on this AfD without seeing the copy of this page prior to Zanimum deleting it clean out of the history.

<li>what issues remain, Tito, et. al? If you're not providing constructive criticism, you're just being rude. In IETF circles, at least, if you're unhappy with something, you're expected to suggest alternate wording. None of the complaints suggest that a good article on Upfront Rewards can't exist.</li>

<li>Just my two cents, but I just needed to know if Capitol Records was part of Warner Music or not. I came to Wikipedia, found that link in 2 seconds and now I know. So, for me, it was completely handy.

<li>Retain- I see no reason to get rid of a very complete list of record labels. It seems a waste to get rid of something that can be quite useful. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 138.78.110.99 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.78.110.99_f088.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.78.110.99">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li>Retain For the purpose of researching a specific record lasble, a list is much more useful than categories.

<li><b>Keep</b> - fascinating list, and there are plenty of blue links on it. I agree the first paragraphs are nothing special and most of those could go, but the list itself is viable. It is not true that "it can never contain actual verifiable information", because all Wiki needs for verification is a published source, and presumably that's where the info came from in the first place.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:08, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>A published source isn't really enough. A published <i>reliable</i> source is needed. And the sad fact is that the content of that page has been disputed at least in parts for about two years, and still there is no reliable source for the actual language skill level for any one of those "polyglots". I agree that it is fascinating reading, but it is not factual.</li>
<li>I admit that it is a noteworthy fact <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Caspar_Mezzofanti_7720.html" title="Giuseppe Caspar Mezzofanti">Mezzofanti</a> is supposed to have spoken one hundred languages. It is always interesting to see how people were perceived.

<li><b>Keep</b> - For many of the individuals the information seems to be verifiable, and the sources should be contained in the blue-linked articles where they belong.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Haikupoet is right, tall ships are unusual and some are definitely notable, but this is a 1989-built leisure boat used by a commercial operation. Compare with <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tall_Ships_Youth_Trust_5cd6.html" title="Tall Ships Youth Trust">Tall Ships Youth Trust</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stavros_S_Niarchos_%28ship%29_e943.html" title="Stavros S Niarchos (ship)">Stavros S Niarchos (ship)</a>. Trivia fans: <i>Stavros</i> was completed and fittted out at Appledore yards (no connection). I'm undecided. It looks like spam for BaySail as-is (TSYT is a not-for-profit), but open to persuasion either way. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:07, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Wikipedia's blatant attempts at censorship aside, this term is quickly becoming relevant. Delete it if you must, but you'll come back with your tail between your politically correct legs and add it later. In all seriousnes, if Wikipedia is supposed to be "impartial", I find it laughable you're fussing over this word. It's more than just a few forums..do your research. Besides, "spam", "netizen", "blogger"...these all started off "on a few forums". Your excuses are weak, and probably indicative of a conservative upbringing. Neverfailtotry

<li><b>Comment</b> This seems to be a common argument by people arguing for newly made-up words, that other, now common terms were once equally obscure. The difference is that words like "spam", "netizen", "blogger" are no longer obscure. This one is still about as obscure as they come, and we don't add words here because they <i>might</i> become common or are <i>"quickly becoming relevant."</i> <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 23:49, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>New set of articles about non-notable pet theory. Original set of articles posted in June/July 2005.</p>

<p>Material regarding Cycles Theory was originally inserted into Wikipedia in the summer of 2005. This was backed out where it was added into articles like <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycle.html" title="Cycle">Cycle</a>, and deleted outright when it was presented in articles like Harmonics Theory, as it represents the pet theory of one individual (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Harmonics_Theory_9b87.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Harmonics_Theory_%282nd_nomination%29_bb72.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory (2nd nomination)</a> for sample context).

<dd>Too funny. This is a 501c3 U.S. recognized organization. That is doing research in cycle theory. Your personal opinions on whether it is bias, rubbish or pseudoscience is redundant. This is a verifiable entity conduction research in cycle theory. Thus a sub on the theory should be expanded. Therefore, cycle theory should be on wikipedia as the foundation and it research arm. Personally, I hold little interest in the topic. But what does interest me is giving credit were it should be given and it should be. <a href="../../../h/0/r/User%7EH0riz0n_8488.html" title="User:H0riz0n">H0riz0n</a> 06:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First - State a vote of "<b>keep</b>" or "<b>delete</b>", at the beginning of your voting comment, either as a blanket for all articles listed, or on an article-by-article basis.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second - getting registered as a non-profit organization doesn't make you noteworthy. It means you went to the appropriate office, filled in the form, and paid the fee. I've been part of one which consisted of half a dozen people who met once a year to satisfy the AGM requirements so I'm quite familiar with the process.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The most likely deletion criterion considered here is notability (though that's not a cast in stone policy, it tends to be what gets considered). What makes a _scientific_ _theory_ notable or non-notable is how much mention it gets by scientists. What makes an entity in general notable or non-notable is how much mention it gets by the public at large. Google is the usual yardstick for this for AfD disputes. Go and check for yourself to see whether this is notable or not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Third - while status as science or pseudoscience isn't relevant for an AfD vote, it _is_ relevant for how the articles themselves are presented (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>). I have a strong background in science and engineering. If I call something pseudoscience, it's because I have the expertise to know it certainly is. If I'm not sure, I _say_ that I'm not sure, and <i>ask scientists</i>. Accusing me of "bias" and "personal opinion" when assigning labels like that verges on being a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. Please consider the possibility that I _do_ know what I'm talking about. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 07:07, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- Though there are many studies of cyclic processes in different forms of science, I see no independent evidence for the existence of a coherent discipline known as "cycle theory" as defined on the article page, one which tried to be a "unified theory of cycles". The key question here is not whether one can find times when various economic models are described a cyclical, but whether or not there exists a "cycle theory" as a disciplinary field. It seems, from a superficial look at the links offered here, that the author is trying to carve out some sort of new interdisciplinary approach. That's good and well, but unless there is independent reference to this from a mainstream source of some sort I don't think it passes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and does not belong on Wikipedia.

The articles focus quite a bit on cycles outside of business, but have no links to <b>peer-reviewed and respected</b> publications outside of the business-related links. It appears that "Cycle Theory" might be an obscure business theory, but depending considerably on psychology of people involved in business, which bears little relation to what these articles are about. To cite a precedent, this is much less notable than Aetherometry, which was deleted for non-notability. Foundation for the Study of Cycles seems a bit questionable too - many of the links to it appear to be astrology related - but I will look into this later. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> 05:56, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Both of these books extensively discuss various applications, and discuss both periodic and almost periodic dynamical systems.</dd>
<dd>I urge anyone interested to obtain one or both of these books and also to read the articles up for AfD in order to verify the following assertions:

<li>Modern <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamical_system.html" title="Dynamical system">dynamical systems</a> theory offers much insight into why cycles are common (but certainly not ubiqitous) in dynamical systems, including systems which are often used to model phenomena in economics, biology, and physics.</li>
<li>"Cycle theory" as described at the <a href="http://www.foundationforthestudyofcycles.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.foundationforthestudyofcycles.org/" rel="nofollow">FSC website</a> and in Cycles Research Institute and the other articles up for AfD amounts to little more than the observation that cycles are common (but certainly not ubiquitious) in phenomena which nowadays are often modeled as some kind of dynamical system (continuous or discrete).</li>
<li><i>There is no such subject as "cycle theory" in mathematics or dynamical systems theory.</i></li>
<li>The mathematical theory of dynamical systems is a <i>theory</i>. The "cycle theory" promoted in these articles is vapid nonsense.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Since the real theory (dynamical systems) is both beautiful and powerful, I encourage anyone interested to learn a bit about it.

<dd>There are in fact beautiful connections between cycles, closed geodesics, zeta functions, primes, and all that.

<dd><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">User:Fabartus</a>, your comment is almost unreadable (I tried to improve the formatting but probably failed). I have some comments:
<ol>
<li>move to <i>what</i>? What is this <i>"respectable webpage"</i>? What on Earth does "respectable webpage" even mean? Are you saying that you believe that WP should have articles on <i>every website in the world?!</i></li>
<li>Up above we already discussed the key issue in detail the point: in his websites, UseNet postings, and WP articles, Tomes uses legitimate terms from math and mathematical sciences like <i>harmonic</i>, <i>cycle</i>, and by mentions some genuine legitimate research, in hope that the reader will conclude that Edward R. Dewey's vapid numerology is meaningful and mainstream. Neither is the case. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_R._Dewey&amp;oldid=47348205" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_R._Dewey&amp;oldid=47348205" rel="nofollow">my version</a> of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_R._Dewey_8f73.html" title="Edward R. Dewey">Edward R. Dewey</a>, I tried to stress the contrast between vapid numerological mysticism and genuine mathematical theories, by sketching some theorems from dynamical systems theory which mention (mathematical precise notions of) "cycles".</li>
<li>You seem to imply that you believe that we critics don't know what we are talking about when it comes to mathematics and science in general or cycles in particular. Did you overlook the fact that my own <a href="http://www.genealogy.ams.org/html/id.phtml?id=28250" class="external text" title="http://www.genealogy.ams.org/html/id.phtml?id=28250" rel="nofollow">dissertation</a> concerned a class of dynamical systems which (in the generic case) contain no cycles whatever, contrary to the ludicrous claim, attributed to Dewey by Tomes, that <i>"cycles are present in everything which has been studied"</i>. I assure you that before you can understand notions of <i>aperiodicity</i>, you need to understand notions of <i>periodicity</i>!</li>
<li>You ask <i>"Has anyone noticed that one of the Board Members on the below link is the CEO of FedEX? Think he's wasting his time?"</i>. By "Board Members on the below link", I presume you mean "Members of the Board of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles". So what are the scientific credentials of this person? If he has none, why would you think we would be impressed? Particularly since we are well aware of a common cranky tactic of inflating polite replies to emails into "endorsements" (I've been a victim of that myself).</li>
<li><i>"From the same site"</i>: aye, there's the rub. Edward R. Dewey appears to be entirely non-notable in the sense that I am unable to find information about him which does <i>not</i> come from one of the websites associated with Ray Tomes, which I insist are neither reliable nor independent sources of information.</li>
<li><i>"The Foundation has now become the recognized world center for multidisciplinary cycle research."</i> The trouble is, the only source for this claim appears to be none other than Ray Tomes and members of his organization. I take it that you are one yourself? In any case, this ducks the point, since mainstream science has recognized no need for "multidisciplinary cycle research", while happily accepting dynamical systems theory, which already provides powerful, beautiful, provable, and highly applicable insights into many aspects of dynamical behavior, including cyclical and non-cyclical behavior.</li>

<dd>Some points in response here:
<ul>
<li>The search for "Cycles Research" isn't returning what you think it is - take a look at the results. Hardly any of these results are related to the articles in question. Searching for "Cycles Theory" gives similarly erroneous results.</li>
<li>Many of us are mathematicians or physicists who are certainly qualified to judge the notability of these articles.</li>
<li>Although the FSC site certainly asserts notability, it offers little concrete evidence for such. Interestingly, the "recognized world center" for research doesn't appear to have an address, and at least one of its four constituents admits that it doesn't have an office (look at the CRI page, About CRI). Trusting the assertions given on such a site is rather naive, as we have seen in the past (see the Aetherometry discussions, for example).</li>
<li>Many pseudoscientific and obscure organizations have been around for a long time, or claim to have been around for a long time. That doesn't make them notable.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Whether these people (or person) are able to show something in the future or not doesn't really effect their notability now. They are still pseudoscientists, just like others we have deleted before, and non-notable ones at that. They appear to have attached themselves to a term used in economics, but do not really appear to have anything to do with it - while Cycle Theory in business has to do with psychology and other such things, and could probably be formulated on a rational basis, this group is concerned with things like linking cycles in the sun to economics. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> 13:07, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is almost but not quite at the level of noting that <i>many things can be counted,</i> creating a Foundation for the Study of Countability espousing "Countability Theory" as a deep theory of nature, putting [[Category:Countables]] on a bunch of pages and then justifying by pointing out that in mathematics there is something called <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_theory.html" title="Number theory">Number theory</a>.

<dd>Pedantic but to my mind important correction: you wrote <i>"The fact that there are actual discussions in specific fields of something called 'cycle theory'"'.

<dd>No, no, you misunderstand me, or I wasn't clear. While I appreciated your point about dynamical systems theory, I wasn't responding to you at all. Some posters above seemed to be suggesting that since there's a real theory called "cycle theory" (in field X) the term can be used in any context, which is clearly wrong. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> above wrote "while Cycle Theory in business has to do with psychology and other such things"--I was expanding on his point, not yours. My point was that even if there <i>were</i> something called "cycle theory" in some field (I have no idea whether any field actually uses the term), that doesn't justify the use of the term promiscuously or, in the Tomesian sense, as some kind of universal Key to All Sciences. So, I am in fact in complete agreement with you (and, I believe, <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a>).

<dd>See Sjakalle's comment above: "Call me a process stickler if you will, but for some reason, this has fallen off the April 5 AFD log. I am not sure when it happened, but since a discussion can be radically altered by it not being on the main AFD list, I thought it best to ensure that it gets sufficient attention by having it on for the full 5 days.

<dd>To the best of my knowledge, AfD pages stick around. I dug up links to the old Harmonics Theory ones when HT was re-posted. Anything that directly duplicates deleted content, under the same name or not, gets speedied pretty quickly. I nominated these two articles using the full AfD process because I thought they were different enough in content that it would be hard to make an ironclad case for them being duplicates. I removed FSC from the list of nominated articles because the two remaining articles, unlike FSC, _largely_ duplicated previously-deleted content, and so would probably be less contested than an AfD that included the FSC article. I'll take a closer look at the two articles you nominated this coming week.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 06:02, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Salix, as a mathematician I have no quarrel with mathematical economics. But, Salix, <i>these articles hardly mention economics!</i> Their only purpose is to promote the numerological mysticism of Dewey/Tomes. That is cranky POV-pushing and I think that cranky POV-pushing is unacceptable in Wikipedia. Let us not lose sight of the fact that ultimately WP is or should be reliable source of information for the general reader. It is not a soapbox for promoting crank "theories". ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:47, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>No vote.</b> I'm no longer certain. While looking up info on <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_R._Dewey_8f73.html" title="Edward R. Dewey">Edward R.

It mentions that he worked in "interdisciplinary cycle research" and that there is now a <i>Journal of Interdisciplinary Cycle Research</i> <a href="http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/f06e2d629b6d7fc9.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/f06e2d629b6d7fc9.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> So it would appear there is such a field, with Dewey as a pioneer. I'm unsure of whether the field is notable enough for inclusion; this is due in part to just the general crappy state of the article on cycle theory.

<li><b>Comment</b> I observe that my nominations have been challenged as being in bad faith, so let me quickly respond here: while contesting a prod is an entirely appropriate and often beneficial action, AfD is a good place to debate the larger merits of articles where the prod itself makes at least a prima facie case, which is my criterion for moving these to AfD. (I have personally refrained from either voting or often even recommending a way to vote since editors can make up their own minds). <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:27, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, bad faith nomination made without regard to the merits of the dispute. Supposed "prima facie case" for deletion was the unsupported boilerplate phrase "nn-bio, vanity", which can be attached to virtually any article; since the deprob referred to the subject's extremely extensive Google Scholar presence, and the nominator conspicuously avoids that point, an inference of bad faith from the available evidence is certainly valid. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:53, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Cox continues to play to this day, including a Hendrix-tribute outfit called the Gypsy Sun Experience, which also includes former bandmate Mitchell on drums and Gary Serkin on guitar (Cox was also the recipient of his own model bass, when the Cort guitar company issued a Billy Cox "Freedom" model bass in the late '90s). But no evidence that they really exist.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notability established by Monicasdude, verifiability established by Eusebus.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Thatcher's fine analysis. I should say that I do not ascribe bad faith to the nomination and do not think such ascription to be fair; if anything, one's willingness to engage in a debate as to the propriety of our using certain sources, even where one appears exorbitantly recalcitrant, would seem to suggest that he/she has a deeply- and sincerely-held belief apropos of the notability (or verifiability) of a subject. Though one could, I'm sure, couch a bad faith nom in verifiability terms, I think the willingess of Eusebeus to engage in a genuine debate (making conclusions that, though perhaps not the same as mine, are surely not wholly unreasonable) disposes the question (especially in view of our presumptions in favor of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:16, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since there seems to be some confusion amongst many of the newcomers who are being directed here from the LGB message board, I would like to clear something up. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, and wikipedia is not anarchy. There are <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">criteria for inclusion</a>. The issue under discussion is whether or not this page meets those criteria. Before you make a comment it may be advantageous for you to actually read those criteria so you know what is under discussion. This vote is not a judgement on the relative worth of the forum or the team. Making unsubstantiated claims, attacking other users, vandalizing pages, and deleting other people's comments will not win you the discussion. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 02:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I find it interesting that so many of the editors that are calling for the deletion of this site seem to support rather obscure pages themselves. It is really unfair to judge this page on the opinions of a few people. There are thousands of people who visit this site from all over the country, it is considered by hockey fans to be the best hockey forum on the internet. LGB.com is regularly visited by National Hockey media personalities such as Barry Melrose, John Buccigross and Sean Podein. This is not a site that only reposts articles. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.246.148.219 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.246.148.219_a945.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.246.148.219">contribs</a>).</small>, whose first contribution was the proceding comment.</p>

<li><b>comment</b> This message board (BNF) deserves a place on Wikipedia, largely due to the large number and diversity of hockey fans that come to post opinions. Fans from teams across the NHL, rivals or otherwise, are welcome at this site. Why the need for deletion? Why not include it as a link on the St. Louis Blues' Wiki entry? Given the wide array of topics and issues that can be found on Wikipedia, I don't see how this forum is going to harm Wiki's credibility. There are television shows that ended or were cancelled years ago that still have links to fansites and message boards. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.117.37.122 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.117.37.122_8e0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.117.37.122">contribs</a>) .</small>, whose first contribution is the preceding comment.</li>

The problem is, there are several different, incompatible and strongly held views as to what the term <i><a href="../../../s/l/i/Slide_guitar.html" title="Slide guitar">slide guitar</a></i> means. On the other hand, there's general agreement about what a <i>guitar slide</i> is (the term covers both steel and bottleneck), so we can use this to provide a relatively uncontroversial introduction, without assuming any of the competing traditions. Interested in other ways of doing it, but going back to the previous situation (which is what this proposal amounts to) would be a shame IMO.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. Puzzlingly, no coherent reason for deletion was given by the nominator. During the debate, no arguments for deletion emerged. The subject is a musician who has released an album produced by a major record company.

<li>Hm.

<li>Google shows this gangsta rapper is real, but the first pages are Amazon, a bunch of lyrics sites, and eBay.

The album's article says it was released on <a href="../../../d/e/f/Def_Jam_80c2.html" title="Def Jam">Def Jam</a>/Outburst Records... oh, I see that PolyGram bought (half of) Def Jam in 1994, so RGT cited the parent label of the imprint which actually released it.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Cultural and political significance. lewbrown2</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - appears to be a politically motivated ad and hence not encyclopedic (on its own). If it could be cleaned up and NPOV-ized, I'd recommend <b>merge</b> with a Politics of the UK-type article. In any case I don't think it warrants its own article.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 17:59, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I've not intentionally made this article polictically motivated - it is a description of the Labour party's campaign for the local elections (the campaign itself is 'obviously' designed to be biased), as has been reported in several popular newspapers. Since seeing that this is marked for deletion, I've added some opinion of Tory supporters to the article, and its contradictions. If there is an article on the Local Election Campaigns, 2006, I agree it should be added to that. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Martinp23</a> 19:03, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A lot of facts about the actor such as his place of birth, residing opposite Goldspot, first Asian Levi's model, parents eloping and estranged relationship with family etc are highly debatable or untrue. Also it doesnt seem to be written with a neutral point of view. Seems to be more like a fan page rather than a page bearing facts.

<dd>A lot of our Indian film articles are regrettably unreferenced. The editors are often Indian, and immersed in an environment where gossip about film stars is just as obsessive, and intrusive, as is gossip about Hollywood stars in the US. There's stuff that they just KNOW and don't see any need to reference. It is a constant struggle to keep the articles pruned of gossip and fancruft.</dd>

<p>Article about a seemingly non-notable website.

I would vote to <b>delete</b>, since it fails to establish notability per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <sub>└</sub> <sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 20:05, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Certainly seems to fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Pretty hard to find much in the way of relevant GHits. Unable to Alexa, since it's hosted on a free webhost (20m.com), but the fact that it's on a free webhost says a lot. The webmaster hopes to get a real domain name someday? Kind of says it all. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:22, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, thank you UkPaolo for recreating the page and bringing it here instead for discussion. I feel that, although the site discussed on the TigerGardens wiki page may not be notable to the wider world, it does receive sufficient attention and visits to justify the inclusion of a page about it on Wikipedia. The site itself is quite popular with students at schools in Buckinghamshire, UK (for the games and other resources) and I think that it certainly cannot be a bad thing to have too much information and knowledge on Wikipedia, although admittedly I can see how some people may consider TigerGardens to be too trivial and insignificant to deserve a mention on Wikipedia. However, in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> under 'Criteria for web content' the third point states "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster" and I can tell you that TigerGardens has featured on parts of the online publisher MySpace as well as other websites and publishers (such as other smaller, independent websites and online journals). I hope this all justifies allowing the page TigerGardens to remain on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETramster_a0d6.html" title="User:Tramster">Tramster</a> 20:33, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The fact that Prince Albert acknowledged more than one meeting with this person and the fact that her child is called Grimaldi (albeit on her initiative) could at least be a legitimate, neutrally-worded news item. Otherwise rulers can become their own 'Ministry of Truth', with a writ that runs worldwide. However, it could be argued that this does not constitute proof of Ms. Rotolo's claims, so the 'newsworthiness' of the item should not be held to imply the existence of evidence to corroborate the claims of Ms. Rotolo.</p>

<li>While I agree, judging the article souly on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it doesn't hold up much. I beleive this because GBStv is condiserabley new (less than a year old) and, because it is free and nonprofit and created by SA Goons (who tend to not be intrested in the opinions of nonGoons) has received little to no noteriety. However, if you look beyond these factors, GBStv is a prime example of Web 2.0. This is the first television station that is controlled completely by users without any comercial or financial entanglements. GBStv is the wave of the future and, that alone entitles it to have it's own article on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_stuart_c99c.html" title="User:The stuart">The_stuart</a> 16:15, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are no real reasons to delete this article. GBStv has no affiliation with Something Awful other than it was created by member's of the SA forums. Also, the fact that GBStv is less popular than GBS.fm hardly seems to warrant a deletion from Wikipedia. If anything, the fact that it's less popular seems to be more of a reason for Wikipedia to include an article so it can educate the public about GBStv. <a href="../../../s/s/w/User%7ESswanso_c606.html" title="User:Sswanso">User:sswanso</a>

<li><b>Keep</b> Having read the vanity guidelines, I can understand the objection to the link to DeLillo (despite the obvious connection betwewen his novella, "Pafko at the Wall," and Booth's "The Perfect Pafko") and I understand its removal. However, since Pafko has been a Milwaukee icon for over 50 years (and was honored there as recently as this week, prior to a Brewers/Braves game), linking the Booth book to the Milwaukee and Braves pages cannot be dismissed as mere vanity. The book's editor, Kathy Keller, has been editing novels for over 18 years and has never before seen the narrative device mentioned; that is why the book is notable...and its author has earned a first place award for editorial writing in the Society of Professional Journalist's Green Eyeshade competition. It is a serious book by a serious author. The biggest issue here seems to be my lack of contributions, as a newbie, to other pages. I get that...and, to demonstrate that I do, I will be making additional contributions elsewhere over the next few days and beyond. In the meantime, perhaps we can all turn our attention to rooting out vanity where it really exists, which is not in the Robert Booth listing.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Hank Aaron has been a much bigger icon in those cities than this Pafko fellow. Does that mean that if someone writes a fictional book where Aaron is a topic, we should insert external links promoting that book into every WP article involving Aaron or his teams or their cities? <i>No.</i> Also, please <i>sign your comments</i> with four ~'s. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:56, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> The issue is not a lack of contributions... "newbies" are quite welcome, but the edit pattern and article does show intent. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">not a web directory</a> and article links should be directly related to the content at hand. Either way, it is a side issue. Beyond <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity</a> the question posed is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a>. Can "a circulation of 5,000 or more" be shown? Sulfur 18:27, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response:</b> Sulfur: The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a> page you cite weakens your position and strengthens mine. It begins by stating clearly that what follows is a “guideline” and “not Wikipedia policy,” adding that “the whole concept of notability is contentious.” You then take the reference to published authors out of context. The entire standard suggested includes those “who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more <b>or</b> in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more.” Booth’s op-ed pieces have appeared in the <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> <i>Miami Herald,</i> <i>St. Petersburg Times,</i> <i>Atlanta Constitution</i> and <i>Tampa Tribune</i> (which has also reviewed <i>The Perfect Pafko</i>). All of those publications far exceed the 5,000 circulation standard. Finally, the notability page you cite suggests that those feeling a notability standard is not being met, “may wish to explain your position to the user, before nominating it for deletion.” Instead, you pounced immediately on the deletion option. Why? Is this your regular MO on Wikipedia? Would it not have been more prudent to contact me first? That would have allowed the two people who care most about this to dialogue directly on it. As a result, a person of your considerable intelligence would have seen quickly how flimsy the notability argument is and never have put this listing up for deletion consideration.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have yet to see anything presented in this discussion to change my opinion that the article is vanity and non-notable. If the final outcome is "keep," then I recommend that the self publishing bookstore link is replaced with an informational link to Amazon.com. I'm sorry if Mr. Booth feels I have singled him out, but have tried very hard to not alienate a new contributor and fellow Milwaukeean. You are correct that the WP pages are guidelines and not policy... hence the nomination and discussion process taking place. Sulfur 01:01, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> If the "op-ed" pieces were featured guest editorials in those major newspapers and not just letters-to-the-editor, then those citations would apparently be worth adding to the article as meeting the "audience of 5000" guideline. There might still not be a consensus to keep, but it would give editors more reason not to jump to a perhaps-hasty "not notable" conclusion. On the other hand, the facts presented here only bring the article's subject to <i>the verge of</i> notability, not a clear-cut case where a delete vote goes against WP's core policies. Certainly <i>not</i> a situation where a user ought to demand removal from this process of fact-finding, discussion, and consensus-building. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:26, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response</b> You both make good points. The Amazon link would be more recognizable. Also, there is nothing notable about getting letters to the editor published; anyone could do that. The articles referred to here, though, were true op-ed columns, chosen by op-ed editors in every case to be displayed in exactly the same fashion as syndicated columns running on the same page. Regarding Aaron vs. Pafko, there is no question Aaron was the better player, but the better player doesn't always make the better story. Pafko was more popular in Milwaukee. That was because he was the only original Milwaukee Brave who was a Wisconsin native and also because, as the son of small town, Slovakian immigrants, he embraced and returned the affection of Milwaukee's large Eastern European community. But the title refers more to the famous Pafko baseball card--Topps #1 in 1952--that is rarely found today in mint condition. Finally, the "Robert Booth" entry in WP will not remain a stub. "Pafko" is extremely topical, dealing directly with the steroid crisis currently gripping baseball. Lamentably, that issue will reverberate for many years...but that fact will help sustain interest in "The Perfect Pafko." The author is also now at work on his second book.Robertbo 23:05, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. His book has an amazon sales rating worse than 1.3m, so I posit that it does not have sufficient readership to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.
