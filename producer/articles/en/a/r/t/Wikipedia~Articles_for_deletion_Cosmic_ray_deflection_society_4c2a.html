<p>We have about 250 members world wide, including many artcart artists, environmentalists and art critics. We are a humorous environmental group. We were a major player in the web goes black, back in 1996 and were one of the first groups to call attention to the whole in the ozone in the 2 year period back in 73, when no one seemed to care. We were the ones with the holes in our heads then. I have looked at all the pages of those of you that want to delete the cosmic rays from this site and am surprised that none of you see the tongue in cheek humor/putdown of the psuedo-sciences. While at the same time producing some rather interesting recycled art. Here's a list of awards, articles, links and more. I am correcting the original page to fix the links... One last question, why does my name come up empty? Do I need a page on myself (the ultimate vanity) where everyone else can come in and edit?</p>
<p>Accoladeswe have received... Web Awards, Geek Site of the Day, Morts top 99% of the web, Freedom Finger Award as well as several site of the days, now defunct. We have appeared in...

Your long additions to the always-burgeoning AfD page are.. wait, I'm being sarcastic. Sorry. *ahem* Your group is NN - very funny ideas, but unless referenced to prove relevance to <i>anyone</i> outside their circle, I say again: <b>delete</b>. Wikipedia isn't about funny ideas.

<dd><b>Reply to Alsoaswell:</b>Wikipedia is not meant to be cryptic or sarcastic, it's just an encyclopaedia, and so, in my opinion, these articles should not present this information as if this is a serious weirdo-collective. There are plenty of articles around about internet jokes etc, but they are explicit and clear in the explanation of the joke. <i>I stand by my original vote to keep</i> (and the other related articles should merge), and I strongly suggest that the author, also aswell, should change the style of writing and the content to explain what this organisation is about etc. But, so as not to mess with Wikipedia policy, this should be done after this nomination has been decided upon. With regard to the page on yourself, yes, create it, just click on your name in the upper right corner of the page (next to "My talk, Preferences..."). The structure of Wikipedia is such that these pages are created in a different directory and indexed differently to the articles etc (and attacking Wikipedia directly is not going to help you plead your case, honestly). Please read the <a href="../../../h/e/l/WP%7EHELP_d2d5.html" title="WP:HELP">help pages</a> for more info. -- <i>(the preceding two paragraphs both written by me)</i> <a href="../../../q/i/r/User%7EQirex_bef6.html" title="User:Qirex">Qirex</a> 11:00, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply to Quirex</b> I followed the directions at the helpless newbie page and dropped by The Welcoming Committee and picked a member who I think will help me bring the cosmic ray page into compliance along the lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Genius" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Genius" rel="nofollow">Sub Genius</a>. I live in New Orleans and have a lot of other things going on in my life right now so I don't have a lot of time to devote to this, but I am starting to see that I need a serious re-edit of the article. If anyone here cares to help out, please feel free to join in. I feel that I have shown enough links to show that the organization is real and respected in humor, physics, outsider artists, free speech and just plain wierdo circles. I am just asking for a little time to get my first attempt right. Thanks for any of you that have bothered to check my references.</li>

<li>I have done an edit and realize there are still too many quotes from the original manuscripts, but I feel this is a good start on satisfying some of the problems that have been pointed out. Again, I ask for a bit more time to work this out as I have other business/flood/hurricane related problems that really need addressing. <a href="../../../a/l/s/User%7EAlsoaswell_6511.html" title="User:Alsoaswell">also aswell</a> 19:15, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply to Qirex</b>: 1) You're right. 2) You correctly chastise <i>my</i> lousy attitude (I was annoyed after having been working off this AfD list for about 5 hours, and I mistakenly got the (researched) impression that this was an attempt to slide a popular joke / hoax site into the 'pedia under the guise of a straight face), but then you tell me to 'get a life'? <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 05:00, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>To Alsoaswell</b>: I apologize. My sarcasm was completely misplaced in this forum, and not very clever, either.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Along with <a href="../../../q/i/r/User%7EQirex_bef6.html" title="User:Qirex">Qirex</a>, I believe the group is sufficiently notable. The article has been improved to make it clear that the group is satirical, and now satisfies basic Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../a/l/s/User%7EAlsoaswell_6511.html" title="User:Alsoaswell">also aswell</a> did most of the work himself, after receiving some coaching tips from me on his talk page, so I am confident that he is willing to learn and conform to Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamawrites_ede8.html" title="User:Mamawrites">Mamawrites</a> 10:08, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
