<p>Im too lazy to correct it myself, but the page says "heritability measures the percentage of variation of a trait due to inheritance, within a population." This is not true. Heritability measures variance attributable to genes either within or between groups. The "criticism" here is that Jensen supposedly derives emperical conclusions about between-group heritability FROM within group h2 values.</p>

</dl>
<p>Journalists and race activists might interpret this as a claim that genes determine intelligence, but I think they are misinterpreting the scientific usage of the word <i>suggests</i>.</p>
<p>A similar misinterpretation is made in <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> of the <a href="../../../i/p/c/IPCC_676f.html" title="IPCC">IPCC</a> statement which "suggests" that CO2 and similar emissions cause excessive atmospheric warming.</p>
<p>There seems to be a climate of (for want of a better word) "pouncing". Someone makes a statement which arouses you - or can be used to arouse the public - and you simply <i>declare</i> that it means something.</p>
<p>I wonder if Wikipedia will be able to deal with this tendency to impute meaning. <a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElabro_6123.html" title="User:Elabro">Elabro</a> 14:52, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is Gould given his own section in most wikipedia articles when it comes to "intelligence" and related fields? It appears that either some think that Gould was an expert in the field or want, to at least, leave that impression. He wasn't, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Gould wrote an entire book on the history of intelligence testing. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mismeasure_of_Man_ab7a.html" title="The Mismeasure of Man">The Mismeasure of Man</a>.</p>

<dd>Writing a book does not make one an expert. In fact, a substantial number of those who are well-known and expert in psychometrics are on the record as being highly critical of Gould's methods, his selective use of data, and even accuse Gould of misrepresentations. Hardly a glowing endorsement.</dd>

<p>It appears that the unsourced claim of racism may violate the wikipedia policy that</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Negative material that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous. The three-revert rule does not apply to such removals. Concerns relative to this policy can be addressed on the living persons biographies noticeboard."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Second, there is no substantiation of that claim, sourced or unsourced. No examples given by the unknown parties making the charge of racism, sourced or unsourced, and no information given otherwise. Frankly, it appears to be ad hominem which falls squarely within wikipedia's above cited prohibition.</p>
<p>Someone continues to replace the Gil-White article on Resurrecting racism despite libelous content. Gil-white states about African Americans "The claim that they were innately stupid because they had done poorly on IQ tests was therefore obviously nonsense, but this was Arthur Jensen's claim." is perhaps the most insulting as Jensen has NEVER stated this and it is essentially libel. I have read the majority of jensen's work and to state this is patently absurd and evidence of lack of neutrality again.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The source is Francisco Gil-White, a trained anthropologist with notability of his own. While there is obviously vehement disagreement between Gil-White and Jensen (same goes with Lynn and Rushton), the opinion itself is shared (perhaps not in those exact works, but shared nevertheless) by several othe researchers. Our job is to report on such opinions, properly attributed, not to censor those opinions we find politically incorrect or extreme.--<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 13:56, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The attribution by Gil-white is libelous and untrue. If you can point me to the source where Jensen makes that statment, fine, do so. I wonder if you have an unbiased POV on this topic sionce you continue to replace an article that misstates Jensen's opinion so blatabtly. Your job is not to include any pseudoscientific article that misquotes a biography, is it?</p>

This is not about whether Gil-White is right. This is about wht has been said. Some very harsh criticism has been leveled on both sides. Besides, you affirming that "Jensen never said that" is patently <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which is forbidden on Wikipedia; I'm not saying anything about it not being true.

<dd>The exact quote Gil-White relies on is: <i>“Jensen achieved instant notoriety when he challenged the received view that intelligence is primarily a function of environment, not genes.

In his [1969] Harvard Educational Review paper, Jensen claimed that previous attempts to narrow the black/white gap on IQ tests were doomed to failure because,</i> <b>according to him, blacks are deficient in the particular genes required for complex information processing.</b>” It is a cited quote from Peter Shoneman.</dd>

<dd>1)Your first sentence is a personal attack. Please be careful not to say this again. Second, the argument you're bringing here is a non-sequitur to Jensen's reported statement that <b>"blacks are deficient in the particular genes required for complex information processing."</b> <i>Innately</i> means that they are so because of their genes (that it is in them at birth "in-nate"). It doesn't mean they're ALL shorter (or dumber) than everybody else.

<p>Ben, I think you're confusing things. We aren't required to provide a chain of evidence for every cited statement. That is to say, there is no requirement that if Jensen says something, that we must provide evidence for his statement. So if he states incorrectly that a scientific study supports his racialist theories, we cannot remove his statement on the basis that it isn't accurate, or doesn't properly cite his evidence. Similarly with Gil-White - you may disagree with his judgement of Jensen, but you cannot remove his criticism simply because you disagree with his interpretation. We've cited Gil-White's critique as relevant, but nowhere are we required to prove, in any case, that the critique is true or valid. I hope you understand the crucial difference here. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 18:09, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're not following me. The quote is incorrect and libelous.If the critique is obviously incorrect (as it is to individuals who have actually read Jesnen's work) it's not about disagreement of interpretation. It's factually incorrect. I also hope you understand the difference between saying somone said soemthing and citing an actual statemnt by that person. Gil-white does not cite Jensen's articles when speaking about what he says, because Jeensen never says these things, thus he uses secondary sources to attribute statements to Jensen that he never actually made. Do You understadn the crucial difference there?BenGibson 18:16, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, it is well sourced. Gil-White is directly sourced, and he directly sources a critique which directly sources a 1969 paper by Jensen. There isn't any circular reference at all, just a dispute over whether or not two published individuals (Gil-White and Shonemann), have accurately portrayed Jensen's statements in his 1969 paper.

That Jensen said "blacks are deficient in the particular genes" -- or a quote that supports Gil-Whites reference to the Nazism and Jensen in the same breath (although Jensen is part Jewish himself) -- than by all means, JereKrischel, provide those Jensen quotes here since, for some odd reason, that was never provided in the link.</dd>

<dd>Let me add that not only does the link in question fall under the <b>poorly sourced</b> prohibition, I suspect that either Gill-White, at best, doesn't know what he's talking about. Jensen "revived" the use of IQ tests?? Really! By the way, here's an abstract, in its entirety, from a government source, for Jensen's paper <i>How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement</i>. - You'll find, I hope, the tone is a little less 'wild eyed' than that found in the Gill-White chapter. Nowhere does it say, no where does it even imply, that Jensen said Blacks where "innately stupid," or that Jensen is a "eugenicist," or even imply that Jensen is somehow carrying the banner for the Nazis.</dd>

<dd><i>How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement</i></dd>
<dd><b>Abstract: The importance and consequences of raising the average ability level (IQ) of the population requires consideration of the ability level that society requires, how the relevant abilities are distributed, and the efficiency of the current educational process. Within the framework of these factors, the document discusses the determinants of mental ability and the measures commonly used, the sources of variance in IQ, and the ways in which intelligence might be boosted. The latter include both genetic and non-genetic influences. Such prenatal factors as nutrition, length of pregnancy, maternal stress, and intrauterine environment have and effect on infant intelligence. Postnatal environmental influences have not been found to markedly affect IQ, with the exception of extreme isolation. In relation to disadvantaged children, whose learning and ability patterns are different from those of middle-class children, it is important that these differences be recognized as a precondition to developing appropriate educational strategies.</b></dd>

<p>First of all, thank you for the reference! The comments posted at the end were especially illuminating.</p>
<p>Regarding what Shonemann said: <i>"Jensen claimed that previous attempts to narrow the black/white gap on IQ tests were doomed to failure because, according to him, blacks are deficient in the particular genes required for complex information processing.”</i></p>
<p>As evidence for this, Jensen says the following in his paper:</p>
<p><i>So all we are left with are various lines of evidence, no one of which is definitive alone, but which, viewed all together, make it a not unreasonable hypothesis that <b>genetic factors are strongly implicated in the average Negro-white intelligence difference.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Educators would probably do better to concern themselves with teaching basic skills directly than with attempting to boost overall cognitive development. By the same token, they should de-emphasize IQ tests as a means of assessing gains, and use mainly direct tests of the skills the instructional program is intended to inculcate. <b>The techniques for raising intelligence per se, in the sense of g, probably lie more in the province of the biological sciences than in psychology and education.</b></i></p>
<p>So in fact, the only thing I see as missing in the context of Shonemann is that although Jensen calls out doom for narrowing the B-W IQ/g gap, he does call for "schools and society must provide a range and diversity of educational methods, programs, and goals, and of occupational opportunities, just as wide as the range of human abilities.".</p>
<p>Insofar as eugenics, Jensen clearly calls for that:</p>
<p><i>Much more thought and research should be given to the educational and social implications of these trends for the future. Is there a danger that current welfare policies, <b>unaided by eugenic foresight</b>, could lead to the genetic enslavement of a substantial segment of our population? The possible consequences of our failure seriously to study these questions may well be viewed by future generations as our society's greatest injustice to Negro Americans.</i></p>
<p>It seems that although Shonemann's interpretation may be a slanted one, it certainly isn't unfounded. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 21:55, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's it JereKrischel?? Gil-White and Shoneman are only "slanted?" Out the entire paper that's all you could come up with after the claims made by Gil-White? Where's the quotes that "Blacks are stupid" or his advocating eugenics, nor is there any hint of carrying on a brand of Nazi ideology. Where?? Where's the impending superabundance of Jensen quotes from the JereKrischel search. That's it? Those quotes are where you rest your case? You're kidding me -- no? Those quotes will apply the final coup de grace to the <b>poorly source</b> claim? Amazing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, I do have something to add in regards to the Gil-White linked chapter related to the <i>poorly sourced</i> in addition to his misrepresentations of Jensen. It seems that there is a common theme found in certain circles in regards to this topic. It seems that when some have nothing of substance to provide, Gil-White and others decide to go heavy on the ad hominem attacks. In fact, rather than addressing the relevant data, Gil-White seems to select ad hominem attack as his vehicle of choice. Argument peppered throughout with urgent adjectives rather than reasoned, supported disagreement.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Now, since Jensen is a direct intellectual descendant of a eugenicist and fraud, Cyril Burt, it does not look good that Jensen should be the one to have broken the taboo against 'intelligence testing' in 1969, reviving eugenic arguments.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whether Cyril Burt did ANYTHING wrong is a matter of high dispute. Of course, you'd never know that reading the Gil-White, who states it as if it's undisputed fact. I wonder if Gil-White would make his brave claim if Burt were alive. I somehow doubt it. Second, that "made-up" and 'fraudulent' data of Burt's is "made-up" mainstream data, it doesn't need Burt for support, something which is never mentioned by Gil-White when he mischaracterizes Burt. In fact, it's as if Gil-White wants to create the impression that 'but for Burt' the data wouldn't be there. Another mislead. Not that it's a concern for wikipedia, like the Jensen defamations are, since Burt is dead and as I'm certain Gil-White knows, you can't be sued for defaming a dead person.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Heck, there's even ad hominem attack in the book summary</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"These 'researchers' were also the major propagandists of the eugenics movement, which movement is responsible for creating the German Nazis. This is also documented in the second half of Resurrecting Racism, as is the fact that today's IQ 'researchers' continue this fraudulent and dangerous tradition.</i>" <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.195.html" title="User:152.163.100.195">152.163.100.195</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/2/User_talk%7E152.163.100.195.html" title="User talk:152.163.100.195">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.163.100.195_5c9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.163.100.195">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Again, simply because you don't agree with what someone has to say, does not make it poorly sourced, or untrue. Although I agree that ad hominem attacks don't make for a good argument (as with your biting sarcasm against me), the same argument can be made against the gross oversimplifications and generalizations proposed by racialist hereditarians. Here at Wikipedia, we're not in the business of deciding who is right and wrong, however.</dd>

So....the fact that the article states that Jensen said blacks were inherently stupid was an outright lie is meaningless to wikipedia? BenGibson 20:40, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That isn't an outright lie, even though it is an unfavorable presentation of what Jensen said. Reading the paper, you clearly understand that he believes that there is a genetic reason for the poor performance of blacks as a group, and he advocates for abandoning trying to diminish the IQ gap. Yes, he does advocate for improving performance in other areas, but that doesn't mitigate in any way his statements that he believes the evidence points to blacks as a group being inferior because of their genetic makeup.</dd>

<p>Why did you remove this image? It's sourced and it shows how he has "faced criticism" for his... work. I think it is a great addition to this article and it is recent enough to help readers understand this man.<a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuturebird_4da8.html" title="User:Futurebird">futurebird</a> 23:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, didn't mean to remove the whole image, just the overlong blockquote in the reference. I've restored the image with all the appropriate captions. People can still read the article if they follow the link. The blockquote was a bit much, both as a caption, and as forcing POV. Hope it makes more sense now.--<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 23:26, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>On Friday, September 17, 1999, a small group of disheveled and unruly children was allowed to shut down a conference sponsored by the Galton Institute on the topic of “Man and Society in the New Millennium.” From the ignoble events that transpired on that sunny day, it appears that the current people of once-great Britain do not know better than to reward uncivil behavior. Like parents who give in to temper tantrums from a child, they are training their youngsters toward escalating nastiness. <b>The venerable British group that sponsored the conference was organized in 1907 as the Eugenics Education Society and later shortened its name to the Eugenics Society. Finally in 1988, in response to unrelenting demonization of eugenics, the society adopted the more innocuous name of the Galton Society in honor of Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911), the founder of eugenics.</b></p>
