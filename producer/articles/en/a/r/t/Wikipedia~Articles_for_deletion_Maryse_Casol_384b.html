<li>Jamie and Fan-1967,
<p>I understand your concern but this artist is fairly new in the art world and only one book ( Maitres &amp; Epigones) has information on her so far. As I mentionned on your talk page, I am putting the results of my Phd thesis research as I find them, so unfortunately yes, not everything is there yet.</p>
<p>I will be writting this thesis for the next year, so you should have more sources as I find the answers. What would you need in order to remove this tag?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> --Good day dear friends.
<p>My name is <b>Sam Aberg</b>, art historian and international art critic, servant of arts for the last 30 years. I am also author of Maîtres &amp; Epigones, a book that describes today's famous canadian painters. Book that has been distributed at 5000 copies across Canada, Europe and the USA. It is sad to see that some wikipedians may have opinions about artists with just a single Google search, while it takes professionnals months before having a final verdict.</p>
<p>I do agree that Wikipedia must have rules to make sure its content meets notability and verific criterias, it is the base of any public encyclopedia. However, I believe it is a bit early to take decision before consulting experts in the art field.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time</p>

<li>We don't need to consult experts in the field. We just need <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">pointers</a> to where these experts have published books, articles, and studies of this person, as required by our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. What the experts in the field are for is writing those books, articles, and studies in the first place — i.e. for producing <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary sources</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe we can delay the vote for, say 1 week, to let these people the time to find some more sources on Maryse Carol?

<li><b>Comment</b>: The question is whether this artist is already well known in her field, in which case more than one book, and citations to major art journals, lists of major museums where she has been exhibited, etc. can be provided. If these sources can't provided, there's nothing to verify the claim that she is notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>(edit conflict) If claim to notability can be established in the future the article can be recreated at that time. Please note: this is not a judgement in any way on the artist's quality. This is someone who has generated practically no press notice at all anywhere. Being noticed by one art critic and one author may be a judgement on her quality, but it does not make her notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 23:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Though I take exception to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Italy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84966379" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Italy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84966379" rel="nofollow">this piece of editing</a>, I admire the energy put into the promotion of Ms Casol and her work. Dates provided in the article lead me to assume that Ms Casol has only been exhibiting her work publicly for two years. I suggest that it may be premature to include an article at this point in her career. I will add that I find it odd that, inclusion in M. Aberg's book aside, there appears to be no other information on the painter available in print form. I refer here not only to art magazines, but to the four Montreal daily newspapers. One final observation: the article lifts copywritten material from the artist's website <a href="http://www.marysecasol.com/biography.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.marysecasol.com/biography.aspx" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. As such it runs contrary to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/s/WP%7ENPS_2b55.html" title="WP:NPS">WP:NPS</a> guideline and is a violation of <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a>. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 04:41, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>I have read the totality of this discussion, and must thank you all for taking the time to write very good arguments. You see, I believe everyone has a purpose in this world. I was lucky to get the gift to make people happy threw my art. Now, if your purpose is to destroy the work of a few trying to build something positive, I respect that. You know, beeing on Wikipedia or not, won't change anything to me; I will still continue painting, and I will still bring hope to people.</p>
<p>Therefore, you can delete this article if you want.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best in your careers, goals or projects. Just remember that you too one day will need the help from others. That day, God will remember.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> To all the supporters and especially Maryse, do not take this issue personally. Because WP is open to all to edit, it has a constant credibility problem and so there are rules to try to keep at least a reasonable standard. Think about it if everyone decided to add bios on wp, it would not be a serious place. Maryse is a new artist, perhaps the article is a little premature given the WP standards. Copy the code aside so that it is not wasted editing, and perhaps in the near future, the existence of the article (if it gets deleted) will be non-disputable. --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 20:25, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please Delete ASAP</b> To gain notability as a visual artist, there should be critical discourse in recognized journal and periodicals, an extensive exhibition history, or evidence of a signifigant contribution to the discipline. There is no evidence of any of the above. Wikipedia shouldn't be a free-for-all where anybody with the time can create an entry. I would ask you if you think your artistic contributions should entitle you to be in Brittanica. If not there, why here. And to whomever put Maryse in the main wiki article for Painting, under the history of contemporary painting, should be ashamed.
