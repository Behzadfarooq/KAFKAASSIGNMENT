<p>possible vanity, I did get two google hits in the first few pages that were relevant...but they were on the 2nd page or lower. The link to the award doesn't show any award that I can see, and I'm not sure that an award from that site is sufficient criteria for notability. I figured I'd try to get more eyes on this, I could be wrong.-- <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 11:06, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I poked around a bit looking for the award and was rewarded with a massive number of popups, so if it's there it's hiding.

<li>Explain how this isnt a valid article</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There's nothing "invalid" about it. It's just that articles on online things need to be on subjects which live up to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. In the case of this article, has the animation <i>been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself</i>? Not that anyone can see. Has it <i>won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation</i>? Again, not that anyone can see (one comment above deals with the nature of the award the animation is credited with, and it's neither well-known nor independent). Is it <i>distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators</i>? Well, the site seems to be independent of the creators, but it's not well-known. Therefore, it isn't sufficiently notable to qualify for inclusion. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 06:46, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The awards side of things doesn't impress me in the slightest, as neither of them are "well known and independent". They're probably independent, but they're far from well-known. Fourth place by some standards applied to animations uploaded or reviewed (hard to tell from the link) that day isn't a well-known or independent award. Neither is being the "link of the day" at another site. As regards the well-known and indepedent site, I'll leave that to someone more versed in internet lore. The comparison to <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Numa_aede.html" title="Numa Numa">Numa Numa</a> is not as impressive as you may think, either, as it would easily qualify via other sections of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - the fact that it exists at Newgrounds isn't going to count against it. It also doesn't work in "all senses" with the standards we're citing, as it hasn't been the subject of publications independent of the site itself. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:37, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Explain?
<ul>
<li>Explain what, exactly? The remarks about the awards? Firstly, I'd contend that an animation which wins "Fourth Place for today" has hardly won a significant award. The same goes for something which wins "Link of the Day". Think about it - is a local "Battle of the Bands" trophy the same value as a Grammy? I should hope not. The remarks about the publications? One of the standards of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is that the animation would need to be <i>the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself</i>. I see no proof that it has been that, so it fails that part of the test and therefore your claim that "in all senses, it works with the standard" is false. The comments about <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Numa_aede.html" title="Numa Numa">Numa Numa</a>? Without getting into too much detail right now since we're talking about this animation rather than anything else, Numa Numa is <i>substantially</i> more well known than this animation is. At no point is this AfD saying that "all internet phenomena must be deleted from Wikipedia" or anything like that. What it's saying is that there are standards, "Illusions of Immortality" doesn't live up to those standards, so it should be deleted. It's nothing personal. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:57, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is a sad day indeed for wikipedia. This cartoon is a sensation and will only keep growing. Even if you delete it now, for ucalled for reasons, you will find yourself in pain as you do not have this article anymore.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If it'll keep growing in popularity, then you'll be more than welcome to recreate the page later on when it has. Just copy the text into a file on your computer and as soon as it meets those standards we've been talking about, bring it back online. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 00:43, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
