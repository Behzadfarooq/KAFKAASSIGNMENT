<p>Nominating <b>all Lists of companies type articles</b> (collected in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_companies.html" title="Lists of companies">Lists of companies</a>) <b>with named exceptions</b> and others that may be proposed. Virtually all these violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> on potentially a number of grounds, eg: <i>not ... a repository of links</i> point 2: "Mere collections of internal links, except for disambiguation pages when an article title is ambiguous, and for structured lists to assist with the organisation of articles." That they do so can be seen by the fact that almost all can be, and indeed many have been, supplemented or replaced by categories. Some, however, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_commercial_pairs.html" title="List of commercial pairs">List of commercial pairs</a>, seem just pointless. By the way, I know this may annoy people who've worked on those lists, and may have been discussed before and I missed it, in which case, sorry in advance.</p>

<dd>" All the lists can be improved with further information in the long run." - how? any detailed information on companies should go into company articles
<dl>
<dd>The same as any other model list. They could contain a few basic details like sector and turnover so people can decide if they want to look at the article. I'm confident that these sorts of quality enhancements will become more common as wikipedia matures. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 01:43, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which will be even harder to maintain, especially as the lists continue to expand to cover the ever-increasing number of company articles. This goes in the direction of a database on companies, which a simple central, manually-maintained list is extraordinarily bad for. <b>If we created lists by bot from company articles my objections to lists would disappear.</b> They could exract data from templates to make lists with more data than just company names. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 07:36, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>"country lists provide an overall alphabetical list, which the categories do not as they have been partially subdivided by sector." - if we want an overall list (I'm not sure why we do - seems vaguely WP:NOTish) we can do that by listing companies in the top country category as well as subcategories, which would be much more maintainable.
<dl>
<dd>That would be against the general policy on catgorisation, and there would be no way to ensure that it was done consistently and it would make a mess of things by pushing some of the subcategories off of the first page where there were more than 200 articles. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 01:43, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>True. So perhaps have a Lists subcategory specifically to create alphabetised lists without conflicting with standard categorisation. Consistency of application is surely as bad or worse with categories as with lists. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 07:36, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"In any case the nomination should be void as the nominator doesn't seem to have tagged the articles." - are you really suggesting that in order to debate the principle we need to tag every instance (of which there are dozens)? <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 22:24, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Categories aid in finding similar objects, if that's what people want. They're unobtrusive at the bottom of pages, and are more wiki because more decentralised. People working on company articles are for more likely to add it to appropriate categories than to update a list - not least because it doesn't require editing a separate page. Categories of this type are simply a more maintainable version of lists. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 18:28, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Categories are not wiki. They are easy to add to, but they are extremely difficult to reorganize, often requiring bots. They are an <i>inferior</i> version of lists, because they cannot include alternate names for the same thing, and cannot describe or disambiguate what the link target is. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 03:39, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have made a good deal of effort to explain that elsewhere, but you have brushed it all aside. I think the fact that being a proponent of categories in no way biases me against lists is relevant. I understand that the way wikipedia uses multiple organisation systems, some of which are preferred by some people, some by others, is one of its great strengths.

<ul>
<li>Clearly enough people think this for it to be taken seriously - individual probably couldn't be deleted without individual AfDs. But if I'd picked an individual list as a test case (a) it would be an arbitrary choice (b)less people might have participated (c) it would risk confusing specifics with the general principle (d) if the decision to convert to categories were made, it might have been less effective as policy. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 07:36, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I would expect it to be a strong precedent, no more, no less. If the result were Delete, I would suggest making a template to attach to each list explaining the conversion is happening and what it involves and that when done the article will be deleted. (Conversion being the gradual removal of links from the list as it is confirmed that the article is in the appropriate category.) If anybody felt that a particular list should be an exception (beyond those already identified and possibly additional ones still to be agreed), they could create an individual AfD to try and confirm consensus to that effect. (A note on that should be in the template.) Conversion would take some time so there would be plenty of opportunity for challenging individual cases. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 13:48, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

I feel its just too soon to write off this whole area as being bad. my sentiments would be keep it, give it more time. Areas that are growing and contributing something useful- can stay. Things that are going nowhere can be pruned/removed. As more persons come on board to Wikipedia, in time they'll contribute more knowledge on these companies. I have no problem with the proposal of certain bad articles up for delete or stub criteria, esp. if a company article looks totally like nothing more then an advertisement, but I think more companies will be added in the future.

<dd>As more companies are added, companies merge, etc, these lists have to be updated. Typically (or should I say occasionally), this is done by the person who adds or changes an entry (pick a continental European country and look at the editing history of the list..). The information tends to come from the entries/categories, and is then added to the list (not the other way round). In other words, the lists are a (weak) mirror of the categories. The clean up you suggest will be futile - once all the information is added, it is out of date. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocendoDiscimus_4b33.html" title="User:DocendoDiscimus">DocendoDiscimus</a> 15:03, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Jacqui may have misunderstood what I said. When I said "they can but most of these don't" I was responding to the statement that "lists can sort articles in other ways than just alphabetically". I see no good way to improve these lists with additional sorting that can't be done by (sub)categories. Any such improvement wouldn't be "cleanup" either, it would be structural development.

<dd>That statemment borders on the absurd. Subcategories can only contain names in alphabetical lists with no additional information about the entries. Lists can be sorted in dozens of ways (turnover; location, sector, assets, structure, ownership, profitablity etc etc) and can contain several pieces of information about each item. There are some excellent lists on some other topics. It is a pity that Wikipedia's coverage of companies is one of its weakest areas, but there is plenty of time to improve it. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 19:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think you'll find your statement across the border from absurd. You can't possibly have seriously thought through the maintainability implications of doing this widely, much beyond just <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_companies_by_revenue.html" title="List of companies by revenue">List of companies by revenue</a> (which is just revenue, and just top global companies). Imagine List of British companies by turnover, List of British companies by location, List of British companies by sector, List of British companies by assets, List of British comapnies by profitability, List of British companies by employment, List of British companies by location and turnover.... That's a fricken' companies database (which I happen to have some familiarity with). Maintainability of the companies lists is bad enough with just names; how would it be with all that extra information to find and update on an annual or quarterly basis? And why should we keep lists that <i>now</i> do nothing that categories (supplemented with specialised redlink lists) can't because <i>one day</i> they might (pigs might fly) turn into the absurdity of a companies database maintained in wikitext form? If Wikipedia is ever to do something along those lines, it will have to involve templates and probably a software change. Wikipedia should only store detailed up-to-date company data in one place - the company article.

<li>There is no need for any further debate. All you will do is waste a lot of other users' time which could be put to better use. Things like the Afghan list are valuable as a starting point for coverage of countries where Wikipedia is weak.

<ul>
<li>I think that's unwarranted because (a) school deletion is about notability, which is irrelevant here; (b) I was open to persuasion but nothing that anybody has said has convinced me to prefer lists instead of categories for these cases; (c) because lists are harder to maintain they long-term waste far more time than any AfD (d) a 2/3 - 1/3 vote is not a "lost cause" when the keep voting is based, as far as I can see, on no good arguments. For example, "Things like the Afghan list are valuable as a starting point" says absolutely nothing about why lists that can be converted to categories are better than categories, or why lists that duplicate categories should exist. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 19:06, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Because red links can be added to it of course, which is a lot easier than writing stubs, but does encourage others to do more. This is a basic point which has been made on articles for deletion scores of times. You need 70% support for deletion, you are now at 30%, and the early flurry of support was rather freakish as the principle that categories do not replace lists has been confirmed over and over again. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 19:16, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>We already have lists of missing company articles in the form of red links on the existing lists, which are more spedific and can therefore be more precisely categorised so they will be seen by more people with relevant knowledge.

<li>I agree that a single central list doesn't make sense. But do you believe the red links that are currently in the lists are in any way a sign of missing articles? Most red links are put in as linkspam. One of the few ways of having some objectiveness in what constitutes a <i>major company</i> is the inclusion in a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_market_index.html" title="Stock market index">stock market index</a>.

<li>There are many valid red links. If some of the lists need be to cleaned up the appropriate response is to clean them up rather than to delete them. Any company which would surive afd is also a legitimate link, and any links for companies which would not that may exist are hardly taking up a lot of space or causing a major distraction. Not all major companies are listed by any means. There are many multi-billion dollar private and state owned companies, as well as many subsidiaries which merit articles, and indeed plenty of subsidiaries which have them (<a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_86af.html" title="ASDA">ASDA</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_Scotland_e5c3.html" title="Bank of Scotland">Bank of Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_%28bank%29.html" title="Abbey (bank)">Abbey</a> are three very large British examples). <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 19:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree that in theory it sounds like a great plan - someone sees the list, adds companies (or subsidiaries) that are missing, and then later someone else sees there's a company without an entry, so (s)he starts writing it. Unfortunately, that's not how it has been done until now. Please check the histories of the lists, and you'll see that typically few people bother to add anything, unless it's because they've changed another entry. Having lists just because you hope that at one point in future they will actually have any purpose doesn't make sense IMHO. Instead of trying to get the lists to mirror the categories, people should focus their energies on adding company templates etc. - <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocendoDiscimus_4b33.html" title="User:DocendoDiscimus">DocendoDiscimus</a> 20:22, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (just for now), as said before the general consensus seems to be to keep the lists. If they are a structured list, they can still be of help to some of us in developing categories. In keeping them we still have something to gain from them and nothing to lose. In deleting them, we have something to lose but nothing to gain. I say only delete them, if the majority of us no longer find them of any use.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - it appears that enough people wish to keep lists. But surely a proposal to delete the categories would fair even worse. Yet the present situation leads to the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Austrian_companies_e910.html" title="List of Austrian companies">List of Austrian companies</a> lacks 14 existing articles that are in the cat, - eg <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_Skis_53a6.html" title="Atomic Skis">Atomic Skis</a>; and has two errors (<a href="../../../a/m/a/AMAG_6086.html" title="AMAG">AMAG</a> not disambiged; <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steyr.html" title="Steyr">Steyr</a> links to town not company) whilst <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_of_Austria_20ef.html" title="Category:Companies of Austria">Category:Companies of Austria</a> lacks 8 existing articles that are in the list, as well as the famous redlinked companies. Neither list nor cat links to the other. Even <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_companies.html" title="Lists of companies">Lists of companies</a> doesn't mention the existence of the categories.

<li>Where was the proposal to delete categories?

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Suggestion</b> - Wouldn't it be good practice to always have the lists linked to the categories and visa versa? I've seen this discipline in other topics and they seem to be a good double check for each other.

<li>If I weren't so tired of this subject I'd ask you to state those reasons in your own words, because I still I don't see any good reason to duplicate categories with lists or vice versa. Never mind though.

<li><b>Comment</b> While lists are certainly useful, even if there are categories, I find the list of companies too large, spam-targets and almost always incomplete (Note: This is from my own experience as I watch the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indian_companies_867d.html" title="List of Indian companies">List of Indian companies</a>, which is fairly small.). It would be better to break down the list into smaller and more managable lists. But I am not in favour of and overnight deletion or a blanket policy. If it suits you, use it or if it doesn't, replace it with a better solution. --<a href="../../../p/a/m/User%7EPamri_2da3.html" title="User:Pamri">Pamri</a> <sup>• <a href="../../../p/a/m/User_talk%7EPamri_1a9f.html" title="User talk:Pamri">Talk</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/m/User_talk%7EPamri_1a9f.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/m/User_talk%7EPamri_1a9f.html" rel="nofollow">Reply</a></sup> 17:51, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep All</b> I found the 'article' very useful, although I would also support its replacement with a category containing all the same information. Dont just delete it unless you're prepared to replace it. 88.105.251.6</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The lists by industry/sector may be the most productive ones. For those who don't want to use them, they may just igore them. IMHO, there is no point in having "List of missing company articles" in article namespace. It should be moved to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_missing_company_articles_c931.html" title="Wikipedia:List of missing company articles">Wikipedia:List of missing company articles</a> or deleted. -- User:Docu

<li>re namespace - I know, I was tired and in a hurry.
