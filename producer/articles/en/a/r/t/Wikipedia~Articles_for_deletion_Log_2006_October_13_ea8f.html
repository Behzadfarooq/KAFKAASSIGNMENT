<li>I'm a little confused about the policy here -- and where exactly I'm supposed to "defend" keeping this page, but I created this stub and I will copy here what I wrote on its talk page about Jeffrey Irvine's notability. "Jeffrey Irvine is one of the leading viola teachers in the US today, and the list of where he teaches/has taught ought to lend enough clout to his name to assert his significance or influence, without other superlatives or generalizations. His students hold positions in major orchestras and they are teachers in university music departments all over the world. As a student of Karen Tuttle he is also part of her legacy as an annual organizer &amp; teacher of the Karent Tuttle Coordination Workshop." <a href="../../../j/_/l/User%7EJ_Lorraine_a27b.html" title="User:J Lorraine">J Lorraine</a> 09:56, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Where his students play isn't really relevant to whether Wikipedia should have a biographical article on <i>him</i>.

<li>I disagree with Uncle G; if a person's field of work IS teaching, then whether or not they are notable teachers depends not only on what they teach, but where and who they teach. If a music teacher's students are themselves teaching &amp; performing in major musical venues all over the world, then that person's influence is felt all over the world. Thus, such a person is notable because of their students' activities. <a href="../../../j/_/l/User%7EJ_Lorraine_a27b.html" title="User:J Lorraine">J Lorraine</a> 03:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> lists a number of ways a person can be considered notable enough for a Wikipedia article, but it also seems to say that passing or failing such tests is not a sole reason to either include or delete an article, and that the whole idea of notability is not a wikipedia policy. It does point to verifiability, not original research, neutral point of view, etc. I contend first that this article is verifiable, it is not original research, and it has a neutral point of view.

<ol>
<li>made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field. (Organizing, publicizing, &amp; teaching at <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Tuttle_b1f5.html" title="Karen Tuttle">Karen Tuttle</a> Coordination workshops, and, through her work, contributing to the spread of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Primrose_a79e.html" title="William Primrose">William Primrose</a>'s techniques in the following generations of <a href="../../../v/i/o/Viola.html" title="Viola">violists</a>.)</li>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,[1] reported in notable and verifiable sources.[2] (as a performer with the New World String Quartet in the US and in Europe.)</li>
<li>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (The Journal of the American Viola Society, the Journal of Performing Arts Medicine, several news articles (I'll try to find exact dates))</li>
<li>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style (This is not exactly spot-on, since I'm claiming that the "style" he represents is a technique or school of viola teaching, not a musical style of performing; and he is one of the most prominent, not the most prominent).</li>
<li>Has won or placed in a major music competition. (<a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Music_Festival_a8cc.html" title="Aspen Music Festival">Aspen Music Festival</a> Viola competition, Cleveland Quartet competition)</li>
<li>Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in ... teaching in a particular music genre. (notable teaching organizations such as <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Institute_of_Music_5ae4.html" title="Cleveland Institute of Music">Cleveland Institute of Music</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meadowmount.html" title="Meadowmount">Meadowmount</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_String_Teachers_Association_3216.html" title="American String Teachers Association">American String Teachers Association</a>; also referenced as a notable teacher of Karent Tuttle's Coordination technique in places like the Journal of the American Viola Society)</li>
<li>Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture. (well, if you call classical violists a 'sub-culture').</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I'd like to reiterate my request for more time to find exact references, since most of them are in journals or newspapers, and the dates and article authors of which aren't readily stored in my brain. <a href="../../../j/_/l/User%7EJ_Lorraine_a27b.html" title="User:J Lorraine">J Lorraine</a> 08:31, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition to what I listed above, he also passes several of the "alternative" tests for notability on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The professor test -- If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor (based on the U.S. practice of calling all full-time academics professors), they can and should be included. (He has published more articles on teaching in American String Teacher and in the Journal of the American Viola Society than most average college Viola professors).</li>
<li>Verifiability -- Can all information in the article be independently verified now? (some say) 10 years from now? (yes, it can)</li>
<li>Expandability -- Will the article ever be more than a stub? Could the perfect article be written on this subject? (yes, there is sufficient information to provide a full-length article)</li>
<li>100 year test (future speculation) -- In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful? (yes, although this will probably be limited to those in the field of classical music, in particular those interested in 20th &amp; 21st century <a href="../../../p/e/r/Performance_practice.html" title="Performance practice">performance practice</a>)</li>
<li>100 year test (past speculation) -- If we had comparable verifiable information on a person from 100 years ago, would anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful today? (yes, again, though, probably only in the specialized field of historically informed performance, which is a sub-field (albeit a large sub-field) of current performance practice in the classical music world).</li>
<li>Google Test -- Does the subject get lots of distinguishable hits on Google or another well known search mechanism? (yes, although the word "lots" is somewhat ambiguous)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Grutness, if you think this subject is encyclobedic, then why don't you work on the article to improve it instead of AfDing it?

<li>I don't know about everything. I think this is likely to be an encyclopedic subject, but it's not one that I know enough about to write much more than is already there. It needs work from experts in the field to make it worthwhile - and I am not one of those experts. Also, as I pointed out, this is already covered in a number of other articles around wikipedia; those articles may be sufficient. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 04:09, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b>. I agree that the article is in a bad state, but that can be fixed. Let's not delete an article about a good topic just because it's poorly written. <a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 01:57, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> I agree entirely with Sandstein and largely with Eusebeus, and I'd observe that, in any case, whilst there is most probably an encyclopedic article that could exist under this title, there is nothing in the instant article the salvaging of which would be aid one in crafting a new article. In situations such as this, I don't think <i>keep and cleanup</i> to be particularly useful, principally because the article is essentially devoid of content, such that there's nothing to cleanup; expansion, of course, along encyclopedic lines, in quite fine, but during the pendency of such process an unencyclopedic article need not to exist. Perhaps a listing at <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a> is in order, although I suppose stubbification per Themindset isn't particularly harmful (at least should we conclude that an article [cf., a category] apropos of the topic can reasonably and properly be crafted). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> I'm not clear on what this is attempting to cover. Gender discussions will be different depending on the religion, and perhaps even the context in which that religion is being practiced. Other issues raised already have articles on Wikipedia (many of which can be seen on this page). There may be a good article to be had at this title, but the one developing here just isn't it.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I don't think the article should be a complete list of other articles (or list-farm), but it's worthy enough a topic to expand.

<dd>Probably because it's not completely and utterly unverifiable, there are actual sources on it, even if those sources are perhaps not as robust as might be hoped for. For example, there are lots of baby names books that use it. And a few other links. Me, i'm inclined to say that this should be verifiable, but it'd probably require someone from India to do it, since they'd have access to the material. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is unverif<b>ied</b>. That's all that really matters, not unverif<b>iable</b>. It's not like it would be any big loss, a dubious at best sentence or two. If there is anything worthwhile, it may crop up again in the futre, but by someone who knows how to verify whatever information there is. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 01:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it is unverified, all that means is somebody hasn't verified it yet. It is still verifiable, and I don't know about you, but when I do a search for "Kalindi River", I get some hits. Mostly stuff from babyname sites, but there are a few news sources that use the phrase, including what seems to be a report on a wetlands page and something to do with a border incident with Bangladesh. So it's not coming up a total blank. Now personally, I'd prefer something from an official Indian gov't agency on this, but I expect you'd have to be from India to do it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:26, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a substantial tunnel on the line of the Cromford Canal. This canal is currently undergoing restoration so it follows that the tunnel, despite the fact that it closed in 1900 will be restored too. Other significant canal tunnels in Britain have their own pages. It therefore follows that if this tunnel should be referred to purely within the Cromford Canal page then other tunnels should share the same fate. There is a great deal to be said about this tunnel not available elsewhere on the net. During its lifetime some of Ripleys coal mines delivered coal directly to underground wharves within the tunnel. Refer to the restoration groups website linked from the Cromford Canal page and you will see that much is known about this tunnel.

<li><s><b>Let it Grow</b></s> Danielrocks123 is partly correct. The Cromford Canal page refers directly to the Butterley Tunnel. The Benjamin Outram page refers directly to the Butterley Tunnel. The Ripley, Derbyshire page refers to the canal tunnel, meaning the Butterley Tunnel.The canals of the United Kingdom page refers to the Butterley Tunnel. The Butterley Company page does not, however refer to the tunnel at all, my apologies. But my original comment stands. There are at least four pages which refer to this tunnel. The Canals of the United Kingdom page has a section which directs users specifically to tunnel articles. This page will always be incomplete if some tunnels are allowed pages and others are not.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_Cordon_eeb0.html" title="User:Martin Cordon">Martin Cordon</a> 02:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete:</b> Those suggesting this outfit is trivial clearly don't live in East Texas. This is a sizeable (if a bit odd) organization that is one of the major religious and social institutions in East Texas. I don't know the numbers, but they fill busload after busload of congregants every Sunday from as far away as Dallas (130 miles). No, it isn't world-famous; but anyone who lives in Longview or any of the surrounding towns is well aware of it, has likely had dealings with it in some way, and understands that it is quite influential in the region. Its accreditation or lack thereof really doesn't have much to do with it's overall influence. This is a substantial, locally influential, controversial institution - if that doesn't make it worthy of an entry, then I just don't understand the criteria very well I guess.Ritwingr 05:13, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> At first, I had trouble understanding the problem, too, but let me see if I can explain it. All of this controversy is potentially VERY notable ... but we don't have sufficiently solid sources to demonstrate that controversy yet. (The Spurgeon book doesn't yet count because none of us seem to be able to address whether it talks about TBC or only about the church.) If you look at the Hyles-Anderson College article mentioned above, you see that newspapers have written about problems there (just one example). If you live in East Texas, you may be able to find verifiable sources that those of us using online searches can't find; for example, have the Longview News-Journal or the Tyler Morning Telegraph published stories? I also wonder whether any specifically Baptist papers or papers of other Baptist colleges have written about it; I know that when the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Churches_of_Christ_4f57.html" title="International Churches of Christ">International Churches of Christ</a> were getting started, a paper called <i>The Christian Chronicle</i> was writing about the movement long before major newspapers and TV stations or networks started covering the topic. Consider whether you or someone you know has access to such sources, and if so, post here any information you find. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 09:15, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are many articles on people who are not as known as James Warner. James Warner's status as not being very popular is not a legitimate reason for deletion of this article. If that was a legitimate reason, that than deleting every reference of him on every article in Wikipedia would be reasonable along with deleting every reference of every person not as popular as he is. The information regarding why he was not invited to participate should be added to the article if you believe the article is biased in that respect. Also, I do not know what is meant by,"Most are of the also running is variety." Use correct grammar if you wish for me to understand what was attempted to be conveyed.

<p>Some of my elaborating can be found by simply looking for what I typed on this page. Also, to further elaborate, the article(James Werner) should be kept and revised. Revising, if done correctly, is obviously something that can be done that will make the article easier to understand and verifiable. In addition to that, Jesse Ventura polled about 10% before the debates and he went on to win the election, despite the fact that no major polls indicated that he was leading. While, it is true that James Werner is/was not as popular as Jesse Ventura and he is not polling 10% in any major polls, he is still polling in single digits, not a fraction of a percent, and although he did not participate in the debates, he is a candidate that should have an article. Michael Badnarik can be considered a person and a candidate(former and present) that shouldn't have an article, but does. How is he extremely more significant that James Werner? Is it because Michael ran for president and James is only a candidate for a less significant office? Think about it, what harm is done by keeping the article on James Werner, considering the article will be revised in the ways necessary? Liberty6 04:56, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Harm is not a criterion for keeping the article in question. Notability IS. You merely claim that he is notable. PROVIDE SOME SOURCES. Dozens of people run for dozens of local elections. What makes him more notable than the average political candidate. Be careful with the "If Y than X" arguement. Every article needs to be judged of its own merits. Still, if we must use Badnarik for analogy purposese, here goes. Badnarik received CONSIDERABLE national press coverage during his run for president. Though Nader ultimately received more vote, the Libertarian Party is the third largest party in the U.S. via total registered memebers, and the Presidential Election is considerably more notable than a congressional race. Its the nature of the race he was involved in. Badnarik's political positions were put under the scrutiny of the national press. He merits significant NON TRIVIAL mention in several fact-checked sources. We have no evidence that Werner has been covered by any source more notable than a voter guide. THAT is the standard that we are going by when we make the case for delete. If you want to change our minds, provide evidence to the contrary by putting forward NON TRIVIAL, FACT CHECKED references to this candidate. If you can provide them, you will swing the discussion to your favor. In the absence of such sources, however, your pleas, however heartfelt, will not sway the consensus. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 05:07, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>1) <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Ventura_0ea7.html" title="Jesse Ventura">Jesse Ventura</a> is notable independant of his political career. His notability comes from his career as an actor and wrestler, which would have made him worthy of a Wikipedia article had he never even run for Governor. ALso 2) Had Jesse Ventura <i>not</i> been notable before he ran for governor, he would <i>not</i> have been notable polling only 10% of the electorate. He would have become notable the day he won the election. If THAT had been the case, he could only get an article after he had won. This guy is in the same situation. If he wins, we'll write an article about him. He hasn't won yet.

<dd>It's BEEN thought about and thought about plenty, long before you showed up. The harm, as I stated in my nomination, is in allowing Wikipedia to be mistaken for a free promotional vehicle. It's not; nor is a free webhosting service, a blog, a mode for free expression, a repository of unreferenced and speculative factoids, a way to attract attention to someone's cause, an unmediated and one-sided depository of candidate press releases and soundbites, a disguised campaign position paper, a dessert topping or a floor wax. Wikipedia aspires to be a vital and valuable online ENCYCLOPEDIA; devaluing it just so someone can get a few more votes for his pet candidate or pet cause DOES do it harm. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:24, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep.</b> I realize that we can't list every candidate for every office up for grabs in the United States (or anywhere in the world), but I think WP:BIO as it relates to politicians needs to be revised. I think we need to include information about candidates as well as victors in important races. A consensus should be reached as to what those races are, but I would definitely assume that governor, secretary of state, AG, etc. would be among them. I am in COMPLETE agreement that articles need to be NPOV - we don't want them to be big, free promotional vehicles (and it sounds like this has been an issue here), but then that's a different issue, and we need to address that accordingly. I can't think of one thing more confusing and in need of clarification than politics to most people - having a deletionist policy and only listing winners/officeholders seems to be well beside the point of what Wikipedia is for. My humble opinion. (Full disclosure: I was the author of an article of a candidate for secretary of state in my state that was deleted, despite media attention and notability.) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickBurns_f65d.html" title="User:NickBurns">NickBurns</a> 19:39, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect both</b>, merging the keyblade article into the main <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_afaf.html" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> article and just letting the princesses article go. Even uncited, some information on the keyblade would be good for the KH article for future work, but the princess article is unneeded. Six of the seven are main characters from classic Disney animated films, which can (and at least some already are) linkable from the KH article. The info. on the one original character is unusable spoiler and possibly uncitable (though definitely in need of a complete rewrite). <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 00:11, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>In fact, leaving 'the nature of keyblades' and intro out, the remaining three headings could be slapped straight into the KH article during the AFD if nobody objects? Let's see how it goes, but if more contributors think this should be merged/redirected/deleted then it'd be the work of a minute. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 00:18, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Works for me. The story section of KH (possibly most of the article by the looks of it) needs rewriting anyhow, so it's not like the article will be compromised by inserting that text, but it will at least serve as a reminder to expand on the keyblade point when the article is overhauled. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 00:48, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I dont feel that this reason for deletion is appropriate, wikipedia is meant to be based for things also in the past, just because the website isnt as popular now as in its heyday, doesnt mean that during the times your question, that it wasnt a huge aspect of why UltraHLE was popular and infact released and a solid piece of emulation history which provided emulator homepages for its authors to use, without any financial gain.</li>

<p>I am the webmaster of emuunlim.com and any questions on why you dont think that this (alongside other websites included such as Zophars Domain) shouldnt reside on wikipedia please ask, whether you feel that the website didnt have any significance on the emulation/internet regarding media attention and regarding UltraHLE, is souly down to your judgement at this moment of time, im sure that Realityman (Gordon, UltraHLE) will vouch that we played a major part of changing history &amp; bringing it into the forefront (myself being the first person to test it also) of the emulation fans and the media, if you need any more validation, contact Nintendo&#160;:)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well if you put quotes around "emulators unlimited" it's below a thousand. Note that the search without the quotes is meaningless since it will hit any page with the words "unlimited" and "emulators" in it. The search with the quote tells you that about 1 out of every 1500 of this million and a half hits is relevant to the website. As for the search for emuunlim, yes it does get a lot. Yet half of those are the pages from the site itself! <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=emuunlim&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=emuunlim.com&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=emuunlim&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=emuunlim.com&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> A quick look at the remainder of the hits shows that the site does not come close to meeting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:15, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The notability of UltraHLE isn't in question here (the links you gave solved that one pretty thoroughly). The link between emuunlim and UltraHLE is harder, and if I ask Realityman, he will probably say you were influential in the distribution of UltraHLE. Unfortunately, Some of Wikipedia's principles are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability, not Truth</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No Original Research</a>, which means that we couldn't use his statements unless they were published in a third-party reliable source. We also couldn't contact Nintendo for this information for the same reason. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 02:17, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Emulators Unlimited isn't even the focus of the story linked by Mr Manticore above; the story is about a lawsuit against another company, with later content describing the subsequent announcement of UltraHLE, mentioning that "it relies on illegally copied ROMs." Frankly, a hack based on illegal copying may easily get popularity among a small niche, but it needs real evidence of mainstream coverage to meet WP's standards. I read references to MIME (another game emulator) frequently, but if I ever heard of "Emulators Unlimited", it was in a throwaway context. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 13:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Press coverage consists only of trivial mentions to the website in conjunction with the emulator. The articles linked-to only seem to attest to the notability of the emulator, not the site.

<p>Two problems here. 1) This article, which was created to be about the color bright green, has <b>twice</b> been hijacked by environmentalists who blanked the article without any discussion and turned it into an article about a supposed "subcategory" of environmentalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bright_green&amp;diff=29338090&amp;oldid=17622930" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bright_green&amp;diff=29338090&amp;oldid=17622930" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bright_green&amp;diff=63685412&amp;oldid=53057947" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bright_green&amp;diff=63685412&amp;oldid=53057947" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. 2) The term is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> that apparently is in little use even within the environmentalist movement. A Google search on "'bright green' +environmentalism" pulls up only 445 hits total <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bright+green%22+%2Benvironmentalism&amp;num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=460&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bright+green%22+%2Benvironmentalism&amp;num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=460&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, and even starting on the first page of results, most of the hits use the phrase "bright green" purely to mean, well, "bright green", as in "bright green oasis", "bright green in color", etc. Since there appears to be an orchestrated campaign by a certain few editors to hijack the page, I felt it would be best to go for a full AfD instead of simply reverting to the page's original content. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 05:11, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>by analogy, a list of fictional characters would be too long. This is merely a listing of fictional characters by a notable trait. This is hardly a normally deletion worthy article. Check the history. It has dozens of editors and dates back over 2 years. If the page was not useful, it would not show this kind of activity. The list article has proved its usefulness by that standard. Oh, and nothing at wikipedia is self-evident. If you want to delete, make a point that shows this information is a) not notable b) not verifiable or c) redundant. If none of these apply, the article has no reason to be deleted. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 05:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> WP is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Looking at this list, it's simply a lot of characters that share an arbitrary trait. There is nothing to be said about them. You cannot draw any sort of connection that helps one understand their encyclopaedic notability. As it stands, it just exists for the sake of documenting minutiae - not a good thing. I would contrast this with, say, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_pirates.html" title="List of fictional pirates">List of fictional pirates</a>, which can be used to draw connections among and typify the portrayal of pirates in fictional works, or something of that nature.

I'd suggest that this list is well within Wikipedia norms, and can become encyclopedic with some editing: its main weakness, as previously noted, is the skew to SF/Fantasy, and its lack of sourcing. Its contents are neutral, verifiable, and its constituents notable. In certain cases, amputation is a core trait to the fictional character (e.g. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_James_Hook_602d.html" title="Captain James Hook">Captain James Hook</a> or <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Million_Dollar_Man_0bb6.html" title="Six Million Dollar Man">Six Million Dollar Man</a>).

<dd><i>In certain cases, amputation is a core trait...</i> I agree with that and believe that should be covered in the characters' respective articles; however, in many of these cases, this does not hold up and, again, it's just an arbitrary trait that they share with other characters. It is of little difference from "Fictional characters with long hair" or "Fictional characters who live in mansions." My test is, after reading through the entries in the list, is there a possible reasonable answer to the question "So what?" If the answer is yes, there is likely an encyclopaedic use for this list. If the answer is either no or is a contrived, strecthed sort of case, as occurs here, then it probably doesn't belong. GassyGuy 23:45, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is quite a stretch to compare a permanent condition like amputation with "long hair" or "living in mansions" -- both of these are transitory states, and not a core physical disability, which is <i>always</i> employed by a fictional creator for a specific purpose. Just because a topic or list is relevant or important to you does not make it an invalid article.

<li>I'm still not clear how you view a list of fictional characters with visual disabilities as different from a list of fictional amputees? You wrote, "My test is, after reading through the entries in the list..." that's a pretty clear personal discretionary method. The answer to "So what?", as I gave above, is that the motif of amputation is used for a specific purpose by authors; it is not an arbitrary or accidental trait in fiction.--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 01:30, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The amputation of Captain Hook is similar to the amputation of Frodo Baggins which in turn was employed with a similar purpose as the amputation of Thomas Covenant? Sorry, perhaps you can help me with this one? GassyGuy 02:24, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for the question -- and if you'll allow me to expound on this rather interesting topic, I hope I can answer the "So what?" to your satisfaction. First to clarify: I wrote "amputation is used for a <i>specific</i> purpose" -- not "similar" purpose. The amputations of the characters you've mentioned are central to their characters and story development. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Hook_ec40.html" title="Captain Hook">Captain Hook</a>'s amputation of his hand by Peter Pan, and the subsequent eating of his appendage by the Crocodile are the core axes of his character's arc: because of this, Hook is set on a vendetta against Peter, and is in turn hunted by the Croc (who found the taste of the hand delicious) -- both of which prove to be his undoing: hook is ultimately defeated by Peter and swallowed whole by the crocodile. In the case of <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frodo_Baggins_d8a3.html" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo Baggins</a>, the amputation of his finger, by being bitten off by the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gollum.html" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>, is the climax to the entire course of the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_293e.html" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a> trilogy. It is only through this, that the One Ring is ultimately destroyed. Thereafter, he's called "Frodo of the Nine Fingers" in acknowledgement of his status. Finally, and just as critically, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Covenant_1bb7.html" title="Thomas Covenant">Thomas Covenant</a> was actually created by Stephen Donaldson based on his father's description of experiences with leprosy in India. Covenant's leprosy is discovered after the amputation of his fingers, and becomes the central thread of his struggle to survive. In his first appearance in <i><a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Foul%27s_Bane_360e.html" title="Lord Foul's Bane">Lord_Foul's_Bane</a></i>, his amputation is what identifies him as the reincarnation of Berek Halfhand. You may be interested in reading an article from the April 2001 <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychologist_e8af.html" title="American Psychologist">American Psychologist</a></i> journal, "Creative Cognition, Conceptual Combination, and the Creative Writing of Stephen R. Donaldson "<a href="http://educ.ubc.ca/courses/epse516/readings/oct19/stephen_donaldson.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://educ.ubc.ca/courses/epse516/readings/oct19/stephen_donaldson.pdf" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, which notes, <i>"To help himself to avoid the prospect of future amputations, Covenant has developed a rigid discipline of regularly surveying his extremities for injuries... The dynamic tension between the attractions of the fantasy world and Covenant's fear of neglecting the discipline that has kept him well sets the stage for a remarkably compelling story."</i>--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 03:16, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, but when you'd said specific, I'd assumed that meant one specific purpose - so, in essence, if I read you correctly, your argument is that these people all have a purpose for having a missing appendage. I never said they didn't. In fact, I'm sorry you wrote all of these explanations, because I not only agree but already found those three amputations important to their respective stories. What I'm saying, however, is that that purpose isn't similar. I think that the missing appendage should be documented in each character's article because it is indeed important. What I am saying is that this list cannot demonstrate much because the purposes and portrayals are starkly different, so that this list, again, becomes a group of characters sharing an arbitrary characteristic. The characteristic is important enough to be documented in the character's articles, sure; but the memebrs of the list are related by any sort of encyclopaedic connection, just a common trait. GassyGuy 03:22, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you've just acknowledged why this is a notable list: that the amputations are an important part of the fictional characters. However, it's inaccurate to claim that it's an "arbitrary characteristic" -- as you've just pointed out yourself, it's not at all arbitrary. The choice by an author of making a character an amputee is a trait perhaps more significant even than being visual disability in fiction-- amputation becomes a critical element of change for most of the characters, whereas blindness in fictional characters is either inherent from the beginning or a motif of symbolic significance as an outcome for some wrongdoing (e.g. As in <a href="../../../o/e/d/Oedipus.html" title="Oedipus">Oedipus</a> and later fiction, eyes being plucked out is a popular theme).--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup>Talk</sup></strong></font> 07:14, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I think we must be arguing different things. I have never argued against the missing appendage being somehow significant to the character or story - I am saying that there is no actual encyclopedic connection among characters who have missing appendages. You yourself said that the authors' purposes are not similar, just that each individual case has a purpose. What you've given is a very good argument for why missing appendages should be detailed in the individual articles for these characters, and I agree. What I still don't see is any explanation how this list helps to elucidate on characters missing appendages rather than simply collects them indiscriminately. GassyGuy 08:17, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Perhaps you have a differing understanding of what an "indiscriminate list" is. There's no need for the authors to have exactly the same purpose in making certain characters disabled -- as you have already agreed, the use of amputation by an author is notable, in and of itself. That's what makes it encyclopedic. How is this list indiscriminate -- or any less descriminate than the hundreds of other <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_fictional_things.html" title="Lists of fictional things">Lists_of_fictional_things</a></b> that make up Wikipedia? Perhaps you might apply the same metric to the dozen other articles in the category <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_fictional_characters_by_medical_condition_dd6c.html" title="Category:Lists of fictional characters by medical condition">Lists of fictional characters by medical condition</a></b>?--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 23:19, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I feel as if we're going over the same ground repeatedly and see no reason to do so, so I shan't be adding to this AfD anymore (I pretty much said everything I had to say days ago and have just been rephrasing myself since.)

<li><b>Retain</b> The term 'noot' is used by an exclusive South Australian sub-culture, and naturally, a user from Western Australia would not have heard of this term. I had expected Wikipedia to cater for all groups, even a relatively small one, as in this case. We are outraged that genuine, factual information is being deemed "too minor to be on wikipedia" by a user who clearly has no knowledge of our culture.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I've worked places with parking lots bigger than 700,000 square feet, and those lots don't get WP articles. Why should size matter unless the mall is notable specifically for being "the world's largest"? I don't see that we should include every nation's largest mall, every nation's tallest building, etc. unless there are verifiable third-party sources featuring that fact. A local newspaper's article saying "mall being expanded" is of little weight by itself, as every mall has probably gotten a two-paragraph blurb in its local paper.

<li>The small land area of Singapore limits the size of architectures, which make Jurong Point one of the largest and most notable in Singapore.

<li>No. I'm saying we are supposed to adhere to Wikipedia standards, including verifiable significance rather than whether a couple of local people claim importance without evidence.

Freddy's General Store might be the most important shopping facility in a town of fifty people in South Dakota, but that "local standard" isn't evidence of Wikipedia importance.

<li><b>Keep</b> I beg to differ in opinion from Awyong. I live in Hougang, yet I know this mall very well indeed, and have been frequenting it since it opened in the late 1990s. The impact it has on the commercial landscape in the West is pretty obvious, for prior to its existance, the lack of a centralised commercial facility meant it was spread across a far larger area around the various neighbourhood centres. Such an impact is difficult to judge from its physical size, but to say it is non-notable for what it is physically is way too dismissive.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 14:19, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My statement above does not regard "permissibility". It regarded deletion criteria. From a logical point of view, it is perfectly possible for "presence of non-independent source" not to be a deletion criterion, and for "absence of independent sources" to be one. As for your observation on other articles, again I must state that I prefer to judge each article on its own merits. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 16:41, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>An article can have both independent sources and non-independent (related) sources. A good article will use both independent and related sources. The issue isn't whether or not the related sources are used. The issue is whether the independent sources are available and used. If the independent sources are not available, the article should be deleted as a consequence of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If the independent sources are available but not used, the article should be improved by using them. The best evidence that the independent sources are available is their use, but pointing out other sources that cite such independent sources is sometimes adequate. The opinions of individual editors that something is significant enough to cover carry no weight compared to the opinions of independent sources. We ignore related sources in discussing notability because related sources are inherently biased.</dd>
<dd>I also think it is obvious from my comment that I said <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> was the standard.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is a major difference between the two. WP:INDY leads with a one sentence summary of the essay that is an argument from policies. No such summary of WP:LOCAL exists or is possible. To top it off, WP:LOCAL says in the section entitled "Creating articles about places of local interest" that references should be included in an article about a local place of interest. So I can also argue "Delete because the article does not have the references required by <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>." WP:LOCAL is a reason to delete the article, not to keep it, because the article is not up to the level that WP:LOCAL expects. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:39, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: The defenders of this mall have now had several days to provide verifiable references of notability, and have failed. I think the page should be deleted, for the following reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li><i>Notability:</i> Whether you think this page is controlled by <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or the general <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guideline</a>, notability has not been established. <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> is not helpful, as the proposed guideline explicitly states that it does not establish notability requirements. There is no verified statement anywhere that establishes why this mall is notable, other than that it is a large mall in Singapore. The basic requirement of most notability pages -- two non-trivial references in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources is not onerous, and has not been met.</li>
<li><i>Verification:</i> Not one statement on the page is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> by any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. As written in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small 'garage' or local companies are not likely to be acceptable."</li>
<li><i>Advertising:</i> The page as it is written reads like advertising copy, and its only function is to advise readers of the amenties available at the mall, and to direct readers to the mall's website. This fails for several reasons: (a) <a href="../../../a/d/v/Wikipedia%7EAdvertising_29d3.html#Advertisements_masquerading_as_articles" title="Wikipedia:Advertising">Advertisements masquerating as articles</a> are not only inappropriate, they may be speedy deleted; (b) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>; and (c) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not advertising</a>.</li>
<li><i>Incurable</i>: As I've said, the page's defenders have had several days. I don't see that any of the problems above are curable, much less all of them.</li>

<p><b>Please do <i>not</i> change reason for nomination</b>: To clear up the confusion the last post engenders, as the nominator I state again that the proposed reason for deleting this article is that it does not meet the relevant notability criteria. In this case, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> applies, so <i>multiple</i>, <i>non-trivial</i>, <i>independent</i> sources must be quoted by the article to establish its notability. As it stands, the article contains only one such source, whose reliability I have <i>not</i> questioned. As for non-independent sources, whether they are reliable or not, the article can of course contain them, but they are <i>not</i> eligible as notability criteria under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 14:57, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are multiple such sources. In the above, Mailer has already given another source from the <i>Business Times</i>. Let me add another one from a govt. agency <a href="http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2138" class="external autonumber" title="http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2138" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. So, any remaining problem? This Afd is already a futile effort, we are just entertaining each other here&#160;;), which is alright. But basically, if the article was to be deleted, it would just be wasting the contributors' effort and reducing the comprehensiveness of wikipedia (although some editors don't care about shopping malls, but the majority do.) We can discuss forever, but in short, the reason cited for deletion is really very weak. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 22:47, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Coverage of popular game/anime series seems to have improved vastly recently; it seems that the wikiprojects are now taking maintenance as seriously as expansion, and simultaneously the deletionists have stopped being so aggressive (no references to notability so far here, only one mention of cruft, etc).

<p>This is an article about an interview. We generally do not have articles on press conferences, interviews, talk show appearances, and the like. Rather, important material from such events is added to the relevant articles either on substantive topics or on the participants. Any important new points that Clinton made should be merged into the relevant articles on those topics.

I concur, except I'd note that what should be explained in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Wallace_4ec5.html" title="Chris Wallace">Chris Wallace</a> article is the material relating to Wallace's conduct and alleged bias. The Wallace article isn't the place for rehashing the substance of U.S. anti-terrorism policy in the 1990s. I mention this because I wouldn't want deletion to be read by the Clinton-bashers as a license to go back to trying to turn the Wallace article into an off-topic conservative hit job. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 21:25, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Thank you Derex for failing to notify me of your request to delete this article. (I originated the article.) (1) In response to the comments above, there is no explicit attempt to "debate the respective Clinton and Bush records on terrorism" on my part. There was however, an attempt to discuss Clinton's response to the question that was provided part &amp; parcel with Clinton's characterization of Wallace as a "Republican hit" man. Given that Clinton raised ire and accused Wallace of engaging in a "conservative hit job", whether or not Clinton was factually incorrect or evasive in answering the question is certainly relevant information for someone to know, if they want to know whether Chris Wallace is biased, or just doing his job. Otherwise, the report is just heresay. My opinion, so long as the discussion talks about what Clinton and Wallace actually said during the interview, which is the topic of the section in Wallace's biography, then it's fair for inclusion, on-topic and relevant.(2) I certainly did attempt to include this information "merged" with the article on Chris Wallace, but Derex and a few others repeatedly removed that material from the Wallace entry, claiming it was "off topic." Suffice it to say, certain people wish to characterize Wallace superficially as having committed a "conservative hit job" without any counterpoint or in depth discussion. Boogers.(3) Also note from the history, that it was Derex and not I who added completely extraneous material about Napolitan. I tried to delete it numerous times, but it was Derex who kept adding it in. (It's included in the wiki entry on Napolitan anyhow.) Juliandroms 05:31, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: No way. You just have to get off your fixation with this interview. The interview is only one piece of "Clinton administration anti-terrorism actions", which in turn is only one piece of "Clinton administration", which in turn is only one piece of "Bill Clinton". If the article on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> tried to cover everything at the level of detail you want for this tiny piece, the article would be book-length.</dd>
<dd>What Wikipedia does instead is to use a hierarchical "daughter article" system. See generally <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>. For example, the Clinton bio article contains a reference to the <i>Cole</i> bombing, with a wikilink to the article <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Cole_bombing_dedc.html" title="USS Cole bombing">USS Cole bombing</a>. The latter article includes a mention of the different POVs about the Clinton and Bush administration responses (or lack thereof) to the <i>Cole</i> bombing. That section could be expanded with information from different sources, including but not limited to the Wallace interview. Other parts of the interview, of course, related to other subjects. The interview itself just wasn't such a significant event in Bill Clinton's life that it deserves that much space in his bio article. By way of comparison, note that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Clinton&amp;oldid=81346201" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Clinton&amp;oldid=81346201" rel="nofollow">current version</a> of the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> article gives much more attention to this fifteen-minute interview than to Clinton's own autobiography of several hundred pages. The treatment of the interview in that article shouldn't be further expanded; it should be reduced substantially or eliminated. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 07:01, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So let me get this straight: Someone responds to Chris Wallace's question by criticizing him as a "conservative hit" man and that goes in his Wikipedia entry. Meanwhile, Bill Clinton can say whatever he wants, and Wikipedia is expected to parrot this at face value, with no contarty viewpoints to express. Does not adhere to an overal neutral policy, IMHO. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.80.234.11 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__66.80.234.11_3422.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 66.80.234.11">contribs</a>) 23:04, 14 October 2006 (UTC).</small>

<dd><b>Response</b>: I just looked at the text on the interview in the Chris Wallace article. It does present Brit Hume's critique of Clinton's claims. For want of a better phrase: it reads pretty fair and balanced to me. First, in the description of the interview.

<dd>My response to the anon: No, you haven't gotten it straight. Whether Chris Wallace is biased is a subject that's about Chris Wallace, so it goes in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Wallace_4ec5.html" title="Chris Wallace">Chris Wallace</a> article. Whether Bill Clinton, when he was President, acted appropriately after the <i>Cole</i> bombing is not about Chris Wallace and does not go in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Wallace_4ec5.html" title="Chris Wallace">Chris Wallace</a> article. Where that subject is properly addressed, i.e. in the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Cole_bombing_dedc.html" title="USS Cole bombing">USS Cole bombing</a> article, we should report all notable points of view. That means we <i>report</i> what Clinton has said on the subject but we don't "parrot" it (if by that you mean that we assert the truth of one side of a contested issue). We also report any notable criticisms of Clinton, though again without adopting them. The same is true of the other aspects of the underlying disputes about the Clinton administration's and the Bush administration's respective responses to terrorism. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 05:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For your consideration, a non-notable local bottlemaking company, which was bought up by another non-notable bottlemaking company now defunct. An attempt has been made to show some kind of notability - an apparently ground-breaking decision involving the company in Mississippi. Nuh-uh. It's just corporate cheerleading from the lawfirms website ("define in detail" is the relevant weasel phrase).

<li><b>Keep</b> It's informative. It's not promotional. Someone has written an entire <i>book</i> on the company's long history, beginning in 1775. A neutral third party taking time to write about a topic is a stong indicator that some other people will also find the topic interesting and informative.

<li><b>Keep</b> if the article can be expanded to make a case for the company's notability. Since there's a book about the company, and since it started in 1775, it may have notability for some reason or another. Alternatively, if the court case makes it notable, then there should be more information about the court case. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 15:41, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was tempted to speedy delete this under criterion A3. This page is a spam magnet that doesn't work: it does collect linkspam, but it <i>doesn't</i> keep it off of any of the other martial arts pages. There are no established editors watching this page: I couldn't find any examples of an organization being removed from the list, so this counts as "indiscriminate information", advertising, and a web directory, all in direct violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Furthermore, having a list of all Karate organizations is just a bad idea: there's no selectivity implied in the title and there are hundreds of thousands out there, ranging from single dojos to international federations.

<p>This is a cruft-heavy article that almost completely duplicates information in some of the other, better-written articles about <a href="../../../e/v/e/EVE_Online_f4f6.html" title="EVE Online">EVE Online</a>. As one of the major contributors to the better EVE Online articles, I think the EVE Online category as a whole should stay small, and that articles aren't needed about each of the major races... because then we'll get articles on the bloodlines... then the ship classes... then the individual ships... and so on. I am also nominating <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amarr.html" title="Amarr">Amarr</a> with this. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 14:07, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I, for one, found this article useful and informative if not wholly accurate. I also think that using the word "cruft" in an opening line of a thought is shooting yourself in the foot. I'd prefer an expansion and revision of the article or a merge with the main EVE article, but an outright deletion does not serve a useful purpose. Bulbous 01:36, 14 October 2006 (UTC)Bulbous
<ul>
<li>But the main article already has nearly all the information in this article. I didn't think there was much to merge, as the main article already has summaries of each race's history, and the Spaceships of EVE Online article has listings of all the ships of each race also.

<p>I talked with the webmaster of the radio station that broadcasts the show...his (and other members of the show) profiles were supposed to be on the station's website. The pages were left in a "pending" status and never published. This should be getting corrected in the next few days. This would address the verfiability.</p>

<p>One of the arguments that is attempting to be made is related to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Cloud_cb29.html" title="St. Cloud">St. Cloud</a>'s status as a "small market" and <a href="../../../k/n/s/KNSI_ac27.html" title="KNSI">KNSI</a>'s status as a "small local radio program." <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Cloud_cb29.html" title="St. Cloud">St. Cloud</a> is hardly "small market." St. Cloud is the 8th largest city in the state with a population of 64,308 (as of 2000), and <a href="../../../k/n/s/KNSI_ac27.html" title="KNSI">KNSI</a>'s broadcasting is not limited to the city limits, as well as online. Could you please give us your qualifiers for "small market" and "small radio station" so we may reference these qualifiers with other Wiki articles? As a member of the staff, who has an influence on what is put on the air of Race to the Right, I would also like qualifiers that you are using for "obscure staffer." From what I understand (according to Wiki's own definition, "there has been controversy over <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'s reliability and accuracy with the site receiving criticism for its (among other things) preference for consensus or popularity over credentials." Members of Race to the Right staff are not going to win an argument about popularity. But the staff for this radio show can hold their own when it comes to credentials. Articles from the Always Right Usually Correct blog have been featured throughout the blogging community as well as sites that track the notability and popularity of articles ( <a href="http://www.buzztracker.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.buzztracker.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzztracker.com/</a> for example). Would it not be also good to know of decendants of notable historical figures as well?

<p>According to the Wiki guide on Notability, personality notability can be determined by: A large fan base or Name recognition (ammong other things) What would you consider a "large fan base"? Also by what do you define "Name Recoginition"?</p>
<p><a href="http://alwaysrightusuallycorrect.blogspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://alwaysrightusuallycorrect.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> has had over 76720 visators since 3/17/06, with an average of about 360 a day.

<li><b>Comment</b> those criteria are intentionally ambiguous to allow editors to make a judgement call; there is no hard number. Still, the number of hits a website gets is an argument for the website being notable, not "a researcher and contributor" for the radio show tied to the webstite (and personally I don't think it really demonstrates notability for the website... my blog gets roughly the same number of hits). Again, the relevant notability guidelines for a person are at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and that is what you should be basing your argument on. I don't think being a researcher for a show, where the host has a blog that gets a certain number of hits meets any of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:01, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Ambiguous nature of Wiki's rules not only allows editors to make judgement calls, but allows preferencial treatment of some articles, and exclusion of others based on editorial opinion. If rules are going to be cited as criteria to be meet inorder to be allouable in Wiki, then Ambiguous or not, of something meets those criteria, it would be expected to be kept. Race to the Right meets the notability guidelines by having 1. A large fan base and 2. name recoginition. The entires on the contributiers to Race to the Right (Tony Garcia and Pete Arnold) show what makes Race to the Right what it is. <a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Pete Arnold</a> 20:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This article does not function as a game guide, if only because the information contained in it is inapplicable to the games. It is a article on the technical specifications of the weapons used in the game, which are actually un-selectable for most of the games, and more of a storyline concern than any kind of hints page.</dd>

<p>As for having less citations than normal, this is because the information for the weapons is mostly contained in the japanese sourcebooks and in-game dialogue/captions.128.211.254.142 16:02, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - No, I'm saying to just rewrite or remove the game guide type of info.

<li>You just listed a bunch of Flash cartoons that reference this series and Google hits. You didn't show if it was given nontrivial coverage by reliable sources; you didn't show if it won any notable, independent awards; and I would hardly say every site that hosts this Flash series would count as "distributing" the series.

<li>No. Let me repeat myself, "impact" is not a criteria for notability. Read the notability guidelines for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">web content</a> to understand what constitues notability on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">[<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">contribs</a>]</font> 04:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, the article complies with the notability standards. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Chriterion 3</a> indicates: "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." The subject gained notability after being published on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albino_Blacksheep_f6fb.html" title="Albino Blacksheep">Albinoblacksheep.com</a>, a "well known" website whose publishings are made by webmaster, rather than by simple user publishing. The creator (Brian Kendall) does not own or operate said website. This qualifies the article as <b>compliant</b> and should be decided as <b>keep</b> due to Albinoblacksheep's notability as an "online publisher." --<a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidesim_be77.html" title="User:Ridesim">Ridesim</a> 07:07, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And so I suppose you expect most of the "Keep" comments to come from Italians, for something less fishy? It is a no-brainer why most of comments are coming from Singapore.

<dd>Actually, I would prefer if comments on the inclusion or deletion criteria for any given article were not based on the editors' area of residence, but only on the article itself. For an example of what kind of reasoning I'd prefer not to see, try <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jurong_Point_Shopping_Centre_5081.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jurong Point Shopping Centre">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jurong Point Shopping Centre</a>, where the deletion of the article has been defined by one editor as "a great insult to all Singaporeans". I wish this kind of reasoning would not become a factor in Wikipedia debates. My concern is not really that being a resident in the area might colour a single editor's judgement on differentiating between local notability and Wikipedia notability (although that is certainly possible); my concern is that some editors with a common interest or characteristic (in this case, residence) may have rallied privately to "lobby" the debate in disregard to the Wikipedia public. But again, let's assume good faith and deem it not the case. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 17:55, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I know, the <a href="../../../u/r/a/URA_db44.html" title="URA">URA</a> is a governmental entity, not part of Suntec, and thus considered independent. Suntec, having built the venue, cannot be considered an "independent source" about the venue itself. As far as the Fountain record goes, on the other hand, the Singapore Book of Records statement currently is contested, and the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_World_Records_df77.html" title="Guinness World Records">Guinness World Records</a> (generally considered the standard authority on world records) has withdrawn mention of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fountain_of_Wealth_5702.html" title="Fountain of Wealth">Fountain of Wealth</a> as the world's largest fountain about a week ago.

<li><b>Definitely Keep</b> - Boxrec is the only site on the net which has the records of pretty much all active professional fighters (and thousands of retired boxers!). It's a vital source of information for ALL boxing fans. How can you even consider deleting this vital boxing website from Wiki? Many professional boxers have a boxrec hyperlink on their personal websites to show everyone their career results, which merely emphasizes how important Boxrec is! - LAWLLB</li>

If we let such unilateral decisions made by users stand then we'll have way too many emerging superpower articles. Brazil's rise is not as widely documented as that of India, China's and the EU's. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 02:26, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The article <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">Superpower</a> defines such a country as "A superpower is a state with the first rank in the international system and the ability to influence events and project power on a worldwide scale".

<dd><b>Reply</b> I've said it already: put this information where it belongs. We don't need multiple articles on the same subject. Secondly, I think there's folks here who'd say that they want to stop the recreation of OR that has previously been deleted. The definition of "Great Power" includes: "is able to exert power over world diplomacy." Brazil certainly isn't there yet. It's not even in the G8. And, the article that I've added, despite its title, makes no case with verifiable refs that the country can actually do this. All it does is rehash stats on the country without showing how the country influences world diplomacy. (On a side note, I think it's amusing that the article includes a pic of Brazil's lone aircraft carrier, a used boat bought from the French...hardly sufficient "power" to project around the world.) <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 23:00, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I nominated each article individually. Group nominations <i>are</i> possible under Wikipedia policies, but this is not the case.

<dd>So how did you come to the conclusion that people arent exercising their votes "individually"? Just because the same logic applies in one topic happens to apply in another doesent mean it is a collective vote.

<dd>I'd rather <a href="../../../a/f/g/WP%7EAFG_0e2c.html" title="WP:AFG">assume good faith</a> and hypothesise that no "anti-national conspiracy theory" has been formulated, and that no reaction to that has been discussed out of Wikipedia channels on the concern that said discussion would have been unsuitable to the general public. As for nominations, nominations are termed "individual" if each article has a separate nomination; they are termed "multiple" if a group of related articles is listed in one single nomination. Personally I prefer the former option, as each article should be assessed on its own merits. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 08:05, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please allow me to explain the local context. The name "Shopping Center" can be quite misleading. But these "shopping centers" are actually major service, commercial, and entertainment hub, located at the center of a large residential district serving hundreds of thousands of people. These are not just business corporations. The supermarket in the mall is a business, but the "center" is the hub for many activities in that community. You may still think it is not worthy for wikipedia, that is a fair opinion. But <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> does not apply here because it is not a purely corporation or business entity. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 06:52, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

Jurong East Central is the location for the Regional Centre in the Western Region, but the delay in development plans for the area meant the centre remained the sole shopping mall and largest commercial entity there, although it pales in terms of size and tenent mix in comparison to many contemporary malls.

<li><b>Delete</b> as previously, an ad campaign doesnt make someone notable, especially since its during the 9/11 rush where everything related to the twin towers had articles about them, including a pizzaria that appeared on channel 9 and the NYTimes. Being mentioned after 9/11 for anything should be weighed heavily, its one of the most publicized events in the US history and everyone down to janitors around the location were interviewed, starting an ad campaign asking for evidence obviously gets you in the news, however it does not make you notable. WP:BIO is a guideline and this person is obviously not notable. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 18:37, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm changing my vote from the previous nomination because the rewrite has persuaded me that this is useful and notable information that can be presented with a NPOV. Per the argument that 9/11 nutcases are non-notable, I would respectfully note that the whole concept of 9/ll conspiracy theories is now notable. I would suggest an umbrella nomination for merging, or an acceptance that this article is effectively a spun-out part of the larger (and notable) topic of 9/11 conspiracy theorists. I ask myself: will people now and in the future want to read articles about the topic of 9/11 conspiracy theories?

<li><b>Delete</b> I have to agree with the others about the issue of an ad campaign making someone notable. That was easy for Walter to do by the way – offer to reward someone for accomplishing the impossible. This like some common person offering a $100,000 reward for proof that man has not set foot on the moon. Any takers? If Charlie Sheen did this, big deal. He was notable before the reward offer, unlike this crackpot. Fails notoriety. Maybe if he did something really worthwhile he could have an article.

<dd>Really? Can you tell me about the 14th Earl of Someford, in England, who lived to the age of 30 in England and died circa 1520 AD, and did nothing notable in life, yet has a Wikipedia article that is uncontested? Because your statement is a hollow one. Notability is established in policy. Published or written about in multiple non-trivial works. This man qualifies. Any opposotion to our policy therefore, and all above deletion "votes", as that is all they are in truth, can be safely disregarded by the closing admin as politically motivated. Non-policy based reasons to delete should have no validity (and it is from following this all on multiple articles) past time that the AfD process by permanently in writing modified to reflect that. Note that this is not a lapse of AGF, but simple fact, based on observed AFD behaviors and pattens by certain Wikipedians. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 18:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> She's the nominee of a major party in a Congressional race - that should be notability enough. The people who will be seeing her name on the ballot should be able to look her up on wikipedia and get some information. The page regarding notability of candidates indicates that if an article on a candidate is big enough not to be a stub, it should be kept. Rather than advocating deletion, why not add something to the page? <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterAmor_01d1.html" title="User:HunterAmor">HunterAmor</a> 15:28, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That proposed guideline also says that information on a candidate should be so big as to not fit on the page for the race itself. Since the race page does not (yet) exist, it's a bit disingenuous to say that this information wouldn't fit. That same page also suggests that the main page for a candidate should be created "Only if and when there is enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article", and you conveniently ignored the part about the information boing independent and verifiable, which it's not here.

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, this isn't just any district she's running in. The 5th California district means it is high profile even if she doesn't have much of a chance. People will be looking her up for specific information. Which leads me to my second point, she is more than just a 'candidate,' but a well known columnist and researcher from the Pacific Research Institute on her own. Finally, I have seen many candidate stubs worthy of deletion, and this one doesn't even come close to what the policy was probably intended to keep us from. In my view, there's plenty of doubt here which, in line with the Policy for Deletion, means we should abide by the presumption of keeping the article. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmiralwaugh_3837.html" title="User:Admiralwaugh">Admiral</a> 16:12, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As sophisticated and relevant a comment as I have ever seen, AnonEMouse, considering that it only means I have edited those pages *while logged in*. In any case, we're not competing for who has edited the most articles, we are discussing whether or not an article should be deleted from Wikipedia or grouped with another article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see how the 5th California Congressional district is more high profile than any others. I've been looking at the New York Times congressional political map <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/washington/2006ELECTIONGUIDE.html?currentDataSet=senANALYSIS" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/washington/2006ELECTIONGUIDE.html?currentDataSet=senANALYSIS" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> and see only 3 districts that are slightly competitive (neither are the 5th).

<li><b>Delete</b> Notability...she does not meet it. Even under the proposed compromise regarding candidates she does not qualify (basically, article about the race THEN the candidates). Re: 'nominee of a major party in a Congressional race'...this does not bestow notability, especially in a district where the losing candidate is more of a ballot place holder than a candidate with a chance. As an example, look at a similarly Democratic stronghold district in Minnesota (MN-5)...please locate the article about the Republican candiate Frank Taylor or Daniel Mathias...the incumbent's victims since 1998. The discovery about her 'best selling' publishing...well, just further emphasizes the lack of notability.--<a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">Tony</a> 01:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The more AfD nominations I see because of <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a>, the most I realize that it's a really bad idea and needs serious rethinking. And as much as I hate the idea of deleting a major party candidate for the US House, I'm having a really hard time finding reliable sources to add to the article. Yes, she's published several books, but it's difficult to find reliable sources about her being an author/poet. So, as much as it pains me, I'm leaning towards "delete." But I'll keep looking. - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperlex_32b0.html" title="User:Superlex">Lex</a> 05:02, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Don’t forget that neither <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> nor <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> are actual policies that must be followed, more guidelines that indicate the best way to proceed. In this case, I urge people to follow me in voting to <b>keep</b>, because I would argue that any professionally produced playwright of <a href="../../../t/l/i/Tlingit.html" title="Tlingit">Tlingit</a> ancestry, writing about <a href="../../../t/l/i/Tlingit.html" title="Tlingit">Tlingit</a> themes, is notable. Benson has definitely accrued some serious coverage, including through the American Indian Quarterly (you can search this via Project MUSE, JSTOR and Chadwick Literature Online (LION): look for volume 27:1). Don’t forget in searching for her on Google to include the middle initial "e". A good bibliography can be found on her bio created when she was an invited guest to the ninth "Returning the Gift" conference – see <a href="http://nativeartists.org/rtgxi2002/guests.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://nativeartists.org/rtgxi2002/guests.htm" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. While the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> guidelines are very useful when it comes to US or UK mainstream politicians who should always garner major press headlines, they can be less useful for marginalised peoples or smaller nations, and should be treated with care. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:07, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>: I'd like to point out that this article is still a stub; research is ongoing. As <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> points out, there are quite a few references to her out there. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirdre_1773.html" title="User:Deirdre">Deirdre</a> 15:58, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Let's forget about <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> here; I asked two days ago if she has any chance of winning, and have received no response, so I can only presume she's not a viable candidate and her district is safe Republican. Given that the article, in its current state, is pure political advertising (and, interestingly, never existed before September anyway) that means she fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, so bye bye. If someone wishes to do a full rewrite of the article that describes her as a Tlingit playwright, actor and poet, and only mentions her candidacy in passing, I'll be happy to reconsider my vote, but I must admit that as of yet I haven't seen any evidence of her notability there either. We need some verification that she's somehow a <i>notable</i> playwright, actor and/or poet. Her ancestry does not grant her inherent notability --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 16:54, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b>--I created this article in the first place, and not just because she is a political candidate. She is pretty well known in the state of Alaska. It was not intended as political advertising; that content was what I knew about right away and could slap up on a wikipage. Again, I'd appreciate some time to work on this. I really am grateful to <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> for the extensive work done on this article; it fills it out much more nicely. My understanding of Wikipedia's basic purpose is to create a freely accessible online encyclopedia of human knowledge. It's not like we have a shortage of space in the virtual world, and she certainly seems worthy of inclusion to me. With regard to her political viability, an (admittedly unscientific) poll conducted at the Tanana Valley Fair by the local League of Women Voters put Young vs. Benson at 53 to 47 percent out of a sample of 249 voters. (This is, of course, being touted by <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/8/11/111526/151" class="external text" title="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/8/11/111526/151" rel="nofollow">Daily Kos</a>.) <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirdre_1773.html" title="User:Deirdre">Deirdre</a></li>

<li>I'm still willing to countenance the idea that Diane Benson may be notable, but nobody has yet to establish it -- the best we've got is a bunch of things out on the periphery. It may be that she's actually notable, but it may be that she's good at getting her name out there and not much else. Given the straws that are being grasped in the article so far, I'm inclined to think that this source-gathering is motivated by her politics rather than by her art, so until we can say something interesting about that, delete. <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVectro_bf83.html" title="User:Vectro">Vectro</a> 15:13, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you check my contributions you'll see that I have a long-established interest in literature by Native Americans, and almost zero interest in American party politics (I'm a Brit living in Cyprus). The motivation behind my research comes from knowing how much more difficult it is for Native writers and performers to get coverage, hence the paucity of information on them: I don't like to see potential sources of information deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> at least that's what I think. I don't really get it. She's a major party candidate for Congress, and she has quite a few published works. These both seem like reasons folks might want to know more about her, without a lot of campaign spin interfering either way. I can understand that you don't want this place to be promotional, but she's running for Congress and I can't imagine that Wikipedia is part of her campaign strategy or anything like that; she's already well known. Seems to me like even in the future schoolkids might be curious about who ran in the past and lost. Sounds like you have pretty strict rules about who is important enough for people to care about, though. Anyway, that's my two cents.

<li><b>Keep</b> though I use and prefer the term lesbro. Let someone start sourcing it. It's certainly not unverifiable. It's got traction as being in real world use by a simple google search.

<li>Um, yes, that does make it a less <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.

See: <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">Secondary_source</a>. A single entry in a humor book does not fulfill the obligations of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> for an article.

<li>Nope, the book I had in mind (although I doubt I still have it in my library) was about the Russian that went to Japan, but the article started about the Polish ones.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> [Cid88] If your going to enforce this policy with the Moviebattles page, you may as well enforce it with the Nuclear Dawn, Natural Selection, Science and Industry, Alien Swarm, True Combat Elite (which is known to site no sources, but has no deletion notice), etc mod pages. TO be frank, very very few mods fit Wikipedia's rules, so you may as well delete all the ones that don't fit, or don't delete at all. As it is, the mb page is longer and actually sites a source, unlike some of the pages I listed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.233.200.208 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.233.200.208_9fef.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.233.200.208">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> [ACiD]How about moviebattles.de or ModDB for verification. As one of the developers I can vouch for this articles accuracy (and so can our official on-site guide), and I must say I fail to see how a mod with hundreds of thousands of downloads, millions of hits cannot be notable when it has had a pc gamer mention/mini review and cover cd, a 2 page spread in the french magazine, and been the full focus of a sky news article on mods (<a href="http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,31500-13209702,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,31500-13209702,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,31500-13209702,00.html</a> for your reference).

<li><b>Comment</b> - [ACiD] As far as I am aware(till now having no involvement in this wiki) the article was written primarily from the guide hosted upon our own website, www.moviebattles.com, but as mentioned moviebattles.de is a third party source that could be cited, and on the notability front for wp:soft guidelines pcgamer and sky news are hardly questionable sources, I also might add that comparisons with mods such as science and industry really betray a lack of knowledge about the video game industry, given that hl experienced media sensationalism, while jka is a practical blackout.</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. Surely the whole point of Wikipedia is to let people get more information about things, in this case the NPWA. The NPWA is one of the up and coming promotions in Great Britain and run shows on a more regular basis than many of the other British promotion featured on wikipedia, including <a href="../../../1/p/w/1PW_541d.html" title="1PW">1PW</a> and the <a href="../../../f/w/a/FWA_307f.html" title="FWA">FWA</a>. Plus several members of the roster are some of the biggest names in British wrestling today, including Jonny Storm and Jody Fleisch who themselves are considered notable by this website and other big names like them will be a part of the promotion in the future. The point of the page in that people can come onto wikipedia and find out more about the company, it's wrestlers and it's history. I personally think it has as much right as anything else to be a part of Wikipedia. NPWAFireball 00:54, 15 October 2006

<li>Sorry; I'm a newbie at this. The article previously existed, but with his name mis-spelled.

<li>Hi, and welcome to Wikipedia. The problem is that we, on Wikipedia, generally expect the people we have articles on to be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, i.e. they must be in some sense important or interesting enough that others would want to read an encyclopedia article about them. For academics, the rules most of us use are at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. If you think your father meets any of these criteria, you should update the article to reflect it, and provide a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">external source</a> for it. The fact that no-one had gotten around to delete the original article doesn't mean it was acceptable - we unfortunately have many more inappropriate articles than we can keep up with. Another namespace isn't the solution either, because encyclopedic content belongs in the Wikipedia namespace, if at all - unless your father were to become a Wikipedia editor. Then one could put this content on his <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">user page</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>You know, I simply don't care that much, and doubt very much that my father does, either. I was simply attempting to correct an error in the spelling of his name. My father is well-known in the linguistics field. (Heck, <b>I'm</b> well known to most linguists, since my early language acquisition was the subject of one of his early papers that virtually all linguistics students read.) From my reading of the section on WP:PROF, the fact that he's published a significant number of books in his particular area of expertise should be enough, but I guess I'm not understanding. So delete at your pleasure. Srburling 16:32, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> actually in linguistics and anthropology he seems to be well cited, and he's written extensively. I think he passes wp:prof with ease. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 17:22, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

While this list would be more limited and feasible, say, 15-20 years ago, the prevalence of vocoders in modern music makes this on par with List of songs featuring guitar or at least List of songs featuring cowbells, which was deleted less than a month ago. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 19:37, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Unlike guitar or cowbell, most people outside the electronic music scene are unfamiliar with the sound of a vocoder and frequently mistake it for other voice-based electronic instruments like talk boxes and Autotune. My suggestion for making it maintainable would be to limit it to charting singles, so for example, <a href="../../../o/_/s/O_Superman_cd05.html" title="O Superman">O Superman</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/d/Hide_and_Seek_%28Imogen_Heap_song%29_1cae.html" title="Hide and Seek (Imogen Heap song)">Hide and Seek</a> would be listed but "Nightflight to Venus" by Boney M (and most "eurodance" songs) wouldn't make the cut. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERaindog469_eeb1.html" title="User:Raindog469">Raindog469</a> 20:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> In American music, the vocoder is far from prevalent. Putting stricter criteria in place would effectively limit the list to charting singles (not excluding eurodance songs, etc.) List is potentially useful, encyclopedia-worthy, and feasible in my eyes. --<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndlessVince_8ffe.html" title="User:EndlessVince">EndlessVince</a> 02:40, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Trim</b>. Seems worthy of keeping, but it does have a potential to become very large, we need some basic criteria to keep this smaller (Basically, Keep per EndlessVince). <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow1_a579.html" title="User:Shadow1"><font color="olive">Shadow1</font></a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShadow1_f31d.html" title="User talk:Shadow1">(talk)</a> 19:35, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Simdesk is a real company, but this article is focuses solely on the speculation (original research) that it is the company that a series of message board posts were about. If the article is to remain, it should be about the company, and the Virtudyne thing should be at most a footnote. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConeslayer_540b.html" title="User:Coneslayer">Coneslayer</a> 19:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article could be moved to Virtudyne, as it is more likely people look up the article for Virtudyne looking for the real company. Bernhard Bauer 19:50, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We could also rename the article to something like "Virtudyne-Simdesk Theory". The fact is that nothing before this DailyWTF article justified Simdesk having its own article, but now it deserves mention on its story alone. I'm okay with this page being a description of Simdesk, but its story isn't a footnote, it should be the meat of the article. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlondike_5814.html" title="User:Klondike">Klondike</a> 20:11, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article posted here is pure speculation of a company that could be Simdesk. The story itself has not been verified or even researched (to my knowledge). The wikipedia entry for simdesk should first contain information only about the company. Anything else should be addressed as footnotes, or like wise. Atmostphere 20:17, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Came here from TheDailyWTF (although I'm a regular Wikipedia editor in any case). While I believe that Virtudyne may indeed be SimDesk, I don't believe it has any place here. As mentioned above, it's pure speculation, and something tells me that the editors here won't want to get themselves involved in a libel lawsuit if they happen to be wrong. <s><b>Delete</b></s>. --<a href="../../../c/i/a/User%7ECiaran_H_1b23.html" title="User:Ciaran H">Ciaran H</a> 20:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. may seem like a manual, but i would argue that this is instead a completely systemized and well compiled (if not an almost complete) article on the uses and function of the half-life (and through half-life, Natural selection) console commands, many of which can seem esoteric even to the longest time vetrans of this game. This is the only reference i have ever seen with this level of systemization. The encyclopedic value of this compilation is the explanation of useful netcode and console commands that were never formally released by valve, the designer of the engine for this particular game. I can understand that to others this may seem simply like coding, or modification terminology, but to those of us who play this particular game, and to many outside communities involved in running and playing this game, this page is a priceless reference when discussing the improvement of the game, as well as improvement for the players experiences, and to remove it will remove an amazingly rich resource for those of us who do play NS.

<dd>In fact, the notability of this band is likely focused in the Basque Country, which is not an independent nation. The criteria for national notability (charts, etc.) thus may not be met here. However, the Basques could be considered a specific ethnic, cultural and national entity (and in this case notability within the Basque Country could suffice to meet <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>). Otherwise all bands singing in Basque would become inherently non-notable just because they are not notable Spain-wide. I think that this perspective should be debated. --<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 22:08, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not sourced, but the article claims that members of the band went on to play with a series of other bands, the first one of which appears to be relatively notable. Additionally, an argument could be made that the band is representative of a particular regional scene (that of the Basque Country). That said, the lack of sources for either claim is problematic, and I think whatever comes up is going to be in Basque. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Having followed the debate, I'm willing to put my neck on the line and say that the band seems to just sneak over the line as far as notability is concerned, given what Husond has tirelessly located. It's not much, but it just does it for me. Arguing that non-English sources are somehow less than English ones is a nonce argument, since a Basque rock group is always going to generate more information in Basque (and probably in Spanish) than in English. Yes, I'd love to see more sources in English too, but I'm also prepared to accept <i>any</i> sources. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:37, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article's standing is not improved by Husond's personal attacks on those who speak for deletion. I have read the record and i object to my views being termed "deviant". The article's subject is clearly not notable; in fact, the article text makes no assertion of natability. In addition i dont find one google hit in english on this subject. If you read the one link given in the article you will find a brief reference to BAP somewhat far down in the text, and the implication is that the website thinks the band exists, when it is defunct. Thus the source is proven to be not only out of date but inaccurate; moreover, this source doesnt qualify as a reliable source per wikipedia standards.

<dd>Please do not deem my objection to your objections as "personal attacks". I have a strict policy against personal attacks and I don't think that your accusation is even close to plausible. In order to find Google hits related to this band you must narrow your search by adding related words such as band/basque/euskal/etc. That will provide you with a vast array of results. The fact that the band is defunct does not strip it (nor any other band) from notability. Once again I recommend that you carefully read the discussion and realize that the band is notable at least for the fact that one of its members later joined a notable band (as per <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>).--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 03:38, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL - So you are somehow calling me vane (by arguing that my work is an act of vanity, like if I had anything to do with BAP! apart of having enjoyed their music) and you don't tolerate that Husönd considers your opinions deviant (I think he meant <i>dissident</i>, but anyhow). As long as we a re talking about each other opinions or actions there are no personal attacks. We are pondering not each other's essential qualities but our respective acts. If you say that something I've said is false, you are not necessarily calling me a liar, you are just saying that I've comitted an error. If You think my stub is "vane", I hope that you are not calling me that, just this specific act. If I wrote that Annasweden's decission of submitting the article for deletion was capricious and felt my effort sabotaged, I'm not implying that she is a capricious person or a saboteur.</dd>
<dd>Let's stay cool and accept the criticisms to our actions as what they are opinions, and opinions not on ourselves but on some of our acts. That's all.</dd>
<dd>(And, yes, the online sources are obsolete. That's a pity but I still don't think it justifies the deletion. I could create a page in my geocities site on them... but that would be really an act of vanity. So I won't). --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 21:35, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm afraid I don't understand your reasoning. It doesn't seem to meet WP:V, as the PlanetQuake and moddb listings seem trivial and are not from reliable sources.

<p>Generally, if the article's opening paragraphs contain a line like <i>"Defining the views of any 'faction' of any American political party is difficult,"</i> you've got a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<dd>It is true that discussion of highly political issues brings out the POV in people. The editors of this very important, timely article have tried to overcome that problem with considerable success. The article of course is based on the current media--Time, Newsweek, NY Times, New Rebublic, Nation, National review etc have useful information every week. (and numerous books---of which Barone is essential). The critcs seem to have no specific complaints--which seems rather odd. The article of course is one of several spinoffs from The Republican Party, which is already very long. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 20:07, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A teenaged saxophonist. Originally speedied as copyvio from his website, but that has been delat with. We still have the problem that this is a monograph by the subject's father and fails to establish encyclopaedic notability (yes, he's played with some great people, but my 12-year-old son has performed with some of the gods of the horn world and that doesn't make him notable; festivals are great that way, you can meet, talk and play with the greats). I think this is (a) a proud father's boasting of his son's talent, (b) at least somewhat promotional (see the earlier versions) and (c) too early.

<dd>Dear Moderators of Wikipedia.org</dd>
<dd>The details mentioned about the ‘Mall Sainthwar’ community are based upon the facts and is a genuine one and in my humble opinion should not be deleted at all. This is evidenced by a strong community presence of over ‘1.2 million’ people residing in the Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and they originally belongs to the Rajput clan of Kshatryia's. ‘Mall Sainthwar’ community is prominently recorded in well known history books like Aaeene Akabari, Tujjak Jahangiri etc. which, if needed, we can supply for your verification too.</dd>
<dd>I would like to kindly request the Wikipedia.org moderators to first verify the facts with good resources before arriving to a conclusion to delete this article.</dd>

<dd>Dear Sirs,</dd>
<dd>History of Mall and Sainthwars which is written here is based on many books written by Historians on 'Type of Rajputs/Kshtriyas' in India and mainly in Purvanchal comprising of Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Western Bihar. Existence of Mall kingdom can be seen in ancient India. Mall are Visen rajputs while Sainthwars (or sihatwars) are basically migrants from western part of India. Detailed can be seen in AINE-AKBARI which gives name of villages where they settled, their original place alongwith their sect. Population of both rajput sect is around 8-9 lakh as per census of India and they are found in 6-7 districts of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Bihar in India.</dd>
<dd>Literatures are available on these rajput clans wriiten in Moghul period like Aine -Akbari and British records which shows the existence of this great rajput clan.</dd>
<dd>So please verify before deletion.</dd>

<dd>Dear Moderator of Wikipedia</dd>
<dd>The details mentioned at the wikipendia about the <b>MALL SAITHWAR community</b> is a genuine one and should not be deleted at all. This is strong community of more than <b>12 lakh</b> people residing in the Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and belong to the Rajput clan of Kshatryia's. It has strong hold in cities of Uttar Pradesh namely <b>GORAKHPUR, DEORIA, BASTI, SIDDHARTANAGAR, PADRAUNA, KUSHINAGAR, MAU, AZAMGARH, VARANSI, ALLAHABAD, KANPUR, EASTERN AND WESTERN BIHAR</b>. The authencity of this community as a caste can be verified in Gazzeters of Government of India and also from the land records Uttar Pradesh Government. Kindly look into the matter and as a matter of expectation it would be unwise on the part of wikipendia team to move ahead for deletion without any prior verification as such.</dd>
<dd>For any clarificatins and details for historical accounts, kindly get in touch with me as well.</dd>

<dd>This is one of the purest races of Rajputs. In ancient past, there were many powerful kingdoms having rulers from this community e.g. "Mall Rashtra",etc. In medival period also, there were many reputed and strong princely states like Padrauna, Dughara, Pali, etc.</dd>

<dd>(1). That the Gorakhpur district beside the adjoining districts is widely inhabited by the people generaly known as Sahatwars or Sainthwars. They are also written as such in caste column in Government papers.</dd>
<dd>(2). That the said Sainthwar Rajputs are the descendents of grand Rajputs whose original capital was Sahat in Gonda District. The mention of Sahtwar rajputs is to be found in Aine Akabari* on pages 93, 151, 314 etc. The Sahat rajputs have also been mentioned in Tod’s Rajsthan.<b>( * “Aine Akbari” is famous book written Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak, Vizier of Mughal Emperor Akbar the great * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar</a> and the author of “Akbarnama” refer your own site <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Akbar.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Akbar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Akbar.htm</a></b></dd>
<dd>(3). That among the people generally known as Sahatwars there are other sections of Rajputs who are incorrectly termed as such. They are Khagis, Thakurais, Mohits, Karkotaks, Dovis, Bishenmall, Gaharwars, Mohatas, Soharas, Mangras, Pushkars, Bellas, Bhathis, Uskas, Barhajas, Bais, Sahajs, Rawals, Kotharies, Rajpali, Khutahania, Barwas, Pundaris, Darwa, bhakhars etc. who are scattered over whole of the district. Thus the word Sahatwar though really comprising a part is by misnomer used for various independent deferent sects of Rajputs mentioned above.

<dd>(5). That the paper of whole Gorakhpur Tehsil has been corrected.

<li>Please note that Indian History is not found in the net in the same magnitude as European or American History.</li>
<li>Also most of the Indian magazines (dailies, weeklies) do not have a online version.</li>
<li>Another factor is that the vernacular (Hindi, Tamil etc) magazines use different fonts and is not searchable by Google</li>
<li>Another problem is the use of different spelling for the same name. For example, my town is referred to as Tuticorin, Thoothukudi, Thoothukkudi, தூத்துக்குடி etc. You can get the complete picture only if you search all these.

<dd>On your actual points, you'll note that the article clearly states the length of time the character appears. However, it also notes the character's significance to said film, and goes on to explain why it is important within the context of tokusatsu and Toho productions in general.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fact of the matter is, there is clearly content here that is not easily merged with the film. The article is (if I may be so vain) reasonably well-written and well-referenced, so there is really no case for deleting it. Having said that, I would not oppose a merge into a list of minor Toho kaiju, if absolutely necessary.

<li>It was never split off; the vast majorify of the information in this article was never in the <i>Gorath</i> article. In any case, you have an odd definition of "very short", as <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorath.html" title="Gorath">Gorath</a> is a pretty substantive article. Why don't you give an actual <i>reason</i> this should be merged, instead of blindly citing notability guidelines? --<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sean_Black_def1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sean Black">SB</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">T</a> 21:21, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's a notability guideline and also a deletion and style guideline (it's the where the debate about character deletion was codified and the guidlines were recently updated to jive with the <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">guidlines for writing about fiction</a>.) The general premise of the guideline is to keep like things together until an encyclopedic treatment of the article makes it long enough to warrant its own article. In fact most of the information contained in <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magma_%28Gorath%29_ec9e.html" title="Magma (Gorath)">Magma (Gorath)</a> is duplicated in Gorath.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Nominating for AfD and seeking consensus is a far better approach than repeatdly converting an article into a redirect without merging content, and without discussing it anywhere. Thank you Interrobamf. Can we count on you to do the same for all the other articles you silently tried to merge out of existance?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article is complete on its own. The information contained within the Magma article is different from that of Gorath and they coexist separately rather well. Merging would be confusing and deletion wouldn't make sense as the character is important. In the interest of comprehensive, easy to understand topic coverage, I'd think it were best to leave them both as they are. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 06:05, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, the character's so important that he was added at the last minute to the film to attract a Kaiju audience. No. It rampages around for six minutes and then dies. It's a distraction from the main plot. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 16:02, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Using Google news and Lexis-Nexis I can find only one article where BPN is featured, and it's in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, practically BPN's "hometown paper." <b>Delete</b> unless <s>more</s> other reliable non-trivial third-party sources can be found. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 23:37, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I totally agree it's reliable.

The one exception is the Guardian article, which is a column not an article.

<p>The result was <b>AfD failed</b>. Sherurcij obviously meant well, but he should not have attempted to close the AfD himself, as there are other voices for deletion apart from his, and as it is he hasn't closed it properly (that's what I'm doing now with the coloured background etc - until this is done, the AfD still appears in the lists of open AfDs). When he removed the tag, he should have been reverted. AfDs require that the tag remain on the article for the duration so that everyone knows it's going on who should know; <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> has invalidated AfDs where this didn't happen and I'm forced to do so here.</p>
<p>Though it may be somewhat moot, as from the discussion here, a consensus doesn't seem to have been reached anyway. If anyone still feels that notability is in doubt, this AfD should not prejudice another. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 14:15, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><s><b>Delete</b>, while a bit of work could make the subject a bit more NPOV, (he was beheaded for apostasy presumably, not "for owning a bible"), the fact remains that there is absolutely zero evidence that he ever existed...900 google hits, all of them are Wiki mirrors, or copy/paste the exact phrase "In 1994, Sadeq Mallallah was beheaded for owning a Bible". The only quasi-basis for the name is seen in a statement made by the head of the Saudi Institute in Washington, Ali al-Ahmed, who said <i>"In September 1993, Sadeq Mallallah, 23, was beheaded on a charge of apostasy for owning a Bible."</i><a href="http://www.newsbackup.com/about763008.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsbackup.com/about763008.html" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>, he offered no evidence or reference, and none was ever given by anybody else. No news agency ever reported such a beheading (and it certainly would've been a dear pet for media sensationalism at the time, if it were true). Basically it comes down to a completely non-notable person making an illustration of his point by inserting a name, fictitious, misremembered or actual. In short, let's not allow ourselves to further the misinformation out there...or else I want to start an article about how my priest discussed "There was a guy named Jack Straw, who was ploughing his fields one afternoon, when..." as a sermon illustration last Sunday. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">Speaker for the Dead</a>)</sup> 23:19, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>Subject is not notable</p>
<p><br />
This page has been prod'd twice before by others, and removed against the rules, without discussion. As others have noted, it appears to have originally been written by a fan-boy impressed merely with the fact that Miss Henson is female and attractive. Consensus in the talk page appears to be that her contributions as a programmer are not significant enough to warrant a Wikipedia page, and there's debate whether her "women in computer science" writings make her a notable figure. I don't think they do, but either way, this should be resolved with a proper discussion, rather than silent Prod removals.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. (Disclaimer: I'm the subject.) Ironically, to improve the case for deletion, I feel it's best to correct some misconceptions in the original request for deletion.
<ul>
<li>"Written by a fan-boy" - The original article was a cut and paste from a speaker biography I wrote for, I believe, Ottawa Linux Symposium, with the addition of one paragraph about my Linux Weekly News (LWN) articles. Someone commented that it seems creepy and stalkerish; if so, I have no one but myself to blame. In fact, it may very well have violated Wikipedia's self-authoring rules.&#160;:) I am not sure why at least one person has repeatedly interpreted it as the result of infatuation, given the actual text of the article, but it's not a good argument for deletion and detracts from the good arguments for deletion.</li>
<li>"[Because she's] female and attractive" - The original article went up shortly after I first began writing for LWN and made explicit reference to the LWN articles. Given that I've been female and attractive for some years, but only recently began writing for LWN, the LWN articles are probably the proximate cause. Writing for LWN does not automatically make someone notable (although it will earn you a little extra cash).</li>
<li>"Consensus in the talk page [...] programming contributions are not significant" - No argument here that my code is insufficient for notability, but the only consensus I can detect on the talk page is that I'm so pretty that I intrinsically warp the minds of male Wikipedians. There's certainly no comments on any of my patches to either Linux or Solaris (perhaps because it's easier to look at photos than read kernel patches.)</li>
<li>"Debate [if] women in computer science writings [make her] notable figure" - I think "debate" is too charitable a word; this does not make me notable either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While I am sympathetic to the desire to have more articles on women in computing in Wikipedia, I don't think this article will have a significant positive effect, and will all probability dishearten such an audience given the current propensity for discussion of female subjects' appearances and their effects on men. Given the enthusiasm of the various editors (hi, Rabbi!) and the relative lack of third-party source material, I still feel that the wiser course of action at this time is deletion.</p>
<p>For me, the loudest knell of doom for this article is the fact that even people who like me (or, heaven forbid, are infatuated with me) can't clearly explain why I'm notable. Therefore, I'm not.</p>
<p>Valhenson 07:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>:Hi Val -- your use of the phrase "even people who like me" makes me want to point out that my nomination for deletion doesn't have anything to do with not liking you. It should be clear by now that I don't like the paper of yours that I keep hearing mentioned, and am concerned that people coming to this page because of that paper may come away with the impression, based on your biography here, that you have a cryptography background on par with John Black's. I don't particularly think it's "mean minded" to compare backgrounds and competency domains of two parties in a debate, but given the other issues about notability it seems easiest to avoid the debate and have the entry deleted than have it explained that the Compare-By-Hash paper wasn't written by (or apparently peer-reviewed by, judging from the workshop's program committee) someone with a adequate understanding of hash functions.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, it's better that the controversy over that paper subside than to continue to confuse developers who don't wish to become experts themselves in the subject of hash functions, but simply wish to have an authorative source to turn to and direct them in proper usage of these primitives. I suspect this is likely to happen now that a peer-reviewed rebuttal has been published in academia -- but with John Black lacking a Wikipedia bio page explaining his background, and with edits expressing limitations of your background in this area being removed for NPOV reasons, I'm uncertain of a good way of presenting a coherent, unconfusing explantion of the controversy of the paper that satisfies NPOV and doesn't denigrate you unfairly. (The Usenix committee really fell down in accepting it, in my opinion, and did you a disservice by doing so.) It's important that developers think about the sorts of questions raised in your paper, but it's also important that they have an accurate source at their disposal from which to seek the answers to those questions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's rare that a good programmer is also a good cryptographer, and I hope I've made it clear that I'm not trying to imply that your lack of "kernel hacker celebrity status" means that you're bad at programming. One's level of fame is quite often orthogonal to one's talents or abilities. And as for my comments regarding the initial post and the presumed motives of the author -- I was attempting to sum up what had been previously expressed by others on the talk page. (I believe the original author represented it as his own writing, which explains the confusion.) I think we share the belief that your gender should be irrelevent, or only minorly significant, when considering your notability as an open source developer (and certainly not more significant than the actual code you've written!)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: To summarize, the above argues for deletion because the mere existence of a Wikipedia article about a person might improperly sway readers' opinions in favor of one of the subject's many publications. It is possible there are better arguments for deletion; if so, I plead that they not suffer by association with this one. On a side note, I appreciate John Black's criticism of my work, which has improved slightly as a result, and also his courtesy in attaching his name to his criticisms.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The point about third-party source material is well-made. "Just needs expansion" -- with what? Blogs and personal websites are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and code doesn't provide much biographical detail. More pressing is the "part of a cast of thousands". I don't think she currently meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. We can still include her name in the Linuxchix article (and relevant kernel articles?) without it needing to be a link; but there is no need for a stub, let alone an article. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelsa_ea14.html" title="User talk:Telsa">(talk)</a> 09:05, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Her primary qualification appears to be her gender. Her kernel contributions have been minor, and her publication record is not particularly significant. While she might warrant mention on a page about women in computer science, she does not appear anywhere near notable enough for Wikipedia. With respect to the appalling compare-by-hash paper, that's the downside of being an academic. If you co-invent RSA, everyone knows your name. If you present a braino of a paper at a major conference, everyone knows your name. Rob 06:26, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
