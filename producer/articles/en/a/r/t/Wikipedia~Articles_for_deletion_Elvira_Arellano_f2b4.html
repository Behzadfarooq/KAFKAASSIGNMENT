<li><b>Keep</b>, from the article: "On November 14, 2006, Saulito Arellano appeared before Mexican lawmakers." How many illegal immigrants do you know that have appeared before a national legislature? Plenty of sources written to show notability, and 100-year test is a suggestion, not an actual notability criteria. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 17:54, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Testimony before a govt. subcommittee, especially one of a foreign government, does not automatically confer notability. I have to go before the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services_72cd.html" title="United States House Committee on Armed Services">House Armed Services Committee</a> several times per year. Should I get an article in the encyclopedia based soley on that? L0b0t 18:04, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you are an illegal immigrant, yes. Illegal immigrants are among the least vocal groups ever of political consequence, for a great many reasons. For one to get such an audience is very notable. Besides, as I pointed out earlier, multiple independent sources of information is enough to confer notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. And as a last point, the "foreignness" of a government is irrelevant, this is a world-wide encyclopedia. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 18:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> In this case, the nationality of the govt. in question takes the wind out of the sails of your argument, she is a <b>CITIZEN</b> of the country whose govt. she testified before. If she were to speak before the U.S. govt. then she would be an illegal immigrant speaking before a govt. and that would be a wee bit more notable. A Mexican citizen speaking before the Mexican govt. is an everyday event. L0b0t 18:24, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're spinning. You might as well say she's a woman and they regularly testify before Congress, thus she's not notable. The point remains is that she is a member of a class of people who individually has rarely had an wide or powerful audience. She has two, the Mexican Congress and the North American news media. See the cited sources, again. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 18:42, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've both got <i>me</i> spinning. She did not testify, her 7 year old son Saulito did. Saulito is a United States citizen who testified before the foreign government of Mexico on his mother's behalf. Both of these individuals are from groups that rarely have a wide or powerful audience: children &amp; "illegal" immigrants. - <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicaneo_2438.html" title="User:Chicaneo">Chicaneo</a> 07:45, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very important event. Illegal immigration is one of the hottest political topics today. This woman is at the forefront of that debate and she has become a symbol. She came into the United States illegally and gave birth to her son here. While she is holed up in that church and sending her son to Washington and Mexico to plead on her behalf, there has been talk about whether U.S. born children of illegal immigrants should be automatically afforded U.S. citizenship. This woman is making history. There is something about her or illegal immigration in the newspapers at least once a week. At first, it was only in the Chicago papers, but now that it has been picked up by CNN, I think the article deserves to stay. If she is not notable, then I'd say at least 20% of the articles on people in Wikipedia also deserve deletion.Crazydog 18:23, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. She is the president of an political advocacy organization. That alone gives her notability. Her case has been given substantial coverage in national media, and, as was pointed out, she has become a symbol for the struggle of undocumented people for their human rights. For this, she has been both lionized and demonized. She may yet cause a change in laws or policies.

<li><b>Comment</b> the current version of the Elvira Arellano article is much different from the one I voted on this morning. I based my vote on the (23:03, November 15, 2006 68.166.88.10) version. That version only had 5 paragraphs and contained 11 links to the same three sources, one of which was an editorial damning Ms. Arellano. That version did not assert importance nor significance and had been marked for speedy deletion earlier. Since my vote, the article has been significantly improved and I believe that the current version establishes that this is a watershed case regarding the civil rights of children and of immigrants. Elvira's son is 7 years old, is a U.S. Citizen, and his mother and primary caretaker is being deported. If that's not significant then what is it? If I could change my vote at this juncture, I would say <b>Keep it!</b> - - <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicaneo_2438.html" title="User:Chicaneo">Chicaneo</a> 06:06, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Bwithh. Other than the fact that she decided to try the unusual (but not at all unheard of) tactic of taking refuge in a church, this isn't even a newsworthy story. And it's not encyclopedia-worthy either way. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 21:37, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Chicaneo, evrik, and Edison. It's a very important event that could possibly change the way procedures like this are handled and also the fact that she has made national and interntional headlines over the past few months. --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreau36_2b22.html" title="User:Moreau36">Moreau36</a> 16:21, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just to inform that <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicaneo_2438.html" title="User:Chicaneo">User:Chicaneo</a> has been asking people on talk pages to "come and vote". 1st.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree, it's bad form, and AfD is not a vote. But in this case I think it's a moot point as it's pretty clear Ms. Arellano meets the criteria for inclusion. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 00:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>Yes I have been contacting people. I have only contacted those who have a pre-declared interest in Mexican-American, Latino, or Hispanic issues and who are listed on one or more WikiProjects relating to these issues. This is the message I have left: "The Elvira Arellano article is up for deletion. Please vote by linking to the Arrellano article, then follow the links at the top of the page. Thanks. - Chicaneo" We are all busy, and those who are interested and/or knowledgeable about a particular issue need to be made aware that their attention is needed on a particular issue. This is not spam. It is communication and networking utilizing grass roots efforts techniques. I offer my sincere appologies to those who feel that these actions are "in poor form" <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicaneo_2438.html" title="User:Chicaneo">Chicaneo</a> 00:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well you weren't actually soliciting votes in a certain direction (heck, you <i>did</i> vote delete originally, and a few weeks ago, I might have, too, despite the local press coverage where I am), rather, simply soliciting input.
