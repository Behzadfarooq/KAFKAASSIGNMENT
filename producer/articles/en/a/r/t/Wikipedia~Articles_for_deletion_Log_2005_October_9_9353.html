<p>This article provides no useful information. Hurricane name lists are reused every six years. This, this year's (2005) will be reused in this year (2011), except for retired names. Since everyone knows that there will be retired names, no one will know this year's list until spring, 2006. Therefore, this article is a waste of space and there is nothing whatsoever that can be put in it to make it useful.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: it seems odd to have an article for every album, and even singles, a well known artist has produced, except for a greatest hits album. They usually only have one or two greatist hits, so it wouldn't mean a whole lot of new articles. Plus, an article would let you know which tracks are included on the album.

<li>I note that there are already <i>hundreds</i> of Wikipedia articles on artists' <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_hits.html" title="Greatest hits">greatest hits</a> albums. I also note that in many cases -- including, to all appearances, this one -- a greatest hits album often contains at least one or two songs that have never appeared on a studio album. And I note that a greatest hits album is often one of the biggest-selling (and thereby inherently notable) albums of an artist's career. And "not a crystal ball" is a pretty pointless argument to make for an album whose release is only a month away, and whose advance publicity and advertising has already gone out. (It's also a rather silly argument to make when we already have an article about <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Bush_9841.html" title="Kate Bush">Kate Bush</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_%28album%29.html" title="Aerial (album)">Aerial</a></i>, and we've had an article about the just-released-last-week <i><a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_Social_Scene_%28album%29_163a.html" title="Broken Social Scene (album)">Broken Social Scene</a></i> since <i>February</i>.) Finally, I note that "studio albums vs. greatest hits" seems a pretty absurd distinction to draw, and an unenforceable one -- if there isn't an article about this, somebody <i>will</i> create another one, and another one, and another one. All in all, I just don't see a convincing argument for deletion here. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:51, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. just to respond to some of the points. First, it's not that articles on compilations <i>aren't allowed</i>, only that they're discouraged unless there's some special reason (I don't see one here). Secondly, I don't understand why it's so outrageous to suggest that people wait until an album exists before creating an article; we're not some newspaper desperately trying to scoop the opposition. Thirdly, that there are thousands of other articles on non-notable (and not-yet released) albums and singles isn't a good reason for adding another. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:38, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This album exists. Release has been confirmed by the official website and they've even released cover art and track listing. It'll be out in roughly a month. How much more do you need for it to be real?

<li><b>Keep</b>. This color name was certainly notable in the late teens and twenties and has become one of the standard "named colors" used in web browsers.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure that's appropriate, to be honest. As Dystopos says, prior to X11, HTML, and standardisation of all things, "Alice Blue" wouldn't have been anything defined to the one-in-sixteen-millionth part as it is now. Perhaps the Alice Longworth article (or rather the caption to the image) shouldn't state quite so categorically that this <b>is</b> "Alice Blue", is all. I'd ask my granny which one <i>she</i> thought was more "Alice Blue", but she passed away twenty-odd years ago. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 22:28, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Depends what you mean by a "real" colour. "Alice Blue" is certainly a "real" colour, per
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>the Longworth article,</li>
<li>its having been chosen as a colour name for browsers,</li>
<li>the early 20th century song,</li>
<li>my late granny.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Note however that the Microsoft reference I cited also names "official" colours like "linen", "blanched almond", "ghost white", "misty rose" and "brown". I'd defy anyone to say "those boots are not brown because they are not RGB #A52A2A", "that rose is not sufficiently misty according to the W3C colour definitions". or to find a ghost for comparison. There are two things here, really - a "real" (as in "named as such by browser suppliers") colour called "aliceblue" and a range of colours into which both these grey-blue colours fall. <i>Perhaps</i> the Longworth article shouldn't state categorically that "this is Alice Blue", but the issue we're voting on is whether or not to delete the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice-Blue_%28color%29_1584.html" title="Alice-Blue (color)">Alice-Blue (color)</a> article.

<li>At risk of further obfuscation, I recently did <a href="../../../c/o/n/Image%7EConflicting_royal_blues.jpg_511b.html" title="Image:Conflicting royal blues.jpg">a comparison</a> of four different ways that "Union Flag (Royal) Blue" is defined per "The Flag Institute" and a similar exercise regarding the specifications for "Crimson" used by Harvard University and the University of Alabama. In the big picture, there's no way to put up an image on Wikipedia and say "This is the color _____". Definitions vary by medium and use. Displays vary. Perceptions vary. What we DO know, is that "Alice Blue" is a notable concept, and was once much more notable than "<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bondi_blue.html" title="Bondi blue">Bondi blue</a>" or "UPS brown". <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 00:12, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>RE: The No original research policy represents a different type of data. First of all, this information is not researched. It is simply a very intuitive guide on how to very specifically manipulate a certain data file. It is verafiable, and has no POV whatsoever. The page has nothing to do with original research. It is not scientific or academic, but rather technical in nature. Therefore, this is not a valid application of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">no original research</a> policy. -- Unsigned comment from User:IronLion45 at 21:21, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with your interpretation of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> policy. Your work creates a primary source. It is un<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a>. No exemption seems to exist for technical research as opposed to scientific. Regardless, we'll see how the votes go. I suppose it could be a long-standing tradition for the Wikipedia to allow technical guides here but I have not seen any other such article. I believe this would be more appropriate on a site like <a href="http://www.planetblackandwhite.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.planetblackandwhite.com/" rel="nofollow">Planet Black &amp; White</a>. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 21:36, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article has problems and should never have survived the original VFD. First, it's weasely: "Caffeinism has been defined as the poisoning resulting from excessive intake of caffeine". Yeah, OK, <i>who</i> defines it that way? Second, this section is a red herring: "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) states: "The 4 caffeine-induced psychiatric disorders include caffeine intoxication, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, caffeine-induced sleep disorder, and caffeine-related disorder not otherwise specified (NOS)." Notice that DSM-IV <i>doesn't ever use</i> the term <i>caffeinism</i>. Third, the single online reference given <i>never uses the term caffeinism</i> either.

<p>This page was up for deletion once before but I decided to list it again. The article seem to be a total vanity article. When discussing whether or not to delete the article before, the subject of the article, who is <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> was asked to refrain from editing the article. He has been unable to do so and has made almost weekly edits to it changing wordings, listing himself as in categories (such as philosopher) which he may or may not actually be qualified as. He did seem to appear in a few Google searches, but that's not very hard to do. I myself have published books, have taught classes, and have many of the same qualifications as this man seems to have, but I don't feel the need to glorify myself or make a completely vanity-like article. The fact that this user himself is the one who's done most of the workl on the article, and has made the majority of the edits, especially after being asked not to do so, is troubling to me and puts the reputation of wikipedia at stake. {See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_Mertz_Archive_262f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Mertz/Archive">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Mertz/Archive</a> for the previous deletion vote) --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottyBoy900Q_4200.html" title="User:ScottyBoy900Q">ScottyBoy900Q</a> 15:35, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My book on <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addison-Wesley_c410.html" title="Addison-Wesley">Addison-Wesley</a> has sold about 3500 printed copies to-date (but has just gone to second printing in the last week), but has been downloaded approximately <b>70,000</b> times in its electronic version. The website gnosis.cx is essentially exclusively for archival publications of my articles first published in other places. It has received visits from approximately <b>750k</b> distinct IP addresses (which only loosely correlates with eyeballs, of course). However, the original publishers, chiefly IBM <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeveloperWorks_76db.html" title="DeveloperWorks">developerWorks</a>, O'Reilly ONLamp<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.onlamp.com/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and Intel's (now terribly unorganized) developer site, certainly receive more readers on first publication (of my articles specifically) than does my archival site. So in other words, <i>my readership is approximately</i> <b>two orders of magnitude</b> <i>beyond the (admittedly minimal) recomendation WP provides for notability.</i></dd>

<dd>I took a look at Google Scholar for my name. It's a cool tool; I haven't really used it before. There seems to be a "DB Mertz" who is an ethologist, and is not me. But looking through the 67 basic hits, I see that 38 of them are really about me. Fewer than half of those concern any work for IBM. It appears that I have a number of citations and acknowledgement related to my philosophy work that I had not been aware of. Cool! See: <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22david+mertz%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22david+mertz%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>

<dd>Also of interest—at least to me—is Google Print.

Interestingly, all of the 11 books that contain my name in their text are genuinely references to me. It's delightful to me (for vanity reasons) that books as diverse as <i>Women's Health Solutions</i>, <i>Understandings of Russian Foreign Policy</i>, <i>Philosophy of Science and Its Discontents</i>, <i>Python Cookbook: 2nd Edition</i>, <i>Fear, Truth, Writing: From Paper Village to Electronic Community</i>, and <i>Sexual Investigations</i> all mention me. Mostly just by way of brief acknowledgments or citations of a single paper; I'm certainly not claiming that any of those are significantly about me.</dd>

<dd>The basic "Google test" shows about 85k hits on my name, about 95% are to me rather than someone else sharing my name. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 05:14, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Google Scholar turns up some half-dozen hits (admittedly in IBM publications) so I don't feel it's <i>total</i> vanity although it is somewhat self-promotional. I too am disturbed by the edit pattern, but it did fairly clearly survive the previous Afd and the request there by <i>Smoddy (Rabbit and pork)</i>that <i>Lulu</i> not edit the page further can hardly be taken as binding. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 16:26, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is just absurd (again). Yeah I'm the guy the article is about, and I've done a number of <i>small</i> edits on it, but the substantial content was written by our fine admin SlimVirgin (and contributions by other top-notch editors). But either way, "David Mertz" is both meaningfully discussed in a bunch of Wikipedia articles (on computer programming-ish topics), and read by hundreds of thousands of readers (a magnitude more than watch the minor porn actors with articles, or ever attended some high school with an article). I mean, 85,700 google results on "David Mertz" isn't an accident (about 95% are the right david mertz). Nor is the high Alexa rating on the site gnosis.cx where my articles get archived. Contrary to my "sworn enemy" Jguk, my contributions to Wikipedia are completely non-notable in this article, and that's why they are not mentioned. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 17:08, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just the fact that you're so dedicated to making sure the article stays seems to justify my claim that its for vanity. I have a degree in history...does that mean I should list myself amongst the most notable 20th century historians and create an article about myself...no! You just don't seem significant enough to warrant having your own article. The very idea that you edit it and keep editing it to me indicates its just for self promotion.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Although this may sound fan-boyish and David has pointed the AfD request out to me, but I do find David Mertz to be notable, especially in programmer circles (3 hits on Slashdot on his name is notable in my book).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have no reason to doubt that this AfD was brought in good faith. However, while I had personally never heard of David Mertz, there is sufficient evidence of notability, through google searches, and online bookshop searches, etc. His book "usually ships within 24 hours" at Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk. (The more obscure titles have "usually ships within two months, but may not be available at all".) The book seems to be popular and to sell well. Obviously, it was against Wikipedia policy for Lulu to have started the article, but he explained in the first AfD that he was unaware of that policy at the time.

Another one today, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_map_symbols.html" title="Japanese map symbols">Japanese map symbols</a>, was not on Japanese wikipedia either, it was a red link on one of their pages, and I translated that into Japanese (it's since been heavily added to by another editor). If you'll look on my user page under "Japanese Wikipedia" you'll find two more examples of articles about Japanese language which didn't exist there until I translated them. As a matter of fact, several of the articles on Japanese language here in the English wikipedia are a lot more comprehensive than theirs. So, it seems, strange but true, Japanese Wikipedia is not yet the fount of all human knowledge. But anyway, thankyou for your comments. --DannyWilde 06:08, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why look, THAT article is up for deletion also.

<li>I'm very sorry, but which article are you referring to? I have just checked the Japanese version of kyabetsu taro, the Japanese map symbols article, and the English map symbols article, and none of them have notices saying they are being put up for deletion. Is there something I'm not aware of? --DannyWilde 02:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Without putting words in DannyWilde's mouth, I think the point he was making is that using the presence of an article in the Japanese Wikipedia as a litmus test for cultural validity in Japan is not foolproof. Otherwise, we have to say that <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> is not culturally significant in Japan, since it doesn't have a page of its own in Japanese (but it does in several other languages -- are you planning an AFD for those too?). In Japanese, it is relegated to a catalog list of other pokemon characters <a href="../../../../ja/%E3%83%9D/%E3%82%B1/%E3%83%A2/%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7.html" class="extiw" title="ja:ポケモン一覧">ja:ポケモン一覧</a> from a redirect. I'm not against merging the snack foods in a similar way (or, the plethora of pokeon characters that populate the en wikipedia), but I am against deleting an article with &gt;30k google hits. - <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 08:19, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, exactly. For example, "<a href="../../../e/d/o/Edomoji.html" title="Edomoji">edomoji</a>", a type of Japanese lettering used in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo.html" title="Sumo">sumo</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabuki.html" title="Kabuki">kabuki</a>, and other Japanese arts like <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rakugo.html" title="Rakugo">rakugo</a>, was not in the Japanese wikipedia until I translated it. There were just some red links. <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edomoji.html" title="Edomoji">Edomoji</a> are undoubtedly culturally significant by any standards, and they just weren't there at all. Absolutely nothing existed in the Japanese wikipedia until I made that article. Whether it's in the Japanese wikipedia or not means nothing, really, since there is no guarantee that the Japanese wikipedia is comprehensive. I suppose Dforest would suggest deleting the edomoji article from the English wikipedia too, if he can't find enough links about edomoji in English on Google. --DannyWilde 02:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As a matter of fact it was my poor attempt at humour. I'm sorry you don't like the article and feel it is not useful to you, but I think that this information could be useful for other people. It would be a shame if the information were deleted, I think. It could be merged into a larger article, perhaps, but I don't see what harm it is doing as a small article in its own right. Quite often, merged articles end up being rather unreadable and unfocused. Take a look at <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_of_the_Apes_683c.html" title="Planet of the Apes">Planet of the Apes</a>, where the article tries to extensively describe a novel and a rather different film in the same page, with rather poor consequences for readability and focus. As for significance, Wikipedia contains things like individual articles for every single episode of the Simpsons cartoons, individual articles on particular trees, and individual articles on streets and roads in cities. I don't see why it can't tolerate a few dozen articles on the snack foods eaten by a country with a population of 120 million people. Most of the Japanese snacks don't have particularly much in common with each other anyway. The <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagashi.html" title="Wagashi">wagashi</a> article already deals with traditional Japanese sweets, and then there are individual pages for most of the wagashi anyway. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japanese_snack_food_74e0.html" title="List of Japanese snack food">List of Japanese snack foods</a> could be extended into a longer article if there is some common point in all of these snacks which needs to be dealt with together I suppose. Anyway I say to people who are interested in doing that, why not go and edit the relevant pages, instead of discussing doing it here? Actions speak louder etc. --DannyWilde 02:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable snack food - sold EVERYWHERE in Japan. Is a children's snack, only known in Japan, hardly surprising that it doesn't show up on English Google. Actually, astonishingly famous - try asking any Japanese person about it. Should not be deleted any more than <a href="../../../m/o/m/Momoe_Yamaguchi_f416.html" title="Momoe Yamaguchi">Momoe Yamaguchi</a> should be - if you haven't heard of Momoe, it is hardly surprising. If you can find a single Japanese person who HASN'T heard of her - even more astonishing. Same goes for "cabbage taro". --DannyWilde 22:15, 9 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue is whether it is notable enough to have its own article in the English Wikipedia. Regardless if they are popular, are all snack foods inherently notable? The absence of English Google stats is relevant here. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 09:43, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>So what you're arguing is that if it doesn't already appear in English, it isn't worth mentioning about. --DannyWilde 10:24, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What I am arguing is that it is a regional snack food that is rarely exported outside Japan. Searching Google in English (or <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romaji.html" title="Romaji">romaji</a>) seems to be a good way to judge international interest in the food, which in this case appears to be virtually non-existent. I don't think all regional snack foods deserve their own articles, or we would have thousands of stubs on Japanese snack foods alone. Even in Japanese, I don't think an article on <i>Kyabetsu Taro</i> has much potential for being more than a stub. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 00:45, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>"Cheez-it" returns 80,000 Google hits and "Kyabetsu Taro" returns <b>9</b>, none of which refer directly to the food. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 09:55, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> character on hit show. Looking at the edit history, it appears the original speedy tag (nn real person), and the AFD nom (who tagged it as a "us-bio-stub"), were both based on the assumption this was a real person, who's job as "lieutenant" didn't make them notable. Since, it's a fictional character on a hit show, it probably qualifies for an article, although, it needs work. While I want a keep, I would be ok with a *temporary* re-dir to the show while the article is brought up to better standards (if it's not fixed by the end of the AFD) --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 11:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The current deputy defense minister is Ward Elcock, not Luke Swenson.</li>
<li>The article indicates that Luke Swenson flew the majority of his missions in stealth bombers. Canada has none.</li>

<li>"The Prime Minister felt that having a CSIS director of Scandinavian descent would have two benefits: firstly, a Scandinavian clearly has a formidable resistance to the cold, and near invulnerability to anesthetics of all kinds; and secondly, would ease tensions with Denmark, thus allowing Canada to seize the near-gorgeous Hans Island without Danish or United Nations intervention."

<li><b>Strongly disagree with deletion</b> As far as I know, the article about the monkey controlling the robot was downloaded by far much more than any other article published in <a href="../../../p/l/o/PLoS_Biology_2bb8.html" title="PLoS Biology">PLoS Biology</a>. Thus, it contributed significantly to the journal's acceptance and popularity not to mention the impact on the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain-computer_interface.html" title="Brain-computer interface">brain-computer interface</a> field. Instead of deleting articles from this list, I would suggest adding more. This way, the scope and impact of <a href="../../../p/l/o/PLoS_Biology_2bb8.html" title="PLoS Biology">PLoS Biology</a> will be more clear. <small>(Unsigned comment by 24.163.65.156 - <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">CB</a>)</small>

<li>The content is useful, 24.163; that's why I proposed a merge rather than delete.

<li><b>Comment</b>: there's a mystery here. There is at least one very well-known open source software package called OpenIT; its details are here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openit/" class="external autonumber" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openit/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. There is also OpenIT described here: <a href="http://openit.synthesyssolutions.com/drupal/taxonomy/term/1" class="external autonumber" title="http://openit.synthesyssolutions.com/drupal/taxonomy/term/1" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> which may be the same thing. Google search "OpenIT" gives 250,000 raw hits, but many are about other things, including a commercial s/w package "OpenIt". The article appears to refer to #1 or #2, but is badly written, perhaps by someone who does not understand it. The OpenIT described in #1 would, I think, be sufficiently notable and widely used and known to deserve an article. Can anyone in the field shed some light on this? <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 00:11, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's what I thought at first, so I began cleaning up the article. Then I realised this article had nothing to do with that. Also, I can't find any mention of OpenIT or OpenTracker in the context of Tiger (assuming we are talking about the MacOS), and <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenTracker_8c72.html" title="OpenTracker">OpenTracker</a> is generally a reference to the opensource versions of the BeOS tools (as in the Wikipedia article). Anyone who could write a better version is encouraged to, but until then it's not a great idea to have this page around. — <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestrosync_66c2.html" title="User:Maestrosync">mæstro</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaestrosync_903a.html" title="User talk:Maestrosync">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maestrosync_5c60.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maestrosync">c</a></sup>4 09:26, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

The commenter in question is the in-house "joker" of the community.

<li>Actually, it's very reasonable to assume all viewers of a web page have internet access (any dreams of mass paper distribution are not going to be realized). A wiki-article is to inform the reader, about the school. The location and web address are essential to do that. The phone number is not. Also, people are often viewing an old version of a wiki article, where the number could be expired (or vandalized), and we could be causing some poor person to be getting wrong numbers from around the world, with no way of stopping it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 13:23, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. What the heck is the bias against writers and academics.

<ul>
<li>The bias is not against writers and academics. We have large numbers of properly written articles about writers and academics that editors would not even consider nominating for deletion. The bias is against articles that tell us practically nothing of importance about the subject. I suggest a look at the state of this article at the time of nomination. For all that the article told readers, Garfinkel could have been just some random web logger. The way to avoid nomination for articles about book authors is to have at least the beginnings of a bibliography in the article (and indeed to mention that they are authors in the first place). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:22, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I guess. But I wouldn't put an article on AfD without at least a basic investigation of whether the subject itself was notable, even if the article failed to show it yet. A basic google test would show a huge number of hits for Garfinkel (myself, I knew well of him without even doing that; but sure some folks would not). But even for an area where I knew nothing, I wouldn't just assume the lack of current content meant lack of worthwhile possible content.

<li>They do the research because the articles on such subjects that come up for deletion generally <i>do</i> tell us about the subjects, unlike this one, and thus the initial question of who the article is even talking about, and thus a context for any Google searches, is firmly established. An article about a pornographic actress that told us as little about its subject as this one told us about Garfinkel (e.g. "Jane Doe is an actress who got a Ph.D. from Ohio State University in 2004.") would very probably receive the same treatment as this article did. Once again: The claim that there is bias against writers and academics has no basis in reality. The bias is against bad biography articles that say almost nothing of importance about their subjects. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:23, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It is certainly not a hoax, having been party to this game myself several times. However, I am not sure of the game's origins - I have only heard of it through one source, so to speak, so it may not be in the same class as 'Centurion' or '21' as a universal drinking game. From the person I first heard of it from, it could possibly have a military origin. Not quite sure how one would show that it is verifiable according to the Wikipedia definition, although I do have photographic evidence which would suggest it is...! I get the impression from Catergory:Drinking Games that this category could be used as a source for people to explore if they want to try a new drinking game. I am sure this is not the only game on this list that has just been made up by a group of friends, if Tommy does indeed fall under this banner. For this reason, I think it should stay. I note that some other pages in this category do not verify their content with explicit sources, but such is the nature of the subject matter. -- <a href="../../../r/m/b/User%7ERmbyoung_27a2.html" title="User:Rmbyoung">Rmbyoung</a> 00:02, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Universidad de Corinthian is one of two clubs that partake in the Albany Cup. The Cup is noted on a national level due to its eclectic mix of players. Many involved are artists, writers, succesful business people or part of the fringe scene in Ireland (even a body builder).
