<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-08_67d2.html" title="Edit section: i wireless">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../i/_/w/I_wireless.html" title="I wireless">i wireless</a></span></h2>
<p>i wireless is a mobile phone operator based out of <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> that offers 1900MHz <a href="../../../g/s/m/GSM_920e.html" title="GSM">GSM</a> phone service with both <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prepaid.html" title="Prepaid">prepaid</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract.html" title="Contract">contract</a> options to the majority of Eastern <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> with a large <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural.html" title="Rural">rural</a> coverage area. Coverage is also offered in small portions of Northwestern <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, Southwestern <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, Southeastern <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Dakota_9b0f.html" title="South Dakota">South Dakota</a>, and future coverage in Northern <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>.</p>
<p>i wireless was previously known as Iowa Wireless and is a <a href="../../../t/-/m/T-Mobile_efa9.html" title="T-Mobile">T-Mobile</a> affiliate. T-Mobile users roam on i wireless while in the Eastern Iowa area. While outside the local coverage area, roaming is more than likely accomplished via the T-Mobile <a href="../../../g/s/m/GSM_920e.html" title="GSM">GSM</a> network.</p>
<p>Contract options are typical of smaller providers with Local, Nationwide no-roaming, and shared plans.</p>
<p>An unusual plan offered by i wireless is a service called Megatalk, which offers unlimited local incoming and ougoing calls with unlimited incoming text messages, basic voicemail, caller ID, call waiting/hold in both contract and prepaid options. It is often used to replace land-line phone service at home.</p>
<p>Contract is offered in 3 varieties: •Unlimited Eastern Iowa local calling •Unlimited Eastern Iowa and Des Moines area calling •Unlimited Eastern Iowa, Des Moines area, and 100 free minutes of long distance and roaming.</p>
<p>Billed (contract) Megatalk can roam off the i wireless network and can also make long distance calls, at an additional fee on all but the most expensive plan, which offers 100 free minutes of each.</p>
<p>Unlimited Prepaid cards are available in 8 varieties: •7 Days •7 Days with Des Moines Area •15 Days •15 Days with Des Moines Area •30 Days •30 Days with Des Moines Area •60 Days •60 Days with Des Moines Area</p>
<p>Prepaid Megatalk can not roam off the i wireless network (will show "No Service" on handset), and can not make long distance calls, but retains the unlimited local calling feature for the time duration of the prepaid card purchased. Prepaid cards are purchased at kiosks inside select retailers, i wireless stores, i wireless website via <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_card.html" title="Credit card">credit card</a>, or by entering a special <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertical_Service_Code_f853.html" title="Vertical Service Code">Vertical Service Code</a> and your credit card number into the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handset.html" title="Handset">handset</a>.</p>
<p>Since i wireless is a <a href="../../../g/s/m/GSM_920e.html" title="GSM">GSM</a> provider, a <a href="../../../s/i/m/SIM_2629.html" title="SIM">SIM</a> card is used that holds all the network information. This means you may purchase the starter kit and upgrade the phone at will with unlocked phones purchased elsewhere, just by swapping the existing SIM card into the new phone.</p>

<p><b>Frogger (1997)</b> is the successor of the classic <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcade.html" title="Arcade">arcade</a> game, <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frogger.html" title="Frogger">Frogger</a> , that was released on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. The player's objectives are to run arround the map, avoid the various obstacles, and search out the five small frogs, a red one, a blue one, a green one, an orange one, and a violet one, in a certain amount of time. These small frogs are his children. The player begins with five lives. Every obstacle, whether it be a car or a bee, kills the frog with the smallest touch, the frog has no health meter. If a player dies, they return to the starting point of the level.</p>

<p>Sun in Aries – The Beginning of a New Astrological Year</p>
<p><br />
When the sun enters the astrological sign of Aries, each year, at the vernal equinox, it brings with it new excitement and the promise of new beginnings. When the sun is in Aries, we can expect to experience a lot of action, in our lives.</p>
<p>It is spring! We feel a surge of energy as we clear away the dark and dusty cobwebs of winter, and welcome the bright days of spring. With cheerful anticipation, we cast aside Piscean contemplation, for the thrill of adventure, heralded by Aries.</p>
<p>A cardinal sign and the very first sign of the zodiac, Aries represents beginnings. People born under this sign are often assertive and spontaneous. Being first means being bold, something which comes easily to brave Aries.</p>
<p>A fire sign, Aries is assertive and dynamic. Aries loves to be in the center of the action and is often the initiator of games at parties. He doesn’t crave attention, but often gets it because of his winning personality. Everyone seems to want to be around powerful, sexy Aries.</p>
<p>The planet Mars, which rules Aries, is named for the ancient Roman god of War. Interestingly, the Greek counterpart to Mars is named Ares, strikingly similar in name and disposition to Aries. Known for his penchant for conflict, the ancient war god was charismatic and ingenious in the ways he persuaded people to do his bidding.</p>
<p>Like the bold warrior god, Aries is active and ambitious. Forever interested in conquering new territory and acquiring more of everything, Aries seems to run around the clock, non-stop, never tiring or showing a hint of slowing.</p>
<p>Embodying the dynamic qualities of the ancient war god, Aries is a natural leader. He is well liked among his circle of friends, which tends to be rather large. Often in a position of power, Aries comes across as a non-threatening and fun, while still possessing, a take charge attitude. You definitely get the sense that Aries is looking out for his people, yet to him this does not seem to be a burden.</p>
<p>While the sun is moving through the sign of Aries, we can expect the qualities of Aries to be dominant in ourselves and our lives. We are likely to be more active, to initiate new projects, and to be more spontaneous. Enjoy the powerful feeling of dynamic strength and ambition while the sun is in Aries.</p>

<p>Chester Bennington vs. Julien-K is a Norwegian Punk Rock band who made its first musical appearance in Denmark. After Graduating from Colorado State, the unemployed lead singer, Benjamin Zimiger, started a small garage band for fun. Seeing their potential success, he signed them up for the Emily Flickr Band Contest. Their Band of Benjamin Zimiger-lead singer/guitar, Joshua Flint-Base, Al Gervan- Drums, and Erik Sanders-keyboard won the competition in 1999. Ever since then, they have remained together in the field of music. Originally titled the Comp Stomps, the band played at small concerts. It was not until their new lead singer, Chester Bennington, joined that they became known as the Chester Bennington vs. Julien-K. Popular in Europe, they made their initial tour through out Denmark. Soon after, their music became popular through-out Europe. Recent albums include Starlight(2004), Death Reaves(2005), and Angel Invitation(2006). One of their most famous songs is Morning After, which appeared in the 2006 film, Underworld Evolution.</p>

<p>The expression "black and blue" has been used in songs and as album titles by several bands like The Rolling Stones, The Foo Fighters and the Backstreet Boys for example. It is an idiom that means being badly bruised. Although black seldomly is the color of a bruise it is the color used in this expression.</p>
<p>This expression can be found in different languages. In Swedish the expression would be, "att bli slagen gul och blå" (to be beaten yellow and blue). Interestingly enough in Swedish the colour black has been replaced with yellow. It might have something to do with pronounciation.</p>

<p><b>Bone Exercise Monitor</b> is a physical activity monitor which allows its user to measure and assess the bone strengthening effect of her exercise or physical activity i.e. bone exercise. The Bone Exercise Monitor was invented and patented by a Finnish sports technology company, Newtest Oy, located in <a href="../../../o/u/l/Oulu.html" title="Oulu">Oulu</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone.html" title="Bone">bone</a> strenthening quality of a physical activity is a very difficult task to measure and assess during the activity. Most types of physical activities or exercise has bone strengthening qualities but they tend vary very much in their capability of increasing the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_mineral_density.html" title="Bone mineral density">bone mineral density</a> (BMD) and bone mass. Therefore, a measurement method and a device used to measure this phenomenom was designed.</p>
<p>The Bone Exercise Monitor is worn on the hip and it measures the acceleration and deceleration forces also known as G- forces acting on the body during the physical activity and its specially developed measurement and analysis algorithm analyses the data and corresponds it into understandable format by showing how many percent of required daily (and weekly) bone strengthening physical activity has been done. This may help the user in targeting her physical activity and exercise to build stronger bones and to prevent <a href="../../../o/s/t/Osteoporosis.html" title="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a>.</p>

<p>A pocket is a small bag, particularly a bag-like receptacle either fastened to or inserted in an article of clothing. It is really useful when you need to carry something small with you.</p>
<p>Pocket sizes can vary to very small non functional pockets or to huge cargo pockets. There are also a large variety of pockets for example: inseam pockets, hip yoke pockets, patch pockets and the most popular pocket these days, cargo pockets.</p>
<p><br />
• Hip yoke pocket</p>
<p><br />
Everyone still expects to see pockets only on trousers but pockets are appearing everywhere. From the smallest article of clothing to accessories like bags and scarves.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>• Pockets in the 18th Century</p>
<p><br />
Bags and purses were not very popular during the 18th Century since the clothes of both men and women had ample pockets. The distinctive feature about women’s pockets in the 18th Century is that they were not sewn into the garment but hung from the waist under the side hoops and were reached through small slits in the skirt. Pockets could be worn singly or in pairs. Some were very decorative, embellished with embroidery and ribbons. Others were quite plain. No mobile phones, car keys, credit cards or palm pilots in the 18th century!Nevertheless, women kept a wide variety of objects in their pockets. In the days when people often shared bedrooms and household furniture, a pocket was sometimes the only private, safe place for small personal possessions. Pockets have come a long way in history. One year they in fashion the next they not, but one thing for certain they will never fade!</p>

<p><i><b>Aggressive Inline Skating</b></i> is a sport, of which a video game (Aggressive Inline) is based on. The sport is also known as 'Rollerblading' 'Aggressive Inline Skating', 'Blading' - and in slang, one would say 'Lets go for a skate' -meaning Rollerblading (not skate-boarding).</p>
<p>Aggressive Inline skaters perform tricks by using specialized skates (or Rollerblades) -or (blades), which have bits built into them (the sides are extended)- using pieces of plastic or perhaps metal -called 'Grinding Plates' and in the middle of the skate - inbetween the middle two wheels there is a piece of plastic or metal which is called an 'H-Block'. Grinding Plates and H-blocks are used to slide down metal poles, or across surfaces which are slippery - usually due to wax (like candle wax).</p>
<p>The skates usually have 8 wheels, and a lot of the time the middle wheels are smaller than front and back wheels (known as an Anti-Rocker Setup- allowing for the skater to grind more easily on the H-Blocks. Inside the wheels are cylinder shaped 'bearings' -which give the skater speed. Bearings are usually measured to a standard known as Abec - and the higher the number, the better the bearings.</p>
<p>Inliners or 'skaters' perform tricks at 'skateparks' - places where there are ramps and poles (rails) etc, on Halfpipes - as the name suggests it looks very much like a pipe chopped in half, with a pole on the top for grinding, and the other place you might find a Inliner is on the street, jumping off roof-tops, jumping down stairs, sliding down hand-rails etc.</p>
<p>Tricks performed involve spins (horizontally and vertically-'flips'), and sliding along surfaces using their skates. Grinding involves sliding across a surface, and varying the position of your feet, and the slope that they might be on. Spins may be incorporated into grinds - before you grind, and after, to make the trick harder.</p>

<p>Marker In The Sand is the fifth track off Pearl Jam's new self-titled album "Pearl Jam". Many fans have described it as one of the best works of Pearl Jam and especially its lead guitarist who composed the song; Mike McCready. The song is a war-protest song and desbribes the two "worlds" fighting eachother, but "God is nowhere to be found, conviniently". Eddie Vedder, the lead vocalist in Pearl Jam wrote the lyrics to Marker In The Sand, a real rocker of 4:23 minutes. Marker In The Sand seems also to be a favourite song inside the band as it has been played live at most concerts on their US Tour Leg 1 (2006).</p>

<p>Double Block and Bleed isolation, aka DB &amp; B or DBB, is an intermediate level of isolation used in the process and chemical industries. It is above Single Block or Single Block and Bleed, but below positive isolation. Depending on the fluids involved it is often insuffient in itself as isolation for vessel entry or hot work (i.e. welding) for which positive isolation must be used (particularly in the oil &amp; gas industry).</p>
<p>Double Block and Bleed consists of three valves, the two blocks and a bleed. The upstream block valve prevents the process fluid from passing across the isolation. The downstream block valve ensures that any leakage (in any valve a small measure of leakage is inevitable no matter how well maintained or designed) through the 1st valve is prevented from reaching the downstream system. The bleed can be used to remove any fluid trapped between the blocks. It also is used to test for leakage (to see if the upstream valve is passing fluid) and/ or to drain any fluids that have passed away from the isolation.</p>
<p>Double Block and Bleed isolation is typically used on systems containing hazardous fluids (i.e. hydrocarbons) or high pressure systems. Many Double Block and Bleed isolations (i.e. isolation on a drain for a large vessel) will contain between the two valves a spectacle blind or spacer, allowing positive isolation to be achieved once the Double Block and Bleed is closed.</p>
<p>Typically ball or gate valves are used for this role, with a blind flange on the end on the bleed to prevent leakage. It is also possible to use integrated valves which can act as DB &amp; B’s, which save weight and space.</p>

<p>Τα δεκαπέντε του χρόνια στην Β Εθνική μέχρι στιγμής σε συνδυασμό με την μαχητικότητά του απέναντι στις μεγάλες ομάδες της χώρας, έχουν καταξιώσει τον Α.Σ. Λαμία στις καρδιέςτων φιλάθλων της Φθιώτιδας και όχι μόνο.</p>
<p>Την 1η Ιουνίου του 1964, όταν τελικά οι εκπρόσωποι των Φθιωτικών συλλόγων αποφάσισαν να "χαράξουν" μια κοινή πορεία, ιδρύθηκε και η μεγαλύτερη και δημοφιλέστερη ομάδα της Λαμίας. Βέβαια, για να φτάσουν στην τελική απόφαση, χρειάστηκε να περάσει πολλής καιρός και ατελείωτες ώρες διαπραγματεύσεων. Η "βασίλισσα της Φθιώτιδας", όπως αποκαλείται, προέρχεται από την συγχώνευση του Λαμιακού και της Παλλαμαϊκής.</p>
<p>Όλα ξεκίνησαν το 1961, όταν η ΕΠΟ αποφάσισε ότι από την επόμενη αγωνιστική περίοδο (1962-63) η Β Εθνική κατηγορία, στην οποία αγωνιζόταν τότε ο Ολυμπιακός Λαμίας, θα απαρίζεται από 60 ομάδες χωρισμένες σε τέσσερα γκρουπ και η πρωταθλήτρια από κάθε όμιλο θα έπαιρνε και την άνοδο στα "σαλόνια" της Α Εθνικής. Έτσι με την λήξη του πρωταθληματος της περιόδου 1961-62 σε γενική συνέλευση που πραγματοποίησαν τα μέλη του Ολυμπιακού Λαμίας (17/6/1962) αποφάσισαν να προτείνουν στην Παλλαμαϊκή την συγχώνευσή τους σε ένα καινούργιο σύλλογο με καινούργιο όνομα. Παρόλο που η απάντηση των "κιτρινόμαυρων" ήτανε καταφατική, η πρότασή τους η ομάδα να ονομαστεί Παλλαμαϊκή δεν έγινε δεκτή και έτσι ο "γάμος κατέληξε σε διαζύγιο".</p>
<p>Το ναυάγιο των διαπραγματεύσεων με την Παλλαμαική οδήγησε και πάλι σε γενική συνέλευση τα μέλη του Ολυμπιακού (24/7/1962), όπου αποφασίστηκε η συγχώνευση των "ερυθρολεύκων" με τον Παμφθιωτικό, με την ονομασία Λαμιακός. Έτσι ο Λαμιακός θα είναι η ομάδα που θα εκπροσωπήσει τον νομό στην Β Εθνική την περίοδο 1963-64. Ωστόσο την ίδια χρονιά, το εισιτήριο για την κατηγορία θα πάρει και η Παλλαμαϊκή ως πρωταθλήτρια της Γ Εθνικής, με αποτέλεσμα η Λαμία να εκροσωπήτε απο δύο συλλόγους στην κατηγορία. Αυτή λοιπόν ήταν και η κατάλληλη εποχή να δημιουργηθεί ένα σωματείο, το οποίο θα προερχόταν από την ένωση των μεγαλύτερων ομάδων της πόλης.</p>
<p>Στις 27/5/1964 λοιπόν με πρωτοβουλία του τότε δημάρχου της Λαμίας και των ποδοσαιρικών παραγόντων του νομού πραγματοποιήτε γενική συνέλευση, η οποία δεν ειχε το προσδωκόμενο αποτέλεσμα, αφού κατέληξε στην δημιουργια δύο νέων συλλόγων του Α.Σ. Λαμία και του Α.Σ. Θερμοπυλών. Πάντως, η ζωή του δεύτερου δεν ήταν και πολύ μεγάλη, καθώς δεν κράτησε παραπάνω από μία εβδομάδα και την 1η Ιουνίου του 1964 συγχωνεύτηκε με τον Α.Σ. Λαμία.</p>
<p>Αν και οι " κυανόλευκοι" έχουν φτάσει έξι φορές κοντά στην Α Εθνική, δεν έχουν καταφέρει ποτέ να πάρουν την άνοδο στην πρώτη κατηγορία. Παρόλα αυτά η πορεία του όλα αυτά τα χρόνια σε συνδυασμό με τις μεγάλες εμφανίσεις κόντρα στα μεγαθήρια του Ελληνικού ποδοσφαίρου στο θεσμό του κυπέλλου (2-1 και 1-0 με την ΑΕΚ στο ΔΑΚ Λαμίας και 1-0 με τον Παναθηναϊκό στην Λεοφόρο, με το τέρμα των "πρασίνων" να σημειώνεται στο 91') έχουν κάνει τον Α.Σ. Λαμία την ισχυρότερη και μεγαλύτερη ομάδα του νομού, με τους φανατικότερους οπαδούς.</p>

<p>Ο Α.Σ. Λαμία είναι μια από τις πιο δημοφιλής ομάδες της Στερεάς Ελλάδας και η πιο διάδημη της Φθιώτιδας. Χαρακτηριστικό είναι ότι, φίλαθλοι του συλλόγου υπάρχουν όχι μόνο στην Λαμία και τις τριγύρω πόλεις, αλλά και στην Χαλκίδα, στην Κρήτη, την Θεσσαλονίκη και την Αθήνα.</p>
<p>Την δεκαετία του 1970 μέχρι τις αρχές του 80', όπου οι "Ρουμελιώτες" αγωνίζονταν στην Β Εθνική, η παρουσία του κόσμου ήταν συγκλονιστική, αφού η έδρα της ομάδας, το ΔΑΚ Λαμίας ήταν κάθε Σαββατοκύριακο κατάμεστο. Ωστόσο, η παρακμή των "κυανόλευκων" την δεκαετία του 1990 είχε ως αποτέλεσμα την απουσία του κόσμου. Παρόλα αυτά, το 2004 η συμβολή των "πιστών" της ομάδας ήταν αυτή που "έσπρωξε" τον σύλλογο στην άνοδο στην Γ Εθνική. Μάλιστα, την επόμενη αγωνιστική περίοδο, ο Α.Σ. Λαμία είχε των μεγαλύτερο μέσο όρων εισητηρίων στην τρίτη κατηγορία, περίπου 1500 ανά αγώνα.</p>

<p>Έδρα του Α.Σ Λαμία είναι το ΔΑΚ Λαμίας. Η χωρητικότητα του γηπέδου είναι 7500 θέσεις, όλες καθιστές. Το ρεκόρ προσέλευσης κρατάει από το 1985, όταν σε έναν αγώνα της Λαμίας με τα Τρίκαλα στο ΔΑΚ βρέθηκαν πάνω από 11000 φίλαθλοι.</p>
<p>Το γήπεδο χτίστηκε την δεκαετία του 1960 και πρόσφατα (το 2004) ανακατασκευάστηκε. Την αγωνιστική περίοδο 2003-04, λόγο της ανακατασκευής, η Λαμία χρησιμοποίησε ως έδρα το γήπεδο της Αγίας Μαρίνας, λίγα χιλιόμετρα έξω από την πόλη, όπου μάλιστα στην φιέστα για την άνοδο στην Γ Εθνική βρέθηκαν 6000 φίλοι της ομάδας.</p>

This box: view • talk • edit A Salafi (Arabic سلفي referring to early Muslim), from the Arabic word Salaf سلف (literally meaning predecessors or early generations), is an adherent of a contemporary movement in Sunni Islam that is sometimes called Salafism and sometimes identified with Wahhabism. Salafis themselves insist that their beliefs are simply pure Islam as practiced by the first three generations of Muslims and that they should not be regarded as a sect. Saudi Arabian Salafis do not like to be called Wahhabis, although this name was acceptable in the past.</p>
<p>The word Salaf means predecessors (or ancestors) and refers to the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (the Sahaba), the early Muslims who followed them, and the scholars of the first three generations of Muslims. They are also called Al-Salaf Al-Salih or "the Righteous Predecessors".</p>
<p>The Salafis view the first three generations of Muslims, who are the prophet Muhammad's companions, and the two succeeding generations after them, the Taba'een and the taba Tabe'een as perfect examples of how Islam should be practiced in everyday life. These three generations are often referred to as the pious generations. This principle of law is derived from the following hadith (tradition) said to have been spoken by Muhammad: "The best of people is my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them (i.e. the first three generations of Muslims)." (Bukhari 3:48:819 and 820 [1] and Muslim 31:6150 and 6151 [2].</p>
<p>One tenet of Salafism is that Islam was perfect and complete at the days of Muhammad and his Sahaba, but that much undesirable "innovation" (bid`a) was added to Islam afterwards. Salafism seeks to revive the original practice of Islam [3].</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>[edit] Distinctive beliefs and practices Salafis claim to preach a purified Islamic monotheism, or tawhid. Salafis believe that widespread Muslim practices such as venerating the graves of Islamic prophets and saints are wrong. Photographs of any living being that possesses a soul are forbidden. Celebration of Muhammad's birthday (Mawlid) is discouraged. All these practices are considered shirk (a comprehensive term which is commonly translated as polytheism), or as bidah (innovation). Salafis in general are opposed to both Sufism and Shi'a Islam, which they regard as deviations.</p>
<p>Salafis reject mainstream dogmatic theology (kalam). They consider this to be based on classical Greek philosophy (Plato and Aristotle) and an import foreign to the original practice of Islam.</p>
<p>Salafis are divided on the question of adherence to the four recognized schools of traditional legal interpretation (madhabs).</p>
<p>Some Salafis wish to base their jurisprudence directly on the Quran and Sunnah. They believe that literal readings of the Qur'an and the hadith (or oral traditions), are sufficient guidance for the believing Muslim. They thus reject the madhabs. One scholar who supported this position was Albaanee. Some Salafis follow the teachings of the 14th century Syrian scholar Ibn Taymiya, and his students Ibn al-Qayyim and Ibn Kathir. Some Salafis rely on the jurisprudence of one of the four famous madhabs. For example, Ibn Taymiya followed the Hanbali madhhab. Some of his students (such as Ibn Kathir and Al-Dhahabi) followed the Shafi madhhab. Other students (such as Ibn Abu al-Iz) follow the Hanafi madhhab. Because Salafis see themselves as practicing "pure" Islam, Salafi teachers and adherents will not necessarily identify themselves as Salafi. They can be identified as part of a particular current of contemporary Islam by their characteristic beliefs, by their use of terms like "the Salaf" or "Qur'an and sunnah." They also tend to use a specific style of transliteration of Arabic into English: long vowels are indicated by doubling, emphatic consonants are doubled, and words that end with a ta marbuta in Arabic are rendered with a terminal h.</p>
<p>[edit] History of Salafism From the perspective of the Salafis themselves, their history starts with the Prophet himself. They consider themselves direct followers of his teachings, and wish to emulate the piety of the earliest followers of Islam (the salaf al-salih). All later scholars are merely revivers (not 'founders').</p>
<p>Historians who are not Salafis see them as a loose grouping of Muslims influenced by three movements with a complicated history.</p>
<p>The term Salafi was first used for an Islamic modernist movement of the 19th century, a movement associated with the writers Muhammad Abduh and Jamal al-Din al-Afghani. Both men believed that Muslim communities could resist the incursions of Western colonialism and the corroding influence of Western civilization if they returned to the pure Islamic values believed to be best displayed by the earliest Muslims. This involved rejection of centuries of tradition (including innovations like Sufism and saint worship) and a rethinking of how Islam should function in a modern world. Abduh in particular believed that a purified Islam would be democratic and progressive.</p>
<p>Abduh, an Egyptian, had a great deal of influence on thinkers in Egypt and north Africa. His student Rashid Rida published an influential journal Al-Manar. Hasan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, is said to have been influenced by the ideas of Abduh and Rida. Al-Banna was influenced by another movement as well, the Wahhabism of neighboring Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The Wahhabis, or, as they called themselves, the Ikhwan, or Brethren, followed the 18th-century teacher Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, of Nejd in Arabia. They were instrumental in the rise of the House of Saud to power. Al-Wahhab himself professed to be simply reviving the teachings of the 14th century Syrian scholar Ibn Taymiya.</p>
<p>Both Abduh and al-Wahhab had advised Muslims to return to the source directly, and to jettison centuries of popular Islamic practices. Abduh, however, had limited his activities to writing and speaking; al-Wahhab had participated in the formation of a state that enforced his principles. Al-Banna combined these two approaches by creating an organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, that organized within an existing state with the hope of eventually capturing the state, as in Saudi Arabia, and recreating the Muslim utopia of 7th century Medina.</p>
<p>The members of the Muslim Brotherhood devoted themselves to missionary and social service activities, building clinics and schools to serve poor Muslims. They were quite successful at first, and spread to many other countries in the Middle East, as well as inspiring student groups throughout the world. However, the involvement of the Brotherhood in an attempt to overthrow the Egyptian government resulted in the suppression of the Brotherhood in Egypt and then in many other countries.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia gave sanctuary to many members of the Brotherhood who had been exiled, or fled persecution, and a further mingling of Wahhabi and Salafi ideas and practices followed. Saudi Arabian Muslims who were unhappy with Saudi government policies (seen as being increasingly worldly and non-Muslim) tended to explicitly define themselves as Salafis. However, even pro-government clerics and laity started to adopt the term Salafi, when pressed to describe themselves, in preference to the terms Ikhwan or Wahhabi. In 1980, the Saudi King Fahd stated: "We are not Wahhabis; we are Salafis." [4] The mingling of the Wahhabi and Salafi strains of Sunni Islam was further accelerated by the Saudi attempt to "Wahhabize" or "Salafize" the rest of the Islamic world. Saudi money funded clerical training (in Saudi Arabia), mosques in many parts of the world, printing, websites, and other missionary activities.</p>
<p>Contemporary Salafis do not acknowledge any indebtedness to Abduh and al-Afghani. If they are willing to concede any historicity at all to their movement (and many do not believe that it has a history, being merely "pure" Islam), they would trace the Salafi revival to the Muslim Brotherhood or the Wahhabis -- or to some teachers in those movements, but not all.</p>
<p>[edit] Contemporary Salafis Salafism is a movement within Sunni Islam. It includes many groups and shades of belief. It is strongest in the Middle East, in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Syria, Jordan, etc. It is also found in most other Muslim-majority countries (see Islam by country and Demographics of Islam). It is increasingly important to diasporic Muslims in Europe, Canada, and the United States.</p>
<p>Salafis tend to differentiate themselves not so much by matters of Islamic practice, such as prescriptions for prayer (salat) or Islamic dress (hijab), but by their attitude towards the state.</p>
<p>Some Salafis urge believers to support or endure the state under which they live. Believers are encouraged to spread Salafism non-violently, by missionary activity, social work, and political organization. Above all, they should help each other lead lives of true Islamic piety. (Rabei Al-Madkhaly) Some Salafis believe that violent jihad is permissible against foreign, non-Muslim, occupation, but not against governments that claim to be Islamic. Those governments are to be reformed, not violently overthrown. Civil war (fitna) is to be avoided. (Salman Al-Auda) Other Salafis believe that it is permissible, even required, for believers to engage in violent jihad to overthrow oppressive regimes, even if they claim to be Islamic. One of the strongest proponents for violence was Sayyed Qutb, an Egyptian member of the Muslim Brotherhood. After the Egyptian Brotherhood assassinated the Egyptian leader, the Brotherhood was suppressed and Qutb went to jail. There he wrote a long treatise on political Islam called Milestones. This book was and is widely read, and has had a strong influence on various Islamist or jihadi movements. Hence these Muslims are sometimes called Qutbis. They are often linked with terrorism. The teacher Abdullah Azzam is also said to be a proponent of violent jihad. The non-violent Salafis insist that the violent groups are not really Salafis. Those who believe that violence is necessary see the non-violent Salafis as refusing their full responsibility as Muslims.</p>
<p>[edit] Saudi Arabia Some Salafis support the government; others distance themselves from it, or oppose it.</p>
<p>Prominent pro-government Saudi scholars include Ibn Baz (now deceased), Ibn Humaid, Rabi' al-Madkhali, and Ibn Uthaymeen.</p>
<p>Some Salafis believe that the Saudi government has strayed from true Islamic purity and is to be opposed, albeit non-violently. One such prominent Salafi is the scholar Safar Al-Hawali.</p>
<p>Some Salafis believe that most majority-Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, have strayed and that the only answer to the plight of Muslims today is violent jihad. Osama bin Laden is a prominent example of a Salafi Saudi Muslim who has gone from supporting the Saudi regime to violently opposing it.</p>

<p>The Contest started on Monday April 3rd and the end date is Friday September 1 (duration is approx 5 months). There are no restrictions on contesting except a few rules.</p>
<p>1. Who can rank the highest for a brand new domain for a keyword phrase "retsambew dash klat for Charity" in Google (the complete keyword phrase would yeild 0 results at the beginning of the contest).</p>
<p><br />
<b>Conditions:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You must use a brand new domain name. The registration date of the domain used must be on or after the announcement date of the contest 4/3/2006</li>
<li>No remotely hosted blog domains allowed (i.e. keyword.blogspot.com) Using a Blog is fine. You just can't use a remotely hosted blog subdomain (which would not follow the no subdomain rule anyway).</li>
<li>No Subdomains Allowed in any form.</li>
<li>The contest keywords can not be used in the domain (with dashes or without any dashes) (subpages with the keyword is fine).</li>
<li>The winning page must link to a Charity of your choice from this page on Give.org. (you must use a text link or logo with link that has at minimum the charity name).</li>
</ul>
<p>The last condition is perhaps the strangest atleast among most SEO contests. Most require a link to the site hosting the contest while Webmaster-Talk only requires a link to a charity. In this way many sites are supporting charities through this contest.</p>
<p><i>Why a Charity? This contest is going to be different. Because of our unique set of contest conditions, this contest will not only be entertaining but also a contest in which I feel we will be able to learn more from the results. Lets not only make it entertaining and educating but lets also give something back to others who need it. By participating or telling others about the Webmaster-Talk.com SEO Contest you will be supporting a good cause by giving exposure or urging others to donate to your favorite charity (the link is the only "requirement").</i> <i>- Tim Schroeder</i></p>

<p>Timothy 'Middies' Munroe is one of Australias most notorious murderers. In a spate of killings that lasted from dec 2004 - jun 2006, he is responsible for the brutal murders of 11 Perth residents. Starting with a young asian boy who was viciously starngled to death and ending with his long time obssesion Hayley. Middies has been known to kidnap, torture and rape his victims before killing them, favouring strangulation as his method. The reason he has been able to pick his victims so well is due to his charming demeanor allowing him to give them a false trust. He is very unstable and snaps at any given moment. Middies was brought to justice early june 2006 when he was shot and wounded by enigmatic police detective David Pope. Pope has now been given hero status though shys from media. He is described as a self made man. Police commisioner Asher had this to say, 'Has anyone got a bottle on em by any chance??'</p>

<p>Klear (pronounced Clear) is a nu metal rock band that hails from Niagara Falls, New York. Klear consists of Bruce Wojick (Guitar and Vocalist), Leo McDonald (Bass Guitar) and Denny Pelczynski (Drums and Vocals). Klear is currently on the Good Charamel Record label, which is a record label created by bassist Robby Takac of the Goo Goo Dolls.</p>
<p>The band took a slight hiatus during 2005, and has re-emerged in 2006 with a harder, yet still commercialized form of rock similiar to that of bands like Alter Bridge and Creed.</p>
<p>Joe Cafarella, singer and guitarist for Stemm (another Niagara Falls nu-metal band that has enjoyed limited yet marginal national succes), has recently joined the Klear. Cafarella is known for his dread-lock hair and large underground hardcore/nu-metal following. It is unknown if Cafarella's joining of Klear will affect Klear or Stemm, as both bands are very different in styles. Fans of nu-metal, such as the largly popular and underground style of Stemm, are often known to dislike commercialized rock such as Klear. It seems, however that the results have been positive for both bands.</p>
<p>The mis-spelling of the word "clear" is common in the nu-metal genre of rock. Another example is the band "Korn" which is "Corn" spelled with a "K" instead of "C".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-08_67d2.html" title="Edit section: Susan Getz">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Susan Getz</span></h2>
<p>A unique singer on the rise, with a captivating new CD</p>
<p>It's not often that a delightful new singer appears on our radar with a distinctive voice and assured grace already in place, but San Francisco vocalist Susan Getz is doing just that. From the first note she sings, it's clear that Susan has been listening to the greats, but there's no doubt that her sound is her own.</p>
<p>Now, with an ever-growing resume of appearances in major Bay Area music venues like the Plush Room, Shanghai 1930 and Café du Nord, and with her beautiful new CD, Jazz Boxx, in hand, Susan Getz stands ready to bring her wonderful, singular sound to a wider musical audience.</p>
<p>No less a jazz expert than famed producer Teo Macero said upon listening to Jazz Boxx, "It's nice to hear a new voice. Susan Getz is on the right path, with a charming sound and a different style. The concept, to be sure, is hers alone."</p>
<p>Susan sings with economy and a ready warmth, underscored by an ever-present yet controlled emotion. She stays close to the melody, generally eliminating flourishes and vocal adornments. Asked to describe her own style, Susan answers with a smile, "I try to sing like Ernest Hemingway writes. He doesn't put in a lot of extra words, but he's very descriptive. I think it was Miles Davis who said, 'Don't worry about playing a lot of notes. Just find one pretty one.' That's what I shoot for in my music."</p>
<p>It's no surprise that the vocalists she says have influenced her most-Chet Baker, Peggy Lee, Astrud Gilberto, Carmen McRae and Carlos Jobim-are all paragons of understatement and smoldering emotion. While all of these performers have made their mark on Susan, it's the Gilberto and Lee influences that seep out of her singing most clearly.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean Susan is afraid to take chances. She often approaches songs from unique directions, bringing fresh perspectives to timing and harmonies that allow her to illuminate surprising corners of long familiar favorites. She has a deft lyrical touch that lends her lovely originals a quiet empathy.</p>
<p>Susan also gives her sidemen plenty of room for creativity, encouraging counter-rhythms and inventive harmonies that add a creative depth and tension to Susan's performances. The proof is in the heartfelt efforts turned in on Jazz Boxx by pianist Leonard Thompson, bassist David Ewell, drummer Jemal Ramirez and trumpeter Joel Ryan, an ensemble of some of the Bay Area's finest instrumentalists.</p>
<p>Susan grew up in a musical household in Ohio. Her mother taught her the standards, and her first performing "gig" was as a five-year-old, standing on a table in the family garage, playing tambourine with her older brother's rock band. Her singing career started in 2000 when she began music lessons with jazz and cabaret legend Faith Winthrop and Bay Area piano great Dick Hindman.</p>
<p>With a firm grasp on her compositional and arranging skills, and her warm, strong voice, Susan Getz is poised for wonderful things, eager to share her unique sound and captivating, intimate style. As Susan puts it, "You know the kind of songs someone might be singing in your ear on the dance floor? That's the tone I like."</p>
<p>As Teo Macero requests, "Let's hear more from the silky voice of Susan Getz."</p>

<p>Born in Marblehead, Massachusets, Bob began his musical career in New York and Boston/Cambridge area coffeehouses and college concerts in the late 1960s, together with musicians including Paul Geremia, Bill Staines, Jaime Brockett, John Compton and many others. With resourceful and innovative stylings on guitar and mandolin, Bob performs an eclectic blend of original music drawing on many styles, including gospel, jazz, celtic, blues and traditional folk. His recently released CD of original instrumentals titled "Star of the Sea" on the Wandra Music label includes the electric version of “Transfiguration” featuring the slide guitar of the late Rod Price, founding member of the rock group, Foghat.</p>
<p>In addition to his solo career, he has shared the stage with Jorma Kaukonen, Bonnie Raitt, The Everly Brothers, Pentangle, Tim Hardin, John Prine, Neil Young, Buddy Miles, Taj Mahal, Dion, Leo Kottke, Livingston Taylor, Steve Goodman, Jay Leno, Jerry Jeff Walker, James Montgomery, among others. As a free-lance guitarist and mandolinist, he has performed on stage with Nanci Griffith, Larry Coryell, Mary Travers, Tommy Makem, James Montgomery, Tom and Harry Chapin (at Gerde’s Folk City in New York City), among others. He has appeared on recordings with Columbia artists Andy Pratt and John Compton of Appaloosa, Eugene Friesen of the Paul Winter Consort and Bill Staines. Quoting from the entertainment newspaper, Variety, of his performance at Gerde’s Folk City in New York, “. . . His work on six-string acoustic guitar stands out. ...McCarthy does one tune in ragtime style and as with the jazz material, seems unhampered by delivering solo stylings usually associated with combos.”</p>

<p>Healthy male role model monday is a celebration for all men who have children in their life. It is celebrated on 6-6 of each year regardless of wether it falls on a Monday. Men have unique skills and children without a father in their life have the opportunity to be exposed to those skills on role model monday. No matter what you choose to do with the children it should be something only men would do. Preferably something stupid under the guidance and supervision of at least one woman who knows first aid, to take pictures and fix wounds. The celebration is capped off with an event known far and wide as " The Cold, Cold Hand Challenge" Qualifing rounds eliminate all kids except one and all adults except one, these two do battle in the cooler of ice water until one quits, or their hand falls off. This is a test of both mental and physical strength because while the opponents face off the heckling commences. The winner of the challenge earns the right to call all the other players losers until the next year. They also recieve a travelling trophy which has yet to be made, but will once desinged and created will be prominently placed for all to see.</p>

<p>X9.37 is the standard format that establishes the file sequences, record types, and field formats for use in the electronic exchange of check MICR lines, associated check processing, and check images in the form of cash letters. It does not address operational, implementation, or settlement issues. It includes, but is not limited to: data and image compression, encryption, transmission specifications, and data representation.</p>
<p>The purpose of this standard is to provide a structure to facilitate the electronic exchange of check-related data and images for the purposes of forward presentment, return item notification, and returns. Part of this standard is a list of tests to ensure the quality and usability of check images.</p>
<p>Quality of images refers to how accurately the image compares to the original check. Potential problems are: missing fields, partial images, contrast and brightness issues, and excessive skew. Depending on the severity of the problem , any of these may cause an item to be rejected. Quality is very important because once a check is truncated, these electronic images are the only source of information about the transaction. Without usable images, transactions cannot be completed or proven in disputes.</p>
<p>X9.37 took effect October 28,2004.</p>
<p>X9.37 is alternatively known X9.100.180.</p>
<p>Companies who provide X9.37 solutions include DHIS, Invoke Technologies, and Mitek.</p>

<p>Rett syndrome is a childhood neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by normal early development followed by loss of purposeful use of the hands, distinctive hand movements, slowed brain and head growth, gait abnormalities, seizures, and mental retardation. It affects females almost exclusively.</p>
<p>The disorder was identified by Dr. Andreas Rett, an Austrian physician who first described it in a journal article in 1966. It was not until after a second article about the disorder was published in 1983 that the disorder was generally recognized.</p>
<p>The course of Rett syndrome, including the age of onset and the severity of symptoms, varies from child to child. Before the symptoms begin, however, the child appears to grow and develop normally. Then, gradually, mental and physical symptoms appear. Hypotonia (loss of muscle tone) is usually the first symptom. As the syndrome progresses, the child loses purposeful use of her hands and the ability to speak. Other early symptoms may include problems crawling or walking and diminished eye contact. The loss of functional use of the hands is followed by compulsive hand movements such as wringing and washing. The onset of this period of regression is sometimes sudden.</p>
<p>Another symptom, apraxia — the inability to perform motor functions — is perhaps the most severely disabling feature of Rett syndrome, interfering with every body movement, including eye gaze and speech.</p>
<p>Individuals with Rett syndrome often exhibit autistic-like behaviors in the early stages. Other symptoms may include toe walking; sleep problems; wide-based gait; teeth grinding and difficulty chewing; slowed growth; seizures; cognitive disabilities; and breathing difficulties while awake such as hyperventilation, apnea (breath holding), and air swallowing.</p>

<p>These visual facial feature are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large head</li>
<li>Large curved forehead</li>
<li>Facial elements (eyes, nose, mouth) located relatively low</li>
<li>Large, round eyes</li>
<li>Small, short nose</li>
<li>Round cheeks</li>
<li>Small chin</li>
</ul>
<p>Psychological and social research on facial attractiveness has pointed out that the presence of childlike facial features increases attractiveness.</p>
<p>A prototype for a "child woman" is '<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigitte_Bardot_ae2c.html" title="Brigitte Bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a>. Some researchers claim that the reason why childlike women are perceived as being more attractive, is a biological one: Evolutionary biologists argue that men have an reproductive advantage when preferring young women as mating partners since they are likely to be healthy and still having a long period of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertility.html" title="Fertility">fertility</a> ahead of them. Thus, he can have many children with young women which means that he can successfully pass on his <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genes.html" title="Genes">genes</a> to his descendants.</p>
<p>Babyfaceness appears throughout humanity, within all human <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">races</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalities.html" title="Nationalities">nationalities</a>. But it seems the occurance of this is not uniformity throughout as there is a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variability.html" title="Variability">variability</a> in how prevalent is it.</p>

<p>Zen Shiatsu is One of <b>Derivative <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiatsu.html" title="Shiatsu">Shiatsu</a></b></p>
<p><a href="../../../s/h/i/Shizuto_Masunaga_a8cc.html" title="Shizuto Masunaga">Shizuto Masunaga</a> graduated from the <a href="http://www.shiatsu.ac.jp" class="external text" title="http://www.shiatsu.ac.jp" rel="nofollow">Japan Shiatsu College</a>. He wrote the book “Shiatsu” in 1974. It was translated in 1977 and titled “Zen Shiatsu” in English. It was the first publication relating to Shiatsu in North America. The purpose of the book was to re-educate Shiatsu practitioners. In the book there is no mention of the religion of “<a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen.html" title="Zen">Zen</a>” or the religious and philosophical inferences of this word in Japanese. Zen Shiatsu is just one form of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian_Shiatsu_cc93.html" title="Meridian Shiatsu">Meridian Shiatsu</a> and, in Japan, there is no special category for it. However, the book helped spread the oriental trend in North America and Europe due to its mysterious name. It is also known as Masunaga Therapy. One difference between Zen Shiatsu and <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiatsu.html" title="Shiatsu">Shiatsu</a> is that Zen style uses not only thumbs and palms but also fists, elbows and knees.</p>
<p>There is a strong presence of Zen Shiatsu practitioners in the U.S. and the U.K. Zen Shiatsu was founded by Shizuto Masunaga, who emphasized the importance of remaining in a Zen-like, present state when practicing shiatsu; nourishing weak kyo areas primary to dispersing excess jitsu areas; using two-handed technique to better feel the flow of qi; working from the hara, or belly, which is the body's energy center; and using perpendicular pressure to access the <i>qi</i>. Masunaga moreover expanded the meridian system, discovering extensions of the classical Chinese meridians, and developed an effective new system of hara diagnosis.</p>

<p>Essentially, the Tsubo of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiatsu.html" title="Shiatsu">Shiatsu</a> are determined from an anatomical and physiological perspective and in this respect, its theory differs from the Meridian Theory of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_Chinese_Medicine_d15d.html" title="Traditional Chinese Medicine">Traditional Chinese Medicine</a> that was introduced into Japan from China. The clinical results of <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsubo_Shiatsu_112c.html" title="Tsubo Shiatsu">Tsubo Shiatsu</a> and Meridian Shiatsu are comparable because the location of meridian points and Tsubos are identical or very close.

<p>One of the Derivative <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiatsu.html" title="Shiatsu">Shiatsu</a>. In about 1980, Dr. Hiroshi Ishizuka, M.D., current principal of the <a href="http://www.shiatsu.ac.jp" class="external text" title="http://www.shiatsu.ac.jp" rel="nofollow">Japan Shiatsu College</a>, (and former professor at the University of Tokushima) proposed the theory that meridian points are derived from anatomically and physiologically referenced points and represent the body’s physical expression of its current condition (pathological or otherwise) or of changing homeostasis in the body. These pathological reflex points are called <b>Aze-no Tsubo</b> in Japanese. In 2003, “<a href="http://www.tsuboshiatsu.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tsuboshiatsu.com" rel="nofollow">Tsubo Shiatsu</a>” by <a href="../../../k/i/y/Kiyoshi_Ikenaga_2a2a.html" title="Kiyoshi Ikenaga">Kiyoshi Ikenaga</a> (Chairperson and CEO of the <a href="http://www.oyayubi.com" class="external text" title="http://www.oyayubi.com" rel="nofollow">Canadian College of Shiatsu Therapy</a>) was published in North America. Following the basic Shiatsu founded by <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokujiro_Namikoshi_5b07.html" title="Tokujiro Namikoshi">Tokujiro Namikoshi</a>, the distinguishing feature of Tsubo Shiatsu is the expectation that in every treatment the therapist will find and treat, using the thumbs and palms, these pathological reflex points.</p>
