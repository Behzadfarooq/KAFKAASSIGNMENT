<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. I'm applying my admin's discretion here and I certainly hope I am not going to be accused of making a rash decision (though, of course, I would welcome a message on <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix">my talk page</a> followed by a deletion review if anyone disagrees with my closure). There are a couple of concerns or factors in this AfD that led me to this decision, and I lent a lot more weight to people who&#160;!voted after the article was written down to a regular stub (at around 06:20 on 3 October 2006):</p>
<ol>
<li>The original author asked that this article be deleted. While not the ultimate deciding factor in any deletion of an article, this is still <b>A</b> factor.</li>
<li>Second to the first point, the original author, and indeed, some other&#160;!voters, thought that the information is wrong.</li>
<li>Is there more than one Infotech Strategies? Perhaps, and if so, a disambig page would be useful, but in the meantime, it doesn't help to have a mish-mash of information on two or more companies residing in the article history, especially when the information on these two or more companies are merged to appear as one.</li>
<li>Regardless of whether the information is correct, this company might not be notable enough for an article. There are arguments for and against keeping this article solely on the basis of notability, but most of the arguments are that this company is not notable enough.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these are the reasons I decided to close this article as delete. I have no prejudice against the recreation of this article if it turns out that there are two or more companies with this name, and these two or more companies are all notable enough to be mentioned in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 19:34, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Precious reliable sources are here. Enough to warrant keeping this article.

<dd>Yes, I've noticed, but the fact remains I can't find anything besides some basic numbers on their lobbying counts, (outside of their PR releases, of course). I'd love to find some nice reliable sources for them, but so far I've had tough luck. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 06:25, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They seem to be pumping millions of dollars into lobbying US politicians and getting their clients on national TV networks. I think such activities are significant. Of course it would be best if we can dig up more data on them, but I think we should at least tellg readers that "Information and Communication Technology consulting firm" means "lobbying group". <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 06:29, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. If this is in fact a lobbying group that describes itself as a consultancy business, that may well make it notable. The original author attempted to blank the objectively written version, and removed the AFD notice. (I put back.)

<li>Well, it's not like they're doing something illegal or unusual. Lobbying groups usually call themselves things like this.

<li>I left a message at the user's page explaining the situation, and since I see no reason to expect further problems (we are talking about a serious company, not a bunch of thugs), I've unprotected the page. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 16:17, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Might there be two "Infotech Strategies"? It is a rather vague and uninformative name to give a business, and that unfortunately seems to be the fashion these days. If there are two, the lobbying business is much likelier to be the one worthy of an article. At any rate, a consensus seemed to be developing to delete the networking or consultancy business and keep the lobbying business article. If there are in fact two, the article needs to be revised to say so, use the correct logo. If both have some evidence of notability (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) so that both should be kept, and a neutral, encyclopedia style article (no advertising) can be written about yours, this is a job for a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_page_1257.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation page">Wikipedia:disambiguation page</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 21:17, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No I'm sure they're the same. "We help our clients <i>develop legislative and regulatory agendas</i> to support their <i>public policy</i> and business goals, <i>develop long-term relationships with policymakers</i>, and <i>participate in the development of government policy</i> at the highest levels."<a href="http://www.itstrategies.com/pubaffairs.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.itstrategies.com/pubaffairs.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>(emphasis mine).

<p>"Efforts to influence legislation by influencing the opinion of legislators, legislative staff and government administrators directly involved in drafting legislative proposals"<a href="http://www.yscf.org/glossary.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yscf.org/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> or "Lobbying"<a href="http://youthink.worldbank.org/glossary.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://youthink.worldbank.org/glossary.php" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. They're a public relations and lobbying firm. Of course, its hidden behind a lot of weasel and buzzwords. The fact that the company has spent millions speaks for itself. The article you wrote KHNY even included "Outreach to Decision Makers" What decision makers are we talking about here? "Infotech Strategies also help’s its clients develop long-term relationships with policy makers" is probably the most clear cut indication of the company's intention to lobby, just on behalf of companies that hire them. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 21:36, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The lobby thing is not the issue. The issue is does the information posted accurately portray the company? I just took a look their website and it all about technology and education. The company’s client list on their website does not include the clients listed on the posting. Are there two Infotech strategies?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The creator of the page, KHNY, is now asking that it be deleted. Because of WP:SPAM and the tone of the article, I would have suggested that it be deleted in any case. This group is hardly so important that the encyclopedia is incomplete without it. Especially when it's so hard to verify the information. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 20:01, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. KHNY created this page, and he/she says that the information is full of errors, now he/she wants it removed....then lets remove it. Why risk Wikipedia image with "what maybe wrong information" or "two different companies" I edited the page because the only correct information I see is the company's name and locations
<ul>
<li>Actually, the whole article (now that I reverted your changes) is fully sourced, and it seems clear that there is a company called Infotech Strategies that the article accurately (and surely incompletely) describes. This discussion tries to determine whether the company that this article describes is something that the encyclopedia should write about, nothing more. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 20:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note to the closing admin:</b> Many of the delete votes above are for the initial version of the article, out of which only the infobox and one sentence remain. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 23:29, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
