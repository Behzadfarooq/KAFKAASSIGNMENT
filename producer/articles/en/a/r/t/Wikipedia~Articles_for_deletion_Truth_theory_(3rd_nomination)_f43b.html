<p>Page survived 2 prior AfDs (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Truth_theory_b7f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Truth theory">1</a>,<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Truth_theory%282%29_6c70.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Truth theory(2)">2</a>), yet it was later redirected to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a> by the same person (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truth_theory&amp;diff=74430874&amp;oldid=73958354" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truth_theory&amp;diff=74430874&amp;oldid=73958354" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) who nominated it the 2nd time (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Truth_theory%282%29&amp;oldid=69463049" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Truth_theory%282%29&amp;oldid=69463049" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). That certainly appears to be a way to circumvent the conclusion of the AfD, which was <b>no consensus</b>. Attempts to restore the original article have been prevented vigorously <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truth_theory&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truth_theory&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, therefore again a listing here. I'll abstain for now --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 22:20, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>: For the sake of clarity, I have in principle no objections against this article being deleted or redirect, but going against AfD consensus, even if the main author of the article was banned for being abusive, is not the way to go. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 22:52, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Changing the article to a redirect is within the bounds of reason subject to the AfD (2). If one were to count "votes" (most of which have reasons, which I won't try to weight....)
<ul>
<li>delete or userfy</li>
<li>redirect</li>
<li>keep (3)</li>
<li>delete (3)</li>
<li>delete or merge</li>
<li>keep or merge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Noting that, for the purpose of the AfD, keep, merge, and redirect are all counted as "keep", but for the purpose of deciding whether a merge is in order, "redirect", "merge", and possibly "delete" would be considered favorable, I would say that a merge "vote" probably would have succeeded. I'd lean toward merging the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> parts of the article (back) into <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>, but I'm not sure there are any. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 00:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>. As with above, but any pertinant information moved over would have to be re-written as it does read like a small dissertation paper. <a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b>Khukri</b></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">talk</font></b></a> . <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khukri_f113.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">contribs</font></b></a>)</sup> 13:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Merging following a keep consensus would be legitimate. Merging following no consensus is even more legitimate. There isn't a problematic overriding of AFD consensus visible here. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:50, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Then drop this AFD and merge! The problem is that the content of the article is a POV fork from <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>, so in effect <i>there is nothing (or very little) that the authors of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a> would agree to including!</i> And <i>that</i> is why the article has been made a redirect. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 21:41, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This article is a poster child for <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, and a candidate for poster child on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. We were handed a bill of goods by an extremely astute but highly tendentious editor who's turned out to have almost 30 sockpuppets to date. The stated purpose of this article at the time was to have a place for the more highly technical material, but it turned out to be a one-man article and not a useful one at that. Time to get rid of the headache please. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 22:12, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Adding comment: With the exception of the nominator of this Afd, every single instance of replacing the redirect with the article was done by a sockpuppet of the tenditious editor mentioned, evading ban. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 15:39, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> i think theory of truth might be different from truth. so tread carefully please, i think losing knowledge(if that is what will happen) might make me feel bad. so if you do decide to delete please take care to keep any knowledge that may be lost. also on a different topic i think it makes me feel bad when people use words which are (as seem to me) foreign (eg kenosis) instead of simpler (but equaly effective) words in order to show their knowledge of that word, i think such action is an indication of pride, which i think is a form of self deception, and i think i don't like deception, i thank you for your time.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon-o-man_f209.html" title="User:Anon-o-man">Anon-o-man</a> 17:43, 15 October 2006 (UTC) ... in an unussually philosophical mood.

<dd>Kenosis is an editor. Delete per Kenosis just means 'I agree with the reasons Kenosis gave to delete'. Look up, Kenosis' Delete is the one after Banno's comment, and before Banno's Delete. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 18:44, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Nominator has made the point that a post I placed on his user talk page covered the issue better than the above statements, so I add it here for future reference: Truth theory is covered thoroughly in <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html#Major_theories_of_truth" title="Truth">Truth#Major theories of truth</a> including <b>Substantive theories of truth</b>: <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correspondence_theory_of_truth.html" title="Correspondence theory of truth">Correspondence theory</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/h/Coherence_theory_of_truth.html" title="Coherence theory of truth">Coherence theory</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructivist_epistemology.html" title="Constructivist epistemology">Constructivist theory</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_theory_of_truth.html" title="Consensus theory of truth">Consensus theory</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pragmatic_theory_of_truth.html" title="Pragmatic theory of truth">Pragmatic theory</a>; <b><a href="../../../d/e/f/Deflationary_theory_of_truth.html" title="Deflationary theory of truth">Minimalist (deflationary) theories of truth</a></b>, Performative theory of truth, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redundancy_theory_of_truth.html" title="Redundancy theory of truth">Redundancy and related theories</a>; <b>Other theories of truth</b>: Kripke's theory of truth, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic_theory_of_truth.html" title="Semantic theory of truth">Semantic theory of truth</a>.
