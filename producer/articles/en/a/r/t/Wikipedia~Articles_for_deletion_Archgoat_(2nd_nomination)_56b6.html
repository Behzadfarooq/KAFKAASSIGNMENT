<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>: Non-notable band. They've only released a few short EPs which doesn't adhere to the two-full-length-albums rule in <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. No mentions on allmusic.com (which has almost every band). Amazon only has a split album with Beherit. The website is as charming as the band itself but doesn't show anything that fits <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> - it even has an ad for "Our Debut album" for 2006. Don't be fooled by apparent longevity since they broke up for over a decade.

<ul>
<li>Careful. Allmusic is heavily biased towards American bands and is unlikely to contain bands from Asia for example. It may be a good guide to notability for Western bands, but by no means has it got "every band". - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:16, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: This band is nowhere close to an A7 speedy. The fact that everyone is voting that way demonstrates how misguided the criteria really is. Furthermore, those who claim a band needs to have won a grammy or had chart hits to merit an article are setting the bar at a level that goes well beyond the spirit of the band guidelines. Vote based on any standards you want, but the pack mentality displayed above is frankly scary and does a severe disservice to our music coverage here.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 15:52, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Take a look at <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/browseL.php?l=C" class="external free" title="http://www.metal-archives.com/browseL.php?l=C" rel="nofollow">http://www.metal-archives.com/browseL.php?l=C</a>. If we followed your criteria, every single one of those bands would be in Wikipedia! And that's just the ones starting with C! Do you seriously think it would fit Wikipedia standards to have almost <b>twenty</b> bands whose names relate to Cremation, <b>eight</b> bands named <i>Cabal</i>, etc., etc. (even <i>Chapel of Ghouls</i> is taken twice!)? Even die-hard black metal fans would start looking elsewhere for actual useful info. Recording studios aren't interested in them enough to make a full-length album, most heavy metal reviewers aren't interested in them enough to even listen to their EPs — but you expect the general Wikipedia public to be interested?! That type of reasoning is why CSD A7 had to be created in the first place. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:17, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Even "Cerberus" has eight bands listed including three just from the US. So, for every scary mythological figure, we'd have eight adjoining articles for some band that used it for a band name. I shudder at the thought. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:20, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. A Finnish band that has been around for this long, that has music available through Amazon and that headlined in at least seven countries in the last three months is not a speedy. Afd is there for a reason. It is not a formality and is meant to be a vehicle for achieving consensus. It provides a timeframe for editors who actually know something about the group (unlike anyone here) to add new info or improve the contents. Having a bunch of editors scream speedy A7 without providing any serious reasoning does nothing to reach consensus in this case and denigrates the entire process.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 16:36, 25 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Their own website says "Our Debut album... will be released on spring 2006". That's all the "serious reasoning" necessary in my opinion. Even they admit they've never released an album. Hard to get less notable. My cousin from Maine released an album in 1982 so I guess I'll create an article for him. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:54, 25 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your opinion has been clear from the beginning. However, I reiterate, this is not a speedy. You proved that yourself when you checked their website. Had the article not asserted "notability" you would not have needed to check anything. Otherwise, while an upcoming album release is one factor in considering inclusion, the past history of your Maine cousin hardly seems relevant unless he/she is now a member of Archgoat. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:33, 25 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When this alleged release is made, then maybe this article will be relevant. Until then, someone with an actual album under their belt is more so. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:55, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>It's your right to discount the material they have released to date. However, please show good faith by changing your vote back to the original delete- or at least justify the need to change to A7. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FArchgoat_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=36595965&amp;oldid=36592698" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FArchgoat_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=36595965&amp;oldid=36592698" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:21, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
