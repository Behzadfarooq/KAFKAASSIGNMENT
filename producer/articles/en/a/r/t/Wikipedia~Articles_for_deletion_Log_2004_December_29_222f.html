The result of the debate was ambiguous. There is a clear consensus to delete. However, the nominator notes that he actually moved the content to other pages. In order to preserve the attribution history (a requirement of GFDL), I am instead going to turn this into a redirect. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:30, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article describes an attempt made by Augsburg bankers, ruled by Spanish King as Holy Roman Emperor to take part in Spanish colonisation of America. While it is interesting to read, the article doesn't describe what the title says. The attempt was performed by private persons, not by German state and was tied to the Spanish crown more then to German one, partcularly because German state barely function at that time.

<li>James, please do not use profanity (see <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>) - "bloody" is derived from "bloody Christ", an expression to which some Wikipedia users may take exception to. Also, I find that statements like "don't waste people's time with a deletion request" only serves to intimidate people to not put articles up for deletion which they, in good faith, believe not to be suitable for Wikipedia.

<li>The term "bloody" is not in any way understood to be profane in the United Kingdom, nor by anyone I've ever met from Ireland, the US, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and other places where English is spoken.

Do you want to rename the other twelve articles as well? Even if so, that's no grounds for deletion. The content is good. If you don't like the titles, move them, which will preserve the content and history, and then propose the resulting redirects for deletion. But before doing this, I suggest we use the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Talk%7EEuropean_colonization_of_the_Americas_695c.html" title="Talk:European colonization of the Americas">talk pages</a> both of the articles and their parent, I suspect you will find these renames opposed as well.

<li>If one follows this logic to the end: wouldn't any 'revolutions' (e.g. uprising of the Dutch against Spain) which led ultimately to an independent state to have to be attributed, in this case, to the spanish people...?

<li>Other articles imply colonisation by the private organisation with support of the state. We have English colonisation, if private enterprners are working for English state.

<li>The "<a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrims.html" title="Pilgrims">Pilgrims</a>" were supported by no state, but they were ethnically British and colonists. I don't know why people are so hung up about whether or not an ethnic group that colonized the Americas were supported by the state. A good counter-example to this notion is the Pitcairn Island colonists, a mixed group of Tahitians and British who settled that island while fugitives from Britain.

<li>This was settled when Gunthrie's people tried to sue JibJab over the parody.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Without changing my vote to keep, I beg to differ with you. Shea is indeed a lot less known than are his creations -- which I happen to think is very healthy and indeed the way things should be (the reverse of "celebrity culture" whereby David Beckham seems more famous for his appearance in ads and his hairstyles than for his footie) -- so even if you look for him he doesn't spring out of Google and grab you by the, um, whatever. And if you look at the original article, it was very slovenly. I think the onus should be on the writer of a new article to indicate (however imperfectly) how the subject is notable, and the writer of this one hardly bothered. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:14, 2005 Jan 1 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The final tally is 15 delete (fvw voted twice, I assume accidentally) to 9 keep (two unsigned votes were by extremely new users and are discounted). Failing to reach a clear consensus to delete, the article defaults to keep. I am, however, going to tag this for clean-up.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I say keep for two reasons.

Secondly, just because it's an internet joke doesn't mean people don't want to know about it. For instance <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/t/Yatta.html" title="Yatta">Yatta</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin_foil_hat.html" title="Tin foil hat">Tin foil hat</a> all have articles, and with due cause.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 17 Keep votes and 23 Delete votes. Failing to reach a clear consensus to delete, this article defaults to Keep. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:08, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some additional comments on the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Delete as recreation of previously deleted content" can not generally be used as an argument when the <i>only prior deletions were speedy deletions</i>. Speedy deletions are supposed to be non-controversial. The good-faith recreation of the article is often evidence that the deletion was, in fact, controversial.</li>
<li>While there is general consensus that forked articles are bad for Wikipedia, the jury is still out on the use of this template trick. Notably, it avoids the maintenance problems that are inherent to forked articles. It will probably be appropriate to revisit the decision on this article after there has been suitable discussion and time for consensus to appear at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html#censorship_and_wikipedia" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:village pump#censorship and wikipedia</a>.</li>
<li>While a comment warning of a possible <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">Wikipedia:sockpuppet</a> is appreciated, history on this page has shown us that being overly aggressive (such as by using strikethrough on the comment) is too often perceived as an aggressive and personal attack.</li>

<li><b>DELETE</b> - It sets an extremely dangerous precedent to have censored pages on Wikipedia.

<li>The first abuse was the initial creation of this article which sets an unhealthy precedent. The second abuse was recreating the page after it was legitimatly voted to delete it in the initial instance. The third abuse was the recreation of this page after it was legitimately speedily deleted for the second time. The fourth abuse was the removal of the previous VFD debate during the holiday period when many people interested in this subject were away for the holidays. The fifth abuse is trying to shout down the valid procedure for the deletion of this page on technical grounds and not on any real justification for the page's existence in and of itself. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 11:57, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>The technical grounds are very important in this case. If it was common practice to do like you just did and relist surviving pages it would destroy the entire VfD process.

I wasn't aware that this was an alternate display rather than a fork, or that it had just survived a VfD (although I note that opinion there was far from unanimous.) This shouldn't have been relisted on VfD, but I feel that more discussion is needed somewhere. This kind of thing would set an important precedent, and the opinions of a broad segment of the Wikipedia population should be sought.

<li>The article at <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ghraib_prisoner_abuse_0976.html" title="Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse">Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse</a> is already censored. The pictures have fuzzy bits over parts of the images that someone somewhere has deemed too shocking to show. I feel that the providing a separate "censored" version without the pictures can only have a political agenga. It it curious that of all the pages in Wikipedia this one should provide the incentive for someone to produce a separate page "to lessen the impact" of the article. The story of this article is the pictures. Without the pictures there would have been no story in the first place. There would just have been unsubstantiated rumours of abuse. To remove the pictures is an attempt to water down the article so that it can be forgotten about. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 18:00, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse (no pictures) was deleted after a majority of people voted for its deletion. It was then recreated at Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse/pictures suppressed, albeit using some jiggery pokery with templates. I nominated this page for deletion. Quite rightly it was speedily deleted. We all then went off for the Chirstmas break and then suddenly it is recreated once more at Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse (censored). This page has been legitimately deleted twice and has been recreated with minor modifications. I see nothing wrong with my nomination under these circumstances. I believe with every fibre of my body that under no cicumstances should we be in the business of self-censoring Wikipedia to satisfy a political agenda, under this principle I cannot support the concept of this page existing in Wikipedia which is why I have nominated it for deletion. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 00:48, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Imagine, for example, having a math article at two different levels of reader skill, or having a shortened version of a long article that cuts out some peripheral diversions. On the other hand, it's also an incredibly awkward hack that doesn't generalize and might not work forever (I still can't believe it works at all). I tried to do better, but could find nothing (at least without a stylesheet change).

<li>I have to take issue with your claim that it's not some kind of test page. Just try visiting it and then try to edit. Even when you do succeed in editing, I believe it's true to say (unless it's fixed in 1.4) that the cache is broken so you may not see changes until you manually purge. For these two reasons it cannot be regarded as ready for prime-time. It's a proof of concept, no more.

<li>Reidrect only: I've heard it both as a slur and as DINK. IMO, they're both dictdefs and not appropriate. However, given the presence of the slurs list, it can go there. I just don't think it's worth putting in the merge queue. It's used about as often, in my experience, as "gook," which is to say not very often at all. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:10, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. I initiated the article. I would agree with a merge and redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_slang.html" title="Military slang">military slang</a>, if people dont believe it deserves its own article. I do not think that it deserves to be snuffed out of existence however. Nor do I feel that it should only go to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">list of ethnic slurs</a> page, considering I have only ever heard it used within the context of the war in Vietnam. Sorry removing the notice. It seemed like people still thought this was in reference to that (british?) television thing. I tried to clarify in the discussion for the article. I will leave it alone until the issue is resolved. As for "dual income no kids", I think that is probably too contemporary to have mention here, and is more of "urban dictionary" type of article. --63.172.33.194 18:42, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Thank you for your courtesy, and please don't let this VfD listing discourage you. Specifically, I believe, "dink" was used in the Vietnam War and has been reused since, though inaccurately. It could certainly be in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_slang.html" title="Military slang">military slang</a> in a section on "the enemy," but the term has spread, unfortunately, into civilian (and, of course, teen) use for Asians and then for "dinky" (i.e. small genital) persons. That's why it could go to the ethnic slurs page, too. I agree that it really <i>ought</i> not be confused with the Yuppy/Buppy type of descriptor, since that should be DINK and never "Dink" or "dink." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 05:06, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was keep. (Several anonymous or suspiciously new users' votes were discounted but that still failed to establish a clear consensus to delete the article.)</p>
<p>Having said that this group's decision is "keep", I am disturbed to note that the relevant standard - the "more than an average professor test" - was never applied to this article. (See the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>.) Neither the article nor this discussion thread establish that she is more than an average professor.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'd like to comment that a vote to keep the article (at least for now) is <b>not</b> an endorsement that the current content must be kept. Much of the biographic detail is in my opinion inappropriate for an encyclopedia article. However, that is something that any editor can fix. It does not need discussion on this page.</p>
<p>I am going to tag this article for clean-up. Please be aware that if the article is not cleaned up in a reasonable amount of time (no firm standard exists), and if notability is not established which passes the "average professor test", there is a significant chance that this article will be again nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:09, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

As an aside, <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> challenges our policy of discounting anonymous votes by noting that we allow and encourage user IDs to be pseudonyms. The point Mel misses is that we are a community.

<p>For the comments about Wikipedia not being a peer-reviewed encyclopedia, they are right. It is both a weakness and a strength.

<li>Vote against deletion (is there a separate page for this? I couldn't find it) I'm in the process of writing this page (in fact it's only been up for about ten minutes); the material so far does indeed come from her own Web site, but I'm adding more substantial descriptions of her positions. She's an extremely popular and well-respected lecturer (on Descartes, expecially) in Oxford; philosophical worth isn't merely a matter of the length of one's publications list. (I don't have a User name -- do I need one for these purposes? I should say that I'm not Dr Christofidou, so whatever else the page is, it's not vanity.) 13:27, 29 Dec 2004.</li>
<li><s><b>Tentative Keep</b></s> <b>Delete</b>. She is a Lecturer at Oxford. I'm not up on British academic titles, so I don't know how significant this is; but obviously the university if a very highly-regarded one. The article could do a lot better job of establishing her notability. Being popular doesn't equate to being notable. And if she is well-respected, the article does not indicate why. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:01, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Changed my vote. Doesn't seem like the author has much more to say about this person other than a "Lecturer" at Oxford is not equivalent to an Assistant Professor in the U.S., and 'could' be notable.

<li>Delete: Vanity page for a random professor. First, it's biography with personal details (hallmark of the vanity page). Second, she is a lecturer (aka "assistant professor"). Third, there is no indication that her works are influential or leading the field. Professors always chalk up publications. We've long had a standard for academics that they need more than to be at a university. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:19, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: "Lecturer" is the first rung of an academic career in Britain, it turns out. So basically every faculty member at Oxford, Cambridge, and equally notable schools is as notable as this person, based on her post alone. The references cite several of her journal articles. The journals are among the most respected ones, but someone else will have to comment on whether these articles are notable. It would be nice if the people responsible for this article had done their homework, instead of expecting other people to do it. No change of vote. --22:42, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>(The page-writer again — still no User-name; I've tried twice, but both times I was told that my chosen name was in use, though a search came up with nothing. I'll try again.) Aside from the person before last, who seemed not to have read what went before, the debate has been interesting. There seems to be no clear agreement on what an entry is supposed to do. I'd assumed that entries were primarily for those who were looking for them, rather than as introductions for idle browsers (perhaps that's just because that's the way I've generally used Wikipedia). I didn't intend my entry on Dr Christofidou to puff her, to tell people why they should be interested in her; rather, I intended to offer information for those who looking for it. I started with the easy bit – the biography, etc. – intending to add the harder stuff (what's distinctive about her positions and arguments in the areas of the philosophy of the self and of Cartesian studies).
<ul>
<li>The last person is wrong, I'm afraid; the British system is in general more complicated than this, and the Oxford system is different again. I'm surprised that anyone thinks that philosophical distinction is a function of one's position in the academic hierarchy (few eminent philosophers of the past were academic successes, and many holders of University chairs are tedious nobodies). Finally, I don't know what homework I'm supposed to have done; if the reference is to the stuff about what "lecturer" means, was I really supposed to include that in the entry? Incidentally, if the entry gets to stay, and I go back to working on it, what did people mean by the need for cleaning up? Is that the coding, or something to do with the content? --(Call me Ishmael — at least for now) 22:50 29 Dec 2004
<ul>
<li>Actually, those who came before were the ones who had not read what had come before them. In fact, Wikipedia has been around for quite a while. How many assistant professors/lecturers do you see on the site? Know why? Academic articles are for those persons who are notable within their field. This does not merely mean individual, as all academics have to be original to some degree to publish, but rather those who are talked up, discussed, leading. As for whether eminent philosophers of the past have been academic successes or not, that's an utter red herring, for how many academic failures have been notable philosophers? Is this person <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Rorty_ff75.html" title="Richard Rorty">Richard Rorty</a> or just a striving academic? If the former, then an article is in order. If the latter, then she is like the thousands of others who toil in hope's delusive mine. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:51, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suspect that what was meant was that you referred to it as a "vanity page", when we've been told that it isn't. I can't comment on that, but your insistence on the claim that a U.K Lecturer is the same as a U.S. Assistant Professor is certainly wrong. Wikipedia is full of U.K. Lecturers; we don't have the formal and highly-articulated hierarchy that you do. A U.K. Lecturer can be equivalent to anything from an Assistant Professor to a Full Professor in the U.S. (Is Associate Prof higher or lower than Assistant Prof? Anyway, "Lecturer" includes all three.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> 15:51 30 Dec 2004</li>

<li>You need to cater for different kinds of readers - people who know who she is, but want to know more about her, people who find her page in a search engine using words it mentions, people who might have followed a link from "oxford philosophers" or Cartesian studies or some such article, "idle browsers" who get there with "random page", etc. // It's not that academic position is a wonderful measure of philosphical distinction, but at least its an objective one, the same as record sales.

<li>Not only isn't it personal, or vanity, or whatever, but Dr Christofidou knows nothing about it. The comment concerning lecturers is an inaccurate and petty generalisation. As for "salting" other articles, I added links to a couple of relevant articles, just as I linked from this page to others -- I'd thought that that was how Wikipedia worked.

<li>I've just discovered this discussion; the usual Usenet-level stuff, with dogmatic nonsense from anonymous, ignorant, arrogant little nobodies. Andrea would be upset by some of the crass comments, but then I don't suppose you really understand taht, you autistic creeps. Take the page down; why would she be interested in having n edited duplicate of the bio from her own page on a non-peer-reviewed "Encyclopedia"? I expect that the person who started putting it up had the best of motives, but take it down please, and leave these autistic twerps to play their dominance games with each other. --[A friend and colleague of A.C.] 9.25am 31st December 2004
<ul>
<li>The most striking example of autistic Usenet dominance games in this discussion is your own (anonymous) contribution. Unfortunately votes from anonymous IP's don't count. People writing biographies when the notabiity of the subject can't be readily established aren't really doing the subject any favors. They are potentially exposing the person to a fairly blunt discussion of how notable he or she really is. No university lecturer (or her colleagues , apparently) wants to read on the Internet that she is just another person working in the education industry. Other encyclopedias are not peer-reviewed, either; but they don't conduct their editorial discussions in public. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:49, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmmm... a few problems with BM's reply: (1) it seems to be using "autistic" as a general term of abuse (from the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a>: "people on the autism spectrum have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Neurotypical 5-year-olds understand that other people have different knowledge, feelings, and goals than they have. An autistic person may lack such understanding, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions"; (2) the use of "anonymous" to mean someone not using a pseudonym like "BM" or "Geogre" or even "Mel Etitis" is peculiar to say the least; (3) I'll pass over the repeated sily stuff about the relative importance of academics and the notion of education being just another industry (we get enough of that from right-wing politicians here); (4) I've contributed to a few non-Internet Encyclopedias, and they were all peer-reviewed to various degrees (at least having a subject-specialist editor who was responsible for accepting, rejecting, or asking for alterations in articles). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> 10:21, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. The concept is a real concept (the business sense). It should have a label in the form of a word or term. Is the problem that it's a word that isn't used widely yet, or is it that it identifies a concept that some would rather not have identified? I'm not sure about Wikipedia policy, but if there is some kind of rule against new words to identify previously-unlabeled concepts, I'd just like to state my opinion that such a rule would be counterproductive toward the advancement of knowledge. And I would question the value of Wikipedia to society.

<li>I wish you had simply answered my question, rather than impugning motives and denouncing Wikipedia.

<li>Keep deleted: The author knew about the previous VfD outcome and had taken part (angrily) in the VfD debate. Therefore, this is not an honest mistake. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:03, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>If it wasn't the same article, it should not have been speedied! There is nothing to stop an editor from re-creating an article with different information. There is nothing in the deletion policy that says hospitals must be deleted. This is the personal opinion of some editors. The idea that Wikipedia can be "too highly detailed" is very worrying. Edit the article, Gtabary, if you think that. That's what editors do. But chasing another editor around, destroying all his work, is unfriendly to say the least.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 23:00, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>There come to a point that you are saying that all Hospitals are to be deleted. There are lots more of Hospital articles on the wikipedia, and why are they not deleted since this is? There is a question to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is nothing wrong with Hospital articles. This time I have written with a new and friendly outlook, like <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Israel_Deaconess_Medical_Center_524c.html" title="Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center">Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Massachusetts_Medical_School_3e6d.html" title="University of Massachusetts Medical School">University of Massachusetts Medical School</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_General_Hospital_86f4.html" title="Massachusetts General Hospital">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>, etc. I written this time about the outlook of the hospital, instead about the staff itself. This article is just as notable as all other hospitals. What's wrong with writing Hospital articles? User:Chan Han Xiang</li>
<li>There is no law that someone cannot write local-interest articles. <a href="../../../y/o/u/Wikipedia%7EYour_first_article_be65.html" title="Wikipedia:Your first article">Wikipedia:Your first article</a>. I did add local colours, and there's nothing wrong with that.</li>
<li>Gtabary, I did not say that I will add the same old rubbish information again. I only added the stub, and promised to add more info. Other hospitals are just the same with that. Oh god, what's wrong with that? Hospitals are always not so notable, but in the margin between notable and non-notable. User:Chan Han Xiang</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Extremely weird. Some workers are left behind to entertain the patients? The bosses run their own clinics and leave? If put into less disturbed idiom, it would be not notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I agree what the writer of the article says. I totally disagree on what Geogre says. Generally, the bosses need to sleep at night. At the same time, hospitals have to be on for 24 hours for the sake of saving people in critical conditions at all times. By looking from the iew point of a human's life, a critically sick or injured person will surely die if there is no help to arrive on time. So, if a hospital is only open for, say, 12 hours, the person will not be able to wait and will even die. Furthermore, the bosses, I presume, are very rich and prominent people since they are able to built a hospital like <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tan_Tock_Seng_62e3.html" title="Tan Tock Seng">Tan Tock Seng</a>.

<p>This article, though well written, is not notable enough in and of itself to be included as a separate article from Clubs and organizations of Columbia University. I suggest the content be merged as a subheading in that article, not be its own. There have already been recent arguments over <i>too many columbia articles</i>, and I do not wish this loose end to be inflammatory, unless it can be expanded in the same way as <a href="../../../c/o/r/Core_Curriculum_5bea.html" title="Core Curriculum">Core Curriculum</a> was. --<a href="../../../c/t/r/User%7ECtrl_build_3fb4.html" title="User:Ctrl build">Ctrl build</a><sup><a href="../../../c/t/r/User_talk%7ECtrl_build_ad86.html" title="User talk:Ctrl build">talk</a></sup> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Image%7EColumbia_SEAS.GIF_0933.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/1/1e/Columbia_SEAS.GIF/15px-Columbia_SEAS.GIF" alt="" width="15" height="16" longdesc="../../../c/o/l/Image%7EColumbia_SEAS.GIF_0933.html" /></a> 21:00, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ahem hem. If you think this is a <i>merge and redirect</i>, then you should have done it. <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">Be bold</a>. If you think the change of venue would be controversial, then discuss it on the Talk page first, or put up an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">RfC</a>. I realize there's lots of precedent for it, but I still don't like people using "Votes for deletion" as "Threats for discussion/expansion". Don't list articles here unless you want them <i>deleted</i>. Not edited, not merged with something else, <i>deleted</i> without leaving a trace. For that reason, no vote. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 21:17, 2004 Dec 29 (UTC)\</li>
<li>JRM is correct. If you think the content can be merged, just do it, and redirect. The only reason to ask for a vote on deletion is if you are encountering unreasonable resistance to the merge/redirect -- unreasonable resistance being from perhaps one or a small number of people who insist on a separate article for reasons that don't seem valid. If you merge and redirect, you can then propose later that the redirect be deleted, if you feel that is appropriate. However, since you have put this up for a deletion vote, I consider it non-encyclopedic and vote <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:36, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. One of the problems with this approach is that, now people can and have voted <i>Delete</i>, a bold merge and redirect is no longer an option unless the article survives the full VfD monty. Otherwise, attribution for those edits would be lost, which violates the GFDL. This makes it doubly important not to list articles here unless you really want them deleted, because there's no going back. For that reason, a vote. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 23:22, 2004 Dec 29 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Problem is that the nominator doesn't "own" the vote to begin with. You could let <a href="../../../c/t/r/User%7ECtrl_build_3fb4.html" title="User:Ctrl build">Ctrl build</a> "withdraw" his nomination and then have <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> "own" it, as he was the first to express the opinion that it should be deleted. But what's the point? We might as well just do a proper VfD. I'm sure some people wouldn't be principally opposed to having <i>all</i> Wikipedia articles pass VfD at least once, just to be thorough.

<li>Merge and redirect is logical and follows precedent (the nightmare that was Dartmouth College), but I agree that it is seldom useful to scold other voters, and especially to scold nominators.

I would prefer to see this information yoked with other protests, and especially student protests, in a logical article where things not sufficiently notable in isolation can be spoken of in toto, but I don't know what such an article is. (Even mooning Bush, so to speak, doesn't seem to make a difference, as the man is kept behind a sanitary cordon at all times so that he never sees demonstrators.

<li>Comment: I gather a lot of Wikipedians don't like Bush, but those opinions shouldn't be relevant here. I think there's an important principle at stake, so at the risk of being provocative, let me ask those voting <i>keep</i> a question: If instead of being anti-Bush, this was a proposed demonstration by a <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a> group (or something similar that you don't personally like), and consisted so far only of a four-person incident and some Internet and news coverage, should we have a article on that? I'm genuinely curious. I don't think this campaign will change the world a lot, but I fear it compromises Wikipedia significantly.

<li>Comment: Here we have an article dedicated to this particular planned protest, whose title is an anti-Bush slogan. You're comparing it to a <b>section</b> of an article, with a neutral section heading. But is there perhaps a better comparison? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 03:55, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that's just a quibble, really. You ask whether an article about a protest on grounds not favored by those who vote for this one should be kept. The article must have a provocative name and the protest must have received equivalent publicity. I don't know whether such an article has ever existed, but if it did I don't see why it should be deleted. Since I have no reason to believe that Wikipedians are particularly opposed to Bush or are in the habit of letting their personal political views influence their votes on VfD I concentrated on demonstrating that Wikipedians do represent unpopular views fairly. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:56, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Thanks for clarifying that. To you it may be a quibble, but IMO your first reply didn't answer the question at all, and this now does. My reason for thinking that a significant number of Wikipedians must have an anti-Bush bias is that I'm still struggling to understand why anyone would vote to keep what looks to me to be a blatant piece of political advertising. This is not a criticism, it's an honest question. All the article says so far is that four unnamed students have protested in this way, and that an unnamed person is organising a much bigger demonstration in three weeks' time, and that some websites exist to promote the plan. As for the press services (which confirm this), I think they set the bar a bit lower than we should. But if others disagree with this, that's fine. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 19:14, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

By extension, there is "school vanity", "road vanity", "hometown vanity", "boy scout troop vanity": the subject must be interesting because I am associated with it, and I am interested in it. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:06, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the "vanity" issue is the balance between the self-actualization needs of contributors, and the needs of Wikipedia users. I think the "vanity" in a vanity article is: "I feel like creating an article of my own, and all the good titles seem to be taken. So, I'll start an article about a soft drink consisting of the ingredients list copied from the label. Or an article about a local shopping mall. Or a list of songs whose titles contain the name of a color." Such articles are "all about <b>me</b>" regardless of their subject matter. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:26, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Move to some other title. For the love of Mike, this is a bad, bad, bad title. There is a crush in publishing, as large houses are bought by larger multinationals and catalogs are ripped apart and even prestigious academic presses that never noticed profits and losses begin imitating the trades, but, of course, that's <i>not</i> what this article is talking about! How absurd. At the same time, retailing has changed, although, frankly, what has really happened is that the mall stores that killed the neighborhood shops are getting killed by big chains and the Internet. The funky used shop is actually doing well, just as the used record shop hasn't been hurt.

<li>This is a repeat VfD. Anyone have a link to the old discussion? I remember how I voted before. Unsurprisingly, I'm sure, I voted <b>delete</b>, and I do so again. It is simply a saying. Therefore, at best it would go to Wikiquote, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:19, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Stet</b>. It's not a "mere" saying; it's more like to a theorem, which has a name but is an established fact. It's not quite a fact, perhaps (though I'd argue that it is), but at worst it's Jargon (in the CS Jargon File (jargon.net) sense): it's the standard name within the relevant community. Call me the PC Police, but it seems to me that deleting this entry would tend to marginalize that community, and I don't see a pressing need for Wikipedia to be in that business. Excuse my anonymity. 12/30/04</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A quip from alt.sex.bondage, however often quoted there, and even if elevated to being a named "law", isn't an encyclopedia topic, unless it reaches the wider culture. Removing the article doesn't marginalize that "community"; the community is already marginal. There are hundreds of these "laws". A few of them, such as Murphy's Law, are notable. And the rest aren't. Wikipedia is not the alt.sex.bondage FAQ. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:38, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, certainly non-notable, vanity on behalf of the users of alt.sex.bondage. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 15:53, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>[The wikiquette page indicates that it's not inappropriate to elaborate on disagreements; if this isn't the right page for it, excuse my ignorance and redirect me.] [Full disclosure: I am not a member of ASB and had never heard of Ugol's Law until yesterday.] What about Cayley's Theorem? It's named for somebody, and it's relevant only to a tiny subset of the population. It's encyclopedia-worthy because it's true. The principle named Ugol's Law is true and important; ask any clinical psychologist. And it matters to a lot more people than Cayley's Theorem; again, ask any clinical psychologist. It wasn't named by Ugol, any more than Cayley's Theorem was named by Cayley; it needed a name and therefore it was named after the person who first stated it. (Cayley certainly didn't state his theorem in the form it has now; the language it's in now hadn't been invented yet.) There are two differences between Ugol's Law and Cayley's Theorem. One is that Cayley's Theorem can be proved. But rigorous mathematical proof is by no means the only valid standard of knowledge; even physics can't usually attain it, let alone biology, let alone psychology. So this difference doesn't matter. The other difference is that, indeed, descriptively, ASB is marginal and mathematics isn't. But (1) should that be the case normatively? (2) is the purpose of Wikipedia to marginalize the (genuine) knowledge of marginal groups? I know I'm being quixotic about this; I made it my academic specialty because it hurts me when people are bigots without even realizing it. This is an eminently rationalistic form of bigotry, but I don't think my calling it that is any less honest than "the community is already marginal" (which offended me when I first read it, before I decided to interpret it descriptively). I hope you can see this from a perspective other than your own.

<li><b>Keep</b> or, at worst, merge with alt.sex.bondage. While it is obscure, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to provide access to information about subjects that the reader in unfamiliar with. While this is definately an area of marginal interst to most, it is long standing and established usage within its area. --68.104.17.212 05:59, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
