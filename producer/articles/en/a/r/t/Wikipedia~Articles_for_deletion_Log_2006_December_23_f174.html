<p><b>Delete</b> - I place the "mergeto" tag on this article a month ago, but looking again realised that if the Association's journal was mentioned in <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Monarchist_League_69b1.html" title="International Monarchist League">International Monarchist League</a> (its parent organisation), that would actually do the trick. The article was created on 16 May 2006 and has not been edited or expanded since. It has been tagged as unreferenced since the day it was created. The association is not notable, it would seem, and is merely an offshoot of the aforementioned Monarchist League. It doesn't need its own article - there simply isn't anything verifiable to say about it, it would seem. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 00:41, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The group is sometimes called upon by the media to give a response to an anti-monarchist statement, since Buckingham Palace prefers to say "No comment". I added as references two newspaper articles which quote the association in this context. This may address the concerns about verifiability and notability. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 03:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Monarchist_League_69b1.html" title="International Monarchist League">International Monarchist League</a>, which has the same offices and leadership and function.

<dd><b>Comment</b> They are also a seperate function from the Monarchist League as they are focussed on Commonwealth countries and they seem to have branches (Edinburgh and Lothian is quoted). <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tory_Reform_Group_b2ff.html" title="Tory Reform Group">Tory Reform Group</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Mainstream_17e6.html" title="Conservative Mainstream">Conservative Mainstream</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Group_for_Europe_c3ca.html" title="Conservative Group for Europe">Conservative Group for Europe</a> all share the same offices but merit seperate entries because on their own they are worthy of seperate entries. The sharing of an office should not be the criteria to delete an article. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 11:50, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not disputing that they exist and have been referenced in mainstream media a few times. But everything that has (and I think can) be said about them can be said on the page of their parent organisation. That is why merge (which has already happened) and redirect (which hasn't) is the proper solution. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 12:46, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then you should withdraw the AfD and put a merge tag on there. I still tink that you'd be wrong, however no one seems to want to delete this article and so an AfD is not for this article. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 15:53, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I already did put a merge tag on - read the nomination spiel above. Thing is, no one is concerned with the article because it is clearly going to a perpetual stub of a few lines. So merging is the correct action - which I did, simply by expanding on the reference to this offshoot of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Monarchist_League_69b1.html" title="International Monarchist League">International Monarchist League</a> on the article for that page - here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Monarchist_League&amp;diff=96017538&amp;oldid=96016985" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Monarchist_League&amp;diff=96017538&amp;oldid=96016985" rel="nofollow">diff</a>.</dd>
<dd>There seems to be a consensus forming for a merge and redirect - do you agree to that too? I expect that will be the outcome of the AFD and that outcome I would support. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 17:07, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree to a merger and I don't think that 4 votes against 2 is a concensus. This is not the forum for a merge debate which should be off AfD. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 17:10, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Irrespective of forum, if we get the a sensible debate that's what matters. Apart from you and one other user, the users who have particpated want the article to be either deleted or to be a redirect to International Monarchist League (effectively the same thing). --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 20:57, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a book published in November 2006 by a press that doesn't even show up on a Google search. There is no sign that it has achieved notability. However, there <i>are</i> signs that this article is an attempt to give Don Scott and those who share his views on physics a soapbox, namely, the self-references to Wikipedia and how Wikipedia's existing article on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> is "disputed for its neutrality". The article contains no NPOV content about the book, only lengthy direct quotations from its author on why he is right and orthodox cosmology is wrong. In short, this is a POV fork. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:58, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know enough to say "keep" or "delete", but I'd like to point out that there is another, better-known Amanda Carpenter, a romance novelist.

<li>Didn't mean to tweak ya, badly-spelt-Jef; I'm impefect myself! As far as "the publishing world": Regnery has never had much 'street cred' outside the circles of the ultra-conservative community; their sales tend to be mostly to conservative book outlets and clubs, etc. Most are aware of their past history of publishing unlabelled CIA material during the Cold War, their ties with the John Birch Society, and their record of dubiety towards such liberal enterprises as the Nuremberg Trials (only fitting for a firm founded by the son of the founder of the America First Committee). And of course, Wisconsin still remembers Al Regnery's bizarre run for Dane County district attorney against our now-governor, and his record as the "Have You Slugged Your Kid Today?" head of the Office of Juvenile Justice. --<a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemike_a411.html" title="User:Orangemike"><font color="darkorange">Orange Mike</font></a> 23:45, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>JRandazzo created Joe Randazzo which is an obvious <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> as it is autobiographical. Beyond that, he also created Vincent Zambrano and Jose Patino...the two others with whom he made the non-notable short film The Last Request. He also created David Forsyth one of the actors from this short film.

<li>No one ever said that being on IMDB in and of itself qualifies me to have an article about me. Because that would mean anyone who got someone coffee on the set of "G-String Divas" would qualify. But if a film or TV series is listed, then it is notable because not every film or TV series qualifies to be listed. Also, a film festival that is listed on IMDB and is recognized by industry professionals as a major festival is also notable. There are plenty of festivals whose awards are not recognized by IMDB, just as there are thousands of films not recognized. As a matter of fact, one of the qualifications your film must pass is that it has been screened to a wide audience via a major film festival and winning said festival is notable.

<li>I would imagine most regular visitors to this page are well aware that IMDb's criteria and practices are shrouded in mystery, hence the reason many Wikipedia editors are reluctant to trust it as a source when considering the notability of relatively unknown people, films and companies. Unlike Wikipedia which has very clear, prominent explanations and definitions of it's standards for inclusion, IMDb does not reveal any specifics, and has I believe been criticized for this approach. Joe, if you wish to save these articles your only option is to demonstrate compliance with Wikipedia policies and guidelines. "WE ARE ON IMDB! IMDB SAY WE ARE NOTABLE!" will not suffice, no matter how long and loud you scream it. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 16:06, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

See <a href="http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title" class="external text" title="http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title" rel="nofollow">the IMDb eligibility rules</a> here.

<li>Again, I never said that my just being listed on IMDB makes me notable. My ex g/f is on IMDB, she's never done anything above extra work and she definately is not notable. But if a festival or film is recognized, that is notable. And yes, I am relatively unknown, but I will bet that there are many people who are relatively unknown that you can not easily discredit as "not notable." Michael Tadross' name is relatively unknown, yet he has produced Hitch, Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding, Die Hard 3, The Devil's Advocate among other films. Winning a major festival is a notable achievement.

<li>Coverage must be reliable and independent.

It's the number of results, rather than pages of results that matter in the "google test", so you were inadvertently doing yourself a disservice with the 40 figure.

<li>No,he certainly does not. But when disparaging the numbers of one event which is "not noteable," a comparison is necessary.

<li>Joe, dont get hung up on the google test, it is a vague, subjective and secondary <i>indicator</i>.

<p>I prodded the article with the above reasoning. The article creator removed the prod and added to the talk page: <i>"I do not believe this article is worthy of deletion.

Briefly, the Hegelian dialectic process works like this: a diverse group of people (in the church, this is a mixture of believers (thesis) and unbelievers (antithesis), gather in a facilitated meeting (with a trained facilitator/teacher/group leader/change agent), using group dynamics (peer pressure), to discuss a social issue (or dialogue the Word of God), and reach a pre-determined outcome (consensus, compromise, or synthesis).</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is no longer, or never really was, an encyclopedia by traditional standards. It is a reference work containing elements of an encyclopedia, almanac, and gazetteer.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Wikipedia is not defined in relation to "Britannica or Americana standards". It is defined by its own policies and guidelines. Please argue from our guidelines, not from comparisons with other projects. Most editors consider that material suitable for almanacs and gazetteers is quite unsuitable.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> as there seems just enough to make a proper article about someone who had historical notability.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - it looks notable enough, if all the claims in the article are true - needs some more sources.

<li>(EC) I believe the Kidderminster group hold a seat in the UK Parliament, and have been the subject of many non-trivial media reports in reliable published sources. Winning an arbitrary amount of votes, which constitute a tiny fraction of votes cast, with almost half coming in a constituency uncontested by the major parties does not equal notability.

<p><b>Strong keep</b> They exist and can be in no way described as a 'local'!! Their influnece within the extreme-right and neo-Nazi fringes of UK politics is well-demonstrated in the article and their members have overlapped with other, perhaps better-known parties. The returns to the Electoral Commission said two members, but remember that such reports are very new and have caused some upset to fringe groups - I would not place much reliance on this. In any case, whatever the strength of the party now, it has recent historical significance and the article succeeds in demonstarting this and shows the links between organsations and individuals. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 18:10, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Criteria for organizations</b>
<ol>
<li>Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verified</a> by a third party source.
<ul>
<li>Individual chapters of national and international organizations are usually not notable enough to&#160;:warrant a separate article unless sufficient notability is established through reliable and verifiable sources. However, chapter information is welcome for inclusion into wikipedia in list articles as long as only verifiable information is included.</li>

</li>
<li>Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found.</li>

<dd><b>Assertion of notability</b></dd>
<dd>Notability can be asserted for organizations through:
<ol>
<li>Inclusion in third party published materials.</li>
<li>A significant amount of media coverage that is not trivial in nature and that deals specifically with the organization as the primary subject:
<ul>
<li>For example, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, <a href="../../../u/c/_/UC_Berkeley_d44e.html" title="UC Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> enforced a moratorium on alcohol for fraternities and sororities. The moratorium became a much covered topic in the media outlets in the San Francisco Bay Area. While this asserts notability for the moratorium and the Greek system at Berkeley and possibly justifies an article either on the moratorium or the Greek system in general, it does not assert notability for an individual chapter of a fraternity or sorority on campus.</li>

<dd>The following cannot be used to assert notability:
<ol>
<li>Internal documents cannot be used as an assertion of notability. However, they can be used as source material for an article.
<ul>
<li>Internal documents can include, reports, newsletters, press releases, magazines and websites published by the organization itself.</li>

<li>Student-run newspapers.</li>

<dd>The scope of activies are not national or international in scale. No national campaigning for the National Democrats happened in the 1997 General Election, only local compaigning for the small number of candidates they fielded. Had they fielded 50 candidates and qualified for a party political broadcast, I would happily concede that they campaigned at a national level and were therefore notable. However this did not happen, and therefore according to guidelines the organisation is not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 19:22, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somebody altered the original article by adding language that diminished the importance of both editions of the Glossary. Actually, the article was vandalized in my opinion. The original Glossary was well used by scientists for more than forty years before a second edition was deemed required. The first edition was a major addition to science. This article should be restored to the original state and them improved, but the comments that the Glossary became quickly out of date and as such is/was useless was and is not only inaccurate but absurd. Please consider this quote from the AMS:'</p>
<p>"Forty-one years ago, the AMS published the Glossary of Meteorology. Containing 7900 terms, more than 10,000 copies have been sold over four decades through five printings. It is a tribute to the editors of the first edition that it has withstood the test of time and continued to be among the leading reference sources in meteorology and related sciences. This is the electronic version of the second edition of the Glossary with more than 12,000 terms. Along with the print version it should be the authoritative source for definitions of meteorological terms for many years to come."</p>
<p>The editing of the original article is unsupported by any evidence and is a rather silly and ill informed claim that attacks the value of this important book.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> As pointed out by the nominator on the talk page of the article the remaining text is still copyvio. The original author was quite clearly warned in bold text like all other editors that copying from other websites will cause the text to be deleted without further notice. Hence the speedy tag stays. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 18:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I personally don't have a clue whether this guy qualifies as notable or not. I only just found this article on the first day I was doing Dance assessments. The text of the article has been reworded so it isn't a copyright violation any more, I think. I don't really understand copyright that well, though. If someone can produce evidence that he does qualify as notable, they will probably do so. I have mentioned this discussion on the talk page of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Dance_7368.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Dance">Wikipedia:WikiProject Dance</a>. Maybe someone there will know if he qualifies as notable or not. If he doesn't, I would clearly have no objections to the deletion. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:24, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> He basically took the original text and twisted the words around a little bit. That may or may not be copyvio but it is a creative way of trying to avoid deletion due to copyvio. Does this mean that we can copy freely from websites as long as we move the words around a little bit? I seriously doubt that's how anyone else defines copyvio including the law. He did not write the text himself. If he did he should show his sources and we already established long ago that Myspace is not a reliable source of information. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 09:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is a duplicate, in list form, of <a href="../../../g/a/m/Category%7EGames_magazines_f318.html" title="Category:Games magazines">Category:Games magazines</a>. However, it is much <i>much</i> less comprehensive than that category, and seems to list magazines without trying to categorize them in any way (D&amp;D next to poker next to video games). This is a niche enough category that the existing Category page should cover it just fine. <s><b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 08:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<ul>
<li>At this point, appropriate coverage is provided by <a href="../../../g/a/m/Category%7EGames_magazines_f318.html" title="Category:Games magazines">Category:Games magazines</a> and its subcategories. <i><b>If</b></i> kept, the list should be expanded, formatted as a table showing publisher, area of distribution, and similar stats to provide comparison. Sub-lists for the various game types would also be an idea. However, at this point in time, I personally say <b>delete</b>. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 10:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>But <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_game_magazines.html" title="List of game magazines">List of game magazines</a> lists the dates and topics of many of the magazines, which <a href="../../../g/a/m/Category%7EGames_magazines_f318.html" title="Category:Games magazines">Category:Games magazines</a> does not. I have put it into table format. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 11:00, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>rework</b> . The list itself is certainly capable of presenting information in a better form, and I don't see that it should be deleted merely because it's a work in progress. For example, it could be made more like the section here <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_magazines_5df9.html#Hobby_and_Interest_magazines" title="List of United States magazines">List of United States magazines#Hobby and Interest magazines</a>. Since there's no question about the category being a problem, I see no reason to delete this list. I'd rather see it improved. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:01, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>BTW, taking a quick look at the category, and its sub-cats, I see that it's incomplete too, very much so. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>After <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a>'s reworking, I agree that the dates of publication make the list useful. So I guess I'll retract my nomination and say <b>keep, but rework</b>. (For example, the list should still be sorted by topic, not by name; and it should be at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_games_magazines.html" title="List of games magazines">List of games magazines</a> for consistency.) --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 01:56, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you may be misunderstanding how deletion works. We are discussing whether to delete the article in its current form, not in some hypothetical future form. Unless you (or someone else) rewrite the article into something useful which establishes the term's notability, and do so before the deletion debate is over, the article should not be kept. However, a deletion of the article in its current form will not prejudice the creation of a properly-sourced one of the same name at some point in the future. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 10:49, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're confusing several things here. If you're trying to say that Cockaigne is not notable because it is not in current common usage, you haven't understood that encyclopedias also include information on older notable cultural concepts. Use of the term Cockaigne in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale and perhaps two other equally notable works of art would be sufficient reason for a separate article. In addition, you don't understand that Cockaigne is very commonly used in other languages today, so it is commonly used in English translations of these modern and older works. In addition, you're ignoring all the other points raised by myself and others concerning Absurdistan and trying to derail the discussion by only talking about my simile. Are you seriously claiming that a term regularly used even in mainstream media shouldn't have an article in WP? <i>If</i> Absurdistan weren't used in mainstream media and even if it didn't occur in literary magazines, WP would need an article since it already occurred in several works of art ranging from at least one novel and at least one film even to a Mickey Mouse comic book. If you think WP's coverage of cultural phenomena and concepts should be less inclusive than Disney comics, then my last hope is to make you see the fact that Absurdistan is at least as notable as <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banana_republic.html" title="Banana republic">banana republic</a> and not a synonym. --<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspoo_d646.html" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a> 22:43, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

This is the third time the article has been slapped with an AfD by some enterprising user, and frankly I'm sick of how any Internet opinion source (right or left) is automatically assumed to be nonnotable, and any citations on notable blogs, Alexa rankings, significant involvement in political reporting, etc., are waved away as not being/having "reliable sources," yet "personalities" like <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibo.html" title="Kibo">Kibo</a> are justified because <i>Wired Magazine</i> wrote a story 13 years ago.

Saving the time of recreating an article is not a good reason that we, as editors, should assume <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">future</a> notability. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 07:00, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>See, I'm not convinced that they're a non-notable band <i>now</i>. If they definitely miss WP:MUSIC, then there's a problem with that guideline. Non-notable bands simply don't get major label record deals, and having a hard-to-Google name isn't helping. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:13, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Because they are not yet notable: <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> certainly applies. The author pretty much admits as much, right in the article: "You might not be familiar with them yet, but trust us - in 2007 their harmony-drenched guitar-pop anthems will be impossible to avoid." <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 06:57, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>--While their entry is written from what looks like a biased perspective, they are the download of the week on itunes; what weight that gives them as a notable band is debateable, but still, something to keep in mind.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - She wasn't just another Porn Actress who comitted suicide; to leave it at that is to miss several points. She and the times of her life coincided with the rapid ascension of Indian Culture, and may I dare say that for many a Caucasian male (<i>almost shamefully</i>), isn't it safe to assume she might have been the first Indian Girl that for them was a head turner?? I'm quite sure that many of her fans (and future ones as well I might add) will be more inclined and sensitive towards learning about Indian Culture due to the significant impact she had. Furthermore, this may give the average guy a chance at a deeper reflection on Globalization, and the integration of India's economy with other World economies (think Bollywood and Hollywood). While many Wikipedians are well read of course and undoubtedly don't need Angela to have inspired them to have initiated reading on other cultures such as India's ... nevertheless, the average Joe out there might not have paid any attention to all things India otherwise. Lastly, I might add ... she stood out as a stark contrast to the Hollywood model stereotype, and was a vindication to many a male that IS NOT enamored with the thin, toothpick models thrust upon us with every year's passing. This last point is salient because in of itself, in a full discussion, could branch off into many a subject touching on deeper reflection on the dichotomy between Hollywood and the rest of us as we really are.

<p>This is a neologistic term for a porn genre which may or may not exist, but I don't see a lot of evidence that those covered identify themselves under this label, and the article itself states that the definition is disputed even among them. I checked the sources, several of them do not mention the term at all, and others only allude to it. I'd say this fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>/<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, also probably <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:29, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. I think this is more of an advertisement for altporn.net. If we're going to have an article on this it should be called something like "Alternate pornography". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 17:01, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> – Altporn is a very important trend in contemporary pornography and strongly deserving of an article in Wikipedia. Numerous articles in the press about altporn are included as external links and references. (Just because <i>you</i> haven't heard the term before does not mean it isn't in wide use – try Googling it!) As for the term "altporn" rather than "alternative pornography", if you had bothered to read the talk page, you'd see that I posted a Google test demonstrating that "altporn" is the most commonly used label for this genre.<br />
<br />
I have to say, this whole AfD proposal is incredibly misguided. If you don't like the title, the first step is to propose a "Move", not a "Delete". If you think some of the links aren't suitable, delete them. (For the record, I added the Altporn.net link, because I felt it was relevant portal – I have no connection with that site.) If you think some of the facts in the article aren't supported by the references, then edit damn article, dispute it on the talk page, and/or put a cleanup tag on the article. Deleting the article as first recourse is totally inappropriate.<br />
<br />
Full disclosure – while I did not originate this article, I have been primary editor of the article and am listed on the talk page as maintaining it.<br />

<li>So you say. But as the article makes clear, its definition is disouted and there doess not seem to be a good source for the neologism. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:08, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The precise definition and parameters of what constitutes altporn are disputed, not unlike the way the definition and parameters of any number of musical, film, and artistic genres are. The fact that altporn exists as a genre is not in dispute, however. I'll also point to <a href="http://www.gramponante.com/2006/05/vivid-wins-alt-war-without-shot-being.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gramponante.com/2006/05/vivid-wins-alt-war-without-shot-being.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> which points out that Vivid and VCA, which are major porn production companies, are now getting into the altporn market – I don't think this genre would be getting financial backing if it wasn't seen as an important phenomenon. As for the title of the article itself, "altporn", "alternative pornography", "indie porn", etc are all more or less synonyms for this genre and the various terms (<i>including</i> "altporn") are all used in the various articles I have listed under "external links", however, the Google tests that I've pointed to on the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Talk%7EAltporn_2447.html" title="Talk:Altporn">Talk:Altporn</a> page clearly point to "altporn" and "alt-porn" as by far the most commonly used term for this genre. "Altporn" is an established term for an established genre, albeit, a newly established genre. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamcuriousblue_e928.html" title="User:Iamcuriousblue">Iamcuriousblue</a> 22:56, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I should also point out that I have provided <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altporn.html#External_links" title="Altporn">external links</a> to articles on the altporn phenomemon from <i>Bitch</i>, <i>Orange County Weekly</i>, <i>The Stranger</i>, <i>Adult Video News</i>, <i>American Sexuality</i>, and <i>Der Spiegel</i>, which are all reliable hard-copy secondary source magazines and newspapers (albeit, non-academic sources). (True, these references should be better incorporated into the article, but that's not an argument for deletion.) Clearly, news sources attesting to the fact that altporn is real-world phenomenon can and have been provided. The only point of contention, really, is whether the article should carry the title of a relative neologism or not – this means there's legitimate debate as to whether or not to move the article, but I don't think a good case has been made at all for deleting it. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamcuriousblue_e928.html" title="User:Iamcuriousblue">Iamcuriousblue</a> 23:39, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As others have said, altporn has been written about by notable publications and simply because it suffers the same definitions problems as say many music genres is not sufficient justification for deleting it. I do think a debate about what to call the article on this genre of porn is valid and maybe the article name could be change but I don't think the existence of the altporn or whatever one chooses to call is debatable.--<a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECab88_fc4f.html" title="User:Cab88">Cab88</a> 10:23, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prodded by me with the following concern:<br />
Description of a fantasy world in an unpublished book. Wikipedia is not a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">crystal ball</a>. Additionally there's no assertion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, this is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> and is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.<br />
Author removed the mention that it was in a book "started in 2006" whose publication date is <s>"unknown"</s>"unclear", and then deleted the prod tag.

<li><b>Comment</b> - perhaps the reason that IMDb has never heard of "Brum Doctors" is because you're confusing two series - <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brum_%28television%29.html" title="Brum (television)">Brum (television)</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctors_%28BBC_soap_opera%29_f62b.html" title="Doctors (BBC soap opera)">Doctors (BBC soap opera)</a>.

<p>This is probably not a good article for Wikipedia to have. It's like having an article about E. Coli and then another about "Rest of the Bacteria on Earth".

<li><b>Keep</b>: This term has been used prominently in the Washington Post; entire articles have been dedicated to the differences between NoVA and RoVA. It has become a very important term in the press and in the Commonwealth's politics (especially in Northern Virginia). It's very useful to have an article explaining the difference between RoVA and NoVA when the two are brought up. If Wolf is not re-elected for Senate in 2008, the term will be even more common. I can, however, see this being <b>merged</b> with Northern Virginia, but only if the alternative is deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasmallen_15b8.html" title="User:Thomasmallen">Thomasmallen</a> 03:24, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with Deiz; having only one source from the Washington Post makes the term look like it was made up for that one article or is limited only to the Washington Post. One or two other sources would help determine notability.

<p>A School of Tomorrow school is a private school that uses Accelerated Christian Education curriculum. In these classrooms teachers are called supervisors. Students work individually on their work without direct teaching from the supervisor. Student desks are set up with dividers that do not allow students to see each other. Students have American and Christian flags that they place at the top of their desk to signal that they need help from the supervisor. Students correct their own work with score keys that are kept in a central location for all students to use.</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Anderson has been a leading figure on the extreme-right and neo-Nazi fringe of British politics for twenty years or more. If you have not studied a topic, its leading protagonists and players may seem obscure, (don't get me started on rap singers!). Google News is hardly a reliable source here: pick any famous person from twenty years ago and see what comes up! So he may well <i>appear</i> to be unknown. The article clearly demonstrates not only his contribution to extremist politics in the UK, but provides background infrmation useful to anyone wanting to know more about the groups that preceded the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a> and surrround it now. OK, he's never won an election, but that is not relevant because these groups never intended to win elections. To put it in terms that US readers may grasp, you have an article on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a>, but he's never won an election either! Nominator says "negligible share of vote in a handful of constituency elections" but, again, that someone has contested FIVE elections knowing they will lose says more about the politics of the man and his parties than anything else. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 18:02, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I checked that link. The only checkable references are the subject's own webpages. The other cited references include a magazine called Calabasas (which links to The City Of Calabasas), a magazine called OYE (which links to nothing), a magazine called Peace (no link), a magazine called Infamous (which links to a definition of the word) and Playboy. If 4 out of the 5 magazines a band is mentioned in are not notable enough to have Wikipedia entries, it would come to follow that such a band is not notable. I'm going to add the band to AfD too.TruthGal 15:16, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="http://www.calabasasmag.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.calabasasmag.com/" rel="nofollow">Calabasas Magazine</a> exists, and is confined to the LA area (I only know of it because of a Lauren Graham piece from a few months ago). Most likely though it was probably a passing mention, as I can't find anything within their online archive about this band.

<li>Oh, I'm not questioning whether the magazines are legit - I'm just saying that 4 out of 5 of them aren't noatble enough to have Wikipedia pages. And therefore, if a publication that's not notable does an article about a person, one can't then use the article in the non-notable publication to make the case for the person's notability. Or if you prefer - If someone writes about a tree falling in Calabasas Magazine...&#160;;) TruthGal 23:27, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>answer</b> It looks like the site has had a considerable re-work on their site map structure, and that explains all the error links. I requested the AboutUs.org link to be translated in case it provided clues as to were to find coverage, it's not unusual to include such things. Ie, i did request it to be translated as a RS. And in either case, it is a RS <i>about</i> what they say of themselves. #3 of the Shi'a sites on Alexa tells a lot and it is a clear indication of notability, going above <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Islam.org_8dc6.html" title="Al-Islam.org">al-Islam.org</a> (#1 according to Yahoo) and also above <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sistani.html" title="Sistani">Sistanis</a> page, both being very well known Shi'a sites. Only that is enough to establish notability. I mean, it goes even above Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting! We don't care were it is in six month, we are looking at it's notability now. Even if it goes to zero notability in six month, it will still be notable for historical purposes. The external link at <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abd-Allah_ibn_Umar_9639.html" title="Abd-Allah ibn Umar">Abd-Allah ibn Umar</a> was put there as a link to the Shi'a view of the person. Is that supposed to work against this site's notability? Strange logic. Again, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Islam.org_8dc6.html" title="Al-Islam.org">al-Islam.org</a> a site that is #1 of the Shi'a sites according to Yahoo has an Alex ranking of about 45k, while this site has 15k, making it 3 times more popular and visited than <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Islam.org_8dc6.html" title="Al-Islam.org">al-Islam.org</a>. Of course does the numbers of this site change, how is that a argument against its notability?

<dd>I argue that this shows a flaw in the WP:WEB, and this should not surprice anybody considering that it is still in a guidline phase and has not been accepted as a policy. The bottom point is that wikipedia does not cover non-sense, small and trivial issues. We have a consensus here that this site is among the very top of the Shi'a sites regarding popularity. This is enough to establish that this is not a trivial site, no mater how lacking WP:WEB is. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 14:42, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Notability guidelines will almost certainly never be made policy as they're so heavily debated.

<dd>I'm not arguing that we should scrap WP:WEB, of course not. Rather, i'm saying that this seems to be a case that is somewhat of a exception. You see, a large Christian cite will have no problem finding third part full coverage in English, while an Islamic site will have more trouble doing the same. Specially if it is a Shi'a cite. This is most probably natural bias, i mean, is it really so surprising that we have trouble finding English coverage for a mainly Arabic Shi'a Islamic site? Nobody here have tried to make an Arabic search. And we do know from the statistic and numbers available that a Christian equivalent site would have plenty of third party coverage in English. So, is it good or bad for wikipedia to delete a decidedly notable Shi'a site, only due to a lack of English coverage? As for wrting an article, we do have some facts already that are attributed to third parties, such as the Saudi Arabia ban and the numbers. And adding self-evident facts need no third party sourcing, we don't need somebody to tell us that it has a multi language Qura'an and that it has severa language and sections. I agree that we wont be able to have a large and FA article, but we can most surely have a decent stub. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 15:17, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But a <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">stub</a> needs to have potential for expansion - you can't put all the available information in and say that it's a stub, as there's no way it can grow. You raise a good point with the foreign language coverage, it's possible there will be Arabic sources with more coverage of it. We could really do with someone who can speak the language to search. But I'm reluctant to include an article because it <i>might</i> have additional sources, and the onus to find them is on the people arguing to keep. And although you could add self-evident facts, as they have not been mentioned (to the best of our knowledge) in any outside sources, they aren't <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> aspects of the site. We could add articles for any sites popular on Alexa, along with a basic précis of what's on them, but they would just be directory entries. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 15:55, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Im not sure why this article is being deleted. But if it is popularity or significance that is being debated, I can note that the institute that runs the Rafed.net website is a large institute that has branches in 3 countries (Iran, Syria, Lebanon). (says it here in Arabic: <a href="http://rafed.net/aalulbayt/m8a.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://rafed.net/aalulbayt/m8a.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>). The thing with Arabic websites is that they arent very google friendly. Try finding any website using google. Youll have to do a lot of diging. It seems google is set up in a way such that it doesnt have the search capabilities that it does in English or other languages. Maybe it's the way they put Meta tags on Arabic pages or something. But anyway, google isnt a good measure of things when dealing with Arabic websites. And even if you argued that it isn't popular enough, I'd argue that the website is a portal to a ton of information regarding the Shi'i faith. I'd definitely keep it.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 16:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Zereshk just confirmed my suspicion, the problem is not that this site is not notable, the problem is that it is hard to establish this using English googel.

However, that doesn't matter as the burden of evidence lies with the people arguing to keep - you can't keep on the basis that it <i>might</i> have sources. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 19:08, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here are Alexa and Google rankings that <i>contradict</i> the claim of "popularity":

</dd>
<dd>That is why the article may assert that the subject website is a "popular Shi'a" rather than "popular Islamic" website ... it's popularity is in a narrowly defined field ... note that neither Alexa or Google have a category of "Sunni" wesites, although both have categories of "Sufism" and "Islamic Organizations" (subject website is not listed by either <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_directory.html" title="Web directory">Web directory</a> in the latter category, although its parent organization might be), but if any wesites in the Top (pick any number between 1 and 5) of any of these categories have articles in Wikipedia, then they either have some claim of notability other than "popularity" that satisfies <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, or else they should be AfD'd as well.</dd>
<dd>In summary, Alexa and Google may be used as citations for assertions of popularity, but <b>popularity</b> is <i><b>not a factor</b></i> in considering <b>notability</b> as defined by <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which requires that something has been <i>published</i> about them besides the anonymous rankings made by some <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_bot.html" title="Internet bot">Internet bot</a> that tabulates hits and links. --72.75.72.174 21:27, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I dissagree, the "top ten list" is not page ranking based on Google hits, it is a third party assertion to it's notability. Sure, a pure google search gives <a href="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22rafed.net%22&amp;btnG=Google-s%C3%B6kning&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22rafed.net%22&amp;btnG=Google-s%C3%B6kning&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">67 000</a> hits, and i can agree that is not a third party assertion, but when google adds it as number nine to its own list of most popular Shi'a sites: <a href="http://www.google.com/Top/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam/Shia/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/Top/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam/Shia/" rel="nofollow">Society &gt; Religion and Spirituality &gt; Islam &gt; Shia</a> and Alexia makes it <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=180817" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=180817" rel="nofollow">number three on its list</a>, that is most certainly two third party assertion, that is a direct non-trivial statment from Google and Alexa and not something derived from their search engine or general statistics. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 09:06, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not saying that it is notable since its in <i>a</i> directory, im saying it's notable since it is among <i>the top of notable directories</i>, that's a huge difference.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Only one actual review (<i>The Scotsman</i>; the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> was merely a passing mention), and the criterion requires <b>multiple</b> published works; also, although they have <i>appeared</i> on some TV shows, they have not been "subject of a half hour or longer broadcast" (i.e. might have been on for a few minutes, not clear in the article, but this was not a 30-minute show <i>about the group</i>). <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 19:23, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would suggest the Telegraph article contains more than a passing reference, it clearly notes the author had seen the group, described them, and confirmed he had recommended them to his friends. It may be a short reference, but this in itself does not make it trivial. With or without it however, multiple sources now cited so <b>Keep</b></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The amateur status of GAA teams in itself doesn't affect their notabilty.

<dd>Thanks for the heads up, I was thinking about taking up Aer Lingus on one of their Fly-Drive deals. OTOH, as a 2nd division county level team, this team could not compete on the national level, correct?

<p>• *<b>Delete</b>, but a <b>weak delete</b>. Unfortunately there isn't a Wikipedia article for the village of Carrickcruppen, as this article could be merged in as a section. I categorized it as a Armagh GAA club a few weeks ago in the hope someone a bit more knowledgeable on the subject might do a rewrite. (<b>Note</b>: Searching Google using <i>Carrickcruppen</i>, rather than <i>St Patrick's Carrickcruppen</i> will get a lot more relevant results.)

<p>Non-notable group of students. The notability claim is non-verifiable. 30 or more hours of non-stop <a href="../../../i/m/p/Improvisational_theatre.html" title="Improvisational theatre">improvisational theatre</a> is impressive, but how can we verify through independent sources that it happened, the circumstances of the record, how can we have independent confirmation that it is indeed a world record? IMHO, articles should contain only material that has been published by reliable sources (a message board, the only source, is rather unreliable), and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_sources" title="WP:RS">exceptional claims require exceptional sources</a>... <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 19:57, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I prod-ed this article, with the summary: "Article is obvious vanity (or hagiography), books have seven-figure Amazon sales ranks, no evidence of passing the professor test". Prod was disputed: see comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AndyJones&amp;diff=80554719&amp;oldid=79417893" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AndyJones&amp;diff=80554719&amp;oldid=79417893" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

The page is nonetheless clearly promotional in tone. The books mentioned have 7-figure Amazon ranks (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transversal-Enterprises-Drama-Shakespeare-Contemporaries/dp/1403932115/sr=8-1/qid=1166904206/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-4526349-2602218?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Transversal-Enterprises-Drama-Shakespeare-Contemporaries/dp/1403932115/sr=8-1/qid=1166904206/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-4526349-2602218?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">here</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Performing-Transversally-Reimagining-Shakespeare-Critical/dp/0312293313/sr=8-2/qid=1166904266/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/103-4526349-2602218?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Performing-Transversally-Reimagining-Shakespeare-Critical/dp/0312293313/sr=8-2/qid=1166904266/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/103-4526349-2602218?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">here</a>) but one is currently at 176,000 (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Criminal-Transversal-Performance-Dissidence/dp/0801868084/sr=8-3/qid=1166904295/ref=sr_1_3/103-4526349-2602218?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Criminal-Transversal-Performance-Dissidence/dp/0801868084/sr=8-3/qid=1166904295/ref=sr_1_3/103-4526349-2602218?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">here</a>) so on the face of it the subject fails the author test.

<p>Dear Wiki Contributors,</p>
<p>Thank you for the enormously productive responses to our entry on Reynolds. We did not understand what the problems were with the entry, and no one was spelling them out for us. However, the many responses here made it very clear, and very clear what we needed to do to revise -- really rewrite -- the entry. This is what we have done:</p>
<p>1. In response to the criticism that the entry was way too long and like a book review, we have cut down the descriptions of Reynolds’ work to less than half -- leaving just enough to summarize the basic ideas. I think we just got too attached to our write-ups and could not see how they were overkill.</p>
<p>2. We have removed all qualitative and evaluative language from our descriptions -- to ensure <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>3. We have provided <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> to back everything up, to demonstrate <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>.</p>
<p>4. We have included quotations, both positive and negative, from reviews of Reynolds’ work, as can be seen in the entries of other scholars.</p>
<p>5. We have included a section listing recent honours Reynolds received.</p>
<p>6. Further to <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, note that: 1) Reynolds is seen as an expert in his field, 2) by independent academics in the field; 3) his work is well-known; 4) his work is widely cited, 5) Reynolds has come up with a new concept -- a critical theory and methodology: “transversal poetics,” and 6) has received two notable awards/honours for his work. From this it is clear that Reynolds passes every category of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> and not just one as required: “If an academic/professor meets any one of the following conditions, as substantiated through reliable sources, they are definitely notable.”</p>
<p>7. We don’t understand the issue with regard to Amazon’s record of book sales. Reynolds numbers are similar to those of most academics. Most sales of books by academics are to libraries.</p>
<p>We hope that these improvements are enough to keep the entry. Please let us know if we need to do more. For sure, the entry is only improving. Thank you <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorthebug_921b.html" title="User:Gregorthebug">Gregorthebug</a> 19:51, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. To Gregorthebug, if this article is going to have any chance of surviving, <i>all</i> the haigiography has to go, all the reviews, all the incomprehensible gibberish that currently summarises his books. A <i>brief</i> summary of his qualifications and publications, with <i>one</i> paragraph per book that the lay reader can understand, might be sufficient. As it stands, it's irretrievable. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 22:17, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To Tevildo, thank you for the constructive criticism you have provided regarding how the entry could be changed productively so as to have it benefit the wikicommunity as a whole. So far, I have removed one of the pictures of Reynolds, and also per your suggestion have removed all the reviews. I would only like to note that the reviews section was added during our last change (Dec 24 2006) so as to attempt to improve upon the suggestions made by Wafulz and SkierRMH that the article was <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> and massively <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">non-sourced</a>. Nevertheless, the reviews section is now deleted, and moved to the external links sections in the case that other users would appreciate double-checking the legitimacy and sources of Reynolds' books.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I plan to make changes to the summaries of his books. Their length will be shortened, and their language made more accessible to the wikicommunity as a whole. Despite appearances, I thought the language appropriately reflected the academic community in which Reynolds' work is engaged with, but upon further reflection you have made clear how the language could be improved so as to benefit all readers of this entry.</p>
<p>Hopefully our good faith effort to improve this article will generate more positive criticism and suggestions on how to make this a valuable wikientry for the wikicommunity. Sincerely, <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorthebug_921b.html" title="User:Gregorthebug">Gregorthebug</a> 20:07, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If this is a page that needs work, then it would be better to just edit it or mark it for cleanup, along with many pages on Wikipedia that are in the improvement process. Everybody should feel comfortable editing it, as this is a public work. As for notability, this seems somewhat tricky to gauge to me. I should disclose that I do know some of Reynolds' students, which is why I've been following this page. However, I don't have any personal interest in keeping this page or not. <a href="../../../g/c/c/User%7EGccwang_4e7b.html" title="User:Gccwang">Gccwang</a> 22:06, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <b>keep</b>. A UCI professor with an extensive track record is notable. Amazon rank is a wrongheaded measure for specialized academic publications. The article does look like hagiography, but that is an argument for cleaning, not for deletion. I have no dog in this fight, and I don't admire the sort of stuff Mr Reynolds does, but I think he's clearly a valid subject for an encyclopedia article.--<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 23:22, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>To all those concerned,</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that book summaries have been reduced to one paragraph in length, and their language has, hopefully, been ameliorated in response to the concerns raised above. We hope that these changes have gone far in eliminating the hagiographic content of the entry, so that the entry, as a number of wikiusers have noted above, can now be considered for cleaning and editting, and not deletion. (also, we're responsible for making the last set of changes on 02:36, 27 December 2006, but forgot to sign in) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorthebug_921b.html" title="User:Gregorthebug">Gregorthebug</a> 02:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Certainly richly sourced. Perhaps that's the problem: I agree it may still need to be edited down a little. However, without understanding (or necessarily caring) about <i>what</i> this chap is on about, he is clearly making his own distinctive contributions to critical theory and to theatre, and has garnered recognition within academia, and merits retention, in my view. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawn_in_Montreal_5a73.html" title="User:Shawn in Montreal">Shawn in Montreal</a> 02:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Would an encyclopedia say "Transversal theory is, in these early works, delineated through an analysis of its manifestation in the emergent theatrical phenomena of early modern English culture"? This is an admirable degree of precision for a scholarly journal--where the audience is already specifically familiar with the source texts--but it is nigh-unparseable to the layman. 71.57.40.110 00:26, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>agreed, but that's not at issue here. This isn't about whether the article needs to be edited and improved, which as you point out, it does -- as does most of the stuff on WP.

One, Eric Hewitt is a member of Carbon, an extremely notable and #1 ranked team, one of the teams on TV every Saturday, with a lot of media coverage, and is notable just in that. But just in case that doesn't do it, here's some links:<br />
<br />

<br />
I truly hope this the last one of these I have to do for now, but it's probably not.

<dd>I appreciate your work on e-sports in general, but I am seeing a major anti-MLG bias in all your 'delete' votes. I feel that I have gone above and beyond in proving notability in all these AfD's, and that you are against the articles merely because they are members of MLG rather than some other league. Competition is not required to be international under notability guidelines, merely national. These articles have more than enough sources to become good, useful articles, and isn't that what this is (or should be) all about? <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 02:58, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do NOT Delete</b> as Prof. Mohammed is primarily notable with respect to his thesis concerning support for the establishment of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, which is a controversial position for a muslim scholar <a href="http://www.sdjewishjournal.com/stories/aug04_4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sdjewishjournal.com/stories/aug04_4.html" rel="nofollow">(link)</a>. A simple Google search for him makes it clear that he is a well-regarded and well-travelled speaker, especially as to the controversial subject of Israel/<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a>. I would add that information to article but I do not possess enough information or knowledge on that exact subject to add the appropriate content; perhaps a current student or graduate assistant could do so?

<li>Could you explain to me (possibly insert in the article) how he meets the professor test? Prof test means you have to be more than a university professor. If this guy meets the test, can I start writing articles on all my uni professors. I may be willing to accept that he is well known, however, I really haven't seen it in this article. Every professor has had work submitted. What particularly worries me is if this article exists alone because of his support of the State of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>. Having a controversial view alone, does not warrant having your own article. Should we have articles about every Jewish professor who has come to the conclusion that Israel is actually the modern day South Africa? I bet there's a lot more of those. No, they have to be noteworthy because of what they have done with that view (ie many works, and notoriety in a more general sector). Mohammed appears not to have done it. Also, I dont want to judge San Diego State, however I think the academic ranking and population of the school is somewhat important in determining notability. Maybe, I'm wrong. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 04:36, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with Samir ... this is just an average academic who has published one paper a year since 1996 ... while the subject may have <i>written</i> many articles, there has been nothing <i>written about</i> the subject that establishes their notability in their field. According to Wiki policy, it is the responsibility of the supporters to show that the subject satisfies the criteria (in this case <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>), and I cannot find any citations in the article to satisfy <i>either</i> of them. It's not a question of how much they have published ... "notability" is a measure of how much has been published <i>about them</i>, and that is the evidence which the supporters have failed to provide ... none of the "Keep" votes (including <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a>) has offered any indication <b>in the article</b> of how the subject <i>satisfies</i> the criteria, whereas the "Delete" votes only need to say, "I don't see anything that satisfies the criteria". --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennette_c7df.html" title="User:Dennette">Dennette</a> 16:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Same argument as on his brother's page.<br />
<br />
Do we have to go through this again? I already proved both Tom and Dan Ryan's notability in the last AfD, at the end of the last AfD, it said next to both of their names "Determined that this article is note-worthy. Remvoing from AfD." If you want to go on an anti-MLG crusade, that is your right, but please don't use Wikipedia to do it. I'll give you a cut-and-paste of my original arguments. Whether or not you like it, they meet notability.<br />
<br />
Argument #1 "Keep (Tom and) Dan Ryan. They have plenty of sources, such as a full front page section B article in a large paper, The Columbus Dispatch (unfortunately, you must have a subscription to read the archives). They won the 2005 <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Cyber_Games_ff08.html" title="World Cyber Games">World Cyber Games</a> in Halo 2, which according to Wikipedia, is "the largest gaming festival celebrated once a year". A few articles related to that: <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Return-of-the-Kings-US-Gamers-Sweep-World-Cyber-Games-13775.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Return-of-the-Kings-US-Gamers-Sweep-World-Cyber-Games-13775.shtml" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> and they are even mentioned in the BBC News article on the festival, which tries to be mostly focused on the UK participants <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4456288.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4456288.stm" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> Here's a nicely done interview on a large gaming website, GotFrag, if you'd like to add more than "just their MLG standings" <a href="http://www.gotfrag.com/halo/story/6218/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gotfrag.com/halo/story/6218/" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> The argument is that <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a> is notable, they are former members of Team 3D's Halo 2 team. They appear on the MTV True Life: I'm a Professional Gamer as the people to beat that T-Squared just can't defeat. I may be wrong, but I believe that they have been discussed on the gaming channel G4 multiple times. They are #1 and #2 in the MLG league, which I do not believe is non-notable or minor (what other leagues have a TV spot on USA, a channel carried in most homes across the country?) According to Wikipedia notability standards, they belong. They: "are competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable" "have a large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following" I could add more sources, more, better arguments, but I hope that will suffice, as I don't want to spend way more time on this than necessary. If it doesn't I will keep adding, keep sourcing, I will locate better sources (there are just the first few I found). I will even personally re-write anything that has to be changed or added if necessary. Thank you!"<br />
<br />
Argument #2 (was against someone's comment): "Show me some proof that the "global e-sports circut" considers MLG non-notable, for I've never heard of this. This just sounds like your opinion, which group would you rather push? Even if MLG's "PR machine" is "trying to re-invent history" , they're succeeding, because many people, even non-gamers and casual gamers have heard of MLG, and its members get widespread media attention, making them notable by Wikipedia's standards, which is all that matters. This AfD debate is not about whether you like MLG and their set-ups and gametypes or whether or not they're overshadowing "better" leagues, but whether or not they meet Wikipedia standards to deserve an article, which they clearly do."<br />

EGM magazine - the most popular gaming magazine (you can get it in any of your local pharmacy stores) regularly feature MLG and its best teams and players.

<li><b>Keep</b> Do we have to go through this again? I already proved both Tom and Dan Ryan's notability in the last AfD, at the end of the last AfD, it said next to both of their names "Determined that this article is note-worthy. Remvoing from AfD." If you want to go on an anti-MLG crusade, that is your right, but please don't use Wikipedia to do it. I'll give you a cut-and-paste of my original arguments. Whether or not you like it, they meet notability.<br />
<br />
Argument #1 "Keep (Tom and) Dan Ryan. They have plenty of sources, such as a full front page section B article in a large paper, The Columbus Dispatch (unfortunately, you must have a subscription to read the archives). They won the 2005 <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Cyber_Games_ff08.html" title="World Cyber Games">World Cyber Games</a> in Halo 2, which according to Wikipedia, is "the largest gaming festival celebrated once a year". A few articles related to that: <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Return-of-the-Kings-US-Gamers-Sweep-World-Cyber-Games-13775.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Return-of-the-Kings-US-Gamers-Sweep-World-Cyber-Games-13775.shtml" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> and they are even mentioned in the BBC News article on the festival, which tries to be mostly focused on the UK participants <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4456288.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4456288.stm" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> Here's a nicely done interview on a large gaming website, GotFrag, if you'd like to add more than "just their MLG standings" <a href="http://www.gotfrag.com/halo/story/6218/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gotfrag.com/halo/story/6218/" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> The argument is that <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a> is notable, they are former members of Team 3D's Halo 2 team. They appear on the MTV True Life: I'm a Professional Gamer as the people to beat that T-Squared just can't defeat. I may be wrong, but I believe that they have been discussed on the gaming channel G4 multiple times. They are #1 and #2 in the MLG league, which I do not believe is non-notable or minor (what other leagues have a TV spot on USA, a channel carried in most homes across the country?) According to Wikipedia notability standards, they belong. They: "are competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable" "have a large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following" I could add more sources, more, better arguments, but I hope that will suffice, as I don't want to spend way more time on this than necessary. If it doesn't I will keep adding, keep sourcing, I will locate better sources (there are just the first few I found). I will even personally re-write anything that has to be changed or added if necessary. Thank you!"<br />
<br />
Argument #2 (was against someone's comment): "Show me some proof that the "global e-sports circut" considers MLG non-notable, for I've never heard of this. This just sounds like your opinion, which group would you rather push? Even if MLG's "PR machine" is "trying to re-invent history" , they're succeeding, because many people, even non-gamers and casual gamers have heard of MLG, and its members get widespread media attention, making them notable by Wikipedia's standards, which is all that matters. This AfD debate is not about whether you like MLG and their set-ups and gametypes or whether or not they're overshadowing "better" leagues, but whether or not they meet Wikipedia standards to deserve an article, which they clearly do."<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.... First, whether or not gaming is a sport, the gamers are still <b>competitors</b> of the highest level, and Saiyan was a member of Final Boss, the #1 team and the most media-saturated and notable. The team got a $1,000,000 contract to play games, so I would say they'd have to be the top competitors. They're on TV, they're mentioned on virtually every gaming site on the web, and there are more than enough sources to make this a good article. (In fact, I am trying to start a WikiProject:Pro Gaming in order to make these the good articles they can be, here's a link to the proposal for anyone interested: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Proposals#Pro_Gaming" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Proposals#Pro_Gaming" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>) Here's some sources to build an article from:<br />
<br />
Interview with Ryan "Saiyan" Danford <a href="http://www.team3d.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=2490" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.team3d.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=2490" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>, probably the 10th separate link I've found referring to their contract <a href="http://games.kikizo.com/news/200606/134.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://games.kikizo.com/news/200606/134.asp" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>, an interview with NBA star Gilbert Arenas who signed them for 1 mil (he mentions Ryan) <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/gamegurus/hollywoodgoesgaming/20061113-gilbertarenas.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/gamegurus/hollywoodgoesgaming/20061113-gilbertarenas.htm" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>, a link discussing his involvement in the World Gaming Championships (he and his partner were beaten by Ogre 1 and 2) <a href="http://www.gotfrag.com/halo/story/29498/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gotfrag.com/halo/story/29498/" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>, and you can probably find more abut him in any link I gave for Final Boss, Tom Ryan, or Dan Ryan on their AfD's in you still need more links. Again, this is about whether or not they have enough sources, and meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which he does by being a top competitor (it doesn't say athlete, but competitor, making the sport argument completely moot).

For all the vociferousness of the comments, I am unimpressed with the quality of sources to back them up, and especially with the attempts to sell press releases, blog posts, and interested (i.e., not independent) media as reliable sources. So the threshold primary subject of multiple independent sources has not been met. On the other hand, the scraps of acceptable material, especially the Reuters article, show that coverage of the team is acceptable within the right context, in this case the main MLG article (which is also how it is covered in that article). I expect that the exposure of the team will increase, so in due time with more <i>reliable</i> sources it can be spun out, but poorly sourced articles like this one fail the core policies of Wikipedia. I'm redirecting because the team is already covered and I don't see much in terms of sourced material that can be merged, but if anyone has better material than urbandictionary to source the claims, the edit history is still available. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:06, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Not in these cases. The field we are talking about is relatively young and general media have shown no effort whatsoever to inform themselves well regarding the field. Professional gaming is a buzz phrase right now, and whoever shouts loudest (or whoever gets the biggest investment to put into a communications department) "wins" the media attention. This is exactly the case with these MLG related articles. I think we should be weary regarding "bought" media attention. Nonetheless, the point was that they were hardly mentioned by electronic sports media. Eg, the media specialized in the field has deemed them hardly notable. -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjith_4679.html" title="User:Djith">DJiTH</a> 23:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I appreciate your work on e-sports in general, but I am seeing a major anti-MLG bias in all your 'delete' votes.

<dd>But is notability based on whether something is discussed by the experts in the field or if it is known by the average Joe? Far fewer people have heard of eSports than happen to click across USA Network while surfing cable. I'm still up in the air about the article since the original quality of the writing obscured whether it might be notable. I think our criteria in evaluating some of the stars of eSports (<a href="../../../k/s/h/Ksharp.html" title="Ksharp">Ksharp</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/HeatoN_c6b1.html" title="HeatoN">HeatoN</a>) was whether they could make a living doing it. If these kids on Final Boss get paid $60,000 a year, I think they pass that criteria. They may not have been at the top of their profession for 5 years, but it sounds like they have been for 2-3 years. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 18:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> This would be the Team 3d of console gaming. Djith it is strange that you claim EG hardly finds them notable when they "were" Team 3D. I would need to see citations for you claim (or maybe that was your opinion?). The fact that non-gaming industries find them notable only makes your argument seemingly more bias and anti-MLG. Your claim that this industry is based on who is willing to push more money out differs from other industries in what way? Of course all of that is irrelavent to the fact that media attention paid for or not is a guideline for notablility. The more media attention the more notable (at least in the case of the current entertainment industry). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 06:05, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Regarding <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a>, 3D is a major e-Sports club, that in the past, had players that now play for MLG Team Final Boss under contract.

For the results of the former HALO squad alone, it may not be. Regarding the accomplishments now listed at Team Final Boss, it would be highly dubious to take achievements players had at one club to a new club.

<dd>Yes, because coverage by an independent television network and multiple gaming sources is clearly not as worthy as the true keepers of the flame, Gotfrag.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This clearly passes WP:BIO with flying colors. This team is currently the Halo 2 national champion team. MLG is a major gaming league which receives equal if not more coverage than <a href="../../../c/p/l/CPL_3e40.html" title="CPL">CPL</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> They've been the subject of a Gamespot article (neutral gaming source), and a Reuters release (non-gaming source). Considering how many such teams get that sort of coverage, I'm satisfied with notability. I agree with hahnchen that if these people are mostly known only because they're in Team Carbon, we should have one team article instead of several individual ones. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 11:28, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is a weak claim of notability here, since it is claimed that he played for a minor league baseball team for a "stint". Not sure how long a "stint" is, or if he played, or if this is <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> since there are no references. Since he is today playing hockey at Northern Iowa, I think it more likely this is a gentle attack page. His fellow hockey players are saying he left hockey for baseball. Or maybe a vanity page.

<li>As nicely as possible, in the opinions expressed above there is a <i>claim</i> to notability without any supporting evidence other than "hits." In particular "<i>a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works,"</i> and all of the listings I have seen have clearly been "trivial." Do we have, for example, an article in <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired.html" title="Wired">Wired</a> talking about this particular bit of code, telling us why it's more important than some others? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 23:40, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would argue that software products (i.e., virus/malware-removal products) and their associated websites qualify as "published works," and that since SpywareStrike is a significant piece of malware that is featured (and neutralized by) those products/websites, that it meets the standard you are proposing. Some of the malware-removal products that include removal of SpywareStrike include major products with millions of users. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 13:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. IMDB has nothing on this person and the only credits I could find are two executive producer credits which may or may not be this person. <b>First, I cannot be responsible for errors on IMDB. The projects I worked on were produced with the BBC while I was in London and through them once I returned to the United States.

<p>3. I can find nothing to corroborate the claim about co-founding the American University in Dubai. <b>You could start by asking me directly first, I'd be glad to provide such information.

<p>4.
