<dd>The Christianity articles are more well developed... they may be at a level where it makes sense to create verses and put them in an understandable context... also, Bible verses don't involve such sectarian struggles that hadith do. So, under that logic I'd probably keep a Qur'an verse if it had information but I'd delete most hadith. (also, where do these names come from?) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 22:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More developed is great, lets have it more developed. The arguement "involve such sectarian struggles" only makes the hadith more notable, not less. People dont "struggle" about non-notable stuff. Exactly what about the article lacks context? If you could point it out, i would be happy to fix it, since i cant see what is out of context right now. Further, people dont end up here out of the blue, they have probably cliked through some article to get this deep in, and if nothing more, that should give them <i>some</i> context. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 23:51, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete or merge</b>. We're missing a whole layer of articles necessary to make individual hadith articles worthwhile.
