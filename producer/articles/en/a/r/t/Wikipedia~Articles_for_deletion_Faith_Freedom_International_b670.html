<li><b>Keep</b>: The problem is this: There are trillions of less notable pages here and they dont get deleted. Why? Because no one cares. But in this case, in case of stuff that is critical of Islam, there are lots of believers who will do anything to get any Islam-critical article deleted. They'll apply all the policies they can to get the stuff out. Thats whats going on. There's a huge opposition to criticism of Islam. Its unfair for material that is anti-Islamic. Obviously Ali Sina is vehemently opposed by Muslims. Maybe the present Islam-critique effort should be focused on Criticms of Islam sections. The big problem there is the Revert wars. Somehow that has to be resolved. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 19:32, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I propose that you go and "care" about the neglected articles, instead of that we treat this article as a neglected article. The issue is not what views the web site has, the issue is if it is notable. Do we have third party sources covering this web page? Why is this web page notable? . --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 19:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thats what I'm saying. Usually any other lesser-known XYZ person wouldnt have a problem staying in on Wikipedia, but Ali Sina has a problem because of the large group of people who detest him and his views. Right? The bigger problem though is not the existence of Ali Sina. That can be solved and reliable sources can be found. I have no doubt. The bigger problem is endless revert wars in any controversial article and Wikipedia's inefficiency to deal with this scenario. I'm thinking about what can be done. Even if we focused our efforts on Islam-critical articles, Muslims want to revert every word we add in. They will do it if they can. This is the bigger problem. Its not limited to articles about Islam. It applies to any controversial article. Most of the articles on Wikipedia are not controversial. No one cares about the article <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider.html" title="Spider">Spider</a>. You wont see revert wars going on there. But on topics with strongly different opinions and where editors of different beliefs are editing, thats where the problem lies and currently, Wikipedia doesnt have any policies about how to deal with this effectively. New policies have to be made to deal with this. This is what has to be solved before Criticism of Islam can proceed successfully. I dont know whats a good solution for this. Again, obviously when trillions of other lesser known people exist on Wikipedia, its unfair that Ali Sina was singled out. The policies were applied on him strictly, only because all the Muslims on Wikipedia are opposed to his presense. This is a fact. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 20:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I lack a dog in this fight, but I disagree on some points you raise and wanted to comment. First, please don't take this the wrong way, but please know that <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_is_no_cabal.html" title="There is no cabal">there is no cabal</a> against criticism of Islamic thought. Second, the people who comment on AfD typically have <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral points of view</a> about the subjects being considered - no one is out to get a category of articles; we're only interested in notability and appropriateness for the encyclopedia. We're mostly editor geeks - not politicos. Third, I care about <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider.html" title="Spider">spider</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a>, and all other articles about notable things (and you will, in fact, see some strange revert wars going on in articles like that sometimes. Like I said, editor geeks.) However, wikipedia does have good policies for dealing with editors with different points of view - I'd point you to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. When there's a question of which point of view to include, the answer is simple: neither. If there are disputes, there's a procedure for <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">requesting comment</a>. When there's a question of whether an article should be deleted, the article comes here for outside comment. To my mind, no new policies are needed to address that. And, finally, if there are non-notable articles on wikipedia, it's our goal here to smoke them out regardless of subject - you can help by finding articles about non-notable people and sending them to AfD. With that said, I have no idea whether this particular article is notable, so this is just a <b>comment.</b> --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 22:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bob, like I said: there are 100's of articles right now lacking RS. Why was Ali Sina singled out? Because all the Muslims in Wikipedia want him out. You say there's no cabal - do you know of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Islam%7EThe_Muslim_Guild_0890.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam:The Muslim Guild">Muslim guild</a>? It existed until recently. What do you think its purpose was? These people are here to kill Criticism of Islam. Sadly, they wont succeed. The only sad thing is like I said: Ali Sina was singled out for deletion when there are 100's of other articles lacking RS, only because Muslims dont want to see Islam being criticized. Thats common sense. As for RFC, here's the thing: there's a dispute on every edit of the Criticms of Islam section (and its related articles as well). Therefore, filing disputes like this is not efficient. What I'm thinking is, some sort of policing should be done to make sure stuff is not reverted without discussion on the Talk page and anyone who does revert like that, should be suspended for some time. This hsould apply for any highly controversial articles. Do you still think RFC can deal with the edit warring that goes on constantly on an hourly basis on Islam-critical sections? --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 23:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Someone wiser than me once said that <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_of_wisdom_e960.html#There_is_only_a_cabal_if_you_want_there_to_be_one" title="Wikipedia:Words of wisdom">there is only ever a cabal if you want there to be one</a>. But even if you want to think that some particular group of editors <b>have</b> "formed a cabal," the fact remains that Wikipedia contains checks against that type of POV-pushing - such as AfD.</dd>
<dd>In any event, I'd ask you to consider the possibility that this article was "singled out" only on the good-faith belief that its subject may be non-notable. In that regard, you may want to review <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">the requirement that we assume good faith</a> - I wouldn't assume that any marking of an article for deletion is based on bad-faith religious bias of some sort.</dd>
<dd>If you think there are 100's of other articles without reliable sources that should also be deleted - bring them here for deletion. It's good for the encyclopedia. That we haven't gotten around to discussing other articles yet doesn't mean that we are "targeting" the article we <i>are</i> discussing.</dd>
<dd>Do I think that RfC and our other processes can deal with edit-warring when dealing with difficult and controversial subjects? Yes - because I assume good faith. Will it always work? Nope. Will it be easy or efficient? Not a chance. But the alternative - assuming bad faith and cutting off editing of the encyclopedia - is far more damaging to the project than any amount of editing warring can ever be. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 00:26, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bob, none of us infidels care about an XYZ obscure Islamic leader having his page. But these people do care about Ali Sina and they'll try all they can to get him out of here. Can I remind you that attempts were made to delete Category:Former Muslims and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_left_Islam_6892.html" title="List of people who left Islam">List of people who left Islam</a>? See whats going on there? Thats what they do. Islam won over Wikipedia in this case because <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakir_Naik_b802.html" title="Zakir Naik">Zakir Naik</a> was allowed to stay and Ali Sina was deleted. Ali Sina cant come out in public and debate, or else he'll be killed. I dont have the time or desire to go and battle pages of obscure Islamic figures into deletion, none of us cares about that. But for muslims Ali Sina is prominent and must go. With 80,000 hits on Google, a high ranking website and debates with famous Islamic figures he's much more notable than so many other folks on Wikipedia i.e. he obviously passes the professer test because he's well more well known than the average college professor. These guys have the guts to say he's non-notable, when infact each one of them knows of his name since a long time. The basic problem is the selective application of the policies. We're getting some good third party sources now. The admin was unfair and did not allow us time to put these sources in. After a good number of sources are in, I will attempt a request for undeletion of this page. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 02:47, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Matt is right. There is definitely a cabal to uproot any criticism of Islam. It is no secret that Muslims do not like their faith critiqued and they have killed those who dare to. So it is shortsighted to believe these very Muslims suddenly become disimpassioned about their religion when they become editors of wikipedia. Show me one Islamic country where the critics of Islam are not in jail. I also agree with Matt, this matter requires some serious consideration; otherwise what suffers is fairness in wikipedia. Furthermore the Ali Sina article was deleted illegally. ‘’’The votes were 18 to 17 in favor of Keep.’’’ As the result that article should be reinstalled. If the result of voting is not going to be respected, why vote at all? Faithfreedom.org has received over four million unique visitors in the last 15 months and it received one million page views per month. This movement of the ex-Muslims is entirely Internet based. It can’t have any other way to operate or its members would become target of assassination. Its popularity should only be measured based on how many visits it receives. Faith freedom International has over half a million entries in Google.

<dd>While I do disagree with your views on that, I know full well that I have zero chance of convincing you that Wikipedia isn't being overwhelmed by a Muslim cabal, so I'll just leave it at that. One note, though - AfD is not a "vote," it's a discussion. If, for example, two people made persuasive delete comments ("This article fails WP:Band"), and 50 people "voted" keep based only on something entirely non-persuasive (e.g. "but we really like our friends' band!") - an article would be properly deleted. It's a discussion, not a vote. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 15:40, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems that lots of wikipedia editor are having some "personal agenda and bias" towards criticism in any manner which is against the freedom of speech. I think these editor are trying to kill the best knowledge source on internet (wikipedia) by this kind of attitude. So as a normal web surfers, now we have to look on other sources for right information if this attitude continues for longer period here. Pas1975 21:58, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you, Striver. WorldNetDaily only did one story on Ali Sina and FaithFreedom.org (so far). I know other online journals have done stories as well, and some of them, like the WND article, are pointed to as external links at the bottom of the Wikipedia article about FaithFreedom (as discussed at the top of the talk page). I expect more articles will be appearing in secondary sources when Dr. Sina's first book is released publicly this coming year, at which time there will be an even greater need for an article on FaithFreedom.org and/or Dr. Sina here at Wikipedia.org than there has been here already. I'm sorry, Striver, but I do not know the meaning of the abbreviation RS. What is RS? 72.136.43.94 01:57, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, again, Striver. I consider WorldNetDaily a reliable source. I know they have a point of view, but they are careful about making sure the facts back up their point of view. The editor in chief, Joseph Farah, has over 30 years experience in the mainstream newspaper business, including work as the top editor at a major newspaper. WND sends out independent investigative journalists to places in the world and writes their own copy rather than simply relying on Reuters, etc. As for the previous unsigned commentator in this thread who called it a "right wing propaganda organ" that is true in the objective sense but false in the perjorative sense of the meaning of the word "propaganda" (i.e. "to propagate ideas" vs. "to propagate ideas through lies", respectively). It is thanks to the propagation of certain ideas promoted by the editor in chief at WND that my thinking moved away from knee-jerk liberal responsiveness to thoughtful consideration of all points of view, left, right, center and others. In short, WND is well written independent journalism and no amount of slagging off against it will change that fact. I only wish they would give Ali Sina and FaithFreedom more space on their site. One exclusive article back in September, 2004 is not enough. I'm sure, however, that when Ali Sina's book is published, WND will give it some more coverage, though. Oh, and one more thing. Would people please refrain from referring to WorldNetDaily as a "blog". I know what a "blog" is, and WorldNetDaily is much more than a mere blog. Would you call Al Jazeera or MSNBC blogs?

I am a muslim but I never wrote anti christian or athiesm or any other material. why is this bias only with muslims. plz matt explain me. all the reference comes from either FFI site or sister site why not provide NPOV sites which claim FFI or Ali Sina is notable. Even Ali sina Existence is Disputed how can we have his page and his website page if his existence. I think this site is run by anti muslim bias group. matt57 people like FFI web admins and u are trying to increase the hatred towards islam and muslims fall in this hatred and hate the western world even though there are lot of westerners who are neutral and not bias. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMak82hyd_866c.html" title="User:Mak82hyd">Mak82hyd</a> 02:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You seem to be confused about which notability guidelines we are using here. Under <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, an organization must be verified to have a certain scope (such as "international"). However, we are using <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> here, and there is no such requirement. It doesn't matter if they claim to be international and they aren't really (although obviously any Internet site is "international"). It doesn't matter if they have an office or a snailmail address that you can mail them at. Read WP:WEB very carefully and you will see that geographic scope and mailing address are not mentioned there. This particular concern is irrelevent. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 00:14, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There have been many underground organizations in the history some of them with huge impact. FFI is very much known even though most of its contributors do not use their real name. Only because an anonymous group of people have managed to create so much fear in Muslims it is worth mentioning it. As for Ali Sina’s anonymity, it is only a speculation. He has been silent on that question and maybe because he prefers his enemies think he is not using his real name so they don’t go after him. A man whose existence is disputed and has managed to stir this much emotions makes him notable. We can’t blame him for using a pseudonym when he is constantly under the threat of assassination.

<dd>Okay, well no reply even though I left the same question on your talk page and you made other contributions after that. Let me discuss "rewriting." I'm going to assume that your issue is that the article should be rewritten to be more NPOV since that's what so many other "delete" votes have been, although my argument applies equally to all requests for rewrite-or-delete. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Problem articles where deletion may not be needed</a> explains that in NPOV cases, deletion is not the answer, but tagging is. The point is that an NPOV problem, unlike a notability problem, can always be solved by better editing and so there's no need to delete. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion#How to discuss an AfD/Wikietiquette</a> says "<i>The argument "non-neutral point of view" (violates WP:NPOV) is often used, but often such articles can be salvaged, so this is not a very strong reason for deletion either.</i>" And at the top of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a> it says "<i>For problems that do not require deletion, including ... POV problems, be bold and fix the problem or tag the article appropriately.</i>" Over and over again we see that if a problem <b>can be fixed by rewriting</b> then there is <b>no argument for deletion</b>. "Rewrite-or-delete" is simply not a valid argument, because it sets up a false dichotomy. The reality is don't-delete-because-rewrite-is-possible. You've said that you want a rewrite, so you feel that rewrite is possible, therefore you don't have any grounds to call for deletion. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 11:14, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No you are mistaken - there was a consensus and the result should have been keep BUT the admin felt the page had too few cites (which I agree with him as a result). This was a technical reason regarding the mechanics of the actual article not actual notability reason. Ali Sina is still notable enough person to be quoted as they have contributed to a book by a notable person in this field of Islamic apologetics though as yet no article would stick (which has different criteria for inclusion). <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 09:16, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I'm pretty sure that the FFI stuff on Humanists.net is written by Ali Sina. However, that is immaterial to the notability. What matters is that the Institute for Humanist Studies <i>are republishing</i> his FFI work, and that fulfills criterion 3, which says "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators". It doesn't ask for the content to be rewritten in someone else's words. I am also disappointed with the "Palestinians celebrate" stuff, and I think that Sina is unfortunately repeating some nasty far-right talking points there. But whether or not I respect him has nothing to do with the organization's notability, which is clearly established by IHS's republishing, even without regard to others' arguments for notability above. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 16:45, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In principle the two are no different if the organization providing the tools is in explicit approval of the subsite's contents. And even if it didn't count for criterion 3, then the IHS's inclusion of FFI on their site would reduce to an instance of criterion 1, and would be another cite in addition to the WorldNetDaily cite. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 17:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

And regardless of how inclusionist they may be, the statement I quoted above, "...whose Web presence has the potential to contribute to the health of the global secular or humanist movements..." shows that they aren't just hosting, but they are explicitly approving of what they host. That's in principle the same as republishing, so it satisfies criterion 3. And I maintain that if it did not, it's still approval and citation thus criterion 1. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 17:45, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

There is the issue of explicit, stated approval of FFI's work here, and that distinguishes it from mere hosting with TOS. In any case, the requirements are not that lenient.

Well, it's a symposium with a Muslim activist who is a board member of a mosque, and Ali Sina <i>who is introduced solely in the context of being "the founder of Faith Freedom International"</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> says criterion 1 is: "<i>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself</i>". This would apply to apologetics sites <a href="http://faith-freedom.org" class="external text" title="http://faith-freedom.org" rel="nofollow">faith-freedom.org</a> and <a href="http://faithfreedom.com/" class="external text" title="http://faithfreedom.com/" rel="nofollow">faithfreedom.com</a>, would it not? The sources (such as the Qur'an) that they use to argue against FFI are independent of FFI itself, and the sites themselves are far too extensive to be called trivial. That would make two more instances of criterion 1. And there's also <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224081904/http://www.icssa.org/alisinaface.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224081904/http://www.icssa.org/alisinaface.html" rel="nofollow">this coverage</a> by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Centre_for_Strategic_Studies_and_Analysis_db46.html" title="Independent Centre for Strategic Studies and Analysis">Independent Centre for Strategic Studies and Analysis</a> (the site is down at the moment so I grabbed the Web Archive). ICSSA is independent and their coverage is also non-trivial, and their site wasn't set up <i>just</i> to counter FFI (although neither was faith-freedom.org which is a redirect to part of a larger site). So these citations, especially ICSSA, seem to be solidly in the camp of WP:WEB criterion 1, making at least five separate non-trivial instances by my count (WorldNetDaily, FrontPageMag, ICSSA, f-f.org, ff.com); did I miss any others? And I'm still convinced that the IHS's hosting with explicit endorsement of content is in principle no different from republishing. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 22:22, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you mean the third link I gave? Obviously the first and second reference FF since they named themselves after it. So I will assume you meant the ICSSA link. First of all, let me discuss the two FF-named sites, faith-freedom.org and faithfreedom.com, as I think you misunderstand the WP:WEB requirements. Read criterion 1 again: "<i>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i>" Nowhere does it say that the third-party sources have to be notable enough to have their own Wikipedia articles. It just says they have to be <i>non-trivial.</i> This, itself, is a non-trivial distinction. For example, in an article on a scientific phenomenon, we might use the existence of articles in certain published peer-reviewed journals to establish notability. There are literally thousands of such journals that would be acceptable for this purpose, and they are not all notable enough to bother having Wikipedia articles made for them, but they would still be non-trivial and acceptable to use to justify notability for a scientific phenomenon. This is the difference between notability and non-triviality. They are not the same and one bar is lower. I submit that the FF-named sites are extensive and referenced enough to be considered non-trivial here. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 02:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

Anyway, the set of examples at WP:WEB is obviously for the kiddies. It's a very simple "how to" but not at all binding; in the real world we have fuzzy situations and we have to argue the distinctions on their merits. Saying that my links are not like the examples given is not, alone, an argument. My point regarding use of non-notable yet non-trivial citations for other articles, like scientific phenomena, still stands. We can use them in such instances so I see no reason not to here, espcially when the guideline specifically says non-trivial, not non-notable. Faithfreedom.com, for instance, might not be notable enough for its own article, I'll grant you that. But that doesn't automatically mean that it's not a valid citation for something that is more notable, like FFI. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 04:15, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now, regarding the ICSSA link, you say it's all about Ali Sina and not about FF. The link I gave is an article on the ICSSA site that references a debate between Ali Sina and Yamin Zakaria. Perhaps you have forgotten what the early Faith Freedom site was primarily about. It was <b>anti-Islam with an gimmick offer to remove the site</b> (later with $50,000 tacked on to the offer) for anyone who could defeat Sina in a debate about Islam. The first two lines of the front page were: "The movement of ex-Muslim secularists and humanists to lead Muslims out of faith of hate and into the fold of humanity WE WILL REMOVE THIS SITE IF PROVEN WRONG."<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040605193200/www.faithfreedom.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20040605193200/www.faithfreedom.org/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> Faith Freedom hinged its very existence on the debate offer, became synonymous with the debate offer. Zakaria took up the debate, hoping to take the money and use it for some Muslim charity and to shut down Faith Freedom's website, and then the debate was catalogued on both sites, Faith Freedom<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051130070702/www.faithfreedom.org/debates/YaminZakariaindex.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20051130070702/www.faithfreedom.org/debates/YaminZakariaindex.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and ICSSA<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224081852/www.icssa.org/yameendebate.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224081852/www.icssa.org/yameendebate.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The ICSSA copy of the debate even discusses and links to Faith Freedom.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050406004604/icssa.org/yamindebate8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050406004604/icssa.org/yamindebate8.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> So if the ICSSA site is discussing and linking to Faith Freedom in the context of the debate, <i>and the debate took place with Zakaria's intent of shutting down Faith Freedom,</i> then it's pretty hard to say that the ICSSA site is all about Sina but not about Faith Freedom. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 02:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>So? Even plenty of <i>trivial</i> sources that add up to a nontrivial set of information can be useful. Moreover, the site itself is arguably a good provider of information about itself. Nonetheless, the motives of the person behind it are poorly understood - I take it for granted that he thinks Islam sucks, but don't know much other than what he says. This is where third-party sources might be useful, as well as in calculating its effect. And even numerous trivial sources exploring different facets of the site can add up to a nontrivial source. — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 19:01, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article was only linking to the old archive entry page. The article has now been updated, and as you can see the FFI site is much more than a motto.

<dd>Thanks for ur comments. I dont think the article has been made NPOV. I still suggest the article should be deleted as the site just shows HATE towards a faith and suggest killing of all muslims. I can never support a site like this and any site which is full of hatred towards innocents. even if a muslim site comes up and suggest all americans be killed wherever they are as they have invaded countries and killed innocent people, 'I will never support it'. killing anybody in the name of religion and in the name of terrorism cannot be justified, unless for self defense in combat situation like war in Iraq and Afghanistan(when Some country just come and attack your country for OIL or Personal agenda, claiming excuses like terrorism, WMD etc. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMak82hyd_866c.html" title="User:Mak82hyd">Mak82hyd</a> 22:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mak82hyd, if you are admitting that your concerns about notability and sourcing have been resolved, and the only reason you have left for voting "Delete" is because you don't like the content of the site, then your vote won't actually be counted. We have plenty of hate sites already, like <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.org.html" title="Stormfront.org">Stormfront.org</a>. I don't believe that FFI is a "hate site", but in any case it doesn't matter, if it were that still wouldn't count against the FFI article one bit. You don't get to simply have a "vote up or down" here; you have to actually give reasons why the site is or is not notable. If you can't give such a reason (that hasn't already been addressed above) then your vote won't mean anything, sorry. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 23:37, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mak82hyd: FFI is not advocating violence. It is a site made by ex-Muslims created to oppose the ideology of Islam. I am afraid you are not being truthful when you say “The author wants all Muslims to be killed”. Plese provide a link. It is clear that you do not like anyone criticizing Islam. What you are doing is character assassination with libel. Assuming what you say is true, which is not, still FFI remains notable and has to have an article in Wikipedia. What we are witnessing here is censorship. Muslims do not tolerate criticism of their religion. They will try to silence anyone who dares to speak against their faith. Why all the Muslims, including their top politicians, were outraged over Pope’s statement on Islam? Some of them even called for his death. Muslims should learn to tolerate criticism. This long discussion jsut shows how intolerant they are of those criticizing their faith. <a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanSplash_1197.html" title="User:OceanSplash">OceanSplash</a> 3:34 10 Dec. 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Along with other former Muslims such as Ibn Warraq, Sina is spearheading what may be the first organized movement of ex-Muslims in Islamic history, ….It is no exaggeration to say that if the likes of Ali Sina, Ibn Warraq and Wafa Sultan prevail in the face of the traditional death penalty for leaving Islam, then Islam will never again be the same." Obviously both Ali Sina and FFI are notable enough. We might actually be wittnessing the start of a real revolution in Islamic world. This is worth reporting. Obviously Muslims are not very pleased with this situation and will do anything to censor it. <a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanSplash_1197.html" title="User:OceanSplash">OceanSplash</a> 9:58 11 Dec. 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, some good stuff here. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Ball_7d82.html" title="Jim Ball">Jim Ball</a> is a talk show host on Sydney's <a href="../../../2/g/b/2GB_2883.html" title="2GB">2GB</a> radio station which has been in business for 80 years. His coverage (and he explicitely mentions Faith Freedom) is very notable. <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian.com.html" title="Iranian.com">Iranian.com</a> is also pretty heavy, and they are publishing Sina on there representing Faith Freedom at the link you gave. With these two, plus ICSSA's apologetics, IHS's endorsment, WorldNetDaily's article, and FrontPageMag's symposium, we're safely into notability. I'm still going to be picky and ask you to keep in mind, OceanSplash, that anti-Scientologist and anti-Creationist articles get the same AfD maneuvers pulled on them, so don't overlook the wider scope of the problem. But you were dead on earlier when you said "<i>It is funny that Ali Sina’s article was deleted under the pretext that he was not notable. Now we are told that he is notable, it is FFI that is not notable.</i>" —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 10:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>no vote</b> It is strange that there is a lesser notability threshold for websites than for people. Those sources that are provided do not even begin to meet WP:BIO. Not even close... but they are multiple. I have not seen conclusive evidence for more than one of them being non-trivial... so i advice closing admin to take a really close look at the evidence provided and ask himself: <i>"Do we want to include all the websites that can bring fourth an equal un-impresive and borderline list of third party coverage"</i>? "Ali Sinai is the owner/host/random of FFI" is hardly non-trivial. Or is it? Does mutliple occurences of that equal it to one non-trivial coverage? Should a traffic rating of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.faithfreedom.org%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.faithfreedom.org%2F" rel="nofollow">24,746</a> considered a merit? i don't know. In any case, i don't feel comfortable voting delete to this. But i would like to point out that PrisonPlanet, a site that is infinetly more refered to by third party source and has a rating of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=prisonplanet.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=prisonplanet.com" rel="nofollow">5,972</a> was deleted as nn. To the closing admin: I will take the result of this afd as setting a precedence. Do we want a bunch of sites with this merit? Remeber that notability is a key issue of WP. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 12:24, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You think even the ICSSA thing is trivial? When the very purpose of the debate was to shut down Faith Freedom? Is the FrontPageMag symposium trivial if Sina was invited solely because of his FFI work? Several of the other Sina/FFI pieces are also of the Sina-is-here-because-of-FFI sort. Two Muslim websites, faith-freedom.org and faithfreedom.com, have been registered just to fight against FFI; is that trivial? I keep seeing people say "trivial, trivial" but there's no explanation of why or how. Nobody's explained to me how ICSSA's coverage is trivial, for instance, and that's been sitting here for a couple of days during which anyone could have responded point by point. And by the way, I just checked WP:BIO and the first criterion is "<i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</i>" Which is plainly what we have here, though I've argued that since all the Sina coverage has been because of FFI then it should count as such, yet it was argued elsewhere that such coverage was not notable for Sina and now here somehow it's not notable for FFI either? It's starting to feel like we're just getting the run-around. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 19:31, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, just as with many other websites--it's going to be hard to find 'neutral'/reliable outside commentary about this site. In a sense it's notable... but in a sense it will always create problems like <s>FFI</s>Islamonline and other such sites have. <small>that's my comment from Islamonline vfd</small><a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 00:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
