<li>Changing my vote to <b>weak keep, pending expansion</b>. I see the point of some of the other Wikipedians here, to an extent: He <i>did</i> make it to the top 10, he did manage to hang on for two shows, and the article doesn't look half bad for a stub or substub, after cleanup.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I'm the fellow who wrote the entries for Thinking-East.Net and Registan.Net. I did so because I feel that they represent a corner of the blogosphere (so to speak) that shall become more and more important as Central Asia--the region they cover--becomes more important. In retrospect, I agree with you: the original entry was too promotional. Too much enthusiasm. I have since gone back into the entry and excised most of the URLs and biased material. Also, while Thinking-East does have a good reputation, some of its readers have raised concerns about its connections to the group KelKel. So I tried to mention that in the revised entry. Read it and see what you think. <a href="../../../n/y/s/User%7ENYspaceman_9711.html" title="User:NYspaceman">NYspaceman</a> 05:52, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Me again, the entry-writer. Thanks anyway, Leithp. Alright, my case for including Thinking-East is based very much upon its connection to the Tulip Revolution. Several of its writers were senior members of KelKel, the youth movement involved in the overthrow of the Kyrgyz government (and KelKel, by the way, has an entry on Wikipedia.) If a tiny website on the outskirts of the blogosphere has a connection like that, surely it may ultimately prove to be of some historical interest--if not historical importance? (Also: it is starting to get mentioned in Uzbek blogs.) Regarding the Google hits: a) is 26 too low or two high? and b) I removed almost all external links from the entry. <a href="../../../n/y/s/User%7ENYspaceman_9711.html" title="User:NYspaceman">NYspaceman</a> 01:50, 2 May 2005</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> After reading the entry and web-site again, I think it does merit an entry. I don't think the "google test" is a particularly fair way of assessing this. Central Asian politics, as opposed to say Manga or MMORPG games or other "geek-friendly" topics, has a pretty scant showing on Wikipedia. This web-site seems to be a rare outlet for the voice of young people in Central Asia so is of significance, if only regionally. Have a look at it before you vote please, there are a lot more deserving candidates for deletion than this. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeithp_3c9a.html" title="User:Leithp">Leithp</a> 20:20, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Me again, the entry-writer. I communicated with one of the editors of the website. He said that they have a first-hand account of the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halabja_poison_gas_attack.html" title="Halabja poison gas attack">Halabja poison gas attack</a> in 1988, an interview with the nephew of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Garang_c6ca.html" title="John Garang">John Garang</a>, the leader of the south Sudan rebels (the editor said he went to school with this kid), and an interview with Yair Auron, who's the world expert on the Armenian genocide. All these articles they will publish in May and June. For a blog "not worthy of an entry" on Wikipedia, this is certainly impressive. (By the way, thanks for the support, Leithp.) <a href="../../../n/y/s/User%7ENYspaceman_9711.html" title="User:NYspaceman">NYspaceman</a> 01:50, 2 May 2005</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I don't believe Stalin ever considered himself a leader of a distinct intellectual or political movement, so the list ends up being people who, at some time in their lives, spoke of Stalin in a somewhat approving way.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. This has, I think, the makings of two or more good pages, but mixed together like this it ends up being a polemic. There are avowed Stalinists: <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._Bruce_Franklin_274e.html" title="H. Bruce Franklin">H. Bruce Franklin</a>, under whom I studied, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Jong-Il_3f16.html" title="Kim Jong-Il">Kim Jong-Il</a>, and (missing from the list) <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Avakian_a4a2.html" title="Bob Avakian">Bob Avakian</a>. There are politically-oriented entertainers who happen to have supported the Soviet Union in one respect or another during the Stalin era, many of them identified with <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Front_3447.html" title="Popular Front">Popular Front</a> politics that were not narrowly Stalinist: <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Robeson_b580.html" title="Paul Robeson">Paul Robeson</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Chaplin_90da.html" title="Charles Chaplin">Charles Chaplin</a>, and (missing from the list) <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Seeger_18a1.html" title="Pete Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>. There are some <i>very</i> odd inclusions: <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frida_Kahlo_11d6.html" title="Frida Kahlo">Frida Kahlo</a> was a close associate, and almost certainly a lover, of <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Trotsky_11f4.html" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>. Yes, she followed Trotsky's doctrine of giving qualified support to the "deformed Workers' State" that was the Soviet Union, but are we saying that Trotsky was a Stalinist? There are some whose inclusion in the list borders on slander: <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Wallace_dda8.html" title="Henry Wallace">Henry Wallace</a> accepted the political support of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_USA_850c.html" title="Communist Party USA">Communist Party USA</a>, but he never endorsed them in return. Et cetera. As a hodgepodge of these things, the list is useless and borders on slanderous, given the degree to which Stalinism these days is an epithet. This would be like a list of Fascists that included <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Edgar_Hoover_ecb6.html" title="J. Edgar Hoover">J.

In short, I don't think an encyclopedic list can be constructed under this particular title, but this could be the seed for several useful pages. <b>I'd suggest moving this to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stalinists_1bc6.html" title="List of Stalinists">List of Stalinists</a>, editing out those who are not self-described as such</b>, and starting several separate lists: List of Popular Front cultural figures, for example.

<li>A pretty obvious <b>keep</b>. If some listings are original research, they should be removed, leaving the persons verifiably described as being Stalinist (shouldn't be too hard to do).

List of people described as neoconservatives exists because, regardless of NC's status as a political movement, labelling people as NCs is a widespread journalism phenomenon.

<dd>Re. 1. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinist.html" title="Stalinist">Stalinist</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>. Stalinism is somewhat well defined, but Stalinist isn't. This is something of a paradox, but it is reality since Stalinist is a loaded, generally POV term almost always intended as a powerful slur in the U.S. This has been true in the U.S. for about 80 years, so it isn't a recent development. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 22:37, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Edit &amp; Keep</b> - If we forget the troll aspect, this entry is more about an infamous feud between a corporate giant (LonelyPlanet) and a small time author, something that has gone of for the best part of five years. Whether the trolling aspect is necessary is questionable however, it tells another side that is often forgotten and is often asked about among the thousands who are familar with the saga that has encompassed the battle to establish whether plagiarism/theft of research has taken place. In short, it's a poor entry that should focus less on trolling more on the facts of a real interesting story.

<li>Articles from victoriacross.net have been migrated to Wikipedia. That's why at the bottom of every one it says "This page has been migrated from the Victoria Cross Reference (<a href="http://www.victoriacross.net" class="external free" title="http://www.victoriacross.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.victoriacross.net</a>) with permission." and that's why when you go to victoriacross.net it says "The Victoria Cross Reference is migrating its content to Wikipedia - you can help" at the top. I don't know whether the victoriacross.net owner planned to migrate non-VC recipient articles as well, like book reviews. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 22:26, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The recipients of the Victoria Cross can be very notable without this particular book making the cut at all. This book has two Amazon sales rankings that I could find, the better of which was worse than 1,500,000. There is no evidence that this is a notable book. <b>Delete</b> the article about the book and <b>unlink</b> it in all the recipient articles. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:50, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rewrite, Keep</b>. I noticed that the reason the book is linked in each of the 40+ articles which reference it is that it is listed as a source for each of them. Conceivably, someone interested in WWI VC recipients might like to know about the book which purports to discuss all of them. Besides, Wikipedia is not paper, and a book can be notable and at the same time have a very specialized audience. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 03:38, 2005 May 1 (UTC)</li>

He also has a "Hornby Point" named after him. Not sure if he's particularly notable, though. For the moment <b>Keep</b> and move to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hornby_d1f9.html" title="John Hornby">John Hornby</a> and I'll see if I can find out anything useful about him. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveW_ed49.html" title="User:SteveW">SteveW</a> | <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteveW_7844.html" title="User talk:SteveW">Talk</a> 16:42, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> As <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">Google test</a> points out, numbers aren't everything.

<li><b>Comment</b>. John Hornby is probably notable—he was a Canadian naturalist who died in an interesting way and about whom at least one book has been written (see previous comment). Since he died in 1925, it's not particularly surprising that his Google score is a bit low. On the other hand, this article needs to be fleshed out to at least a decent stub if it is to be kept. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TenOfAllTrades_2268.html" title="Special:Contributions/TenOfAllTrades">contrib</a>)</small> 15:50, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would vote for a delete, but there's no point. Smoddy, thanks for your civility and open mind, but I happen to know that this article is nothing but <a href="../../../u/r/b/UrbanDictionary.com_025b.html" title="UrbanDictionary.com">Urban Dictionary-esque</a> banter. The guy who made it often shows me these pages (he is not the same as the "Ultimate Ninja" vandal) he makes about our classmates. I usually give them a dismissive sigh and a roll of my eyes, assuming Wikipedians will soon root them out, which has always happened until now. You are a more patient person than I, but your recommended solution is right on the mark. I will carry through with that now... but don't be surprised if in the future, this person merits a real article.

<li>well, if you <i>know</i> the guy creating these articles, maybe you could ask him to kindly knock it off. Sure, wikipedians will eventually find and delete it, but we all have much better things to do. Secondly, I'd like to point out that the "VfD" notice specifically says <i>"do not blank this article"</i> so I've just reverted it back to the original. I'm sure you were just trying to help, but the VfD stuff is one of the few "serious" policies around here.

<li>I wrote the article. The name "uterine succession" came as derivation from terminology in sociology, where "uterine kinship" etc refer to kinship in unbroken female line. There, "uterine" and "agnatic" are parallel terms. Upon reflection, I concede that probably "matrilineal succession" would be a better-known title for this information. The information itself is true and I stand behind it, therefore I vote for its KEEPING. As comment to a suggestion above to redirect this to some "primogeniture", that will not be correct, since primogeniture is only one form of succession, and there are a plentitude of other forms, such as seniority, tanistry, election, appointment, rotation... Thus, such redirect will give readers a misleading picture. Regarding such comments, it is desirable that persons who do not know nor have thought through the subject in question, refrain from deleting contributions of others who know the subject better. 62.78.106.215 17:31, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Per the anon's comments, perhaps it would make sense to change the redirects at <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrilineal_succession.html" title="Matrilineal succession">matrilineal succession</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrilineal_succession.html" title="Patrilineal succession">patrilineal succession</a> to point to our article <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_succession.html" title="Order of succession">order of succession</a>? It's a broader article than <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primogeniture.html" title="Primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, and covers more flavours of succession.

<li><a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_succession.html" title="Order of succession">order of succession</a> is rather long article already, and I think it is yet growing, as certain forms of succession are not equally presented there yet. Thus, I foresee a point where people would like to have a series of sub-articles, and "order of succession" being their synopsis and sort of 'list of contents'. "Matrilineal succession" could well be one of such sub-articles, as already is another thing, "primogeniture". signat:The same "Anon".
<ul>
<li>I think <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrilineal_succession.html" title="Matrilineal succession">matrilineal succession</a> can easily be worthy of a separate article; but certainly, let's not confuse the issue with <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primogeniture.html" title="Primogeniture">primogeniture</a>.

<p>This page does not seem to be describing a design pattern but more an element of object encapsulation. It seems to be defining an aggregate pattern as a design method that allows data members to be operated on by routines built into their containing object. This is a fairly trivial property of OO design.</p>
<p>Asides from this semantic issue, the article itself is littered with terrible English, with many spelling and grammer mistakes that render it virtually unintelligible. The code examples are entirely unelucidiating, and much of the information is described seemingly from the perspective of a Perl programmer, rather than being a language agnostic description of the methodology.

<li>We probably should have an article about the number two at General Electric. One reason I'd want a separate article about a journalist like Trong is that she's done lots of work that doesn't conveniently fall under her time with Jane. I could post ext links to stuff like her interview with Bowie (for Jane) but she's done literally hundreds of interviews, many with famous people, and not all for Jane. I couldn't just shoehorn it into the Jane article, really, it would probably be best to have it under Trong, because when people read one of her interviews, they're reading Trong, not "Jane", whoever that is. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 06:01, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. Despite being an academic, it is not evident from the article he has made enough of an impact in his field to be notable. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeus_Ex_c1ba.html" title="User:Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a> 21:43, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Google Scholar lists 117 citations for a paper by an SR Denmeade at John Hopkins (so likely to be the same person), with others with 55, 39 and 34. Average in medical science is about 5 [world average of 5.15]. So he's not utterly non-notable. Since the original creator was still expanding the article on the day it was listed on VfD, and this was only the day after it was originally created, I'd say an article on a doctor who has published at least one high-impact papers deserves a bit more time to see if the creator can expand further. Google also shows he is the named recipient in a number of research programmes funded by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs and The Prostate Cancer Foundation. Give some time to expand - slap it on pages needing attention and see if the IP expands it more. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:18, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clean up</b>. Needs universalist treatment (definitely has Islam-centric POV at present). Could subdivide out into sections like Judaism/Islam/Christianity/Other. The phenomenon has existed in biblical accounts since Elijah and before, occupies about 20% of Christian bible texts, and interest in it was more seriously revived by Christian Science starting about the turn of the 20th century, about the same time mainstream Christianity in the US came under active challenge from the scientific revolutions. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Rodgers_82ba.html" title="User:Chris Rodgers">Chris Rodgers</a> 04:04, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

One of the criteria is "Any page which is requested for deletion by the original author, provided the author reasonably explains that it was created by mistake, and the page was edited only by its author." Unfortunately, the page has been edited by others since it was created, so it doesn't fall under that category. I don't know how strict these rules are, though. --<a href="../../../c/i/a/User%7ECiaran_H_1b23.html" title="User:Ciaran H">Ciaran H</a> 09:46, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b> The article does not state that the Countess is a peer in the House of Lords. Titles can be granted with no peerage included. The article simply states that she votes Conservitive in the UK and Republican in the US. Noticed the VC was also removed from the author(?); I've made similar mistakes when making editions to other articles. Whether the title really exists I do not know, but sounds plausible. One could always called Buckingham Palace or The Home Office for authentication. KCD Not remotely convincing - and I think it is for the author to cite verifiable sources (DeBrette's or Burke's Peerage??) which he fails to do --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc Glasgow</a> 08:19, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, a handful of hereditary peerages have been given comparatively recently, but only to people like <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitelaw.html" title="Whitelaw">Whitelaw</a> with no sons so the title would not be inherited in practice, a very British fudged compromise. The whole article is full of implausibilities to anyone who knows much about British titles and awards, but the most obvious is that it is obviously inspired by <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Windermere%27s_Fan_ece9.html" title="Lady Windermere's Fan">Lady Windermere's Fan</a>, a fairly well known play by <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 13:03, 2005 Apr 30 (UTC)

<li>Whitelaw and Macmillan both got their peerages in the early 80's - and were notable exceptions. Since then no non-royal hereditaries have been created. A hereditary to a royal lackey is thus implausible. This article is however quite amusing. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc Glasgow</a></li>

<li>Comment -- I think notability is evident... not sure how I can <i>prove</i> it exists... maybe the next time the weather is nice i can send some videos of the dozens of students playing it?

<li>i'll look for a link ... haven't seen one yet though and people have been asking me about the game, which is part of the reason i saw a need for the wiki article in the first place. I'm sure you appreciate how some topics, though less notable, lend themselves much more to Internet coverage than others and i think borgolf falls into the latter category, unfortunately. <s>Still don't see how this is <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> any more than other articles, i didn't have any role in the game's invention and didnt even play it till the last day in nashville...

<li>I read <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiable.html" title="Verifiable">verifiable</a> and I see that wikipedia does rely on published references, but I think that some value has to be assigned to the fact that borgolf is the sort of topic that achieves notability long before the mainstream media takes notice... so how to do an article? should wikipedia wait? <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket"><font color="#337147"><strong>---FoodMarket</strong></font> </a><sup><a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoodmarket_3251.html" title="User talk:Foodmarket"><font color="#0000C0">talk!</font></a></sup> 04:47, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Given the timeless, universal nature of Wikipedia, even if it can be proved college students in 6 US states have played the game in the past couple months, I'm not sure it's a big enuf blip in the universal timeline to have an article (at least yet)--I suspect a LOT of "games" that have been 'invented' on US colleges that won't pass the test of time. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 06:44, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)
