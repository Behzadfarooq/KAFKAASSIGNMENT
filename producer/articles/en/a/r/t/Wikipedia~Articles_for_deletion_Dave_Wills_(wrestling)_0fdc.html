<li><b>Keep</b>There are countless articles on wikipedia about subjects that may not have huge mainstream popularity. A lot of the time when somebody hears some obscure reference, like "crying wrestling fan" or even the aforementioned Luger video, where do they check? Wikipedia of course. Now if people just go hog wild deleting everything they don't see as significant, we'll be stuck with a very incomplete encyclopedia. I say, if somebody takes the time to make a page for something, and if as many people as have commented on it and edited it do so, it is definitely noteworthy. It's not like somebody made up a page just to vainly showcase their own minimal accomplishments. Are people worried that the internet is going to run out of space or what? <small>— 4.246.230.190 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.246.230.190_c3c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.246.230.190">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I fail to see how a little blurb about something that got some media attention has to be deleted. Compared to some of the vast useless information on here, I think this is just fine the way it is. That's my view on it. And also, if the "I don't know" comment be striken then the "I think so" comment should as well. Hypocrisy shouldn't be becoming of a supposed unbiased site. <small>—The preceding unsigned comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.17.46.8_adbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.17.46.8">130.17.46.8</a> (talk) 07:33, 5 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Very well-written, "dave wills" wrestling gets 1,800 ghits. The clip is one of the most famous clips on the internet, and not just with wrestling fans. He also appears at major independent shows in ring announcing roles and such. Being on Jimmy Kimmel is pretty big, and he has done radio interviews. He meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and there is no reason for this to be deleted. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 07:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a well-written article and Dave Willis is probably the most well-known wrestling fan within the large Internet Wrestling Community (without being a one-time joke like the Cena-Fan-in-Shock), as well as being a special guest on radio programs and at southeast indy shows.24.228.59.90 07:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Of course it is known within the wrestling community... so is Lex Luger's selling ability... does that mean people outside of the community care about it? "I Don't Think SOoooooO!", as your boy Lex would say. Bottom line is that it fails notability. The only reason the anon IP(s) want the inclusion is because they argue "well if Dave Wills has a page then Lex Luger's viral video should be included" Well then when this page went up for nominition, they pulled a Sid Eudy and decided that they need to vote for them in order to keep their wrestlecrap meme going. And of course as you can see from <a href="http://realwrestlecrap.proboards89.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=wrestling&amp;thread=1167982028&amp;page=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://realwrestlecrap.proboards89.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=wrestling&amp;thread=1167982028&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> they even posted a campaign telling people to vote for this... so if we see alot of contributions from people who's only edit is on this page then this is why (like the person who was wise enough to sign his post in his wrestlecrap forum name). <a href="../../../4/9/e/User%7E49erInOregon_0564.html" title="User:49erInOregon">49erInOregon</a> 12:55, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I strongly disagree that the keep votes are just a way to "keep the Luger info". These people have given valid reasons to why it should be kept. We can't control the fact that someone started a thread on the message board about it. Your vote should probably be discounted b/c you are just on a vendetta to make people upset and try to gain some power. We have a right to vote and discuss this article, and every valid reason should be considered. There's already been 2 attempts by anons to delete the keep votes, which is a pretty shady practice. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 13:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you serious about the "vendetta" comment to gain power? Where do you get that from? I'm not even on here enough to care about any form of power. That is ridiculous. If you read the thread and their thread about Lex Luger you can clearly see that is their point. Here's an example from Dave's talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dave_Wills_%28wrestling%29&amp;diff=98378540&amp;oldid=95970227" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dave_Wills_%28wrestling%29&amp;diff=98378540&amp;oldid=95970227" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> from the same IP that voted keep here. As far as the GHits go, I guess it would depend on where they are coming from... if they are gorillamask and wrestling site hits then I don't know what to tell ya. Should we put up an article about every video on gorillamask? And for the one anon IP that deleted the info... how do you even know where that is coming from and what he/she is trying to cause with that disruption? <a href="../../../4/9/e/User%7E49erInOregon_0564.html" title="User:49erInOregon">49erInOregon</a> 13:38, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
