<p>small academic department. not highly notable. no significant reason for separate article. should go bye-bye. some substantial error facts in establishing the notability (it is not on of the largest in Australasia by a long stretch for instance).

<li>Because the department has had a major influence on the modern course of NZ politics, and because a few of its current lecturers are major figures in their own right, the page should stay. People can edit as they please, but the impact on of the department on contemporary NZ is felt throughout the policy spectrum. Incidentally, it ranked 1st of 5 in NZ in the PBRF system-the coment that it was 3rd smacks of jealous misinformation by one of the lower-ranked departments.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.216.146.240 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.216.146.240_bade.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.216.146.240">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>This really smacks of jealousy. Cantebury ranked higher than Auckland in Political Studies? Are you serious? Is there anyone at Cantebury in Politics that matters? Vic can make some claims, but the PBRF scores in no way reflect the true weight of Auckland in national political life. Beside the alumni, people like Jack Vowles, Raymond Miller, Yongjin Zhang, Paul Buchanan, Helena Catt, Andrew Sharp, Barry Gustafson, Peter Aimer, all current or recent staff, are certainly major academic figures in NZ political life. Deleting the page or merging into the Auckland general page might be advisable, but the grounds advocated by the one commentator show a clear prejudice against the department. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.216.146.240 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.216.146.240_bade.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.216.146.240">contribs</a>).</small></p>
