<p>This was listed on DRV, where the lister was self-admittely confused about the process regarding renomination of kept articles. The debate, which was withdrawn by the applicant, can be viewed here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_December_13&amp;oldid=94222037#Darcy_Burner" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_December_13&amp;oldid=94222037#Darcy_Burner" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The original AfD can be viewed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Darcy_Burner_6e8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Darcy Burner">here (closed as no concensus)</a>, that took place about five months ago.</p>
The reason for listing was:
<blockquote>
<p><i>Delete or Merge with article on Election -- WP:BIO. Proponents for keeping the article during the July discussion centered on her viability as a candidate in the November 2006 election. As the election is over and she has lost, her notability seems to have declined. AndrewSaint 06:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
</blockquote>
The concensus from DRV was to relist at AfD, so here it is. Eat your heart out - this is a procedural nomination, so no opinion from me just yet. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">T</a>&#160;·&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daniel.Bryant_a73d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daniel.Bryant">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 05:01, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

Burner was a real candidate in one of the most contested races this cycle and she nearly won. She may run again or she may run for another political office. Even if she dropped off the face of the Earth tomorrow an article about her would still be useful for anyone interested in Washington state's political history. Personally, I've used articles on failed congressional candidates in the past to learn more about the opponents current congressmen have defeated. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 05:53, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> loosing candidate. There is news coverage about the election but none about her specifically is cited in the article and nothing suggests any notability outside the election so she should be mentioned in the election article and nowhere else. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 08:51, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This canditate generated signaficant media coverage thus making her notable under the primary criterion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is a very high chance she will reappear in the Washington State political scene, potentially as a candidate in the 8th District again, or in some other capacity. Her political career is far from over. It would be foolish to delete at this time. If she is not considered significant, then Wikipedia will wish to reexamine its definition of what is significant, as it would appear to be far too limiting. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_cruickshank_5401.html" title="User:Robert cruickshank">Robert cruickshank</a> 22:51, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Burner got substantial media coverage both nationally and internationally, and on that basis clearly meets the inclusion criteria under WP:BIO. There were dozens of articles in local, regional, U.S. national, and international press about her specifically, including coverage on the front page of the New York Times, a feature article in New York Times Magazine, a feature article in Vanity Fair, a feature article in the UK Guardian, and dozens of articles in the Seattle Times, the Seattle PI, the Tacoma News-Tribune, the Mercer Island Reporter, plus coverage on television both locally and nationally by way of CBS, NBC, FOX News, MSNBC, ABC, etc. She was one of the top Congressional challengers of 2006. Mere fact of non-election does not negate the notability criteria under WP:BIO, which she clearly meets.
