And above and beyond that, <i>there is no significant secondary attention being paid to this book</i>. No reviews, no chatter on literary websites, nothing but business announcements.

In other words you are makling a lot of statements you cannot support. Have you spoken with the publisher? Do you know something none of us know?

<li><b>Do not delete</b>. I don’t understand these arguments. Wikipedia allows people to write about themselves or projects they have a strong personal involvement, as long as the article maintains a neutral point of view and verifiable. The focus of the arguments should be on neutrality and verifiability. On the neutrality, it is not too difficult to judge. If anyone thinks something is not neutral, point the portion out. On the verifiability, I don’t know how anyone can really verify where a person is born, who are their parents, …, unless you are the government. Regarding this specific case, the writer or his publicist claimed that “Macmillan Publishers bought Darkest Days in August of 2006.” So Wikipedia can verify with Macmillan whether they bought Stanley Gallon’s Darkest Days. Notability is not a requirement for Wikipedia articles. No one should be penalized for lack of notability. Wikipedia should not become a privilege for celebrities.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Blueorgreen (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blueorgreen_821a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blueorgreen">contribs</a>).</small><small>— Blueorgreen (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blueorgreen_821a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blueorgreen">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li>Where is Funky Monkey's evidence that this is a vanity or a spam article? I’m tired of this new culture of accusing people of “serious allegations” without providing supporting evidence. There are many people on Wikipedia that are not “well known”. That’s the purpose of Wikipedia, to provide information that people may not know. Being signed by a major publisher is notable enough, it means the book will be published and it is irrelevant whether the book is on the market today or will be a few months from now. The author provided two sources, bookseller.com and the publisher's website, thereby satisfying the mutliple secondary sources requirement.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Blueorgreen (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blueorgreen_821a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blueorgreen">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Reply</b> Considering that you only registered on Wikipedia several hours ago, you tire very easily. The issue before all other issues is Notability. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:Not">not an indiscrimate collection of information</a>. Other websites are, Wikipedia is not. There are literally thousands of websites where this content is welcome. MySpace comes to mind. There is no reason that it <i>has</i> to be on Wikipedia. Even if the book is published, it <i>still</i> may not meet notability standards. The fact that a large publisher is publishing it is not enough. It also has to be a success and make a notable mark on the public consciousness. Quibbling that it absolutely positively will be published isn't the point. If you have a problem with Wikipedia notability rules, take it up here: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">Wikipedia_talk:Notability</a>. <i>Do not</i> take it up here. This is not the place for it. The fact that you only seem concerned that <i>this</i> article be allowed in clearly labels you as someone with an outside interest in the Gallon's public profile. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 03:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Fact: it can be verified that Stanley Gallon is being published by Macmillan on a specific date from at least three sources: Macmillan itself, Bookseller.com, and Publisher's Lunch, which I found by doing a simple Google search. With so much arbitrary value judgement being considered in the process, it begs the question as to whether Wikipedia is a reliable source of information or just another fluff site pandering to "famous people". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 139.85.254.32 (<a href="../../../1/3/9/User_talk%7E139.85.254.32.html" title="User talk:139.85.254.32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_139.85.254.32_3f34.html" title="Special:Contributions/139.85.254.32">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>WOW</b>!!! Step away for a while and look what happens. As the writer of this article I am a bit shocked at this debate going on over this. Let me just clarify some things here, based on what I've read so far. I am not a publicist, I'm not the author of the novel, nor did the author pay me to write this article about him. I'm just a guy who found out about this novel called Darkest Days. I thought it had a fascinating premise.<br />
I noticed there were just bits and pieces of information on this writer when I did a search on him, so I figured I'd do a little research of my own and post something, you know, see what happens. Why would I do that you ask? I am trying to get into journalism, this author turned out to be very accessible, (I'm guessing because he's new) and I asked him some questions. He told me about why he started writing and I put together this simple little thing you all see posted here. I had no idea this site only posted articles about bestselling authors.<br />
So why this book? Tell me, when was the last time that a dystopian thriller type novel was published in recent history? Exactly, hard to name even one. I thought this was a pretty significant development in the publishing industry. It demonstrates a societal shift, a change in global perceptions (I say that because I learned through my reserch that the publisher is making a huge global push on this novel. By the way, notice I did not mention that in the article.) I tried hard to make certain I did not write anything slanted or that sounded too enthusiastic on my part, because I wanted to be as neutral as possible.<br />
Before reading these posts I had no idea what a "sockpuppet" was (Other than what kids make in elementary school), as I'm gussing most people don't. Whether or not this article stays posted is not that important. I am not one to argue if I posted something contrary to Wikipedia policy. My personal belief is that I did not do that. I think there is enough verifiable information in the article to let it stand.<br />
I was a bit surprised to see that someone did not feel it was a notable accomplishment to be published. I've tried writing a novel and submitting it, over and over and over, to no avail. It turns out there are tens of millions of people in the same boat all over the US, and who knows how many in the world. Out of all those people only a couple hundred thousand ever see their books in print. I believe that qualifies as notable.<br />
But I digress. If this is such a big deal to people I'd be willing to pull the article. I'm not here to promote anyone. I'm not here for personal gain, and I was planning to submit more articles in the future on topics I believe should be here. The author himself suggested I wait to post my article until his book came out, but I didn't think that mattered.<br />
So there it is for all of you who think there's some big conspiracy of sockpuppets running around trying to exploit wikipedia. If there is, I'm walking bare handed and barefoot. Have fun with the debate and remember, life isn't supposed to be so complicated. Take it easy folks, Stanley Gallon will be in here soon enough, if not now then later.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edwin Roik (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwin_Roik_872d.html" title="User talk:Edwin Roik">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edwin_Roik_ec44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edwin Roik">contribs</a>).</small></li>

It is clear that whoever you are, Richfife, you have an personal agenda about this article. For the life of me I can't figure it out. I have not argued repeatedly about notability issues. I am not taking a moral highground. I am simply explaining why I wrote this article. It is utterly disgusting how you have demonstrated a pattern of insults and personal attacks in this forum toward anybody who disagrees with you. You should be ashamed of yourself. You take this far too personally and have clearly strayed from the facts of any discussion here. I have provided background information on the process through which this article came to be and all you have done is insult and show nothing but contempt for me and the other people who have posted here. You make unfounded arguments and assumptions that are unsupported. Every opinion expressed that you disagree with, you have written off as "sockpuppetry" and now you are trying to slander me and my intentions. You are a bully who likes kicking people when they are down. You apparently seem to enjoy denegrating other people.

<dd>I have no idea what you are talking about, and yes I did say that richiefife is a bully because that is exactly what a person who calls people names and provides no evidence to support the name calling. That is simply stating a fact. You are choosing to catagorize it as something else because the truth doesn't suit your agenda. Stating that someone is trying to "grab the moral highground" is a value judgement and an opinion, which again Richifife has chosen not to back up. It is a condescending and insulting remark that smacks of passive agression.

<li><b>To Richfife</b>: I have no way to know whether it is your real name or not. Anyway. Wikipedia's notability guidelines are too vague, subject to too much arbitrary value judgment. Wikipedia does allow people to write about themselves and their projects. Neutrality and verifiability are the 2 most important criteria, other tests exist to prove these 2 criteria. It should allow more content to come in, if it wants to build its viewer base. I don't think the article owner should take off the article. Richfife and IrishGuy do not own Wikipedia - it is .org, not .com. I think a lot of people will be interested in the subject matter of the book, because a lot of people, like myself, are tired of today's politics.</li>

<dd>The use of heavily loaded words like "magically" shows your emotional involvement in something that should not be such a big deal to you. The evidence you speak of does not support your claim at all. What it does support, judging from the statements made, however, is that people view your personal attacks as insulting to the spirit of the Wikipedia community. Your lack of proof that sockpuppetry is even occuring is disturbing. Also everyone who has posted anything here that disagrees with you, you called sock puppets. What you are essentially saying is:<br />
If you have never edited or posted in Wikipedia before, then don't bother. your opinion doesn't count, it does not matter, and you are nothing but a sockpuppet.<br />
These are the same idiotic arguments that conned this nation into a war, has allowed unbriddled corruption to abound, and has contributed to the degradation of society. The fact that people are expressing their opinions should not be discouraged by you or anyone else. Nor should those individuals be labled, branded, insulted, or called names, because you disagree with them. And by the way the evidence of your name calling in this forum, post, bulletain (or what ever it is called) is proof of your unsupported name calling. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edwin Roik (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwin_Roik_872d.html" title="User talk:Edwin Roik">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edwin_Roik_ec44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edwin Roik">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>There you go again, now you've lowered yourself to the same level as Richiefife. Your use of passive agressive attacks is not helping you convince anyone that you are justified in expressing your contempt for those who disagree with you. No one is standing on a soapbox, but you are clearly trying to undermine criticism by putting lables on it. When I refer to the accusations of sockpuppetry I am collectively refering to you and Richiefife together seeing as your tag team method of richiefife making the insult and your defense of his insults. That makes you complicit in his attacks. Now, if you are infact not complicit in his activity then you should post something here telling him to refrain his constant references to sockpuppetry "without a shred of evidence" to support it as unhelpful in this discussion. Also, you defended his characterization of my explanation for posting the article as "grabbing the moral highground" rather than what it actually was merely an explanation.<br /></dd>

<dd>There is nothing to reply to. That isn't an argument. What you <i>feel</i> is wholly irrelevant. There are policies about inclusion in Wikipedia. Your inability to get a book published and admiration for those who have isn't a Wikipedia policy. There is no book. It hasn't been published yet. Therefore, this person isn't notable. At all.

<dd>It was not I who came up with the sockpuppetry conspiracy theories. That was Richiefife, and you supported his allegations. Show me where I refered to a cabal? The fact that the two of you are tag teaming is evident and clear. It does not take a genius to see it. Whether the two of you know each other is irrelevant, wheter you are working in tandem or seperately is irrelevant, what I think of your relaionship or lack there of is irrelevant.</dd>

<dd>What is relevant, is what is obvious and clear from reading your posts. Both of you have an agenda. Richifife started this line of attacks and suddenly you appeared to defend hiim. You still have not answered the post adressed to you above asking why you did not ask Richiefife to read: <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">WP:ATTACK</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>.

<dd>Who's grabbing for the moral highground now. Don't criticize someone then do the thing you criticize. BTW the dictionary, which you so brazenly discount, calls that hypocrisy</dd>

<ul>
<li>Irishguy, as for your post about cabals: Perhaps a course in remedial reading is in order. I CLEARLY disavowed any reference to a cabal. Those are your words not mine.</li>
</ul>
<p>As For what I have to say on this matter let me repeat it for your benefit. Perhaps this time Richiefife will refrain from passing valuejudgements and you will avoid defending them:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>WOW</b>!!! Step away for a while and look what happens. As the writer of this article I am a bit shocked at this debate going on over this. Let me just clarify some things here, based on what I've read so far. I am not a publicist, I'm not the author of the novel, nor did the author pay me to write this article about him. I'm just a guy who found out about this novel called Darkest Days. I thought it had a fascinating premise.<br />
I noticed there were just bits and pieces of information on this writer when I did a search on him, so I figured I'd do a little research of my own and post something, you know, see what happens. Why would I do that you ask? I am trying to get into journalism, this author turned out to be very accessible, (I'm guessing because he's new) and I asked him some questions. He told me about why he started writing and I put together this simple little thing you all see posted here. I had no idea this site only posted articles about bestselling authors.<br />
So why this book? Tell me, when was the last time that a dystopian thriller type novel was published in recent history? Exactly, hard to name even one. I thought this was a pretty significant development in the publishing industry. It demonstrates a societal shift, a change in global perceptions (I say that because I learned through my reserch that the publisher is making a huge global push on this novel. By the way, notice I did not mention that in the article.) I tried hard to make certain I did not write anything slanted or that sounded too enthusiastic on my part, because I wanted to be as neutral as possible.<br />
Before reading these posts I had no idea what a "sockpuppet" was (Other than what kids make in elementary school), as I'm gussing most people don't. Whether or not this article stays posted is not that important. I am not one to argue if I posted something contrary to Wikipedia policy. My personal belief is that I did not do that. I think there is enough verifiable information in the article to let it stand.<br />
I was a bit surprised to see that someone did not feel it was a notable accomplishment to be published. I've tried writing a novel and submitting it, over and over and over, to no avail. It turns out there are tens of millions of people in the same boat all over the US, and who knows how many in the world. Out of all those people only a couple hundred thousand ever see their books in print. I believe that qualifies as notable.<br />
But I digress. If this is such a big deal to people I'd be willing to pull the article. I'm not here to promote anyone. I'm not here for personal gain, and I was planning to submit more articles in the future on topics I believe should be here. The author himself suggested I wait to post my article until his book came out, but I didn't think that mattered.<br />
So there it is for all of you who think there's some big conspiracy of sockpuppets running around trying to exploit wikipedia. If there is, I'm walking bare handed and barefoot. Have fun with the debate and remember, life isn't supposed to be so complicated. Take it easy folks, Stanley Gallon will be in here soon enough, if not now then later.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edwin Roik (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwin_Roik_872d.html" title="User talk:Edwin Roik">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edwin_Roik_ec44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edwin Roik">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Constantly repeating yourself doesn't give your comments any more weight. When you claim that everyone who opposed you has a political agenda and they are working in conjunction against you...that <i>is</i> a cabal. It is irrelevant that you didn't use that exact term.

<li><b>IT IS UNFAIR</b> – IrishGuy deleted my posting. I said: If I am the same person as Edwin Roik, I would be superman able of changing identities and making 2 arguments at the same time.

<dd>Irishguy, the supposed "policy" guy, I would like to see you attack Patstuart. While I am making honest comments, <b>Patstuart is vandalizing</b>.

<dd>The reason I "vandalized" was that I am on recent -pages patrol, and reverted before I had a chance to see what the problem was. But actually, I realized that this person's comments were a complete attack anyway, so, if I could do it again, I wouldn't; but it's not worth adding attack comments back in.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article states no solid claims of fame, besides of a book that isn't published yet, and even that is a bit questionable until it's actually out. Lack of sourcing and a little bit essay-like and advertisatory tone doesn't help. And I find this behaviour, if one can call it that, of some editors in this debate somewhat unconstructive. Oh, as an amateur writer I know how stating good, deep, philosophical points can take <i>a lot</i> of words, but in this particular medium of deletion debates, conciseness and sticking to the facts counts in particular. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 23:41, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have a delete vote somewhere in the middle of this mess that I do not want to bother looking for. Please change it to Speedy Delete per authors request. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 23:58, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b> under the new <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">G11</a> criterion. How can anyone seriously believe that the creator of the article is not the author himself or his publicist?

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> per Pascal.Tesson. Really, this has gone on long enough. There are lots of articles out there, and this one shouldn't be taking up our time. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpseudo_5ea4.html" title="User:Johnpseudo">johnpseudo</a> 21:13, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Can we <b>delete</b> already? This does not seem complicated. The information in the article cannot be found from any outside <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a>; therefore, it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>; therefore, deletion is appropriate.
