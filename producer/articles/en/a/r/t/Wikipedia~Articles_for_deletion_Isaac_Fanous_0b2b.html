I shall do that removal and annotation, for the sake of the permanent record, not too long after midnight, and call the result if no one else has done so.

If Isaac Fanous as an artist is not known to the majority of Egyptians, by virtue of them being Muslims, there is hardly any of the 15 million Copts around the world who does not know Isaac Fanous. He has travelled around the world to paint Icons for Coptic churches. He has a whole school of his own to teach modern Coptic iconography, and where hunderds of apprentices are currently learning the art of painting Coptic icons. I am the one who added the article and I am not of the same family of Dr Fanous (that's to answer the claim that it might be a self-promotion from my side). I vote to keep the article.

<li>I suppose my choice of the word "hunch" fed the same odd bit of human psychology that tends to treat the unmodified word "coincidence" as ruling out the sense of "mere coincidence". Thus i invited the inference that i thought what i learned by following it was some kind of compelling "confirmation" of a hunch, despite the disclaimers before and after it -- and despite introducing it with "BTW", which i think is widely accepted as warning "Don't be distracted by this minor thing i am about to mention; it is an insignificant part of the whole." In fact, i had not so much a hunch as an estimate that since there are about 40 items a day added to VfD, M's VfD edits could be close to the number of new VfDs during her month of editing; if that were true, it would make it surprising if she <i>hadn't</i> voted on that at least peripherally related VfD. Indeed she had, and it seemed to me that leaving that small additional snippet out would undercut my more extensive effort to help anyone interested find a context for this exceptional vote (the only Del, then and still now, other than that of the nominator), and this remarkable history. As i clearly stated, i</li>

Without suggesting that bad faith on her part was involved, i regard it as a personal attack for the following reasons:</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li><i>The thrust of that contrib is that my citation of her remarkable record (my terms) should be discounted because</i> i <i>submitted it; that is a textbook example of</i> argumentum ad hominem <i>AKA personal attack. While the context, including any inferred intent of the author, can be important in remediation and in the justification of the policy, the essential element of a personal attack is the focus on the individual, and the main target of the policy is the attack rather than the author. So one might stop at this point.</i></li>
<li><i>While to some extent "meaning no harm" and having acted with reasonable caution is irrelevant (neither protects an attack from removal), i address that area to demonstrate the attack is not <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_minimis.html" title="De minimis">de minimis</a> in terms of the policy's intent to protect individuals. Her accepting the claim "[based] on [assuming that <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">User:Omar Filini</a> so claimed in] good faith" (if that is what her reference to "good faith" means) is not in this case compliance with "assume good intent", since concluding i had engaged in vandalism meant assuming</i> i <i>had acted with bad intent. (In fact, whether or not Omar received her assumption of good intent, i did not.) And if there were a need to decide which of two colleagues</i> more <i>deserved that assumption, she had reason</i> not <i>to choose the one who (the day before) had 23 edits since registering 17 days earlier, and had been "prominent" (as i described it) in a troubled VfD: She had reason because of the post that immediately preceded, and provoked, the one she says she relied upon in inferring that a "record of vandalism" existed; if she was reasonable enough to read it, she knew that those things had been stated about him, read by him, and not contested by him. And she had further reason: if she had an impulse to believe his vague charge, and his audacious claim to judge so quickly what vandalism means here, consider the fact that she had (if she acted reasonably) seen a link to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Marco_of_Alexandria_2c9b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Marco of Alexandria">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Marco of Alexandria</a> in that preceding post. On that other VfD, a reasonably acting editor could easily have evaluated the behavior of each the nine other IP or newly minted editors allied to Omar, and have estimated the number of independent voters among them, as an aid to evaluating his claim to the benefit of the usual assumption. (Checking</i> exhaustively <i>there for vandalism of Omar's contribs by me would have of course demanded a little more Wiki sophistication.)</i></li>
<li><i>While falsehood is not a necessary element of a personal attack, it is IMO another aggravating circumstance that can reinforce the need for removal, in support of the protective role of the policy. The claim was "you seem to vandalizing all my edits and trying to discredit all my actions here!" i.e., (even allowing for inserting the word "be" to make it grammatical) literally not a claim of vandalism but of a subjective sense of it probably having occurred. On the other hand, the removed material was "your vandalism is on record", literally asserting not that the record includes charges of vandalism but that vandalism by me existed, and is "on record", and the circumstances indicate in two ways that the author</i> intended <i>to assert that substance:</i>
<ol>
<li><i>the statement is irrelevant to its context unless (in addition to ignoring the</i> ad hom <i>fallacy) the claims are at least credible</i></li>
<li><i>presumably understanding that (while avoiding the literal statement can help excuse the intimations to the same effect) authors are responsible for their literal statements unless the intimations are</i> clearly <i>to the contrary, she chose "your vandalism is on record" where either the free inference "a vandalism charge against you is on record" or the literally true "a suggestion of vandalism by you is on record" was an easy substitution.</i></li>

<li>Jerzy Do you have a specific problem with me???? you seem to vandalizing all my edits and trying to discredit all my actions here! and no I am not Marco of Alexandria, and by the way since you brought it up. Marco of Alexandria is more notable than Isaac Fanous and it is not the question of being a Muslim or Christian because they are both Christians as far as I know; but I don't think Marco was Coptic, maybe Catholic or Protestant otherwise he will be called Morcos and not Marco. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">Omar Filini</a> 14:25, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC) The reason I was Supporting Marco is because I am very much into the art scene here in Egypt and I know much about it; I did add a few names to the List of Egyptian Painters page and plan to write articles about a few. And that is why I nominated this article for deletion because I know that this person is not nearly as notable as anyone on the list; regardless of his position in the coptic church; as an Artist he is not notable at all. <i>[The text from the red link to a non-existent article sharing my username, to here, is all part of the same edit at 14:25, 2005 Jan 24 by Omar.]</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Isaac Fanous seems to be a notable person in Coptic religious art. In my view, this makes him notable enough for Wikipedia.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 09:30, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems borderline notable. Wouldn't hurt to have some pictures of his work, or at least descriptions of where it might be found. I would urge my fellow editors to limit particularly verbose commentary to appropriate talk pages.
