<li><b>Almost uncontestably strong keep</b>: I had great fun writing this article and I have great fun on Wikipedia; deleting this entry would just make me cry. To be perfectly honest, I didn't understand the policies of verifiability or notability, however since reading them I now see that the article probably has little reason for being here and I apologise for wasting your respective times with it. I don't see, however, what harm it is doing; it isn't misleading or advertising, it's not a vanity page and I think it's just a rather nicely written article about a gaming clan. I would suggest that if almost no gaming clans are notable - and there are some notable clans out there - then perhaps the rule is flawed. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorD_2121.html" title="User:LorD">LorD</a> 20.18, 7 September 2006 (BST).</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: But my point was that I run the site already, there's little point in putting the page on a site when really it belongs here and it's only a collection of people who are stuffy about rules that Wikipedia so famously doesn't have who disagree. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorD_2121.html" title="User:LorD">LorD</a> 16.57, 8 September 2006.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I forgot no such thing, I was highlighting how meaningless it is to say 'we have no rules... except for these ones, but otherwise we have no rules. No rules whatsoever... Except those ones over there.' Fifth pillar just there to make up numbers, is it? The mainstream image that Wikipedia has is that it's a vast source of mostly-inaccurate information on almost any subject. It's a given that there will be inaccuracies, people accept that about a print encyclopaedia, they are more likely to accept that about an online encyclopaedia, especially one whose sources are the online version of the tabloids. It's going to be inaccurate throughout its entire existence owing to its nature; on one side you could have an article on <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_Shop_Boys_772d.html" title="Pet Shop Boys">Pet Shop Boys</a> telling of how they were slating <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbie_Williams_6008.html" title="Robbie Williams">Robbie Williams</a> for not being able to concentrate while recording in the studio for his new album, <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudebox_%28album%29.html" title="Rudebox (album)">Rudebox</a> and you could cite Victoria Newton's column in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_e3a1.html" title="The Sun">The Sun</a> as the source, but then you could cite the <a href="http://www.petshopboys.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.petshopboys.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Pet Shop Boys site</a> as the source vehemntly denying this claim. Where subjectivity comes in is if you're a fan of Victoria Newton or if you're <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobic</a> and choose sleazy <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloid</a> 'journalists' over <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_relations.html" title="Public relations">PR</a>-concerned artists. Someone will always believe one side and someone else will always believe the other, thus such a project like Wikipedia is fundamentally flawed in the aspect of accuracy. Where you could let people help out is to fill in the gaps of subject matter; "...information on almost any subject". It doesn't have to be almost. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorD_2121.html" title="User:LorD">LorD</a> 12.51, 9 September 2006.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: UFO is notable because it just is. Like Paris Hilton. Notability is subjective.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective.</a> There are objective ways to deduce notability. Namely, all the articles we linked to that you seem to not understand. <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFO_9768.html" title="UFO">UFO</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> are not notable "because they are", they are notable because people who have no affiliation with the subject take the effort to write verifiable sources about the subject. If nobody wrote a verifiable source on Paris Hilton or UFO, they'd be similarly rejected. So I have a question: do you currently believe that your site does not pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 17:52, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Deduction is a subjective art and so there can be no subjective way of deducing anything, much less something as subjective as notability. Regardless, the UFO site is compiled by its members and the clan's site has been linked to a number of times (with authority) by a number of other gaming clans who note it for its wealth of resources and tutorials; I'm still unclear as to whether those sources make it verifiable. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorD_2121.html" title="User:LorD">LorD</a> 11.56, 9 September 2006.</li>
