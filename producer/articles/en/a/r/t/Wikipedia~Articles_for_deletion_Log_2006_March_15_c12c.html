<p>The result of the debate was <b>REDIRECT</b> to <i>Self-fashioning</i>. My British English would have the hyphen, so that's where I'll redirect to, but it's not important.

<dd>I'd say it's more than just the name; I assume the "confusion" is that there's a metric crapload of processors with "Pentium" in the name that have different characteristics and, sometimes, different microarchitectures (<a href="../../../n/e/t/NetBurst_7f63.html" title="NetBurst">NetBurst</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentium_4.html" title="Pentium 4">Pentium 4</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentium_D_f9d6.html" title="Pentium D">Pentium D</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentium_EE_3433.html" title="Pentium EE">Pentium EE</a>, and some <a href="../../../x/e/o/Xeon.html" title="Xeon">Xeon</a> processors; <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentium_M_00ee.html" title="Pentium M">Pentium M</a> in some other processors, including the Yonah <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_Core_aecf.html" title="Intel Core">Intel Core</a> microprocessors). If the goal is to clear up confusion about processors with "Pentium" in the name, it could list any such processors - perhaps we could start by renaming the page "List of Intel Pentium processors", and allow classic Pentium, Pentium II, Pentium III, etc. to be added to it by those sufficiently anal-retentive to care.&#160;:-) It wouldn't list the current <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_Core_aecf.html" title="Intel Core">Intel Core</a> processors, though, as they're not Pentiums, nor would it list <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celeron.html" title="Celeron">Celeron</a> or <a href="../../../x/e/o/Xeon.html" title="Xeon">Xeon</a> processors - they'd have their own "list of" pages.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We might want to add a column for the microarchitecture, given that Intel's used the same marketing name for processors with different microarchitectures (more so than AMD, who've used <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon.html" title="Athlon">Athlon</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/r/Duron.html" title="Duron">Duron</a> only for K7 processors, and have used <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon_64.html" title="Athlon 64">Athlon 64</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/t/Opteron.html" title="Opteron">Opteron</a>, and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turion.html" title="Turion">Turion</a> only for K8 processors, although they've apparently used <a href="../../../s/e/m/Sempron.html" title="Sempron">Sempron</a> for both K7's and K8's). <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Harris_fa37.html" title="User:Guy Harris">Guy Harris</a> 02:13, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, if people think this page should simply be deleted (as opposed to renamed), would they say the same for the various "List of AMD XXX microprocessors" page?

<dd>The <a href="../../../x/e/o/Xeon.html" title="Xeon">Xeon</a> page has a list of Xeon processors; by analogy to that, I'd merge the stuff about Pentium 4/D/EE from <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_processor_confusion.html" title="Intel processor confusion">Intel processor confusion</a> with the table on the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentium_4.html" title="Pentium 4">Pentium 4</a> page, and move the stuff about Pentium M to a table on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_Core_aecf.html" title="Intel Core">Intel Core</a> page (because it's only about Yonah).

<li>First 1. Fact is is that television actors are not put onto IMDB unless they have appeared in a movie as well. Read IMDB's acrticle on submission, MANY television actors are not on IMDB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second2. "Very Unpromising Google results" has nothing to do with the validity of the actress in question. Having peoples opinions written about you on websites has no validity if you were or were not appearing on a television show. I can say Ashton Kutcher is the worst actor in the world, it doesn't mean he hasn't been on tv.</p>
<p>Third 3. "A 10-year-old extra does not qualify as notable." So I guess Dakota Fanning shouldnt be on here either right?</p>
<p>Fourth 4. "Family is already notorious for self-promotion in theater/TV community. " Unless you know the family personally, or are their agent, then you really don't know, and you base your opinion on other people's opinions.</p>
<p>The point of Wikki is to list FACTS, not OPINIONS. If you cannot PROOVE she has NOT been on television then you cannot say that she hasn't, opinions matter little.</p>
<p>I actually am a CD that found this link typing her name into a search engine. She will be appearing with Alyssa Milano in a Humane Society Commercial in June. I know for a FACT because I am the one that cast her.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Regarding your opinion: <i>"If you cannot PROOVE she has NOT been on television then you cannot say that she hasn't, opinions matter little."</i> Wikipedia has a clearly stated policy (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) that is exactly the opposite. If you cannot prove (or PROOVE) notability, there's no reason to assume it's true. All sorts of wannabe musicians, models, actors want articles here to promote themselves. An actor not listed in IMDB is suspect to say the least. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:39, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>JackO'Lantern , this may come as a surprise, but Dakata Fanning was in 6 independant movies before she "hit it big" AND 2 commercials&#160;! (Do you think they just pulled her out of daycare?)</p>
<p>I suggest you go see the website in question, you'll see a girl in a picture with THE casting director for Palmetto Pointe, PRACTICING LINES.</p>
<p>The FACT is, she HAS been on TV, she HAS been in independant movies, she WILL be in more commercials.</p>
<p>The opinion (Yours) is, She's not good enough to list on Wikki because you don't think her being 10 years old and being in commercials counts as being on tv.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Justadding (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustadding_73bb.html" title="User talk:Justadding">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Justadding_f37c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Justadding">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>I offer no opinion except that the person I've nominated for deletion has no IMDB entry and next to no Google results. It's standard practice to delete an entry if we can't establish notability (or in this case, the existence of the subject). Of course, at some point in time, Dakota Fanning would not have been notable enough to list. But that changed circa 2000. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackO%27Lantern_5fea.html" title="User:JackO'Lantern">JackO'Lantern</a> 16:43, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I put this up for speedy, but have copped some flak from the author, and some other editor, who has only about 10 edits, but has been around for one month. "Obidike" has 453 google hits, mostly to people in America, while "Obidike Eze" has only 10.

<p>Hi BL Nguyen, I'd just like to say that it's local folk lore. I don't know what a person living in australia would know about local folk lore. The story is most often spread by word of mouth, that's how I heard it and apparently someone else has too. The lots of edits are because I'm not a very good typer and i have a tendancy to post and reedit. I know it's a bad habit. Also i missed a couple of things off and added later. I'm a long time reader here, but Until recently I've only read, not contributed. Please don't judge me because of that. I ask you is it the case that you only dislike the article because of the slight mention of "yellow fever" since you are quite obviously asian from your vietnamese name. I'm not being racist here, its not my fault the fabled society was called that. As with all folk lore and legend, it is indeed mostly unverifyable, as are many things in life. I understand that technically it should be verifyable to be on wikipedia, but how is any mythology to be posted if there is no gray area. KX36 02:24, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I can assure you that my ethnicity has nothing to do with my nomination. I did not even notice anything from "yellow fever", and I can assure you that I am not in any way offended by the posting of the article. I check the Newpages for articles which are not encyclopedic as per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, and in this case, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<p>It's a new web2.0 project involving webcomics. Could be the start of new ways publishing comics online. With the coming of new portable devices, particulary with pen, touch screen and wireless connection. This could be a great solutions for amateurs with devices unable to load painter, paint shop pro or other paintng applications. As each and every on of those devices will have a browser, they will be able to draw a comic strip directly online whenever the want.

<p>Just one last comment, I do think you are not being very open to this. I do think this project, this webcomics deserves a article here in WP. If you ask, i'll make an honest effourd to improve it with your help, but saying that you want to delete it because I'm not knowen it a bit far fetched!.. It gives a bad sense of anti-democracy to the project and the user-coorperation.

Too much of pretentious and non-constructive comments. But that's just my opinion. I offered myself to re-write the article with help, like that link you shown. I'll take care of that later.

<li>I've been warned now that I had better not re-add my article, because admin can delete it on sight... but I will be re-adding it........ I'll fix up the content so that it doesn't seem like an advertisement, and instead gives more of a historical look at Trek based Role playing on the Internet, but I KNOW that Borderlands has a place here. If you look at the debate around Bravo-Fleet being on the Wiki, then that's all you need to hear to know that Borderlands belongs also. Bravo-Fleet is unique because of it's size, but Borderlands is more notable because of age. We started in 1993 - a full 5 years before Bravo Fleet, and well before any other documented Trek RPG out there. We have a history that is more relevant to gaming than Bravo Fleet, and if I get deleted after highlighting that history then I'm going to demand that every other RPG documented on Wikipedia be removed as well. I admit that the current article content isn't anything special, it was a cut and paste job from our homepage just to have something up, but we do have relevance, and I will be putting Borderlands back up again when I compile that information, despite threats......... Would it kill you to offer suggestions to FIX content? - Rather than just acting like freaking Wiki-Nazis. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Truemper (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruemper_5caf.html" title="User talk:Truemper">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Truemper_9fc6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Truemper">contribs</a>) .</small>

<ul>
<li>So tell me, what makes the fan club notable?... Are you telling me that being the longest standing game on the Internet isn't notable enough?........ What is it about Bravo Fleet that makes it more notable, other than size? We intentionally chose a different niche than Bravo Fleet, we want quality, not quantity, so that disqualifies us? How about games like UCIP that have NO notability, but didn't get hammered by this crap?... Like I said before, the categories: Star Trek games | Star Trek role-playing games | Science fiction role-playing games | Fan fiction | Star Trek fan fiction are all full of less notable clubs than Borderlands..... That's all those categories have at all! I know I'm not supposed to be offended by the delete request, but how can I *not* be when so much clearly non-notable crap is all over the place, and a club that built itself off of our history in gaming gets put up for deletion, but isn't deleted because of popular support. We are the ancestry of these categories, we deserve a place here, but somehow we're the ones that get singled out for deletion and threatened not to try posting up better information.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> very intriguing and good idea, funny list, well done - actually it is rather a candidate for "featured articles". Kurt.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> it - as a fan of music I've always been strangely intrigued by the fact that so many of my favorite musicians died at 27. The fact that many other groups of people share this intrigue is reason enough to keep it. Obviously, not everyone will care, or find this article interesting, but that is not a reason to delete it.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as it is a popular concept. page bottom lists it as a "curse" and for the MTV generations it has just as much historical significance as <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecumseh%27s_Curse_4433.html" title="Tecumseh's Curse">Tecumseh's Curse</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_Curse_1b45.html" title="Kennedy Curse">Kennedy Curse</a>, Rebel Without a Cause Curse and the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_Curse_4ce0.html" title="Superman Curse">Superman Curse</a>. If 27 Club is deleted, then the aforementioned should be deleted as well.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> -- 27 Club is a well-known phenomenon in American pop culture. The fact that the 'Big 4' 27 club members weren't just famous ... they were huuuuge; at the peak of their success. And now each is a rock icon. Heck, Wikipedia has an article about the myth of eating <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Rocks_e956.html" title="Pop Rocks">Pop Rocks</a> while drinking soda pop as well as articles on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coprophilia.html" title="Coprophilia">Coprophilia</a> (sexual arousal through feces) and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_bleaching.html" title="Anal bleaching">Anal bleaching</a>. <i>KEEP THE 27 CLUB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As noted above, it's a popular concept. I had heard it discussed several times before stumbling upon the wikipedia page. —thames 03:55, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a rather fascinating phenomenon, in my opinion, I've always been aware of the strange fact that these artists all died at 27 before wikipedia came along. It's nice to have an entry for it for those who aren't already aware.</li>
<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> It's not pointless. I believe one of Wiki's goals is to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia around. Thus, we should all want it to contain as much information as possible, no matter how insignificant it might be to <i>some</i>. A small amount of google hits shouldn't be reason for deletion. Wikipedia would be that much more popular having something that isn't found on a major search engine. Most importantly, it does have a following within the music community, and anyone looking for it won't go to <a href="../../../2/7/_/27_%28number%29.html" title="27 (number)">27 (number)</a> as their first thought.

<li>A merge into 27 (number), seems a bit odd as this article isn't really about the number 27. it is after all not math but music and most music fans wouldn't look at 27. The information in the article is certainly interesting trivia, the above mentioned articles do indicate a certain degree of use. Perhaps the term itself is somewhat obscure, so I propose recreating this article at Musicians who died at age 27 with redirects from 27 Club, Forever 27, etc. Then mention those as names for the "phenomenon" in the new article.

<li><b>Comment on Comment</b> -- Wikipedia may not be a "majority rule" or "democracy." But Wikipedia is most definitely a microcosm of pure socialism much like an Amish community (not to be confused with Communism, Fascism or totalitarianism). People contribute their thoughts and ideas for public consumption, but just because someone may not care for the ideas of another that does not warrant the article as meaningless. For example, right now you probably have about 55% of the people that 'don't care for' George W. Bush, but does that mean his article on Wikipedia should be deleted? Should articles about God and Jesus be deleted because someone is an atheist, or Muslim, or Hindu? Wikipedia is a marketplace of ideas, but this article deletion policy is just a mere step away from censorship and book burning. Every article with a purpose -- no matter how ridiculous (<a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape_Escape_3_7379.html" title="Ape Escape 3">Ape Escape 3</a> anyone?) -- deserves to be part of that free market exchange. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.208.110.32 (<a href="../../../2/0/6/User_talk%7E206.208.110.32.html" title="User talk:206.208.110.32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.208.110.32_e778.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.208.110.32">contribs</a>) 13:31, 23 March 2006 (UTC).</small>

<li>I hate to disagree with my esteemed colleague from the UK but I think this nom is at best a few days early.

<li><b>Note</b>: The mere <i>existance</i> of an album or CD (since it is relatively easy to do low copy count production runs for not a lot of money, I could produce an album of my musings on the stylistic failings of dog music for 400 USD or so I think...) is not sufficient to demonstrate notability per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. There has to be some evidence of sales through established outlets, or evidence of impact on others, or evidence via reviews, etc... In this case I think some of that evidence does exist (but is enough to make it barely notable, at best) which is why I suggested a merge. Colin's point that there is no article to merge TO is valid... so maybe this should be moved and other dog music articles <i>then</i> merged with this one? <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:45, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is a genuine item with a real connection to The Beatles' music, and therefore of potential interest to anyone researching The Beatles. <b>Comment</b>: This is what I don't understand about <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" class="extiw" title="m:Deletionism">deletionists</a> - they frequently advocate removal of material which is potentially of genuine interest to researchers on a topic, which is based on real and genuine sources, but may be a little obscure. Is there some merit in keeping Wikipedia to the bare minimum? If so, why are these huge bloated articles tolerated which deal with all sorts of subjects of fan-dom of little interest to anyone but the most obsessive fans of various print and electronic media? --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 13:10, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Honestly, there is no encyclopaedic content here at all! <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 23:56, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

No doubt that's why they wrote <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a directory. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:13, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As usual <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a> makes some good points. However, I don't think we should delete articles because someone else out on the internet has produced a better version. If that's the case many, many articles here would have to go. The advantage is that we can be an impartial source that has no pecuniary interest in the material covered. Getting back to the Dummy series, I know that people really admire and love these books, kind of like Harry Potter. As such, I see little difference between this list and any of our many book lists that people can begin to peruse at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lists_of_books.html" title="List of lists of books">List of lists of books</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:13, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But it isn't just "someone out on the Internet" with a better version - more like, the publisher's list is a source, and our list is completely derivative of their list. I understand that we can be impartial in the article that describes the series, and that the publisher can't. But how can we be any more impartial than the publisher in producing a bare list of titles? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 05:00, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It should be pretty obvious how we can be more impartial since we can draw from any source we want to compile the list. Also why do you think this list is condemned to remain "a bare list"? Why does <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> have a list of Harry potter books? Couldn't the publisher do that better? Or for that matter, why don't we just leave it for a fan site?

<dd>A few points:
<ul>
<li>Are you arguing that the publisher's listing of its own products is biased? I'd say that it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a></i> is a completely different case, because each individual book is notable—each has topped best-seller lists, garnered critical praise in mass-media outlets, etc. The list of <i>Harry Potter</i> books (<b>note</b>: which is not on List of Harry Potter books), links to articles on notable subjects. With very rare exceptions, the only claim to notability most <i>...For Dummies</i> books have is being a <i>...For Dummies</i> book.</li>
<li>Following, this is condemned to remain a bare list, for all intents, because the vast majority of its subjects of the list aren't notable enough for inclusion on Wikipedia. It will be more useful to put any articles which may be created in a Category:...For Dummies books, rather than bury wikilinks between hundreds of list entries.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I am unconvinced that this article will ever contain useful content in addition to the basic list of titles. And if it's just a list of titles, it serves Wikipedia better to link to the publishers site instead of maintaining them ourselves. - <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 14:26, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am not arguing anything. I have been responding to questions that were addressed to me. If I wanted to argue, which I most assuredly do not, I would be leaving comments for other people, as you have done. Furthermore, you are certainly entitled to your opinion about what books should be listed here based on any criteria you wish to apply. I have expressed my opinion on the matter and I strive not to let my POV influence my thinking. For the record, I have never read Harry Potter or a dummy book. As far as I know, they are both highly profitable, longstanding book series. They both probably sell a lot of copies and are widely read. In short, for me they are the same and as far as I am concerned we should have articles on every one of those dummy books, just like we do for Harry Potter or any other book series that people choose to add to the site. Going further, I would see no problem with having articles on every book ever published in every language since Gutenberg. That to me would be truly encyclopedic, and I apologize for using that truly meaningless word.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:52, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're swallowing the propaganda put out by the media conglomerates. Lots of things they're trying to make you think are copyright violations really aren't. How could a list of books <i>possibly</i> be a copyright violation?! That would pretty much make all library catalog systems illegal. It's in the publisher's best interests for <i>lists</i> of their books to be available, fer godssakes. Also, prior court findings on matters like these have been that facts themselves cannot be copyrighted. A mere list of what some corporation has published, which is a fact, can't be a copyright violation. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 00:23, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is not legal advice. But: Some think that specially ordered and categorized information is copyrightable. If this is the case, this IS a copyvio. Library catalog systems aren't copyvio, as they don't follow the same ordering/categorization as other lists. Also, they don't include/exclude the same things. IF such organized lists are copyrightable, this is definitely copyvio. There IS caselaw for copyrighting fairly mundane things.

<li>That would be true, but Jacksonville has five daily newspapers. The largest (the Times Union) lists 29 articles on Stephen Dare alone. None of those hits are included on the hundred or so google search hits. Also, the Times Union only includes articles written after '97, 10 years after his first article in that publication. (I looked it up) The second largest (The Jacksonville Business Journal) has 18 hits over the past three years, also not included in the gooogle search. The third largest, The Financial Daily Record has listed 10 articles either about or mentioning Dare over the past year. The Jacksonville Star, an African American daily newspaper has four articles about Mr. Dare.....the list goes on. I notice that the new links at the bottom of the page list Cincinatti as well.

When I called him to inquire about the other individuals, he was unsure what the entry was about, and had never heard of 'syncretism'. Mr. Dare's page has been serially vandalized by a group of individuals who have bragged about their vandalism on their myspace pages. reference: <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=887943" class="external free" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=887943" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=887943</a>. (scroll about midway down) When I asked about the individual, it turns out he was a disgruntled band promoter. I last updated his wiki article to flesh out his accomplishments, of which there are a number.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.193.67.231 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.193.67.231_a892.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.193.67.231">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Stephen Dare runs the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boomtown_Theatre_c228.html" title="Boomtown Theatre">Boomtown Theatre</a> page, which was created by Stephendare (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephendare_0f93.html" title="User talk:Stephendare">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stephendare_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stephendare">contribs</a>) last year. FWIW, Dare did not create a page for himself. The current page is probably 90% pure cowpies and you have to go back to very early edits to find a version that even comes close to looking like a verifiable article. The alternatives are to stub the article back to an early edit, verify it, then babysit it; or delete it. I'm leaning toward <i>delete</i>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Technically invalid AfD"? Oh dear god, the process wonks have won over again. You want a stupid little tag on each page? Fine, I'll go do that now. Of course, instead of moping about it, you could have done it yourself. We don't close AfDs for improper "filing" of a clerical nature, so don't be so picky. Don't bother opening whole new slanging matches for the things, just tag it and let this one run its course. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> 21:15, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry if you interpreted that as some kind of hostility. It just seemed to me it would be best to list clearly nn articles separately from one that just might not be not nn (though I have my reservations).

If people don't understand why this holds more interest than a "proof that 4 exceeds 3" would, then they have failed to understand the article. Remember there was a time when people hadn't worked out the value of pi. Knowing that it's close to 22/7, but not exactly, might lead one to wonder whether 22/7 is an <i>over</i>-approximation or an <i>under</i>-approximation. This proof makes it clear that 22/7 is high, so the true value of pi is somewhere below it. Sure, we know now that pi=3.14159, approximately, but people had to work that out somehow. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 03:25, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This fact is just the sort of thing one would <i>expect</i> people to find intriguing and curiosity-provoking. That's why it's notable. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 17:35, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, not necessarily. Reflect on the statement "intriguing and curiosity-provoking facts are notable" for a while, and now imagine the articles this policy could defend. It's not a pretty sight.
<dl>
<dd>Off hand, I cannot think of any hypothetical articles that could be "intriguing and curiosity-provoking" but "not a pretty sight". By all means, tell me what you have in mind, if you can. Perhaps I should add to "intriguing and curiosity-provoking", that this article could lead to insights that in turn lead to further discoveries. People who see this argument often wonder if this is the first in a long sequence of integrals with a neat pattern, that correspond to the successive convergents in the continued fraction expansion of π, just as this corresponds to 22/7. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 00:11, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I don't think anyone disputes that the fact that 22/7 is really close to π should be included in Wikipedia. Whether a property of an integral cast in proof form qualifies is another matter. And whether the dozens if not hundreds of equally intriguing mathematical curios should have articles is yet another.</dd>
<dd>Then again, notability has never been a useful criterion on Wikipedia, and the "cui malo?" argument seems to apply aptly here. This proof is probably not any less notable than, say, any of the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invalid_proof.html" title="Invalid proof">invalid proofs</a> we have on record. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.119.11.html" title="User:82.92.119.11">82.92.119.11</a> 20:19, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The key problem here is that despite all the claims to elegance and such, there's no objective criteria for inclusion that we're using to justify this article. The other articles in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProofs_4245.html" title="Category:Proofs">category:proofs</a> are either about methods used in proofs or specific proofs that are well known and specifically named. This proof doesn't have any historical importance attached to it in the way that a proof of a major problem in math is—mathematicians have known pi&lt;22/7 far longer than they've been doing calculus. "indiscriminate collection of information" applies because this proof becomes the equivalent of an "interesting fact" about a person--worthy of inclusion in the article on the person, but <i>not worth its own article</i>. On its own, it's unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 23:29, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then we can conceivably expand the article to include other proofs of π&lt;22/7 that may have been used in antiquity (If my memory serves me correctly, I do believe there is a geometric demonstration of that inequality). Just because the article as it stands only includes one method of proof does not mean that it can never have more than one method of proof. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 08:30, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>"have known pi&lt;22/7 far longer than"</b> But what's important here is the method of proof, rather than just the fact being proved. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:01, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't have any really precise criterion (<i>please</i> don't use "criteria" in the singular!!!) for what proofs should be allowed, but this is a really pretty proof, with a verified and interesting story behind it. I don't think I'd really like to see the door opened to textbook-style routine proofs in general; certainly techniques can be outlined, but people who want the details probably should get the textbook. But I don't see why we can't have a few articles on proofs that are interesting in themselves (as distinct from the results they prove). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 03:45, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a fine addition to the mathematical content of Wikipedia. I find the argument that a proof can't be an article unconvincing. As long as it's not crap, OR, etc., I see no reason why a proof can't be an article. I think the reason this article is not part of another is that it serves some purpose to have these standalone articles. I can easily envision other articles about famous theorems that would require separate articles on different proofs. I can even imagine that in the near future (a project I'm pondering), one would even need separate articles for <i>parts</i> of of an immense outline of a proof in addition to separate articles just for historical background (and motivation) about the theorem and proof. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 23:29, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Just to correct an inaccuracy above, I'm not at all convinced one can flatly state that this result was around before calculus.

<li><b>Low Keep</b>. I see there are slight notability issues, as I haven't heard of them, but here I was on wiki as I am a lot (without an account usually), and my brother told me to click here, and he said he's heard of them. Now I have no idea how he's heard of them as he's rarely out much, although he has done 'laserforce' (a laser game) quite a lot in the past year. This is a fellow Australian group, which has notability issues in America, Europe etc, but I feel this would make a good reference for Aussies and I've been a fan of social groups ever since high school.

<li><b>neutral</b> As written it is riddled with POV but there is the germ of a good article in there, in that several British MPs are well known to be in favour of legalisation. others are not.

<b>Instead of moaning:</b> you could <b>help</b> rephrase what <u>you</u> perceive to be POV and what <u>you</u> perceive to be emotive wording. After all, 108 MEP signed one declaration hence the wording to show it is incomplete -<b>how else do you say it?</b> If someone else can phrase it better then let them help. The list is also need to counter the comments by some, that there is little support for improvements to the existing laws -which itself is POV. Or do you want to have it both ways? Also, it is hardly (or wont be) 'indiscriminate'... And Look at all the articles listing just 'highways', etc. Why don't you put them up for deletion? Just go to list of lists and look though a few lists of things. =<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Allpages/List_of" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Allpages/List_of" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Allpages/List_of</a> As for it being untidy -it is. I am far from happy with it. There is still information to go on and if you look at the creation date <b>it has only just been created</b> . Some of you might have time to sit at the computer all day but some of us have other things to do. Much of this info is being collected be people who have to pick up the pieces (e.g., social workers, probation workers, lecturers in crime prevention etc) after things go wrong from laws that badly need improving. I expect few of you ( by the way you write) have got any <i>crack houses</i> near you, nor have witnessed at first hand the horror of it all, or your mind might be making connections to the wider picture, about what this list represents. Have you had people drop to the floor and turn blue, would you know how to handle it? Do you know were I and all these other people views are coming from?<br />
As for the comment about any body on the lists changing their mind, it can be updated LIKE ANY OTHER ARTICLE that apt to change.<br />
These articles seem to have been picked up by people who have not thought about it, nor realised that will links in with other stuff - do they reasonably expect that whole thing to be set up at once? Finally: If you look on the first talk page of the first article created it says:<br />
<i>These lists may not make sense to some people who are out of the loop until some of the other templates go on to explain the background and place the lists in context.

<p>Although a notable figure seems to have been involved in Machine Gun Kelly, this seems a non-notable event. To quote from the original version of the article: "...few people know much about it, if anything at all. And Willmar doesn’t celebrate the event or even talk about it." Obviously it needs a massive clean up but I think there's nothing worth saving.

The fact that they are being The Defiants had local significance prior to the ubiquity of local rock bands, and as such are rather more significant than the dozens of bands that we delete daily.

Like all such lists, it creates issues of verifiability, and is essentially indiscriminate (ie, there is no evidence that these people have similar views on Judaism, observe it to the same degree in their lives, regard themselves as Jewish, don't share other ethnicities as well as a connection to being Jewish, etc.) So, there is <b>no meaning, no encyclopedic reason</b> to group these people together. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 17:55, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Isn't every person who invested in these Enron-type companies a "victim" so any who are also (verifiably) Jewish get added to the list? No usefulness for that. As for the criminal side, there was certainly Jewish-run organized crime rings (equivalent to the Italian mafia), a list of those players may be encyclopedic and useful, but this is a collection of crooks of varying decrees of culpability and Jewishness -- moreover, I find no evidence in the biographies of Sarah Jane Moore and the Menendez brothers that they are even faintly Jewish. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:32, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's taken me a while to realise what I feel about this page. I think I can see merit in a page that attempted to list people who were victims <i>because</i> they were Jewish (though I'm aware that verification might often be difficult) and that similar lists of victimization because of different creeds, lifestyle, political views etc. might be created could have a place. This list is not such a list. Any list that fixes on this or other character attributes is arbitary (at best) and potentially inflammatory at worst.

<li><b>Please Preserve!</b> This list has been here for quite a while and only just now has become controversial; If the argument is simply that Jews shouldn't be singled out for special treatment, then all the many other lists of Jews (writers, businesspeople, etc., etc., etc.) should be deleted as well; Likewise the lists of American murderers and American criminals also represent a demonizing of a particular group which I as an American could legitimately object to or question the point of, but I don't because (as an American who occasionally jaywalks) I also believe in the right to freedom of expression as enshrined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (which I believe is still in effect, although sometimes I wonder); Admittedly the external links for the Knoller/Noel dog-mauling case were originally to a decidedly anti-Semitic site <a href="http://judicial-inc.biz" class="external autonumber" title="http://judicial-inc.biz" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, but I have since linked them to the CourtTV site since these two convicted killers of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Whipple_9b02.html" title="Diane Whipple">Diane Whipple</a> don't have a Wiki page (although they deserve one, like all the other well-known figures on the list). As for the Menendez brothers, their father was a Cuban Jew, and after his murder Erik made his way briefly to Israel <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/menendez/arrests_13.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/menendez/arrests_13.html" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> where Jews have special automatic citizenship status and therefore won't be extradited to the U.S. to face capital punishment; Removing this list without removing all the many other lists of Jews and lists of criminals would be caving in to censorship and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=hypocri&amp;searchtype=all&amp;version1=47&amp;spanbegin=1&amp;spanend=73" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=hypocri&amp;searchtype=all&amp;version1=47&amp;spanbegin=1&amp;spanend=73" rel="nofollow">hypocrisy</a>-- something condemned by a certain well-known New Testament Jewish prophet revered by billions of Christians and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus#Islamic_views" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus#Islamic_views" rel="nofollow">Muslims.</a> — Someone (not me) went to the trouble of creating this list quite a while ago, and apparently no one objected until now. Someone also (not me) went to the trouble (last November) of changing it from just "criminals" to "criminals and victims" -- and someone else (me) moved the list of victims to the top of the page to give it more prominence. Clearly an effort is being made to present the facts as fairly as possible, which suggests anything but "inflammatory" and "anti-Jewish advocacy" as the above commenters claim. A few of the names I added have already been legitimately removed because they were not actually convicted of a crime, which I admit I should have been more careful about. It's not a question of whether I personally "like these lists" -- yes, I like the way that Wikipedia is filled with an amazing degree of cross-referencing via hyperlinks, of which the thousands of "these lists" are an integral part. I also like the way Wikipedia goes to great lengths to present an amazing variety of facts from its famously neutral P.O.V., and provides for lively discussions like this one when disputes inevitably erupt. If people thought that Wiki was being "sanitized for your protection" from anything icky, they might start to take it all with a grain of salt -- as they do with the dumbed-down information presented through the mainstream media, which is why people are turning more and more to websites like Wiki. The essential point is that this list is only one of dozens and dozens of Wikipedia lists and categories of Jews, Americans, victims and criminals -- not even counting other ethnicities and nationalities. There are no fewer than 59 pages in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_Jews_e43d.html" title="Category:Lists of Jews">Category:Lists of Jews</a> alone -- should this be changed to "Lists of Good Jews" only, with a little happy face ☺ next to each entry? Or perhaps a gold star <font color="gold">★</font>? What makes any of these pages any more or less "meaningful" than any other page in Wikipedia, or on the web? The question "Why should people who are 'Jewish' be collected together?" can be answered with a rhetorical "Why <i>shouldn't</i> they?" Wouldn't removing these 59 lists (and all the dozens of sublists therein) be an act of ethnic cleansing? If you have a problem with a particular name on a particular list, consider removing it while stating exactly why. But please don't delete (i.e., censor) the entire list unless <i>all</i> such lists are "cleansed" from <i>all</i> of Wikipedia -- G☺d forbid! -- 4.240.123.114 11:38, 16 March 2006 (UTC) -- ElCabezón

<li><b>Comment</b>. You seem to be missing the point. This isn't about censorship or freedom of expression. If you like these lists, create one on a website. The point is what is appropriate for an encyclopedia, which should collect meaningful information and try for objectivity (not POV). This information is not meaningful. If it has a meaning, please explain what that is. Why should people who are "Jewish" be collected together? Aren't they individuals, with individual views? They might object to being categorized like this. Arguing that there are other lists on Wikipedia which are just as problematic does not address the issue. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 15:26, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

I think it would be better to split into a list of criminals vs. a list of murder victims, but the Jewishness of the people in the list IS an interesting and encyclopedic reason for this list to exist.

<li><b>Comment</b> I find this whole debate <i><b>very</b></i> disturbing. There is no reason not to have lists of types of people by nationality: it's not only encyclopedic, it's actually <i>interesting</i>, which is one step higher, and religion should be no different from nationality. However, I am actually quite offended by the idea that because it's a list of "bad people" we shouldn't have it. That's POV pushing! It's one thing if the community thinks none of these lists are worth having... I disagree, but fine. But it is NOT antisemitism to have a list of Jewish criminals: we have lots of other lists of Jews, for one thing, but even if we didn't, and even if it WAS antisemitism, that can't be a basis for excluding it from a neutral encyclopedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, Jewish victims and criminals would be much too large a list if done properly, and in any situation, criminals are (to my mind) more interesting and arguably more encyclopedic than victims. Victims are passive, generally just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Criminals on the other hand, there is action to it. Its like how Iago is a more interesting character than Othello.

<dd>Thanks for that. Yes, she did do a Widcombe church page, and she did the Skinner page, but I take it that these are matters she happens to know about. Since she also did this page <a href="../../../t/o/t/Tota_pulchra_es.html" title="Tota pulchra es">Tota_pulchra_es</a>, a page reflecting on Mary and the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which is contrary to Baptist and other Protestant theology, so it is unlikely that she has POV issues, whereas there is systematic deletion of Christian related articles going on all over Wikipedia. I think it is one thing when there are two sides trying on the one hand to increase Christian content and on the other to delete it, but it's a pity if the contributions of someone who had no such intention, and was merely writing about something local to her, should be caught up in this. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_fb92.html" title="User:Usenetpostsdotcom">Uncle Davey</a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_1e10.html" title="User talk:Usenetpostsdotcom">(Talk)</a> 12:43, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Sorry that I'm still fighting this, but I really believe that this guy is notable. <a href="http://www.theedgeofknownreality.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theedgeofknownreality.com" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> - his website, featuring information about the book he wrote and a radio program he recorded for BBC radio 4 (<a href="http://www.theedgeofknownreality.com/audio_material.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theedgeofknownreality.com/audio_material.htm" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>). <a href="http://www.evangelicalpress.org/books/The_edge_of_known_reality.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.evangelicalpress.org/books/The_edge_of_known_reality.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> - a page providing information on his book.

<li>I think it would help more if the links were not all self-promotional. Except for one review of one book, nobody seems to care about him outside his immediate circle. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 18:30, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We are looking for evidence that other people beyond Skinner himself and possibly a small circle of parishoners and fans finds him insteresting enough to write about. If 2 people think he's important, then he probably isn't; if ten thousand people think he is important, he problably is. The dividing line is invisible and fuzzy. To help the wikipedia community evaluate specific people, we look for outside evidence. See below. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:53, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Evidence</b> Lexis/Nexis search covering the past 12 months finds several columns written by Skinner for the <i><a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Daily_Press_9e23.html" title="Western Daily Press">Western Daily Press</a></i> and some letters to the editor replying to him in one way or another. He takes on <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, who had just run a 2-part BBC special declaring that religion was immoral, and he defended tony Blair, who was criticized by the press for saying that God would judge the rightness of the Iraq invasion. Also a book review that thought Skinner's book proceeded from a logical fallacy and would only be convincing to the already convinced. (I can't link to Lexis/Nexis but I can provide the dates and page numbers; I don't know if the Western Daily Press has a web presence or not.) <s>I have not voted yet, leaning toward keep but would like to know what others think in light of this Lexis/Nexis search.</s> Based on the fact that he has published 50+ newspaper columns in addition to a column in the <i>Evangelical Times</i>, and because we have dozens of articles on the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Expanded Universe (Star Wars)</a>, we can <b>keep</b> this one too. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:53, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Good evidence, hadn't seen that. I'd add and re-clarify that he writes for the Evangelical Times which has a circulation of about 40 000. I believe that he is therefore notable as a journalist. People disagree? <a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbbyemery_4417.html" title="User:Abbyemery">Abbyemery</a> 19:44, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes. Being a journalist is not notable in itself. It hurts a bit that his only book review comes from a publication he writes for. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 19:58, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nice one Slowmover. But if you search, you'll find lots of reviews of the book (The Edge of Known Reality and Beyond) coming from independent reviewers/publications.

<li><b>Evidence</b> See the article's talk page.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although there should also be a disambiguation page, as there is also an American Professor of economics in print and an ecopoet both of whom share that name and each feature higher in Google, it has to be admitted, although this is no accurate measure of notability.

<dd>Hi guys, it's me again, I'm a bit of a newbie to this and I'm just wondering: is the page kept purely on votes for delete or keep, despite the fact that a lot of the delete votes came in before evidence was displayed? <a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbbyemery_4417.html" title="User:Abbyemery">Abbyemery</a> 07:53, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. Only one vote per person is allowed, but the decision is not made by the volume of votes (therefore, multiple votes by one person make no difference anyway). After 5 days, unless it looks like more time is required, an Admin will review the debate, decide if there was a consensus, and act on the consensus. This looks like no consensus to me (IMHO), so it's likely that this page will not be deleted. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 15:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately, some of your patrols seem to be ignorant college students with little knowledge of the subjects they are policing, thus making this entire "wikiproject" absurd by design. Though I find all of this amusing, I have no desire to engage in a long discussion as to the merits of my entry, I merely posted it on a whim after finding its entry strangely absent from your database. I am a university professor and not only am I aware of the club, I attended the hypermodern lecture series with the esteemed Mr. Baudrillard himself at my institution. The presence of the club has been written up in several books, the authenticity of which I do not doubt, and if that is insufficient I will leave the "google-ing" to you.</p>
<p>I wish wikipedia the best into the future and by all means do what you wish with my entry.</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> So since you haven't "heard of it" the entry should be deleted, above poster? That's essentially what this sophomoric debate amounts to, 1.) a 2-second google search, and 2.) philosophy students upset that a professor (rightly) calls them out as unknowing. I, too, had never heard of this organization until reading the entry, but as a New Yorker, I certainly remember the Baudrillard lecture to which the entry refers. I regret that I could not make it. Can you clarify why you consider it "vanity", or "made up in school" because both accusations are tenuous at best?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think we understand it's not "made up". However, is it appropriate for Wikipedia to have an article about something of very little significance outside the small group of people who are familiar with it? If it is notable, provide a published reference. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, where the POV nature of "notability" is discussed.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Against my better judgment I am returning to this debate because Wikipedia, an incredibly ambitious project (apparently) run by students, is certainly intriguing to this old-timer academic who just recently got used to e-mail! I applaud you all. In fact, I'm sure I'd love to have you all in any of my classes for some lively discussions. But to the issue - I pulled this book from my shelf, which unfortunately is in German (loosely translated): "The Decline of the Frankfurt School in European Universities" by Karl Zinner, Uni Saarland, 2002, which contains several pages on the relatively new organization (pgs. 134-145). If anyone is interested please investigate so that this discussion can move beyond such hypersensitive sentiments such as "my (ongoing) graduate education in philosophy must be worthless" and into the merits of the club itself, which are somewhat insidious if taken at face value. Also, one might consider contacting Slippery Rock University philosophy Professor Bernard Freydberg, who surely can offer more on the subject than I. Finally, I want to apologize if I have offended anybody with my previous remarks on this subject.</li>

<p>As a Brooklynite, I am amused to find wikipedia entrys for “Rubulad,” a debaucherous party that occurs every few months on the Northside, and the entry for “East Williamsburg Industrial Park,” which is where I live, described condescendingly in its sophomoric entry, and to LBJ’s Gulf of Tonkin resolution which could be assailed by number of history professors. Being an academic myself, I am curious to understand why references to both Jean Baudrillard and Martin Heidegger cannot philosophically legitimize an “entry” into your ghoulish dream of information consolidation. Also, I would like to know how many moderators and even "philosophical grad students" are not only versed in Attic and Homeric Greek, but are intimate with those earliest of thinkers, Anaximander, Heraclitus, Thales, Parmenides, Anaximenes, that forcefully mark the inception of "Western thinking."</p>
<p>You allow entire entries which are devoted to “reptoid conspiracies,” which allege that the ruling global elite are actually shape-shifting reptilian creatures who sprung from an ancient genetic experiment, perpetrated by a dim race of ET visitors. The entry for this is quite exhaustive, preposterous, and downright insulting to those of us who do, in fact, descend from the reptoid bloodline, and do not have some insidious dream to enslave humanity through domestic internment camps, internet regulation, and RFID bio-metric ID cards. Please, show some discretion, and permit these people who, like bees flung from their hive, and deep into the mists of fragrant gardens, seek only to pollinate and prolong their sweet, succulent existence.</p>

<p>While I believe it is irrelevant to dicker over the fine points of this entry. I cannot help but remark when the pot calls the kettle black. Just the other day, I was reading how political yes-men had been consistently ammending and omitting submited data for Wikipedia entries on various politicians. What we have here is a fine object lesson in information theory. Wikipedia itself represents the hypermodern attitude toward information - vis a vis the flux, eternal expansion and user generation that categorize the internet as a whole. If the mavens of Wikipedia believe themselves to be one iota holier than the myspace whores, with regard to self-promotion by users, they have a tragic lack of self-insight. The roots of the Wiki project and the internet itself are in a mistrust of absolute truth, cancerous generation and alternative history, which come together like Voltron to form the god Narrative. If ya don't know your roots, then you got no culture. And I'll shed no tears when big Fox Murdoch separates your wheat from its chaff.</p>

<b>Comment</b>. I have just <s>confirmed</s> gone out of my way to verify that Davidson and Northwestern, as I stated in the initial entry, have <s>*confirmed*</s> chapters for the Hypermodernity Club. Please call them yourselves if you must verify this even further. Moreover, a colleague of mine, the head of philosophy at Tulane university, served as US chapter President for 2004, thus confirming that the group is "notable". <s>As far as anyone with any sort of intellectual acumen is concerned,</s> Now the burden of proof as to the club's worthiness for inclusion into the Wikipedia database falls on the above moderators (students) who so rashly dismissed it.</p>

<li>Note: this is ZornArmand's 8th edit or so, to 5 different AfD debates. <b>Delete.</b> Hypermodernity is certainly a notable concept and a movement. Paul Ambery's book reference by Karl Zinner doesn't exist on the Library of Congress online catalog. Existence of clubs at two universities doesn't make the overall organization notable. As a "secret society" it's impossible to verify any of this information without actual sources. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 16:32, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the references. I grabbed the closest one at hand, the paper from <i>Theory, Culture &amp; Society</i>, 1998. Odd that it would mention The Hypermodernity Club since it was published at least a year before the article claims the Club was founded. I found a lengthy discussion of the end of modernity and the year 2000, but no mention of THC (I didn't even notice the word "hypermodernity" used, although as Mangojuice points out the concept of hypermodernity itself seems notable). This is all beginning to wear rather thin. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 00:52, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

First of all, I excluded alleged sockpuppets and weighted down one opinion for the reasons stated. I then checked the contribs of names I didn't recognise (which revealed no new cause for concern). I then looked at the numbers; deletion is the favoured outcome numerically but not by a landslide. Finally, I used my discretion in evaluating the arguments and who made them. AFD regulars favour deletion, whereas Australian contributors have argued that this is a reasonably notable company. My decision ultimately is that both sides have a case; the article shouldn't be allowed to stand as a POV fork, but that the company in question is not undeserving of an article. My summation of the debate is, therefore, that the article is not acceptable <i>as it stands</i> but an article on this company <i>could</i> be acceptable; the result of the debate is therefore delete without prejudice to a clean start. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox is most relevant here. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 10:38, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not a lot of hard work as this is a rehash of what was in the Dean McVeigh article plus a large verbatim legal extract. I reiterate, the company is non notable, the liquidation is of mild interest due to the removal of McVeigh but there should be no confusion that this is simply an attempt to circumvent the toning down of the McVeigh POV in other articles by editors with a vested interest. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarglebutt_ee27.html" title="User:Garglebutt">Garglebutt</a> / <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarglebutt_a0ca.html" title="User talk:Garglebutt">(talk)</a> 08:09, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Strong Keep</s></b> This is clearly an abuse of the article for deletion process and a very unfortunate act by its proposer. Notable company, notable liquidation, notable litigation about the liquidation. I would like to see those proposing its deletion actually state otherwise and participate in the discussion. These are <i>reported cases</i> from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal etc. They are important cases which were the subject of several media reports as well at the time aside from being published in relevant law reports which clearly demonstrate their notability in legal terms. There are very, very few cases of a company administrator ever being removed, as anyone familiar with the area of insolvency law will tell you, the threshold is so high that it is nearly impossible to cross. If you have issues with the content, change it but don't abuse this Afd process to pursue some sort of sad vendetta.

<li><b>Agree with Achan</b>. On the face of it, the company seems reasonably notable (but I haven't looked into the issues). <i>However</i>, the use of this article to continue a vendetta against Dean McVeigh is <i>exceedingly</i> inappropriate and troubling, not to mention immature, as is Garglebutt's apparent crusade against Darren and Ben.

Secondly, the article on Dean McVeigh was redirected by AFD consensus; if this article is an attempt to recreate McVeigh material by the backdoor it most certainly <i>is</i> an issue for AFD.

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b> Sorry I missed all the fun. But on a serious note, I would just like to say I thought this article would actually help resolve the issue about the missing information from Dean McVeigh's article after it was merged with <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_University_student_organisations_bf7b.html" title="Melbourne University student organisations">Melbourne University student organisations</a>. It wasn't appropriate to leave the information about Rugs Galore in there and I thought this was an ideal solution. If the article incorrectly states what happens in the Supreme Court cases, and I don't believe it does, why don't we have that discussion. Separating Dean McVeigh who was its Administrator and was central to what went wrong in its Administration does seem rather a strange objective. Anyway, see you at the Talk page and let's resolve it amicably. --<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2006BC_4eed.html" title="User:2006BC">2006BC</a> 07:28, 16 March 2006 (UTC) <b>I'm disregarding this contribution since the user is blocked indefinitely per <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenRay_Sockpuppets_d5a0.html" title="User:DarrenRay/Sockpuppets">User:DarrenRay/Sockpuppets</a>. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 10:24, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

<p>I disagree; the Scroll is a notable middle school newspaper, as it wins awards and the editing staff are generally invited to a journalistic conference because of their hard work. Saying that someone on the paper is self advertising is absurd: it is a free newspaper given out to all ASL middle schoolers. I don't know what kind of personal vendetta you have against the scroll, but there is no need for you to do this. The Scroll wikipedia entry is not violating any wiki or school rules, and therefore your arguments are not valid.

<li>Seeing as how it has a very small circulation among only a few hundred people at one school, it is completely non notable for anyone who doesn't already know about it (i.e. who doesn't go to the school).

<p>"KEEP IT" What on earth do you have against the scroll!?! The Scroll is a notable paper and scored first class in a recent rating. it also won best of show for middle school newspapers during an NSPA confrence. I agree with the above when it says that " Saying that someone on the paper is self advertising is absurd: it is a free newspaper given out to all ASL middle schoolers." He has a perfect point; why on earth would a FREE newspaper that contains NO advertisments and sole purpose is to inform the population of the american school about goings on, want to advertise. The Scroll is a fabulous example of students trying (and succeding) to be heard in their community. scroll editors spend at least 2 hours a week working on the paper plus many of their weekends trying to put out the best paper they can. if you think that the paper is "bad" then take it up with the editors, but keep this page open to all that want to read about it. When you say "some kid" you are talking about 14 students selected out of 400 to represent their fellow students and voice issue concerning them. Please, at least treat the editors with some respect.

<li>This isn't about the quality of the paper, or what we think about the editors. I just respectfully think that this newspaper is not worthy of an encyclopedia article.

<p>Mr. Ben, may i say one thing. this is not a vanity page. this page was not created with the purpose to promore ourselfs. we simply wanted people to know more about our paper. if you have an issue with, dare i say it, making information public and availible, i suggest you stop waundering around wiki.</p>
<p>Excuse me, dear sir, but direct me to the place where it says my name in glorious letters on the Scroll wikipedia page? This is about the Scroll itself. A concious decision was made when the page was made; we didn't use any names because we thought than we might avoid the accusation that you are making right now. This is not an attempt to make us feel better, but to inform other people from other schools about the Scroll. Wikipedia is supposed to be the ultimate encyclopedia, where every term can be defined. The Scroll is just as worthy to hold a single page of explanation as any other newspaper. There are some pages on Wikipedia which take up a lot more room and serve a lot less purpose than this one. Perhaps you should dedicate your noble efforts to those sites more worthy of your exaulted attention.

<p>I was not aware I could say something perfeclty. Look, if this is some sort of vendetta against all middle school and high school newspapers, then I could accept it. But its not; for some reason you have singled out your own middle school newspaper for abuse. Why don't you go after the Trojan Times? They are a middle school newspaper. They have virtually the same layout as us. Go and flag them for deletion, just let us have our few kilobytes of space.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.148.37.20 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.148.37.20_683e.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.148.37.20">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>To add to the above's point, the Trojan Times is much more of a vanity page than the Scroll's. The site clearly says,"Pierce Middle School's "Trojan Times" is widely regarded as one of – if not the – best middle school newspaper in the United States." The Scroll page doesn't have opinionated comments such as the one above. I believe that the page is enlightening other Middle School papers to that fact that there is a MS paper in the American School in London. I don't think it was a vanity page at all. I don't believe that it was created for this reason. I appreciate your opinions, Urthogie, but your points aren't convincing me. I didn't see anything on the Scroll page that caused me to believe what you said.

<dd>I am not just picking on the Scroll; if I see another non notable middle school paper, I will recommend it for deletion, but yours is the only one I have chanced upon. If I see a page that "take[s] up a lot more room and serve[s] a lot less purpose than this one" I shall recommend it for deletion as well. You are welcome to go ahead an recommend the pages you refer to for deletion (you might want to register an account first). However, the fact that there are worse articles does not mean that this one is automatically considered of sufficient notability for wikipedia. The page itself does not provide much information that cannot be determined just by looking at a copy of the paper (e.g. the contents and sections of the paper) nor any information that would interest people who have not read a copy. This is because, and I mean no offense, the Scroll is pretty much an average middle school paper. It has interviewed a few moderately famous people, and has won a minor award, but on the whole it is not very distinguished from any of the other tens of thousands of middle school papers out there. It has not been the topic of any sort of news that extends beyond the school, nor does its readership extend beyond the school (and perhaps a few people in the schools that you send a copy of your paper to). Beyond the few people that already know about your paper, nobody cares about it. Sorry. It's a bit harsh, but it's a bit true. Nobody cares. Your paper is not famous or unusual enough to warrant an article on wikipedia. If you want other schools to have a place online where they can learn more about the Scroll, I recommend setting up a website or something and printing the URL in the paper. But wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> a place for your webpage and is not an indiscriminate collection of information, so it is not the place for this kind of thing. And if you have a problem with that, then you have a problem with the rules, policies and community of wikipedia itself.-<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasmaDragon_68d9.html" title="User:PlasmaDragon">PlasmaDragon</a> 18:34, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As i said before, the awards it wins are not minor ("and has won a minor award," ) they are the best that is avaible for any student newpaper.

<ul>
<li>PlasmaDragon, you've given a really good argument. Go ahead and delete the page, because no matter what we do, the Scroll (and I say this in the most respectful way I can) isn't important enough to be in this online encyclopedia.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.107.70.202 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.107.70.202_41ff.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.107.70.202">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, good sir plasmadragon (nice name, by the way, extraordinarily manly), you have outdone yourself once again. In suggesting that this is the first middle school paper that you "chanced" upon, also serves to suggest that you did not attempt to merely look through wiki's search engine. The first item that you find when searching "middle school newspaper" is "the trojan times," which is nearly identical to the page that the Scroll has set up. Why don't you go and flag their site for deletion, and dash their humble dreams upon the rocks? You claim that the Scroll is a "average middle school newspaper," which has won "a minor award." Well, that really depends on your definition of minor. My definition of minor is something that is not important; perhaps something that no-one notices. Well, it would be difficult for someone not to notice the Scroll if it was announced in front of 60,000 people who all heard about it win this "minor" award (an award you obviously know nothing about, and you merely assume that it a minor one). You are correct in claiming that what you wrote is a "bit true," but incorrect in claiming that no-one cares. Four hundred people, plus 200 faculty members all care. The award board who gave us our "minor" award cares. The dozens of schools we have sent the Scroll to all care. No sir, you are not picking an argument with the Scroll, but rather with all middle school newspapers; you are suggesting that even a newspaper that wins one of the most prestigious awards available to it is still worthless, minor, and not even deserving of a wikipedia entry, is suggesting that no middle school newspapers amount to anything. You see, sir, all middle school newspapers have the same limits; they do not really reach a large audience past their schools, none of them are particularly famous or unusual, and as you say, they have no worth. Indeed, while I might have a problem with Wikipedia itself, than you, dear sir, have a problem with all middle school newspapers, not just this one. And if that is a battle you are willing to take, than good luck to you, sir.

Anyway, since the article about the scroll claims a circulation of 1,000, but you say that only 600 people "care", I must confess that I regard any numbers you give me with suspicion. Oh, and 600/6,000,000,000 (the number of people who care divided by the population of the earth) = 0.0000001. So, on a global scale (this is, after all, the world wide web), virtually nobody cares.

<p>But this does not end at the merger. There was a mention of the Scroll on the American School in London page, but it was deleted, by one of the posters above. The Scroll received the award in front of 60,000 people, all of whom were invited for their contribution to the school newspaper community. And your little division problem hardly strikes fear into my heart; seeing as only a billion or so have internet acess, your division problem works against you; the most any internet site can garner is 1/6 of the world population. You claim that the award that the Scroll wins (most every year), is "not the pulitzer." Well, of course it isn't. The Scroll cannot win a pulitzer, because that prize is not available to them. However, the Scroll can compete against schools from other continents in an attempt to win the prize that you are slamming. You obviously have not done very much research on the very thing that you say does not matter. And saying that no-one cares is incorrect; apparently you care quite a lot, otherwise maybe you wouldn't continue in this persecution of your own school newspaper. You might be claiming that the Scroll, and other pages like it are wasting space on the Wiki server; perhaps you don't realize that this page that you have created takes up at least double the space that our small, supposedly insignifigant page takes up. At the beginning of this argument, you claimed that you "chanced upon" this page. I find this highly unlikely; we put this page up nary a week ago, and you flagged it for deletion less than two days afterwords. Someone told you about this page, and you took as an oppurtunity to continue your personal vendetta against the Scroll. The Scroll is as notable as a Middle School newspaper can be, and maybe you should just accept that and stop whining about Middle School newspapers. Just allow the few of MS newspapers that are trying to expand into the internet to do so, instead of hindering them at every step. (Nakan)</p>

<p>Urthogie, do not try and make out as if the removal of the text from the American School in London page was an error; you were the one who deleted it. And why do you have any doubts about what my name is? You could look me up in the directories right now, if you so desired (assuming you go to my school, which I think is very possible, Mr. Greenberg). I think that my arguements above speak for themselves, and if you have any desire to dislodge them you must give proof that the Scroll is non-notable. As I said above, the Scroll is as notable as it could possibly be; it cannot go beyond where it currently is. Just let us be, for the love of God; this is your school as well, have a little spirit.

<p>Plasmadragon, you merely prove that you cannot let this go by checking this page every few hours, and posting everytime I respond. I will repeat my point: the Scroll is a notable MS paper. It has every right to be here. You are not part of this "conspiracy," but urthogie is. He went on to the ASL page and took out all references to the scroll. And you have not adressed how you found this page; surely it was not by an honest search?</p>
<dl>
<dd>He found this page because it was marked by a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} template. It doesn't help your case when you make uninformed accusations. By the way, who ever heard of a one man conspiracy?--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 15:13, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who do you think the person who proposed this page for deletion was? This is not a conspiracy, and stop calling it one. the fact remains that someone (and according to the history of the page, Urthogie) deleted all references to the Scroll on the ASL wiki page. Please, just let this one go! What personal motivation do you have for keeping this fight going? The newspaper is notable. The newspaper deserves a wiki page as much as any other. And repeatedly claiming that the newspaper is non-notable and has won a minor award (an award it wins most every year), will not win you any respect. Just let this one go; prove yourself the bigger man and walk away. And Urthogie, if you do not go to this school you do not know if the Scroll is notable or not; you have never seen an issue.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm done arguing with you, just like Plasma. Your arguments aren't even grounded in truth-- I recently reverted back whoever removed The Scroll from the article. Peace, --<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 21:42, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Urthogie, did you not claim at the beginning of this argument that you go to the school right now? So wouldn;t it be easy for you to delete the Scroll information? You can say that you are done with this, but you are not. This is not an argument about me or my aggressive posting habits, but about the Scroll. And merely claiming again and again that the Scroll is not notable (when in fact it certainly is, as proved above) does not automatically make you the victor. (Nakan)</p>

Like I said, I'm done arguing with you because of your immature approach-- I am confident that the administrator reviewing this discussion will opt for deletion.

<p>Oh no, woe is me! I'm not the wikipedia policy. Oh no! If I were you, I'd refuse to talk to me, because I have commited a most heinous crime! Go on, walk away, with your tail between your legs, refuse to speak to me. I am not considering you in good faith, because to date you have not given a plausible why the Scroll should be deleted. The Scroll has won many major awards and has achieved the highest possible acclaim that a MS newspaper can achieve. If you really think that it is not worth a few kilobytes of wiki's server, than you are a cold, black hearted man. Walking away does make you a bigger man, but you have not finished the argument; you have not rebuffed any of my points. (Nakan)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I know I promised not to post here again, but I noticed some inaccuracies in your statements, Nakan, that I simply could not stop myself from correcting. First of all, according to the article, the Scroll has not won many awards. It has won one, or at the most two. One of those is the NSPA first class ranking. According to <a href="http://www.studentpress.org/nspa/contests.html" class="external text" title="http://www.studentpress.org/nspa/contests.html" rel="nofollow">this webpage</a> (you'll have to scroll--no pun intended--down a lot, or better yet, just do edit-&gt;find for the word "class"), first class is the second best ranking given (the best is All-American, if you must know). Nor is it given exclusively: on the Internet, a cursory search revealed many other publications that had received a first class ranking too. If first class ranking alone were criteria for a wikipedia article, half of the wikipedia server hard drives would be clogged with a million entries of school publications. I exaggerate, of course, but do you see my point?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there is the claim that the Scroll was awarded best in show. That is not true. It was given <b>third place</b> best in show for junior high papers.<a href="http://www.studentpress.org/nspa/winners/f05bs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.studentpress.org/nspa/winners/f05bs.html" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> So, as we can see, the scroll has won one minor award (if the NSPA rankings are so important, why does the NSPA barely acknowledge their existance?), and almost won one other minor award (I doubt that the junior high papers were the highlight of the evening). Anyway, even if it had achieved the highest possible praise that could be given to a junior high paper, it would still not be notable. There are some things that, due to their limited geographical relevance, are simply not notable enough for wikipedia. For example, if I put together the best possible computer, <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overclocking.html" title="Overclocking">overclocked</a> it with liquid nitrogen, and got the highest <a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_Mark_7bd2.html" title="3D Mark">3D Mark</a> score in the world, would my computer deserve an article on wikipedia? No, because it would still just be my computer that only I, my friends, my family, and possibly my neighbors would care about. It would do pretty much anything any other mid- to high-end computer purchased in the last year or two could do, except at a few more frames per second. The Scroll is the same way. It has nothing that any other middle school paper wouldn't also have (photos, editorials), and it isn't even the best. There is nothing <i>notable</i> about it. Who, outside of your school, do you think would see this wiki page and say "Wow! A first class middle school paper! With photos!"?</p>
<p>Maybe if your paper won 10 "All-American" rankings and was inducted into the Hall of Fame, as described on the NSPA webpage, it would be notable. Or maybe if there was some sort of landmark 1st Amendment court case involving your paper, it would be notable. But until then, it is not. And we cannot give you a few kilobytes. If we gave a few kilobytes to every middle school paper that won a minor award, then, as I touched upon earlier, there would be an overwhelming glut of articles on papers that few would care about, and wikipedia would be seen as only a massive jungle of vanity pages, from which the rare flowers of good articles on notable topics would be all but impossible to locate and extract.</p>
<p>In conclusion: the Scroll is not nearly as notable as its staff would have you believe, there is nothing about it that makes it sufficiently notable, and this article should therefore be deleted. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasmaDragon_68d9.html" title="User:PlasmaDragon">PlasmaDragon</a> 14:37, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am sorry. I do not know when I made a big mistake and made this personal, but reading back over this argument, I realize that I have looked like an idiot. I have been attacking the personal lives of people I don't even know, and making claims that are not grounded in fact. While I still disagree about the notability of the Scroll, I am not going to argue any more. My above arguments have ruined my credibilty, and I simply did not acknowledge the links that you sent me. You have tried to make this more a true argument, but everytime you did I attempted to call you out on personal details that I do not know for certain. My arguments have reflected poorly upon the whole Scroll staff, and I am truly sorry. I realize now that the Scroll wikipedia entry has no chance of surviving; perhaps if I had argued better, with your level of research, then it would have been different, but as it stands now, the Scroll wiki entry has no hope. I am throwing in the towel, and I can only hope that this final apology will return some dignity in the eyes of my peers and fellow wikipedia users.</p>
<p>I am truly sorry, (Nakan)</p>

<p>Non-notable professor.

Nicholas Hopper is a promising young crypto researcher, and an assistant prof (not tenured) at UMN, and has about 10 technical papers of varying quality; the best has about 50 citations, which makes it a good paper, but not an especially important one. Not much more could be added to this article, apart from a CV-style list of papers. As nominator, I <b>abstain</b>; I'm relisting this because it didn't get consensus (or quality discussion) last time. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 21:51, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> But reword it. It seems a worthwhile story but should be cleaned up. For instance <i>"As of 29 October 2005, there have been no reports of aliens landing, people getting abducted by aliens, animals getting killed and/or mutilated"</i> can't you simply say something like; " As of 29 october 2005; there have been no further reported paranormal activity."? Maybe even rename the title: "Kaufman UFO Sighting", "Kaufman UFO Incident" something more explanitary. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezerPumba_107d.html" title="User:SkeezerPumba">SkeezerPumba</a> 02:06, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

I've even checked my most reliable sources -- my teenage daughter, who hears everything being discussed at the high school -- and they confirm that nobody is "buzzing" about the "event". Plus, all the photos and descriptions I've seen appear to be perfectly normal atmospheric phenomena. It's water vapor condensation in a vortex behind an airplane -- not a teleporting alien.

<li>Content is verifiable. Other edits by the author look genuine, on related Minnesota topics. The only issue is notability. Understandably, notability of something in the past may not be well represented on the net, and we have lots of articles on people/music/other arts topics of current marginal notability that may be forgotten in a year and never have a book written about them.

<li><b>keep</b> For the moment, at least, the topic is notable. It is the subject of discussion on many blogs (117 in technorati) with wide readership, some of which are cited. The notability guidelines don't (and shouldn't) preclude blogs. Many of the bloggers who have been using the term (including me) also write for print and/or write books. But blogs are now where our new ideas surface and are discussed. I did not coin this nor am I the principal blogger discussing the topic.

<li>I have added a proposal to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Blogging_4ac6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Blogging">blog wikiproject</a> that an acceptable measure of current notability be the appearance of an article subject with a high technorati rank (or other measures of blog attention).

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. The best argument presented about this being notable is coverage in a local newspaper, and the argument that this is a fairly weak claim to notability seems has been made by Rossami. I am not altogether convinced by the "Digimon-comparison" argument either since Digimon is a series, while this is presently a one-time event.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I originally brought it to DRV, for clarity. For one, at least three notable webcomic artists attended: <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._K._Milholland_e62b.html" title="R. K. Milholland">R. K. Milholland</a> from <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Positive_c5aa.html" title="Something Positive">Something Positive</a>, Jeph Jacques from <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">Questionable Content</a>, and Richard Stevens from <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel_Sweeties_9b01.html" title="Diesel Sweeties">Diesel Sweeties</a>, among others. The convention was covered in the <a href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/headlines/ci_3548793" class="external text" title="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/headlines/ci_3548793" rel="nofollow">Berkshire Eagle</a>, a newspaper with a circulation over 30k. As noted at DRV, we do not have a guideline regarding conventions of this nature, and while it qualifies under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which is good for individuals, it doesn't qualify under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which is good for companies. A convention is neither, but for a group to put on a convention featuring three notable people and recieving non-trivial news coverage, I feel it meets basic notability standards. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 23:43, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I believe that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> does apply to conventions. My apologies for repeating what was said in the DRV discussion but I'll try to save others from having to dig around for it. Conventions are collective activities involving multiple people working together for mutual benefit. That is the classic "social compact" definition of a business. WP:CORP is not limited to only corporations but was explicitly written to cover non-profits and other organizational forms. The tests and criteria have been developed to help weigh these kinds of collective activities. Furthermore, most conventions are specifically run as a for-profit enterprise with the intent of providing goods and/or services to the participants and profits (either direct or through advertising value) to the organizers.<br />
<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, on the other hand, is explicitly written to apply to individuals and does not apply in this case. (When comparing a convention to a company or to a human, I consider a convention to be more like a company and not at all like a human.) However, even if you did attempt to apply WP:BIO to a convention, a single mention in a newspaper would still fail to qualify as an inclusion criterion.<br />
The most relevant criterion at WP:CORP appears to be the "multiple, non-trivial press coverage" criterion. A single mention in a local newspaper fails to qualify regardless of readership. Attendance by three notable people does not convince me that a first-year convention with only 270 attendees automatically inherits notability. Many local industry gatherings have far higher attendance without being appropriate for an encyclopedia article.<br />
Unless other evidence can be presented of significant coverage by multiple independent, non-trivial and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>, I must recommend <b>deletion</b> but without prejudice against recreation several years from now if/when the convention has achieved the true and sustained notability that would make it appropriate for inclusion in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 00:33, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see both arguments but agree mostly with Rossami. On the other hand, I would rather see an article on a tiny fan-run con than separate articles on each different evolutionary stage of each different Digimon character. My mind says delete but my heart says keep. If the Digimon stay, Llamacon stays. <b>Keep</b>, <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:40, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Current consensus at the Digimon project is to merge the evolutionary stages, as soon as they can agree on a structure for doing so. (They want to merge, but haven't decided how.)

<li><b>Delete</b>: I agree wholeheartedly with <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a>. Almost to the point of not having anything to add to it. It seems that <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a>'s only two arguments are the presence of three people with Wikipedia pages and coverage by one (1) local newspaper (I even did a Google News and LexisNexis search for it and didn't find anything other than the Eagle article). Neither of these points have any evidence in the form of examples from other articles, and they have weak <i>interpretation-based</i> evidence in Wikipedia policies. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by PaulIsNotDead (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PaulIsNotDead_9257.html" title="Special:Contributions/PaulIsNotDead">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>To be fair, I don't care if they have WP pages or not, I'm simply more concerned with notable groups, people, and events being represented on Wikipedia. Any disagreements w/Rossami and I boil down to how best to judge the notability here. Notable people + press coverage is enough for some, not for others. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 04:17, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, exactly. And to prove that three "notable" people plus coverage in one local newspaper means notability, I'd like some proof. Ideally, I'd like some proof in other WP pages. Policies would work too, but all you have given is interpretation of policies, which <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> has disproved. -PaulIsNotDead 14:31, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rossami hasn't "disproved" anything, (s?)he's merely given his opinion that WP:CORP is the better guideline in place of a situation lacking one, and I've given my opinion in disagreement. Events where notable people are guests and thusly recieve press coverage pass muster for me, they don't have to pass muster for you. Reasonable people can disagree, especially on issues such as this that are not clear cut. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 14:50, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thatcher: two wrongs don't make a right! I say <b>delete</b> because there's really nothing to say about this single convention. After a second one, Llamacon would be about a series of conventions, and then I think it would be fine. I disagree with Rossami, though: WP:CORP may be more applicable than WP:BIO, but neither is right. I think <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is the ultimate guide here... and there just isn't much to say about Llamacon. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 15:51, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with Ikkyu2 insofar as I am uncomfortable applying either guideline in this case: these are "guidelines" for a reason, with an expectation that certain articles will fall in liminal areas, as this example does. Without reference to strict set criteria, my own judgment demands first evidence of durability. In very few instances would a first-year gathering meet encyclopedic standards; to be notable, it must prove itself able to endure in most cases. While there are exceptions (eg. Woodstock), this case doesn't seem to me to merit such status. Hence, wait till next year's event, at least. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:33, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm having a hard time seeing how a first year 270 person convention is notable enough. Notability may be transitive, I guess, but it goes down by some factor (80%? only one fifth the notability comes over... pick your own numbers and work it for yourself...) every time you transition, so 3 barely notable artists only gets you 60% (3*20% if only 1/5 came over) of the notability you need, if you see what I'm saying... <b>Delete</b> with regret.

<dd>Kappa, sorry to be picky, but: "V.V. Vick, who died of heart problems Saturday at age 93, left behind a business he started on a shoestring in 1929. His first storefront was on 12th Street, followed by a move a few years later to Broadway, where he would become something of a local institution, along with Schomburg's Jewelers and the <i>Kirven's</i> department store."</dd>
<dd>The article actually says this man Vick was a local institution. It mentions Kirven's in an "along with" clause, but that is unclear, and leaves me no clue as to whether Vick owned Kirven's or was just next to it. No need to get snappy; everybody misreads from time to time. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:03, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>sigh* either it says "he + the other two things collectively made up a local instition", or "he became a local institution, like the other two things", which seems the most likely interpretation. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:06, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>While your reading is logical, I don't agree. Since the store is claimed to have been founded in 1979, I need more than an ambiguous single "along with" clause to confer "institutional" status. It is possible that the unclear reporter meant something more like an off-the-cuff reference: "Vick's jewelry store was an institution (remember Vicks?... it was next to Kirven's and that other place.)" Not having much faith in a reporter who uses imprecise language, I am unconvinced. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:38, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>No, that was media hype. The government didn't register jedi as a religion, and they repeatedly said they would not before the census went out. It was a rumour that started in Australia, a completely different country. Don't throw around faulty anecdotes as evidence</p>
<p>On top of this, I chose to start the wikipedia entry BECAUSE I could find so little about it on the internet. If this doesn't fit with your policy, I apologise, but I was under the impression that seeing as how I'm not in any way affiliated with the religion, and therefore not publicising, say, a business or venture of my own, this would be ok.</p>
<p>I'm merely trying to inform the world of a viewset that does not exist anywhere else. I actually gained information about the religion myself through a leaflet that came through my front door. Usually I discard religious material, being a strong atheist, but this caught my eye (due to the use of the word atheist in the title).</p>
<p>I wouldn't say it converted me, but I couldn't fit anything about it on the net, so decided to put a small stub here, allowing others the opportunity to expand on it. Does that run contrary to your policy of freely sharing information?</p>
<p>If you wait a while (it's 1:35 in the morning in England, I need to go to sleep for now), I can scan in the leaflet I was given -- would that provide verification that this is genuine? <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by 88.109.78.41 (<a href="../../../8/8/2E/User_talk%7E88.109.78.41.html" title="User talk:88.109.78.41">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.109.78.41_71b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.109.78.41">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>So basically, you're telling me that even though you COULD very easily phone the government, who would verify the existence of this religion for you, you won't, because it hasn't yet recieved any notable media coverage or google hits? I appreciate that it may not be your place to check the validity that extensively, but then why are you bothering at all? If it's not immediately at your fingertips, you're not interested? I'm placing it at your fingertips. You could verify it with one email -- to a Mr Stephen Wilkins, I've already given you the email address.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.109.184.204 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.109.184.204_92ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.109.184.204">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>On top of all this, has no one noticed that Innatheism has been on the list of newly founded religions in wikipedia since the summer? I noticed it a while back, and have been waiting for someone to write an article explaining to me exactly what it is ToMySurprise_81 13:37, 16 March 2006</p>
<p>Also, I'd point out that the pages of every user who has suggested the deletion of this article are a bigger waste of wikipedia's time and virtual space - they are all vanity pages, and get 0 google hits outside of Wikipedia and its mirrors ToMySurprise_81 13:41, 16 March 2006</p>
<p>Note to Fan-1967 - I was under the impression that I had to validify that the religion existed. According to the leaflet I was handed out, (which I've offered to scan in and post here, I did not contact the government myself and have no personal connection to this church), the church contacted the government last year. Presumably you agree with me that something must exist in order to contact the government. The fact that they hold no register is neither here nor there, I'm working on the assumption that their correspondance will have been recorded. Or at least remembered.</p>
<p>I only wrote this article, as I have already stated, because I received the leaflet and could find no great information on it on the net. I did find this - [<a href="http://www.geocities.com/innatheism" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/innatheism" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>] - which I think you'll agree is quite uninformative. Searching in Wikipedia, results came up with several pages - one of which was a list of religions. Since there was no page on it, I typed up the article we're currently discussing from information in the pamphlet (which I'm still happy to provide for you).</p>
<p>As I've REPEATEDLY said, I have no personal connection to this religion. I'm an atheist. I merely found information on it, and tried to put it on the internet when I found there was no information here already (though the religion WAS already mentioned on wikipedia).</p>
<p>Personally, I think the attitude of wikipedians is ridiculous. I can provide you with a copy of hard media which represents this church, which was delivered through my door. But you won't accept it because google doesn't turn anything up? Two of your policies contradict each other - you'll take information that has a media representation, but only if that representation is already in digital media. The real world exists just as much as the internet does. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.110.27.34 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.110.27.34_0a9c.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.110.27.34">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>As already discussed, it is NOT wikipedia's policy to delete articles based on notability. It states this on the notability page itself, and I have quoted it above. To keep parroting "non notable, non notable, non notable" like a broken record is pedantic and irrelevent. Your opinion is just that, an opinion. Several users have now described encounters with Innatheists in the real world (myself included), and I can only presume these users are from different places. I, myself, encountered the people handing out leaflets in Milton Keynes, and a user above has encountered them in London. Printed media can also be provided - maybe not information published in a newspaper or a magazine, but that would only prove that the religion was attracting the attention of the media at large - and that's not the question being debated. Nor is it necessary - by wikipedia's policies, peer review or publishment is only necessary for academic claims. I quote: <b>For academic subjects, the sources should preferably be peer-reviewed.</b> - and even then, this is only a preference, not a necessity.</p>
<p>I hate to repeat myself, but to requote: <b>"Notability is not needed as long as the verifiability rules are strictly applied...The person who authored the article clearly believes that the topic is notable enough to be included..."Imagine a world in which every person has free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing." <i>We are not doing that if we are deleting articles solely due to their obscurity.</i> "Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one</b> If you're going to object to this article, could you at least do it on grounds based in wikipedia's policies, rather than the fact that you personally think it's not worthy of comment?</p>
<p>In Summary: There is NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING, in the rules for submitting articles that means this particular one should be deleted.</p>
<p>1 - It's been commented that it's not notable - that's your opinion, and not grounds for deletion, by wikipedia's rules.</p>
<p>2 - It's been said that this is unverified - at this moment in time, maybe so, but only because I'm unsure what verification you require. The wikipedia page on verification demands only a fulfillment of the burden of evidence -- the media which contained this information can be provided, which would make wikipedia a secondary source, fulfilling this.</p>
<p>3 - There MAY be grounds for deletion, on a case of dubious reliability. However, according to the verification page, if a source is dubious it should simply be quoted. I can do more than that, I can scan in and upload the document itself.</p>
<p>4 - as for the ignorant question made above: <b>Can we have something more than "some guy gave me a leaflet"?</b> - no, you don't need any more than that. Again, I quote from the verification page -- <b>Self-published sources and other published sources of dubious reliability may be used as sources about themselves in articles about them.</b></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. It seems to me that you are confusing things. Yes, Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. How is any item of information judged worthy of being part of the collection? By notability, not verifiability. Now, accepting this as verified on the basis of 'various people having confirmed its existence' is setting the bar absurdly low imo. But even if we were to allow that, there is the question of notability. And there is no reason at all to suppose that this is notable. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 20:35, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
