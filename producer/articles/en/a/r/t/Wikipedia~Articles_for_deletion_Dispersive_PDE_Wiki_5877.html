<dd>There might be some theory to that effect, just like there is a theory that juries in U.S. law should do exactly as the judge instructs. But, like the juries, we are free to decide however we like. An admin closes the AfD upon determination that a consensus has been reached, and usually that is based on the votes and the arguments. But then, that means the admin is not exactly bound by the votes either. There are benefits to "going by the book", and there are benefits to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">tossing the book</a>. We hope to choose wisely, presumably with the goal of making a better encyclopedia.

<dd>Notability is a peculiar Wikipedia concept. For example, my "Don't kick the baby!" link is to an article about a cartoon character in a TV show.

Look at all the articles on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters_b5cd.html" title="List of Marvel Comics characters">Marvel Comics characters</a>; is this mathematics article less worthy than one on, say, <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modred_the_Mystic_cc10.html" title="Modred the Mystic">Modred the Mystic</a>?

<li>Changed my vote to a simple <b>Keep</b> after I expanded the article. This stuff looks like real Wikipedia-type material, and it's worth having an article that comments on it. In its present form I think the site has value to mathematicians and deserves at least a pocket explanation from us. I can imagine creating cross-links between WP articles and the sections of this site. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 18:25, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree with the way you've expanded the article. The whole of the second section could be moved into the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dispersive_PDE_c47d.html" title="Dispersive PDE">Dispersive PDE</a> article, sans <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">self-references</a>. The third section belongs in <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirichlet_problem.html" title="Dirichlet problem">Dirichlet problem</a>. That gets us back to the first paragraph, and the point of this AfD. Is the website notable enough to have a whole article dedicated to itself, rather than just having links to it from the bottom of pages such as <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dispersive_PDE_c47d.html" title="Dispersive PDE">Dispersive PDE</a>? At 50 active contributors, assuming that no-one else is as notable as <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_Tao_7bd3.html" title="Terence Tao">Terence Tao</a>, I'd say that's a resounding <i>no</i>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Peel_9ea8.html" title="User:Mike Peel">Mike Peel</a> 18:42, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> And let's do wait for comments from interested mathematicians, who are just now beginning to learn of this AfD. Those with little mathematical background may not appreciate why <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_Tao_7bd3.html" title="Terence Tao">Terence Tao</a> is relevant; the answer is that he is considered one of the best minds in contemporary mathematics, having just won a <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fields_Medal_f3ac.html" title="Fields Medal">Fields Medal</a> (a rare top prize in mathematics) and a <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacArthur_Fellowship_dc30.html" title="MacArthur Fellowship">MacArthur Fellowship</a> (sometimes called a "genius award"). If he thinks the site is worth knowing about (making many <a href="http://tosio.math.toronto.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Tao&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" class="external text" title="http://tosio.math.toronto.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Tao&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" rel="nofollow">hundreds of contributions</a> to the wiki version), and you don't, who should we believe? Hmm. The article is a stub less than a month old, and the wiki form of the site has only existed since July 2006 (but using content hosted by Tao dating back to October 2000). It is unrealistic to expect it to get lots of search hits already. (In fact, given the nature of its content, it will likely <i>never</i> be heavily linked.)

<li>We don't keep articles just because we like their subjects, or because we think their subjects might become notable in the future.

Howerver there are a number of other similar mathematical communities, the <a href="http://katlas.math.toronto.edu/wiki/" class="external text" title="http://katlas.math.toronto.edu/wiki/" rel="nofollow">Knot Atlas</a> springs to mind.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sure I understand the arguments for "keep". Why should we have an article on some wiki because Terence Tao likes to contribute to it? It's more of an interesting thing about Tao rather than an affirmation of the notability of the wiki. Does notability just transfer like that so easily? I'm sure the wiki will do well enough regardless of what is decided here. I'm sure with contributors like Tao, the site is worth knowing about. I don't see why this means that it becomes Wikipedia's mission to advertise it though. For example, there are obscure books that are worth reading. Are we supposed to say they are notable because we like them? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 10:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I put the site's article up on AfD as it makes no claims of notability, and it doesn't appear to be notable. If it's got content that is useful, then by all means link to the site in articles on that topic (or better still, incorporate the content and reference it). But does the site need a whole article to itself? If so, please show that it is notable - e.g. news articles that discuss it, or references to it in the literature, etc.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not ready to cast a vote yet, but I did read the guideline <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. And I looked at the website a little, and I searched Wikipedia for references to Dispersive Partial Differential Equations. The only relevant hits I got were in articles about Maxwell's equations, and about the Schrödinger wave equation. Those may not be the best understood PDE's in the world, but they are extremely important in physics. And I gather that the point of calling something a "dispersive" PDE is that its solutions don't look like persistent standing waves, but decay over time somehow (the sine wave versus a Bessel function, more or less). So it seems to me that the best solution might be to have an article that actually discusses dispersive PDE's, and why they're important, and maybe why mathematicians have unanswereed questions about them, and then link to Mr. Tao's wiki through that article. Oh -- I also read Mike Peel's home page, and see that he's in astrophysics. I understand now why he thinks Tao's website is not notable. The website is focusing on the well-posedness problem. I've studied with both physicists and mathematicians, and the physicists never seemed to care about the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirichlet_problem.html" title="Dirichlet problem">Dirichlet problem</a>. But the math department devoted an entire 12-week class to it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. PlanetMath has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/PlanetMath" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/PlanetMath" rel="nofollow">a lot of links</a> from other math articles (generally as the credit for some specific external link to a PlanetMath page on the article's subject, via the {{<a href="../../../p/l/a/Template%7EPlanetMath_d6a8.html" title="Template:PlanetMath">PlanetMath</a>}} template). Do you see it as likely that the Dispersive PDE Wiki can be similarly linked from more than a handful of articles? —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 16:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>More importantly, people occasionally write about planetmath: try <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=planetmath" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=planetmath" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> or <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=planetmath&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=planetmath&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. You wouldn't know this from reading the article, of course, but if our <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetmath.html" title="Planetmath">Planetmath</a> article went on AfD I'd vote to keep while citing those sources. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 23:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>PM has a lot of links because of <a href="../../../p/m/e/WP%7EPMEX_c522.html" title="WP:PMEX">WP:PMEX</a>. In principle, we could copy most of the content from the PDE wiki into WP, which would result in hundreds(?) of links. It should be noted that none of te WP math regulars are active on PDE's.</li>
</ul>

<dd>More importantly, I note that we have wildly differing standards for notability on WP. In math, we tend to reject articles on mathematicians who haven't won any important prizes, whereas average joe-blow programmers get to have bio's. We don't have articles for most physics/math journals, but we have articles for comic books. Notability criteria for rock bands seems low but staunchly defended. So although I get the feeling we sometimes have too much crap on WP, I'm erring on the side of caution: do we through out the baby with the bathwater, by voting to delete things like this? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">Linas</a> (<a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinas_7391.html" title="User talk:Linas">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Linas_833c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Linas">contribs</a>) 01:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with Mike Peel's comments. It's a great resource, but that is not a reason to have an article in Wikipedia. As long as no reliable source refers to the wiki, we should not have an article about it. <del>Do not merge with <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_Tao_7bd3.html" title="Terence Tao">Terence Tao</a>; the wiki does not seem to be an important part of Terry's life, and reversely, Terry is just one of the contributors as far as I can see</del>. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 11:34, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Actually, from 2000 until the wiki was started a few months ago, Tao hosted the content. Also, if he is just one of many contributors, that would seem to be an argument for keeping an independent page. (Ironically, if <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfram_Group_fb4c.html" title="Wolfram Group">Wolfram</a> owned and advertised the site and used it to feed their business, as with <a href="../../../m/a/t/MathWorld_3918.html" title="MathWorld">MathWorld</a>, more people would know about it.

<dd>Thanks for the correction. I still feel that the wiki is not important enough for Terence Tao to be mentioned in his article, but perhaps one line is warranted. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 14:23, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
