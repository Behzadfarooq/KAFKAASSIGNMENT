<li><b>Comment</b> I realy wish I hadn't listed the "not English" language issue in my comment eariler. I see that it has caused some consternation and was not my primary motivation. The book is simply not notable. It has not had a visible social or political effect that warrants separate attention. It <i>is</i> a valid part of the Von Bülow article or any number of conpiracy articles. I read plenty of books and watch plenty of movies that are in languages other than English, and would have no problem with many of them getting their own articles. But this looks more tabloid, yellow press quality to me.

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability exclusively to the english speaking world isn't a criteria for inclusion in WP AFAIK. I don't know that there is a policy on excluding topics that are notable to foreign-language audiences. There are a lot of subjects that are important (even if this particular book is deemed not to be) that have not been translated into English. I don't know if there is a policy explicitly stating that untranslated books or films, etc. can be included (the absence of a policy that they cannot implies than can IMO) but <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Sources_in_languages_other_than_English" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Sources_in_languages_other_than_English</a> comes close I think. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 15:57, 31 March 2006 (UTC) <i>Edit</i>: And also <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28books%29_a736.html#Title_translations" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (books)">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(books)#Title_translations</a> which is "a naming conventions guideline for the naming of wikipedia articles about books" which states "books that haven't been published in English (yet) are preferably referred to by an English version of the title" which would also appear to indicate articles about books that haven't been translated into English are acceptable. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 19:59, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the RS does NOT say that Wikipedians cannot do translations. It indicates they may be "performed by a Wikipedia editor" and that it is OK for "editors [to] use their own English translation." Certainly it is generally better (as stated there) to use outside translations (though sometimes a wikipedian may be able to provide a better translation than the ones available elsewhere). This isn't so much an issue with this article, which does cite to english language sources and external links. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 18:13, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like "the opportunity to verify for myself what the original material actually said". But, I can't do that here. Given the book is so popular in Germany, it's likely in due time that there will be an English translated version of the book. At that time, I wouldn't object to an article here. Until then, I have problems with being able to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the article. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 19:14, 31 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me you're cherry-picking that guideline which states "<b>In principle</b>, readers should have the opportunity to verify for themselves what the original material actually said" (emphasis added). And again, that's not an issue anyway because there isn't any translation of the contents of the book in the article, rather it appears it was composed by reference to english language articles about the book which given that <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Some_definitions" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">WP is a tertiary source</a> is acceptable. If there were translated text from the book you could order the book and a German/English dictionary or plop passages into Babelfish and get an idea as to whether the translation may be accurate or not. But again, there's not, so that's not an issue. Would there be a good place on WP to discuss the broader issue of articles about untranslated subjects?<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 19:31, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are plenty of English-language books, films etc. that meet WP's notability criteria and are not on the enWP yet, but that doesn't mean they're not notable. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 16:34, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Not weak, in my opinion. A claimed #3 best seller in English is probably on the English wikipedia. I haven't been swung over by claims of sales which are unreferenced. Provide a better reference of its claim to notability than german.about.com. Until then, I take the absence on the German wikipedia to be telling -- <font color="black" face="Arial"><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)">Samir</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <font face="Arial Narrow" color="#000000"><small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">(the scope)</a></small></font> 01:16, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I repeat, I don't think the absence of an article on the deWP proves it is not notable, any more than the absence of an article about an English language book on this WP proves the book is not notable. It only proves nobody has added one yet. There's no article on Barbara Hodgson, for example, or any of her several critically acclaimed and award-winning books, one of which is being adapted into a film (I should work on that). Additionally, the dewiki only has "378.316 Artikel" versus the 1,054,498 articles on this one. Look at the article again; there are better references there than the about.com one you singled out. There are other references to it as a bestseller, for example <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boston_Globe_7aad.html" title="The Boston Globe">The Boston Globe</a>.<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/02/01/conspiracies_so_vast/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/02/01/conspiracies_so_vast/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 01:49, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Put the references in the article. I wasn't aware of the Boston Globe reference, and have to use circumstantial evidence like absence in the German wikipedia, which I think still counts for something (i.e. an article on Barbara Hodgson would be more likely to appear in en.wikipedia than de.wikipedia) -- <font color="black" face="Arial"><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)">Samir</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <font face="Arial Narrow" color="#000000"><small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">(the scope)</a></small></font> 03:36, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In the case of people who wrote only one book, and especially if they are primarily known only for that book, I would agree with you. In this case, since he is the author of at least two books and is known (or at least had long been known) for being in the German government, I'd be less inclined to advocate merging. As it is, it's unfortunate so much of Bulow's own entry is about his 9/11 beliefs. I haven't tried to read the de.wiki's deletion policies, but they do have an article there on the apparently untranslated English language 9/11 conspiracy book <a href="../../../../de/c/r/o/Crossing_the_Rubicon_a77e.html" class="extiw" title="de:Crossing_the_Rubicon">de:Crossing the Rubicon</a>, so I'm not sure Bulow's book would be deleted. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 13:31, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> As far as I am concerned, translation into other languages is indicative of the extent of a book's influence. The more translations, the greater the distribution, influence, or interest.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree with the first two sentences of the above comment. Namely, that <i>"translation into other languages is indicative of the extent of a book's influence"</i> and <i>"the more translations, the greater the distribution, influence, or interest."</i> However, it does not follow that just because a book may not have been translated in to English, then the only criteria we can use to judge its notability is its <i>"political consequences"</i>. It's not at all clear how one could judge the <i>"political consequences"</i> of a book in a NPOV way. It may be relatively clear in the case of some exceptions like <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Zedong_fe29.html" title="Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong">Mao's Little Red Book</a>, Upton Sinclair's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jungle_506f.html" title="The Jungle">The Jungle</a>, and the scriptures of the major religions; but in the vast majority of cases books just don't have <b>any</b> obviously visible political consequences. However, that doesn't mean they're non-notable. I think looking at the sales numbers of the book in question as a sign of its notability is perfectly acceptable, even when there's no English translation. By excluding popular books that haven't yet been translated in to English we're encouraging <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a> and hampering legitimate research in to a given topic by English speaking individuals who may be interested in how that topic is percieved or interpreted in the rest of the non-English speaking world. Besides, the English language publishing industry is generally not interested in books in translation: only a miserably tiny fraction of foreign language books are ever translated in to English<a href="http://www.bowker.com/press/bowker/2005_1012_bowker.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bowker.com/press/bowker/2005_1012_bowker.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.bowker.com/press/bowker/2005_1012_bowker.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bowker.com/press/bowker/2005_1012_bowker.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, likely for business reasons that may have little to do with their notability in the rest of the world. Why should Wikipedia defer to the English language publishing industry to the exclusion of the rest of the world, when we can rely on perfectly legitimate indicators of their notability elsewhere (such as their sales in other countries)? -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a> 01:01, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - this article has come a long way since being nominated for AfD. There are three claims being made about: firstly it is NN. I disagree: it has sold 100,000 copies, which is very large for a "non-fiction" (allegedly!) book, especially in Germany. It was the hot topic of the 2003 Frankfurt Book Fair - and <i>as a book</i>, not just <i>as the work of Herr "Cranky" van Bulow"</i>. It is extremely controversial <i>as a book</i> (not just as a selection of views) because of the quality of sourcing - this is an issue about the German publishing industry, not 9/11, therefore we need to consider this book <i>as a book</i>, not just a selection of (what are largely seen as dangerous/bizarre) views associated with one man. Secondly, it not verifiable. I disagree, there are plenty of English languages secondary sources on this book and I have tried to improve the referencing for the article so that it is now clear exactly where each statement in the article can be sourced from. (Haven't finished just yet, will probably take me another hour to incorporate another three English language sources). Thirdly, it is synonymous with Andreas von Bulow and should be merged. Again, I disagree, we need to treat this book <i>as a book</i> for the reasons I have given already plus the fact that Andreas von Bulow has had a long career and is important as a politician in his own right. If we had a balanced biography for him, perhaps the bottom quarter of it would be on his post-politicial retirement conspiracy theorising. However, that is unlikely to happen as in the English-speaking world he is best known for his controversial views on 9/11. Those views do not "define the man" and this article is about more than his views, it also considers the books as a publishing phenomenon, as part of a zeitgeist for similar publications, and as a controversy within German publishing. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 16:33, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
