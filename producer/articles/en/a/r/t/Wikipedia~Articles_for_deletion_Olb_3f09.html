<li><b>Comment</b> although it seems weird, it makes some sense</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> Words constitute our main tool for verbal communication and exclusive tool for literary communication. Yet words constrain us conceptually. To bring a new word into a language is a long and haphazard process. To provide a nuance in both speech and writing can get involved.</p>
<p>Olb provides a cure for this by building a simple and powerful mechanism to harness any word or phrase and imbue it with an immediately understood nuance. As explained in the entry, turning a 'Job' into a 'Jib' provides a significant short cut in everyday speech for casting aspersions on the solidity of the job. A 'Jub' would mean that someone fears holding his job, or the job's future existence is in doubt. A 'Jeb' would indicate that he is doing strange work. We can all emphasize with these emotions regarding our work, I am sure. Further good examples include someone who wishes to refer to a friend -yet he is in doubt to his friend's loyalty. Therefore, in Olb talk, he can refer to a Fruend - inserting doubt.</p>
<p>There are still unresolved problems, something that Wikipedia may help tackle. There is no consistency, even among founding speakers, over what exact vowel should change. What happens when there are 3 vowels in a word? Any comments and suggestions would be valuable and would certainly provide justification for the entry. --192.114.168.74 09:13, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have read the Vote-for-deletion page and don't see that this article (which I started) qualifies. It is certainly not nonsense or gibberish (the internal consistency and detail should make that clear). Olb is also not a prank (it would be a rather unfunny one) and neither is it vanity (I fail to see how any person or group benefits - that is, apart from present or potential speakers of Olb). To address a comment above, Olb provides an <i>overlay</i> to everyday language (<i>any</i> language, not just English) and as such is accurately termed an aspectual form of expression (c.f. <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspect-oriented_programming.html" title="Aspect-oriented programming">Aspect-oriented programming</a>). It should be fairly obvious that Olb cannot be considered a language on its own. The vocabulary provides a number of important concepts for which there are no other sufficiently rich or specific words, at least not in English. 132.68.1.29 07:26, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment:</b> I've had a quick google for it, but haven't found anything relevant.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the originator of this article, I am somewhat taken aback by the hostility put forward by some members. Nonetheless I would like to respond to some of the more sensible points raised. <b>Google references</b>: Since Olb is a verbally transmitted form of expression I would not necessarily expect there to be much mention of it on the Web. A more fruitful way to verify if Olb exists would be to ask around the people you know - I've met a few speakers in my travels in America and Europe over the past few years. <b>Made-up language / conlang / original research</b>: Ignoring the rather unlikely theory of linguistic creationism, <i>all</i> languages are 'made up' by a group of people in response to the conditions in which they live. The objection would be better put that Olb was an <i>artificial</i> form of expression, meaning that it was planned in a top-down fashion rather than arising and developing naturally over time amongst its speakers. This objection is not true, and should be fairly obvious from some of the idiosyncracies that Olb contains. <b>Notability</b>: There are at least 3 reasons why Olb is notable, (a) it is a growing cultural phenomenon, (b) it is unique as an aspectual form of expression <i>not tied to a specific language</i>, (c) it provides easy access to a number of conceptual overtones which are not readily available in Western languages. <b>Difficult to understand or pronounce</b>: This is a very poor reason and seems rather closed-minded. I challenge any Westerner to find the <a href="../../../x/h/o/Xhosa_language.html" title="Xhosa language">Xhosa language</a> easy to understand or pronounce. Over time I'm sure more guidance on pronunciation will be added the article. 132.68.1.29 15:42, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
