<p>Completely unsourced, and a badly-formatted title. We have an article on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_rock.html" title="Progressive rock">progressive rock</a> and if that gets too big, it would be logical to split out subarticles such as history of progressive rock and origins of progressive rock. If an article on progressive rock in the 21st century is ever needed, it should grow organically out of a normal article, like as a subarticle of history of progressive rock. It's silly to have an article like this because 94% of the 21st century has not yet occurred. With all that said, I would have just merged it elsewhere except that there's nothing to merge because this is an unsourced list of albums and stuff that somebody decided was important -- hence, nothing to merge, and, even if an article on this topic was relevant, everything here would have to be removed because it is unsourced and opinionated, not to mention badly formatted and improperly titled (should be progressive rock in the 21st century, theoretically, but since this is more of a timeline than an article, it would be timeline of progressive rock in the 21st century). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 23:46, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I have changed the formatting of the entry. You are correct that the title should be changed. Because the subject of progressive rock is very broad, I chose to tackle recent events because most of those are easily verifiable. I did not realize EVERYTHING, even fairly obvious items, needed to be verified. There are several sub-articles already on the "progressive rock" entry including lists which are full of opinion and debate. I think a timeline of progressive rock (even one that, for now, is just covering events and beyond) is valuable. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 02:11, 21 February 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 20 February 2006 (entry edited by Flonkus)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have sourced the article and tried to conform to a timeline format. I did some research and discovered several other musical genres with "timeline" articles, many of which have uncited sources and opinions. Please consider keeping this one or deleting all music timelines. For now, I requested a move (after asking for help) to change the article title to Timeline of Progressive Rock: 2001-present. I'd be more than happy to take on the task of doing a full timeline of progressive rock in the future as I have considerable knowledge on the subject. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 19:11, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please use normal titles, and create a normal timeline. Why would we need a timeline for the most recent six years but not prior? Why would we start a timeline for a century that's barely begun, focusing on a topic far more closely associated with the 1970s than the 21st century? If you must make a timeline, make a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_progressive_rock.html" title="Timeline of progressive rock">timeline of progressive rock</a>. The sources you've added are nice, but are not sufficient -- this is a timeline of "important, historical events" so you need to have a source that proves more than what occurred, meaning that it's fine to have a source that proves that Dream Theater released an album in 2001, that does not prove that that album's release was an important, historical event. And it's extremely inappropriate to use a band's official website to document something like this. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 19:45, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Work <i>with</i> me, please. I'm doing my part here and I am new to this process. I wanted to bring some attention to the current decade as the information on Wiki so far is sparse. I intended to cover other material later, but I will instead create a <b>full standard timeline</b> to resolve this apparent issue. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 20:33, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regarding Dream Theater, the artwork mishap is certainly historical in this context. And I did not cite Dream Theater's website. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 20:33, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regarding "important, historical events", and "key recordings". I wanted to emphasize these words so that when others add/edit the page, they are discouraged from spamming, bias, etc. as much as possible. If this is the wrong way to go about this, I will just use the words "events" and "albums" that I've seen elsewhere. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 20:33, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You should review these examples: <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_heavy_metal.html" title="Timeline of heavy metal">Timeline of heavy metal</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_punk_rock.html" title="Timeline of punk rock">Timeline of punk rock</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_alternative_rock.html" title="Timeline of alternative rock">Timeline of alternative rock</a>. They are completely unsourced, arguably preferencial. If you intend to hold a standard, why are these existing documents not held to the same? Thank you for your time. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 20:33, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think those should be deleted too, but I'm glad this article is now at least consistent with them. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 03:25, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While sourcing would be nice - I think there needs to be more than just an editor's opinion that a band is a progressive rock band or not - I like the way the article is laid out and believe it would serve the same useful purpose as the other rock timeline articles. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 02:25, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article now has the title <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_progressive_rock.html" title="Timeline of progressive rock">Timeline of progressive rock</a>.

The article may currently lack some depth, and it had a bad title to start with, but there's certainly room to improve it instead of tossing it out together.
