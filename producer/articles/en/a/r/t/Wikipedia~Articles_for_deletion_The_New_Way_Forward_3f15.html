<dd>Bush can say whatever he wants in the speech, but everything before the speech will be speculation. It's like saying that USC is going to win the Rose Bowl because the experts say they have a good team. It's speculation. Wikipedia is a place for facts, and not just what people will think will happen.

<dd>I have now edited the article to place more emphasis on the media speculation. It's an undeniable, sourceable fact that five high level posts related to the Iraq war are being changed, that the press is reporting on a "surge" and that in the many NOTABLE sources cited above ALL sources use the words "new way forward" to describe this series of initiatives. Whether or not a speech happens, it is clear that the Bush administration is leading the press to use the words "New Way Forward" or "The New Way Forward" with respect to these changes. Please reread the article and reconsider. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 21:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's the second time that you have asked me to reconsider, and for a second time, I will say Delete. So, it is confirmed that this is going to be the title for Bush's speech. But the contents of the speech are only speculation, as I said above. Wait until Bush does his speech, and THEN write the article. You said above "I have now edited the article to place more emphasis on the media speculation.", when it's the speculation that we are trying to avoid. Wait until Bush makes his speech, and THEN make the article. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 21:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>but what about the <b>contents</b> of the stragegy change? It is abundantly clear (to the media-- i.e., independent citeable sources) that these changes are already taking place... the series of initiatives listed in the article. If you are suggeesting a name changes that is one thing, but to delete the article is to delete perfectly good (and sourced)content. What are you trying to hide? <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 21:50, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Clearly a bad faith comment, MPS, and I expect you to retract it. This has nothing to do with "trying to hide" anything, and completely with trying to keep propaganda and speculation out of an <i>encyclopedia</i>. If you want to write your or other people's speculations on a blog somewhere, that is certainly your right, but we expect encyclopedia articles, not somebody's expectations. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 22:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not a bad faith comment; just frustration coming out, and for acting on this frustration I do apologize. Re: the topic, I have two responses....(1) These opinions aren't just opinions (the annouced personnel changes aren't opinions... the term "new way forward" is not some opinion I made up or the media made up -- it was introduced used by Bush to describe his coming changes, and reinforced by his subsequent press secretary statements at whitehouse.gov) the media is reporting on this set of changes with more than speculations, more than just opinions. (2) The WSJ, Time magazine, reuters, USA Today, and CBS News are not just "some people" as you suggest. This is a significant chunk of the mainstream news establishment reporting on "NWF" I'm not citing bloggers, I am citing <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_media.html" title="The media">The media</a> <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 22:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The sources cited <b>are most certainly</b> reliable sources. Let me put this into terms similar to the earlier football analogy. Lets say experts predict that Eagles will win. We cannot state that the Eagles will win as a matter of fact, but we can state that experts predict the Eagles will win the Superbowl in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XLI_893d.html" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a>. Thats what is being done in regards to the commentary. But not all of the information is speculation, neither in this article or in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XLI_893d.html" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a>. For instance, the date has been officially announced, the logo has been officially announced, the location has been officially announced. The fact that <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XLI_893d.html" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a> has not yet happened does not keep us from having an article on it, does not keep us from stating the information we know, and does not keep us from stating information that is being speculated in reliable sources. The situation for the New Way Forward, or any other subject matter, is no different. Again, the entire premise behind this deletion appears to be a misunderstanding of guidelines and rules. ~<b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">Rangeley</span></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERangeley_d899.html" title="User talk:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">talk</span></a>)</b> 22:40, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well Zoe, your stance has moved from thing to thing and reached a point where its merely your perspective and not actually an argument meant to change peoples minds. The simple fact is that a lot of people are talking about it, its a speech thats going to happen, its a policy thats going to be implemented. We can only create articles for future events when we are quite certain that this said event will occur - and we are quite certain this event will occur. Please read the guideline again where it clarifies this. As for what will be said, what changes will occur, all we have are breif statements and things that the media expects. We can, and most certainly should represent these things as they are, expected announcements. We wont know if they are right or wrong till it happens, so we wont say they are right or wrong, we will just say that these are what the experts are expecting, or what the government has said thus far. ~<b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">Rangeley</span></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERangeley_d899.html" title="User talk:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">talk</span></a>)</b> 00:26, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your method is wrong. First, you should search on "new way forward"... second... CNN website search comes up with blogs, but that seems to be a failure of the way news websites do searches.

<dd>My bad. But in all seriousness, I'd like to end this debate in a way that makes everybody happy. To do that, I think there are a couple things that need to be said: what you want in the article, what I want in the article (along with anybody else), and a way that we can incorporate those two (or more) things in the article. The only problem I have with this article is the abundance of media crap, to put it bluntly. Even the better links you provided above are plauged with speculation (to quote one, "...House has refused to talk publicly about any of the decisions that Mr. Bush has made about his plan, which is tentatively entitled â€œA New Way Forward"..."). I would support not doing anything with this article until the speech is done, and then write the article, as I have said a couple times before above. Comments? Concerns? Let's work together here, not against each other. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 00:57, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>PTO... let me first start my comment with a degree of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilove_b832.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilove">wikilove</a>...by saying that I have absolutely no ill will towards you or anyone else leaning towards a delete vote. My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikistress3D_1_v3.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikistress3D_1_v3.jpg" rel="nofollow">wiki-stress</a> level is now set to copacetic, and I respect your opinion even if I disagree with it. The reason we call these <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Article for Deletion</a> instead of <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">Vote For Deletion</a> is because this is not just a vote but a discussion... among equals. Viva Wikipedia!!! Group Hug!!! <b>Secondly</b> I want to respond to the content of your post by saying that the subject of discussion is <b>whether</b> there is notable content here. The discussion over <b>how</b> to frame and present the notable content is better left to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_New_Way_Forward_00bc.html" title="Talk:The New Way Forward">Talk:the New Way Forward</a>, a page that is at present red-linked. If you agree that there is subject matter here worth writing about, then change your opinion to <b>Keep</b> IMHO, we can mercilessly edit the media links as better ones emerge. If you think there is grounds for deletion, you need to be clear about why... I think I have shown that the article documents the verifiable political <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/machination" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/machination" rel="nofollow">machinations</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intimation" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intimation" rel="nofollow">intimations</a> that have occurred prior to the speech, and the natural starting point for this narrative is the Nov 2006 Democratic Takeover, followed by the progressively higher profile meetings that the president has held leading up to his often-promised speech. The section on "the Speech" was deliberately left empty because we don't know what he is going to say, only that many of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec20/0,4670,BushText,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec20/0,4670,BushText,00.html" rel="nofollow">his actual recent speeches</a> have alluded to an upcoming "new way forward" plan to change the situation in Iraq. In short, believe I have made the case for preservation of the article, and I agree that the links and references should be mercilessly edited (per <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>) as further information emerges.

<dd>I changed my vote to conditional keep. Doing some homework and reading the links you posted has revealed to me that the term is more of a blanket term than I thought...originally, I believed that the article was only going to be on the speech. Therefore, I've found that the article does have redeeming value, and I am willing to keep it if we don't use any media sources to speculate on what Bush's speech will be on.

<p>PTO and MPS â€“ Thank you both for your most recent posts. I think theyâ€™re certainly moving this discussion in the right direction. I wanted to return to a question raised earlier by JWSchmidt that seems to me to be a threshold issue in the deletion debate. That is, does this topic merit a stub? Would you two (or anyone else reading this page) be willing to agree that the New Way Forward is a media title for potential changes to Bushâ€™s Iraq strategy? If the answer is no, then there should not be a stub, let alone an article. Only if the answer is yes should we shift the discussion to the content of the article â€“ and, as MPS suggests, that discussion might be better conducted in the Talk forum.

<dd>Wikipedians are omniscient&#160;:D. We have had a few threads on you all at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. Back on topic, though, after thinking this one through and doing a little homework, I've found that this warrants at least a stub discribing Bush's opposition about his Iraq policy and his promise to deliver a new plan. However, I still feel that the media garbage about Bush's speech should be left out until they can produce something that isn't just an educated guess. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 02:21, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your comment seems to be phrased as if you don't expect a clear topic to be identified. This article is about the very public Bush response to the Iraq Study Group that he has repeatedly referred to as a "new way forward in iraq". Bush has consulted several conservative think tanks and high level officials and promised a speech that most of the mainstream press reports indicate will propose a <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=troop%20%22surge.%22%20%20&amp;btnG=Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=troop%20%22surge.%22%20%20&amp;btnG=Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">troop "surge."</a> I mean we could call it proposed troop surge of 2007 but that's a matter for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_New_Way_Forward_00bc.html" title="Talk:The New Way Forward">talk:The New Way Forward</a> to sort out, not AFD. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 20:37, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>
<ul>
<li>Even though it is a speculation, the speculation has congealed as a thing of its own. Don't we want wikipedia to include famous media speculations (e.g. predictions of who will run for president)? In other words, a significant speculation can be viewed as a news event in itself. If it turns out to be wrong, that update should also be added to the page.</li>
<li>This page is useful for people who hear the term on the news and don't know what it is. Is there any rule about including pages that are useful?Bobrudin 16:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> â€“ Even if there is currently uncertainty about the scope of this topic, there does seem to be a foundation of cited material and factual developments to justify the stub. More importantly, if Bush delivers this speech soon there may be many more people looking to read and edit this article. Abgb23 00:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but with reservations. I think it's silly to have an article about what some people think a not-yet happened speech will be about, but it does not seem to violate the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal ball</a> rule because it is sufficiently documented in the press and it seems that the speech will happen in some form or another. As more details become clearer the article can be updated accordingly (but perhaps some of the sections, such as the personnel changes that may or may not be attributable to the New Way Forward speech/doctrine, are still to speculative for inclusion even if the article as a whole is sufficiently nonspeculative). I don't find any glaring neutrality issues, at least none that can't be cleaned up. And the bottom line to me is that by the time this debate settles on whether or not to delete the article the speech <i>will</i> have happened and then there will definitely be enough material for an article. But if, on the other hand, a couple weeks go by and it becomes clear that the New Way Forward speech will in fact not go forward, then there is certainly a strong argument to delete the article (as opposed to keeping it, and having the article be about the media speculation of a speech that never was).

<li>2) <b>Speculation:</b> The speech "The New Way Forward" is in the future and not certain to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you all think about trying to address these concerns by making some changes to the article? To make the article more <b>neutral</b>, perhaps the article could include a small section describing--but not endorsing--criticism (by opposition politicians, people in the media, etc.) of the new strategy and/or the phrase itself? To make the article less <b>speculative</b>, perhaps the focus of the article could be on "The New Way Forward" as a policy or strategy rather than a speech. As others have pointed out, parts of the strategy associated with "The New Way Forward" have already been implemented, and are therefore no longer speculative. The article could still mention that the President is expected to lay out the details of this new policy in a speech. --3L Senioritis 19:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm... How do I say this... I appreciate your proposal, 3L. But ... there is already an expectation at wikipedia that this article is going to improve over time (become more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) as editors weigh in with new sourced content. Any wikipedia article becomes more neutral over time. The AFD page is a discussion of whether the article should exist at all. This article <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a> is less than 72 hours old. If you want to suggest neutrality improvements and <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPage_move_167f.html" title="Wikipedia:Page move">title changess</a>, I will start this discussion at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_New_Way_Forward_00bc.html" title="Talk:The New Way Forward">Talk:The New Way Forward</a>. In the mean time, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and feel free to update the content as you see fit. As for the discussion on <b>wikipedia:speculation</b> and the merits of this article even existing (IOW, this AFD), I really believe that the article currently documents quality information on Bush's publicly advertised Iraq strategy change (nicknamed "new way forward" ). IMHO, it's solidly referenced content about actually occurring historical events ... and for that reason I think it's not <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - After hearing and reading the speech and reading and hearing comments about the speech, I find the article to be an unfocused mess that misinforms and is unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 09:30, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>IMHO, It is absurd that we have not closed this vote yet. There very obviously <b>was</b> a speech last night, and it did lay out Bush's new strategy in iraq based on criticisms made by the Iraq Study Group. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=in&amp;q=New+Way+Forward" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=in&amp;q=New+Way+Forward" rel="nofollow">As evidenced by press reports</a> many refer to this as Bush's "New Way Forward" speech. The name is immaterial. If the article is unfocused, then edit it to make it better. As far as content, most everyone would acknowledge that this was a hugely notable speech about a hugely notable policy change, so why are we talking about deleting the article? If you want to page move this to Bush's speech announcing his new Iraq strategy January 2007 then talk about that on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_New_Way_Forward_00bc.html" title="Talk:The New Way Forward">Talk:The New Way Forward</a>. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 16:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The title of the article is inappropriate for the title of an article about the speech and the article has very little to do with the speech (being written before the speech might have something to do with that) so that a speech was given means nothing as the speech and the article have little in common. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:18, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The speech and the strategy change were both formulated prior to January 10. The article cites sources to trace the development of the strategy change as it developed.

<li><b>Keep</b> but why not rename it? If it sounds like Wikipedia would be <b>endorsing</b> Bush policy by using the White House's name for his policy change, try to think of a more neutral article title. But don't delete it while there's a link to it on the Current Events page. But surely we have articles on anti-Bush (or Democratic Party initiatives) which have similar titles.
