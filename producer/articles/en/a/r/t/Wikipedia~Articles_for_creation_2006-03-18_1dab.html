<p>Kwame Amoateng is a Swedish footballer, currently playing for GAIS</p>
<p>Having been found aboard a herring ship in Newcastle, he was presumed to have come from the Swedish fishing port of Smögen, but due to legal constraints was brought up by a Jamaican family in the Sunderland area of Newcastle. After showing prodigious footballing talent he was signed to a Grimsby youth team, and at the age of 19 took the oppurtunity to return to his homeland to persue his professional career. He has played for GAIS ever since.</p>
<p>One of his favourite party tricks is being able to lick his own elbow.</p>

<p>Peppertino Alfreno 'Peppy' Ankylosaurus the Seventh is a fictional dinosaur from Dinosaur Land. He is Yoshi's best friend, and is among popular with people who have played Super Smash Brothers Melee. He is currentely part of a grand prix called Yoshi Kart and is one of the Yoshi Kart racers in the SSBM section of the Video Game section of Fanfiction.Net.</p>
<p>He has been among one of the most popular fan-made characters used in the SSBM section, and he could become one of the most recongnize fan-characters of SSBM, as wellas the entire video game universe. He has made over 18 appearances in fanfiction, and has made 2 appearances in a series of short sprite comics on DevaintArt.</p>
<p>He will appear in 45 more short sprite comics, as well as 4 more fanfics. Here's some info on his stats:</p>
<p>Color: Yellow</p>
<p>Appearance: Has a sturdy body with four legs, and a circle for a head with a reptialian snout</p>
<p>IQ: 60</p>
<p>First Appearance: Yoshi's First Adventure</p>
<p>If there's a possible chance in the future, it is likely that if fanmade characters are allowed in a fan0made game based off of SSBM, it is likely that Peppy will appear.</p>

<p>I received an email from Ukraine asking the question, 'what is and American, and can I be one?'</p>
<p>I quickly jotted the following, then started looking on line for a better definition. I have not found one so I will publish this feeble attempt to capture the essence of who and what an American is.</p>
<p>An American is patriotic, without being idiotic. An American believes that the Constitution was written By the people and For the people, to allow freedom FROM the government. The founding Fathers founded this nation on the basic of the Judeo-Christian beliefs. Over the years people have come to this country because it offers them economic opportunities unlimited. A good American believes in GOD- FAMILY- COUNTRY I that order. He has shed his blood and shared his treasure all over this globe to insure that the American way of life remains free. He is the first to defend the underdog, and the first to shoot to kill when necessary. He can be the meanest fighting man in protecting what he believes, yet the kindest conqueror as he tries to build up his former enemy. Yes, you can be A Good American no matter where you live if you are willing to pay the price. But so far I have found NO other people in the world who are willing.</p>
<p>Anyone want to help answer the question?</p>

<p>Charles born in Stricklandgate, Kendal. Westmorland.England, to John and Hannah Carter. Father was a builder.Born March 1822 Baptised at Holy Trinity church Kendal April 14th 1822. Charles attended a private school, learnt Latin.Greek and French. Ran away to sea at 14, only to be found and sent home. In 1837 his father died and Charles had to leave school, his parents wanted him to become a Doctor, but he had other ideas! He was good at arithmatic and drawing, this would help him in later years in New Zealand. At 15 he went to work with a Master Builder as a carpenter. Some years later he went to London, and heard about the Chartrist movement and sympathised with them. Whilst in London, he read up a lot about Politics and his work, attending the Westminster Literacy Institute. March 1850, he married at St. James' Church, Westminster to Jean Robertson(sometimes it is written as Robieson) they sailed for New Zealand together with her young brother James Robieson, as their parents had died, after 6 months at sea they reached New Zealand. He worked hard in Wellington, building many places, managed to obtain a big Government contract to reclaim land at Lambton Harbour. He was doing well, asked to stand for Government, but declined, since he had a contract to build for them. He owned land up at Three Mile Bush as it was first called, later called Carterton in his honour, as he was the main benefactor of this area, when back in London, he purchased books for their library. Charles did a lot for the start of New Zealand, and this area, now called Carterton. Charles whilst overseas, organised that a Egyptian Mummy would be sent to Dominion Museum. Wellington for the nation. This is now at Te Papa. Lady Mehit-Em-Wesekht. thought to have lived about 300 BC. at the time of the Greek occupation of Egypt. His wife gave birth to a daughter, sadly died in 1870 whilst in London, and in 1895 when the couple were in Derbyshire, Jean also died. At this time, Charles arranged for the coffin of their daughter to be put with his wife's at Burbage. He returned to New Zealand in 1896, and sadly died in Wellington in July, and bought up to Clareville Cemetery where he lies buried in the Old Settlers area.</p>
<p>Carter's Line.. a reserve in Carterton District. Carter's Observatory. Wellington. Carter's Home for aged men, now rebuilt in another part of town, for both sexes in their *golden years* Library of books.. etc...</p>
<p>We have a lot to thank Charles Rooking Carter for... the above only skims the surface of his life in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Britain's oldest manufacturer of motorcycle clothing, Lewis Leathers began life in 1892 as D Lewis, a tailors shop. In 1926 the company was registered as D Lewis Ltd and emphasis was placed on their growing range of protective leather and fabric clothing &amp; accessories for early aviators, motorists and motorcyclists. A manufacturing plant was established in the north of England and D Lewis Ltd soon won contracts for supplying clothing to Governments throughout the world for their respective airforces and the brand name AVIAKIT was applied to these goods. During World War 2 D Lewis Ltd supplied the RAF and also created bespoke items for British RAF officers whilst offering a 10% discount to members of the armed forces. The end of WW2 saw D Lewis once again return to supplying their continually evolving range of goods to civillian aviators but demand from motorcyclists soon saw the company placing a higher emphasis on suitable garments for this market. <a href="http://www.lewisleathers.com" class="external free" title="http://www.lewisleathers.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lewisleathers.com</a></p>

<p><b>Nexialism</b> is a name for a fictional perfect method of teaching complete knowledge through interdisciplinary, synthetic correlation of the theories, premises and results of different sciences.</p>
<p>It was introduced by A. Korzybski and popularized by <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._E._van_Vogt_fe6f.html" title="A. E. van Vogt">A. E. van Vogt</a> in his sci-fi book The Voyage of the Space Beagle.</p>
<p>The main idea harks back to the crowning of the dialectic process (historically first documented by greek philosophers), namely the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synthesis.html" title="Synthesis">synthesis</a> that is the actually productive step of any analysis. Without synthesis, there is nothing new learned and all the work of "splitting the hairs" done through analysis amounts to much less. So it is with sciences and any other sort of expertise, when taken very narrowly, without looking for analogies, applications and source material in other fields: they start producing less and less useful results. Even when each scientist in particular makes use of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>, that gets applied from the particular perspective, and at the level of abstraction at which that particular science functions.</p>
<p>The problem with the feasibility of such a method is the vast amount of theoretical and practical experience a nexialist should be able to master. vanVogt's answer in the story was exposure to all possible fields, but specialization in one or few that spark one's own main interests. Having a model as complete as possible of where all the specific answers could be found, and going for in-depth answers when the problem at hand requires it. Then, continuous learning and development provides for a worthwhile life experience.</p>
<p>Within epistemology, nexialism could be seen as the equivalent from ethics of <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epictetus.html" title="Epictetus">epictetian</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoicism.html" title="Stoicism">stoicism</a>.</p>

<p>Snow hydrology analyses and describes the processes of accumulation and ablation (melt, evaporation, sublimation) of snow, the mouvement of the melted water through the snowpack and the underlying soil and the interaction between snow and meltwater with other components of the hydrologic cycle.</p>
<p>In catchments where important amounts of precipitation fall in solid form during the cold season (the accumulation period), snow hydrology plays an important role in the understanding of the hydrological regime, in particular of high discharge events and low flow. The analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of snow helps for example predicting the occurence of melt-induced spring floods or of inflows into drinking water or hydropower production reservoirs.</p>

<p>The Purple Shall Govern, is a slogan taken from the People's March also known as Purple Haze, which was one of the last illegal anti-apartheid events to occur in Cape Town during 1989. The march attended by approximately 350 protestors turned into a full scale riot with racist police deploying a new anti-riot cannon that sprayed purple dye. Some people who were there: Nat Tardrew, a forty-something art school teacher and anarchist; Buysile "Billy" Mandindi, a Michaelis art school graduate, and various luminaries who have yet to come out of the wood-work. Unfortunately I was busy typesetting the first issue of Kagenna up on campus and returned to find the two covered in purple dye. Graffiti on a wall the following day "The Purple Shall Govern". If anybody has pictures of this event, or knows somebody who was there, please feel free to edit this article</p>

<p>In 1989, the people of Cape Town, South Africa, defied a government ban on protest marches, to rally for the cause of peace and the end of apartheid. 100 000 people attended the demonstration of support for democracy by marching down Adderley St, just a week after the infamous "Purple Shall Govern" protests in Greenmarket Square. Lead by the then Mayor of Cape Town, Gordon Oliver, and religious leaders, Moulana Faried Esack, Rev. Frank Chikane and World Council of Churches representative, Allen Boesak.</p>

<p>African Martial Arts</p>
<p>Mukhanda Enterprise is an organization that researches, preserves, and practices traditional African combat systems, both in Africa and throughout the Diaspora where African people migrated to, both as free people and as slaves.</p>
<p>Mukhanda Enterprise have regular contact with practitioners of authentic African combat arts, both in Africa and the Diaspora, and as an organization, we practice a wide variety of African martial systems from both regions.</p>
<p>Our wide communication system has given us great knowledge of the following African and African derived fighting systems:</p>
<p>Dambe&#160;: Traditional empty hand system of the Hausa tribe of Nigeria, consisting of punching, kicks, knees, elbows, and head butts. Ancient Dambe was a full combat system, and consisted of combat grappling called Kokawa, which today is practiced separately as traditional wrestling. Kokawa&#160;: Traditional wrestling of the Hausa in Nigeria. In ancient times, it was the grappling component of combat Dambe. Shanci&#160;: Combat system of Maguzawa Hausa warriors. It uses weapons and anything goes tactics. In ancient times, it was used to select the toughest warriors. Mani&#160;: An African derived system from Cuba, which despite what some scholars say, still exists. In 18th century Cuba, Spanish slave owners watched slaves fight to the death using Mani. At the same time, slaves in Cuba used this martial art in revolts. Mani consists of head butts, punches, palm strikes, sweeps, elbows, and some systems have kicks; the weapon part consists of stick fighting and knife fighting. Master practitioners were called Manisaros. Mukhanda Enterprise has direct contact with a Mani master and we have extensive knowledge of this system.If you are interested in being contacted when the web site on Dambe is finished and videos are available, please send name, location, and reason for interest in African martial arts to this e-mail address:Mashera76@yahoo.com</p>

<p>Abstract (by Paolo Allievi): The limit mass M of a bright star is that for which the number N of the available quantum states, up to the distance of the frequencies of the “visible” band, in its corona is equal to the number Np of photons which permeate the corona itself. The study allows the calculation of both N and Np and therefore, equating them, it is possible to obtain the values of M (maximum mass limit) and R (star Radius): M=13 Ms (Ms=Sun mass= 2 10^30 kg), R=3 Rs (Rs=Sun Radius = 700,000 km).</p>

<p>Dwight Morrow High School is a high school located in Englewood, New Jersey. It has a very hostile history. It originally opened up in 1932. When it first opened up, it ranked as one of the top schools in the nation for many years. Around the 1970s, however, the school began to decline. A phenemenon known as white flight hit the school hard. Violent incidents increased, test scores plummeted.</p>
<p>During the 1980s many white students began fleeing the school leaving the school majority African American. Nearby district of Englewood Cliffs, attempeted to end its sending recieveing relationship with Englewood due to the poor performance of the school. This led to a bitter court battle between Englewood &amp; Englewood Cliffs beginning in 1985. Englewod called the move racist. By the 1990s, the school lost all of its white population. By 1992, the school was 98% black and hispanic. It ranked the worst in the county and had amongst the highest violent rates in the state of New Jersey. Court battles in an attempt to desegragate the high school continued. The high school got worse with police chases, students randomly setting fires, and gang violence. "In 2001, four juveniles were charged as a result of an investigation into fires at Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood," says the Bergen County Prosecutor's office. Many parents feared to send their kids to this High School. Majority of parents in Englewood and virtually all parents in Englewood Cliffs, sent their kids to private schools. In the fall of 2002 however, a new magnet program was opened up in an attempt to attract white students back to the school.</p>
<p>The opening of the new academy lead to more discrimination. As the academy having a diverse population was kept totally speperate from the majority minority high school, while they were on the same campus. Dwight Morrow got worse with frequent protests and overcrowded classrooms and underqualified teachers. The academy got high qualified teachers as well as better classrooms and better resources. The school continues to have major problems.</p>

<p>Canadian artist Scott Treleaven’s infamous zine, "This Is the Salivation Army", was originally intended to run for only eight issues, from 1996 to 1999. With it's unique collusion of punk aesthetics, Blakean mysticism and sexually explicit, radical queer posturing, the zine immediately attracted press, suspicion, and a loyal international following. The zine fearlessly delved into topics like nomadism, queer identity, shamanism, the occult, and featured blatant homages to the likes of William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Kenneth Anger, Jean Genet, and Derek Jarman. Over the course of it’s three year run the Salivation Army also managed to spawn a number of spin-off zines, setting-up headquarters in Toronto, Prague, London (currently active under the direction of James BL Hollands as the "Horse Hospital" in Bloomsbury, London), and New York, as well as holding a series of public and private occultural events aimed at turning the Army’s magickal theory into practice.</p>
<p>Three years after the zine was put into hibernation, Treleaven released an account of his experiences in the film "The Salivation Army" (officially considered issue #9 of the zine), which was hailed by The Village Voice as one of the most notable underground films of 2002. Widely lauded, even earning a screening at the prestigious Art Basel, Switzerland, and rapidly gathering a second wave of recruits, the film’s success prompted a 'best-of' reprint of the zines by Art Metropole.</p>
<p>In February 2004 a much-anticipated issue#10 was released to coincide with an exhibition curated by Philip Monk at the Art Gallery of York University. Though not a formal return to the helm, ‘issue X’ eschewed much of the personal content of the early issues, serving instead to give new and old readers a glimpse of the iconoclasts and 'shamanarchists' that influenced or sprang from the Army itself; proof that the magickal underground was alive and flourishing more than ever before.</p>
<p>Most recently, New York publisher Printed Matter Inc. released a lavishly bound collection of the entire zine run to celebrate the 10th anniversary of "This Is the Salivation Army" entitled "The Salivation Army Black Book", with expanded texts, colour plates and introductions by Treleaven and Throbbing Gristle/Psychic TV progenitor Genesis Breyer P-Orridge.</p>

The stories follow Louis' attempts to live his dreams and draw grown ups and children alike into a scary cute world where the citizens' lives are stiffled and their actions more or less controlled by Entertainment Centres and obscure regulations. Louis, a sensitive soul, has recently discovered he has an aunt and enthusiastically enters into a correspondence. But does his aunt really exist? Mysterious visitors bring Louis strange gifts but something sinister is definitely going on.</p>

<p>The Ear, The Eye, and The Arm is a science fiction/ detective novel set in a futuristic Zimbabwe. The country had suffered from gang violence and crime for decades, but a headstrong general managed to drive crime and violence away from his city. He is somewhat paranoid, and so his children, Rita, Kuda, along with his oldest son, have lived all their life inside his expansive estate. One day, however, they sneak out for adventure and get kidnapped. As the general desperately searches for the children, he also calls in assistance from one of the few detective agencies left in the world, The Ear, the Eye, and The Arm.</p>
<p>These three detectives take residence in the Cows Guts, a poor, forgotten slum outside of the general's protection. Their community is filled with mutated humans, people with horns, extra limbs, too few limbs and other strange mutations that are only routine in the Cows Guts. The detectives themselves are also mutated; their mothers drank water that nuclear waste had leaked into. The Ear, who is English (only 3 characters (the other two being the Praise Singer and his mother) are not of African descent), has large, sensitive ears, and can hear for miles, while loud noises and minor injuries to his ears can cripple him. The Eye's eyes are also outsize and are all black; he has both far vision and the ability to see things close up in extreme detail. Like the Ear, small injuries to his eyes are crippling, as well as bright flashes. The Arm, who is the apparent leader, not only has extremely long limbs, but the ability to sense emotions and thoughts of others through his entire body, and simply being in a large crowd is crippling for him.</p>
<p>These three detectives go on a large scale chase for the children, always seemingly one step behind, and both parties encounter great challenges along the way.</p>

<p>The Fulton Street El was an Elevated Railroad built by the Union Elevated Rairoad and leased to the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad for operation. Later these companies combined as the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad. In 1900 The Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad was absorbed in to the BRT (Brooklyn Rapid Transit), and its later the BMT (Brooklyn Manhattn Transit), successor to the BRT. The line serviced neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens from the 1880’s until the 1950’s.</p>
<p>The Elevated originally started at two seprate terminuses, one at Park Row and Manhattan, and one at Sands Street, near the Fulton Ferry to Manhattan, in Brooklyn. From their the line procedded down Fulton Street in to Brooklyn. In the 1910’s during the Dual Contracts of both the IRT and and BMT lines, the Fulton Street El was extended down Fulton Street in to eastern sections of Brooklyn and eventually down Pitkin and Liberty Avenues in to Queens.</p>
<p>The Els demise came in the form of the IND 8 Avenue/Fulton Street Subway which was built in the 1936, and directly paralled the El from Sands Street until the Rockaway Avenue in station in Brooklyn. On the day that New York City acquired all the properties of the BMT and the IRT, June 1, 1940, service from Fulton Ferry and Park Row to Rockaway Avenue was abandoned. Service remained from Rockaway Avenue to Lefferts Avenue in which lead to an interesting oddity. Commuters from Queens and Eastern Brooklyn would have to ride the remaining portion of the El to Rockaway Avenue and then get off their trains and transfer to the IND subway at Rockaway Avenue to continue on in to Manhattan, a major inconvenience. There was also a 14th Street-Fulton service, which ran from 8th Avenue IND subway in Manhattan via the 14th Street Canarsie line to the Atlantic Avenue station in which the Canarsie El, Fulton Street, and the Broadway Jamaica Els all convened together. From there trains switched onto the Fulton Street El to Lefferts Avenue later Boulevard. There was a non-rush hour cutback of El service to Eastern Parkway in 1952, with Rockaway Avenue served in rush hours only.</p>
<p>During the Post War years the subway under Fulton Street was extended reaching the Atlantic Avenue station in 1948 and later to Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn. Another planned extension would take the subway right under the remaining portion of the El on Liberty Avenue in Queens, making the rest of the El obsolete. However, in 1955 the transit authority took over the Long Island Railroads Rockaway line and was anxious to connect it to the IND Eighth Avenue/Fulton Street Line. Spending much of it money renovating the Rockaway line, the city decided to connect the Fulton Street Subway with the remaining portion of the El. On April 26, 1956, a connection was opened from the IND Fulton Street Subway line at Euclid Avenue to the Fulton Street El at the 80 Street/Hudson Avenue, and the "A" train began running via this connection through to Lefferts Boulevard. The section from Rockaway Avenue to Hudson Avenue was then abandoned and torn down. Two months later, the connection from Rockaway Blvd. to the old LIRR Rockaway branch was opened and IND service to the Rockaway began.</p>
<p>Today the Fulton Street El section over Liberty Avenue in Queens from the 80th Street/Hudson Avenue Station to Lefferts Boulevard is all that remains of the Fulton Street El. The remaining portion of the El and its connection to the Fulton Street Subway, better known as the A train; service the same neighborhoods that the EL once serviced.</p>
