<p>Although this webcomic is now defunct, if it were notable, I should be able to find some mention of it in Google. Google only has <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=ping972&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=ping972&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">25 results</a> for ping972, and a search for ping 972 returns nothing which suggests the webcomic was notable. Article claims it was mentioned by another webcomic, but I don't feel this is notable, nor is being available in 2 languages. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:06, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>While I don't agree with keeping all of the color articles, I argue <b>keep</b> for this one.

<li>Also a notable color. Sometimes identified with PMS 160 or even PMS 174, but these are to dark. Go with Canada Post and say PMS 470 (or amongst the extended four digit set, PMS 7413).

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Redirecting would be pointless, as there are so few articles that link there. Simply changing the link for the one article that links to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra_cotta_%28color%29.html" title="Terra cotta (color)">Terra cotta (color)</a> to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra_cotta.html" title="Terra cotta">Terra cotta</a> would make much more sense and would help with future use of the term. What I'm saying is that if there is nothing verifiable to merge and the page is simply going to be turned into a redirect, there would be little necessity for the page, as it is just more complicated to link to the redirect than it would be to link to the article it redirects to. -<a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENameneko_fd06.html" title="User:Nameneko">Nameneko</a> 06:13, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li>Redirecting is also useful in preventing future accidental recreation of an article. Although it is much more likely someone would search without the qualifier, if they do, this will prevent them from being given the oh-so-tempting "write-me" redlink.

<ul>
<li>That makes sense. <b>Redirect</b>. However, when merged, the color portion shouldn't go overboard. We don't need information on "dark terra cotta" or "pale terra cotta" or "aquamarineish terra cotta with a hint of magenta-cyan", just the color "terra cotta". -<a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENameneko_fd06.html" title="User:Nameneko">Nameneko</a> 22:21, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>REDIRECT</b> to <i>Tomato</i>. This is the only one of these that is at all difficult to call. We're just about over two-thirds to delete on numbers, and I don't honestly understand why people think this is useful as a redirect given the vast unlikeliness of anybody thinking to search for it, parentheses and all. However, given how clear the other debates were, and the vascillation by Tim Pope, I'll say there's not outright consensus to delete and will apply the redirect. RfD may feel differently if someone wants to try that. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 18:27, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't think this is a memorial for the dead. While the main comic has ended, that was only due to the storyline coming to an end. It's not because the Webcomic artist gave up on it. Her latest comic is still set in the same "world" as Demonic Boppu, and is in many ways a sequel. I had every intention of adding to this article when I had time, and more information. I'm sorry if you do not agree with the standards of <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> but in many ways the comic meets those standards. Perhaps you should set your sights on changing the standards first? Arleas 23:48, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

You should start and expand your article on Demonic Boppu there, it doesn't exist yet. I know if you were a fan of the comic, it's nice to see an article on wikipedia, but it really isn't the place for it, especially ones which have not stated their notability. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 16:39, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think it may almost be time to re-open a wide-ranging debate about Policy. Given the survival of almost all schools at the AfD process, the chronic nomination of schools (particularly mass-nominations) is steering very close to <i>disruptive</i> behavior, going forward. I think the question needs to be put to those that do not believe schools to be notable institutions in their own right, how many elementary schools have to survive the AfD process in order to establish a "rough concensus" that school articles (and stubs) should not be deleted? I'm not merely asking this rhetorically, but how many AfD votes that do not result in article deletion are necessary to establish "rough concensus" to "not delete" (as opposed to a concensus to "keep")? An honest and open debate on that question will soon need to begin, in order to end the abuse of AfD with multi and mass-nominations of school stub articles that will doubtless survive the AfD process. The issue is not whether schools should be debated on "their own merits" but whether or not "elementary schools are non-notable" is a legitimate reason to nominate an article (or 21 of them in one day) for AfD. If a policy can established on that question, then we could actually debate each school on it's merits as an article.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 15:41, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"elementary schools are non-notable" is not a valid reason to put one on AfD, but "<b>this</b> elementary schools is non-notable" is a good reason. However, it's impossible to actually do this at the moment, because of the large "schools are notable by definition" movement. It is clear that the continuing nominations of NN schools for AfD indicate a sizable minority of Wikipedians disagree with the premise that schools are inherently notable. A middle ground is required - as has already been suggested, a page with a table of schools in a particular district (and other misc. info like roll size, founding date, etc.), and any notable schools can be linked to from their entry on that table.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 23:25, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>In grave danger?</i> This has already happened, even if some haven't caught on yet. Because WP embraces consensus (and keeps by default unless ~70% favor deletion), and because enough committed editors care about these articles (claiming schools are public institutions, and ipso facto, notable), these articles will almost always stay. NB: I don't care, really; I don't know whether I think schools are notable, but I understand that enough people do such that a decision has effectively already been taken. Soon enough, indifferent editors like me will understand the same, and this rough keep consensus will become policy. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 08:41, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The problems with a broad "keep articles on schools" policy is the inevitable extension to encompass primary schools, kindergardens, creches, technical schools, military schools, vocational colleges, language schools, art schools, schools for the gifted (and not so gifted) and other innumerable variations of organised education.

<li>Over the past year the argument has shifted from just keeping all secondary schools, to now keeping primary schools as well- I fail to see why this trend will not continue. The problem with school article votes is that there a lot of people who believe schools are always notable simply for being a school. A minority of the people who bother voting on these articles believe that school articles should demonstrate notability in the same way bands, websites, etc have to (i.e. they should be more notable than the average).

<li>Kappa, you have not been here long enough to remember when even high schools had to meet notability criteria. At that time, those who expressed concerns that elementary schools would be next on the list if high schools were granted automatic right-to-exist status were pooh-poohed. Look, however, at the last spate of AfD nominations, and the comments made by users such as yourself. I will not be surprised at all when arguments begin to be made for the automatic inclusion of kindergartens and daycares, on the sole ground that they are "inherently notable". This is what I fight. I have no objection whatever to articles on genuinely notable schools. I would have no objection to an article on a genuinely notable daycare or kindergarten either. At the same time, I oppose the blanket inclusion of any public institution. And yes, if I had my druthers, battleships, Simpsons episodes, and baseball playeres would all have to meet entry criteria as well. It is, however, a disingenuous argument that just because they are currently immune from AfD, so too should something else be. (Oh, and trust me, pokemon characters are not all sacrosanct. I've happily seen a few go into the furnace recently.) <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:23, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I feel motivated to speak in Kappa's defense here. Kate's tool says he has been here since Sept. 2004, and that you've only been here eight months longer, Denni. No offense, but I do believe it's natural and expected for consensus to evolve, and I think its a bit irrelevant to refer to an older state of affairs that apparently existed 21 months ago, but had dissolved as early as 13 months ago, as if it were of precedential value. On a related note, it seems to me that the "rump" of opposition that continues to fight high schools only serves to promote other schools. Those who oppose schools rarely make any distinction among grade-levels, so why should their adversaries. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 22:47, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks Xolox well put. As I said, I think the fears of people claiming daycares to be "inherently notable" are exaggerated, but the most likely way to create such people is by continually attacking educational institutions as non-notable. The idea that consensus should be torn up on baseball players, Simpsons episodes etc, seems an incredibly retrograde step, exposing every editor who would try to improve such articles to a semi-random threat of deletion. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:23, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>If <i>you</i> keep saying "notable, keep" about things that people think should be deleted, it will increase the amount of notability they demand from any topic. Nobody wins, and Wikipedia loses. I think consensus is transient and relative to a particular article - to try and extend it to a <i>class</i> of articles results in the current problem.

<li>Consensus on a class of articles is more consistent and less arbitrary than semi-random decisions on each one.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Perhaps a worthwhile mental exercise when considering AfDs relating to institutions is to imagine the subject as a person. In this case, we would have "St Anne's School is a teacher who lives in Seattle. She is five foot four, has brown hair and blue eyes <i>(this is the equivalent of the data on the school's ethnic makeup)</i>. She thinks she's a very good teacher." Would that be notable? The fact that the school is a few thousand times bigger than a person makes no odds - zero notability multiplied by a thousand equals zero notability. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:28, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I'm not so much trying to argue notability or lack of, but suggesting a different approach: the question of whether these articles contain any encyclopaedic information. Ethnicity data for a school or an American county may look impressive, but without some kind of "value-added" it's no more useful than someone's eye colour. And my other argument stands: if an entity consists of several thousand people, it means nothing if they're all non-notable. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 16:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why? It's raw data, with absolutely no value. "The high proportion of Hispanics in this school/county has created ethnic tension" or "His blue eyes secured him the role of Inspector Knacker in Crime Drama X" are useful information, but this is completely absent in this case. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.</a> --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 10:13, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>He did: nn (non-notable). And by the way, this article is close to a speedy candidate for not asserting notability (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A7), though that's debatable. This fellow's only claim to fame is being a prisoner (of which there are hundreds of thousands) and for being a refugee (of which there are also hundreds of thousands). Perhaps you should provide a reason that this should be kept, but that's just a thought. However, unless this article shows some display of notability, I'll say <s><b>delete</b>.</s> --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 06:39, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> due to Vizjim's research.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Although I haven't personally checked the facts, I'll assume they are correct and he is indeed one of the few notable prisoners there.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Jamil al Banna's case has been the cause of controversy (see <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1388268,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1388268,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). The only redirect that would make sense would be to an article called something like Foreign-born British residents without citizenship imprisoned at Guantánamo. But even then the problem is that the citizenship issues for a Palestinian like al Banna are quit different from those such as Iraqi-born <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisher_al-Rawi_0123.html" title="Bisher al-Rawi">Bisher al-Rawi</a>. For this reason I would strongly favour having a separate page for each man, where details of their cases can be given. The legal case around the internment of these men is the touchstone for formulations of <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_law.html" title="International law">international law</a> in the last four years, and will probably help to define the concept of international law for another decade or more. For that reason each individual case is <b>highly notable and encyclopedic</b>. I've expanded the article a little, and would expect that this expansion will continue with input from more legally-minded contributors. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:13, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This article is actually pretty long for a single recording, and (perhaps surprisingly) most all of it is even relevant.

<li><b>Delete</b>. [1] Wrong title. "The Star Spangled Banner" is <i>not</i> a "Whitney Houston song". It's a Whitney Houston recording. [2] the article claims it was for fundraising, and provides no details of any funds raised. [3] "blew the crowd away" is a bit hyperbolic for Wikipedia, no? [4] "her version is the most recognized vocal version of the song in the modern generation" is unprovable piffle. And what of Rosanne Barr's ageless rendition? Why have we no article on it? [5] "Houston had performend [sic] the song in front of nearly 100 million spectators and TV viewers at the Super Bowl" (she had actually lip-synched rather than performed.). [6] "the golden girl of the industry"? [7] "even more shocking the song could reach that high". If there's actually any important information in this "article", put it in Whitney Houston's article. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:46, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this version of the Star Spangled Banner is a classic that has has a large cultural impact as it has been released twice during critical periods and its profits have gone to help those in need. It is still viewed as one of the best recordings of the U.S. anthem and one of the best recordings of Whitney Houston's career, so it is very notable. It was even officially released as a single and received airplay and sold very well, charting on many Billboard charts and even topping the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart for 6 weeks. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">Musicpvm</a> 03:26, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, that is definitely not all there is to say about. There is an entire article-worth of information to say about it as is evident when looking at the article, and I find all that information to be encyclopedic! There is no reason to delete all that information and merge this into another article and say a few lines about it when there is much more to say about it. This is currently a good, informative article. You should spend more of your time trying to expand Wikipedia articles rather than trying to get random articles with useful and encyclopedic information deleted. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">Musicpvm</a> 05:23, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just thought I'd point out that I've heard a handful of recordings of the Star-Spangled Banner, and Houston's is insipid and just plain terrible. And I consider myself a mild Whitney Houston fan -- this is certainly not one of the best recordings of her career! Everything else you said is a debatably acceptable reason to keep, but the quality of the recording is irrelevant as far as keeping or deleting the article.

This song was not a hit in any country, and was not given a full release as a single. The article fails to establish any other notablility, and therefor the neccessity for a seperate article is questionable. Not even the orignal song has enough information availabel on it to honestly have its own article (this article was in fact written <i>first</i>, with only passing mention to the more notable original).

<li>Mariah Carey's version of Do You Know Where You're Going To? (Theme from Mahogany) is far from a promotional recording. It was meant to be a full single, but there's a whole story behind it on why it got cancelled due to conflicts with other artists and with record labels. That's notability right there. If you merge or delete the article, thast information that will get lost. One article per song doesnt' look good. And in a prior attempt to merge songs over another article, most people commented that it did not look good <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegaWikipedia_90c1.html" title="User:OmegaWikipedia">OmegaWikipedia</a> 12:56, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>Keep-I came across this page today and I find it very valuable. I get to see how phillies fans think on a real board.</p>
<p>Keep-I originally said delete, but finding now that there is an entry for "Sons of Sam Horn" I've changed my opinion. The entry will be upgraded in terms of appearance and content shortly, if it is not deleted, by board members. I have no idea why "Sons" should be notable, but "philliesphans" wouild be non-notable. Is is a Red Sox vs. Phillies thing, or does it have to do with the entry itself? --phillychuck, a moderator of said site.</p>

<dd>I just read that, and think it's worth mentioning that they do seem to be fairly mature about it, which is better than a number of forum-based stuff that's been deleted in the past. The post by "donmoney" is particularly good and quite reasonable about the whole thing. For anyone coming here from the forum, I'd like to point out that ( 1 ) we're voting about the topic, not the article... it isn't a matter of making it bigger, or adding pictures, or anything like that ( 2 ) votes from new or anonymous users generally aren't counted, and a whole lot of them tends to make the article look bad and thus less likely to be kept.

<p>As noted above, Son of Sam Horn warrants a page. If you take a look at the site it is as good as any, and certainly as good as Son of Sam Horn. The discussion of sabremetrics demystifies these stats for many uninformed phans. The folks posting are generally professionals. donmoney being a lawyer, PC is in stats and so on. As with Son of Sam Horn the contacts that post on the site often scoop the media on Phillies information. The site is not commercial in any way, contrary to a note at the top of the page. joboggi</p>
<p>Delete, delete, delete. This group makes baseball sound so dry and empty. Lacking in passion and color. Their use of stats is pointed out as a reason to be allowed on wiki. Their gross overuse of stats sucks all the life out of this passionate game. This is not an attempt at serious archiving but in advertising this site. Delete.</p>
<p>Let me add a comment--we have no need nor desire to advertise the board broadly (or narrowly). We want quality of content, not quantity, and we do not run a single advertisement, nor make a single cent profit from any poster. The site is entirely privately funded by the founder, and has never accepted a donation nor solicited support of any kind. If one is a phillies fan (or likes to discuss politics or philosophy), sure, we'd love to have you come by occasionally. My feeling still is that SOSH, though a bit more prominent nationally, is a perfect precedent for this decision (wiki mgmt may not know that this board was notable in the fight by private fan boards to stop MLB from shutting down private fan sites, was written up in the Phila. Inquirer for this, and participated materially in getting the Phils to acknowledge (again with help from the Inky) that they had mis-measured the dimensions of Citizen Bank Park, and was active in helping to apprehend and convict a noted internet criminal). Regarding the use of stats on the board and making baseball "dry"--that's a joke. We just want people who make assertions ("Bobby Abreu stinks") to support their position with some reasoned arguments, which, in baseball, often leads to the use of stats. The part of the stats FAQ posted in the article is an attempt to HELP users unfamiliar with sabermetric stats decipher posts from users who employ them, nothing more. --phillychuck again</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am reopening this poll because it was closed prematurely, before everyone with an opinion about this matter has expressed his/her views. As such, there is no consensus on whether this article should be kept or deleted. Nor do I think that the situation has been sufficiently explained. Here are three reasons why this article should be deleted:
<ol>
<li>Precedents. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcelles_6733.html" title="User:Sarcelles">Sarcelles</a> has previously created 4 similar articles: Changchun Public Security Bureau, Tangshan Public Security Bureau, Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau, Lu'an Public Security Bureau. None of those survived VfD, because they were deemed non-notable and POV. It makes little sense for this to be kept.</li>
<li>POV. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcelles_6733.html" title="User:Sarcelles">Sarcelles</a> has a history of starting purely POV articles for the sake of pushing his agenda. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Chinese_cities_da9a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Chinese cities">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Chinese cities</a> for a detailed account of his actions starting from mid-May. Three Wikipedians (<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">User:Abstrakt</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html" title="User:Miborovsky">User:Miborovsky</a>, and I) are currently considering an RfC or even RfA against him if the situation does not improve quickly, because we are sick and tired of chasing after literally hundreds of his edits, de-POVizing when we can and VfD'ing when his creations are unsalvageable. This article is an example of that.</li>
<li>Non-notable. There are 300+ prefectures or equivalents in China, Bengbu being one of them. Bengbu itself is an unremarkable city in Anhui province. Its public security bureau is, in turn, one of dozens of bureaus in its bureaucracy. There is absolutely nothing sufficiently remarkable about it to warrant an article at this point in time. The same goes for the other 4 articles that were already deleted.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>As such, this article should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 02:46, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I saw Sarcelles Falun Gong pushing articles earlier. Should be deleted. It's not like its as notable as a primary school is it? Maybe it should be in mentioned or listified in some sort of Police Hierarchy in China article - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 02:59, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. nonnotable. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 03:01, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Should be merged into a bigger article until it needs breaking out, but none of the reasons given here for not even mentioning it is actually compelling. Number of entities is absolutely not a good criterion for deletion. There are how many species on this planet? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:08, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Where should this article be merged to? Which sentence of this article, except the last one, even provides unique and encyclopedic information? The police department of Bengbu is located in Bengbu, and is in charge of the polic there... and it has detention centers! The last sentence is unique and encyclopedic, but there's already an article on the dissident; we don't need a 2nd article just to say who detained him.</dd>
<dd>As such, there isn't even anything here to merge into any other articles. This article should be deleted outright. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 05:25, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Honestly there is little information other than the location and that it is a government office handling policing. Until I can see a better reason for keeping this article, my vote is unchanged. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">Abstrakt</a></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, since we can say something specific about this particular PSB. Anyone researching it would not appreciate being redirected to <a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhang_Lin_426c.html" title="Zhang Lin">Zhang Lin</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:42, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I could also say something about my neighbourhood police kiosk, how it arrested 2 students for drinking and driving... Notable? I think not. The chance of someone researching is, as much as the chance that someone would be researching the above-stated kiosk. --<a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html" title="User:Miborovsky">Mib</a><a href="../../../m/i/b/User_talk%7EMiborovsky_4d3c.html" title="User talk:Miborovsky">orovsky</a> <a href="../../../n/a/m/Image%7ENamechop.jpg_9903.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/4/40/Namechop.jpg/20px-Namechop.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../n/a/m/Image%7ENamechop.jpg_9903.html" /></a> 07:31, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think a prefecture branch of the PSB bears any comparison to a local police kiosk, nor does arresting an internationally known dissent compare with arresting students for drinking and driving. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Well how an internationally known athlete? How about I start an article on the police station whose officers arrested Micheal Phelps for drunk driving?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If you are an <b>expert</b> than feel free to give us tips on how to expand. Like <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html" title="User:Miborovsky">Mib</a> have already pointed out, there isn't anything else in this article to expand upon. And I'm opposed to the idea of merging this information into the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengbu.html" title="Bengbu">Bengbu</a> article because that would be doing what <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcelles_6733.html" title="User:Sarcelles">Sarcelles</a> once did, and that was making assinine edits on Chinese city article to make the main focus about prisons and police. <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">Abstrakt</a> 14:21, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i>Anyone researching it would not appreciate being redirected to <a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhang_Lin_426c.html" title="Zhang Lin">Zhang Lin</a>.</i> — Then this researcher would find out <i>absolutely no new info</i> about the Bengbu PSB from this article.</dd>
<dd>Look, if you guys want to start a WikiProject to describe every single bureau of every single prefecture and county in China (~50 x ~5000 = 250000 new articles), then please go ahead. If I can start, say, Hulan County Forestry Department or Haidong Prefecture Education Bureau, and write a useless subsubstub article that goes "The Haidong Prefecture Education Bureau is located in Haidong, <a href="../../../q/i/n/Qinghai.html" title="Qinghai">Qinghai</a>, and is in charge of education there. [end]", and get away with it, then please keep this article too. But until you decide to do that, this article should be deleted. Unless, of course, if you support Sarcelles' agenda of POV-pushing that he has engaged in for over four months. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 17:46, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, it's not. Thousands of songs have charted; that does not make them inherently notable for inclusion in an <b>encyclopedia</b> as spereate articles. Not even the All Music Guide does that. Besides, the record charted far below number forty: are you saying that every song by every artist that ever charted deserves an article for that reason and that reason alone? Such a suggestion would be highly irrational. The article is all of about four sentence, merge it in bulk to the article on the album and discuss the fact taht the album track charted there. I'm sure the album article isn't nearly long enough to prevent such an addition.--<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 03:30, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thousands of songs chart each day? Um, no they don't Freddy. The Billboard Hot 100 is only made out of 100 positions. Most of the songs that chart have been promoted.

<li>That isn't quite how I meant to word that, and I apoligize (and edited). Reworded, it makes sense.

<li><b>Keep</b> single. I also dislike the notion that a single must be a "hit" to get an article. A hit from whose viewpoint? For one thing, this song <i>was</i> fairly successful, and is from a major album by a major artist.

</li>
<li>I would say keep, except there's not enough there worth keeping (yet?). So <b>merge</b> unless/until a lot more information makes it worth it to have its own article. I do <i>not</i>, however, agree that being a single is not enough to establish notability. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 22:05, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are far too many singles for each one to be notable just because it is a single. What can be said about most songs other than providing catalogue information on release dates, chart performances, and recording studio anecdotes. A single, something that is inherently trivial in the grand scope of an encyclopedia, needs to have some sort of importance or impact other than its general existence and chart performance to warrant having its own article. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 01:00, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I can concede some of the arguments you list, but I still think a <i>charting</i> single would be notable because enough people noticed it for it to chart. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 03:18, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...but when an article on a song reads simply like a catalogue listing (name, release date, label, sales, chart performance) is there a reason for a seperate article? Even an article with an expanded version of this inforamton is arbitrary. Articles are required to establish notability; saying that every charting single should be listed is like saying every book that charted on the Amazon sales list needs an article as well. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 04:29, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...whole point of Wikipedia is to have others add stuff to it, to make it more than a catalogue, no? And... all encyclopedias are arbitrary. They often don't contain information I think is important. (They may include things you don't think are important, or not include things you think are important.) Physical ones are limited by paper. Wikipedia is not. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 18:36, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But Wikipedia articles should only be on notable sunjects. What makes this song more notable than your average song. Thousands of songs have reached the Top 100, and the very idea that they <i>all</i> deserve articles for that reason is absolutely ridiculous. This project is going to de-evolve into a fan-gushing vehicle with no semblance of credibility as a scholalry reference. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 20:55, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a notable track as it charted on the Hot 100. Even though you personally may not find it notable, many other people would. I think the fact that a song charted or was released makes it notable enough to have its own article. This is not just an article about some random track but one by a very popular group from one of the best selling albums of 2005 which received decent play at different radio formats and at clubs. The song was also featured in a very popular TV commercial. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">Musicpvm</a> 03:19, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Millions</i> (or atl east hundreds of thosuands) of songs have been charted and/or relased over the years in various countries. There needs to be more discernemnt than that. I dont nominate articles for deletion because I personally do not find them notable; I do it when I find articles that do not meet the Wikipedia standards for notability. The album's article is very short; a simple merge would make one article better instead of keeping two stubs around. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 03:44, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

There is no shortage of online journalism about this band. Also, besides your stating that the band no longer exists being factually incorrect, since when was that a criterion for deletion? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilhouetteSaloon_0286.html" title="User:SilhouetteSaloon">Stephen</a> 12:57, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As SilhouetteSaloon said they have been on a national tour of the country playing noted venues such as the London Astoria. They have released one album and three Eps on UNDERGROOVE records which is not a self run label it a MAJOR label currently holding contracts for bands such as Alexisonfire and Johnny Truant <a href="http://www.undergroove.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.undergroove.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.undergroove.co.uk</a>. As to point 4 "not Listed on All Music.com" All Music has a reasonably pathetic database of English rock music, providing little to no information on major bands such as Million Dead which are given nothing except the genre "Rock" and a picture of their first album. Further proof of their mainstream existance can be found in the fact that their album is available from Amazon.co.uk <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000E6RR5/qid%3D1128090115/202-4739900-3915855" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000E6RR5/qid%3D1128090115/202-4739900-3915855" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000E6RR5/qid%3D1128090115/202-4739900-3915855</a></li>
</ul>
<p>TO address your final point "The band has split up and no longer exists" the band are actually still in existance working to get their final album done (which also, by the way, invalidates Point 3 of your argument), the band are not necessarily splitting up but inner turmoil may lead to line-up changes and FURTHERMORE there are numerous bands who have split up on Wikipedia, yet that doesnt make it a valid reason for removing their Wikipedia page. Wikipedia is a resource for people to find information and there is little to no point in making unnecessary deletions such as deleting this when there are editorials on the make up of the turd the author took yesterday hovering around wikipedia. Your time is better spent being a busy body on the really unnecessary wikipedia pages.WFCO 15:35, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmmm.. no need to be unpleasant. Surely the point about the band splitting up is a fair one in as much as were the vote to be borderline, the fact that they had split up would probably tilt the vote against keeping the article. (Not by virtue of the fact that they had split up - as you rightly say, many bands have split up but are still included - but by virtue of the fact that in splitting up they would be unlikely to become more notable). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 13:42, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The first source given did not talk about a tour, it said they were playing gigs. This is not the same thing. The second one mentioned "a short 5-date tour" with 2 other bands, it's not clear who the headliner was. I'm thinking they don't meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but the apparent existance of a record makes me wonder. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:44, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Your differentiation between playing lots of gigs over a short period of time and and touring sounds to me like big business promotional rhetoric.

<dd>My comment was not intended that way at all. I'm an independant musician myself, and my band plays gigs, but we do not "tour". I'm all in favor of music being made outside of "big business". Unfortunately, I think the tone of this discussion has gotten unneccessarily combative. Remember, we all want to do what's right for Wikipedia. Sometimes we have different opinions. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:09, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm afraid I agree with Friday's interpretation of the 'tour' — it just wasn't, I'm afraid. Releasing EPs doesn't really make the grade unless they significantly chart, and WP:MUSIC wants two albums.

<li>This is the first article I have submitted to this resource and I apologize for the format of this article. This resource is a free educational module on the electronics industry. I thought is would be easier for a user to go directly to the information via the weblink and not post all the content explanation and additional resources in the article. If all the materials need to be included here, I will reformat the materials to accomplish this. I am also open to having the links added to a resource site. The object of the development of these materials is to have everyone that is in electronics using them when they are needed. Please advise me on what would be the best way to present this information and not have it look like spam or an advertizement. It was not intended to be offensive but only a new resource to be used. --Tom 15:25, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>This particular article seems to promote one particular course from this company. I would suggest an article on WorkReady Electronics (<a href="http://www.work-readyelectronics.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.work-readyelectronics.org/" rel="nofollow">website</a>), from which you got this information. You could describe the history and purpose of the company and some of the types of courses that they offer. The article must not sound like a promotion for the company, but a description of the company and its importance in the field of occupational education. If the company is at all notable or has an established reputation in occupational training, then the article would likely be worth keeping. ♠<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 01:25, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think that you all are misunderstanding the nature of my approach. The Alabama Ass Whuppin is necessarily a stereotypical concept that, at least to many, is not taken seriously.

I also know that the society is not as secret as they make out. <i>The Rock</i> is an actual place next to a public thoroughfare within the grounds of the college. This article, whilst possibly a vanity piece, does have some truth. Perhaps we should give them an opportunity to introduce some more facts and remove some of the more tenuous claims.

<li><b>Keep</b> I was surprised to come across mention of SUCKS here as I wasn't certain of the existence of the organisation, however mere mention of the society here has verified many specific details that I had already heard elsewhere in the past about the body. While not connected to Sydney University in any way (I am, in fact, based in the United States), I first heard mention of the organisation a few years ago in conversation with an Australian stockbroker in his sixties. What I can tell you is that the society certainly is real, as regular contact with this financier and some of his associates subsequently confirmed. These are reputable individuals who are discreet and well-respected, and it is erroneous to suggest they'd be making this all up (and I can't see them as the kind of folks who'd be authoring a piece on Wiki!!). That said, I'll concede that you are always going to have trouble verifying the existence of something that, at least to my knowledge, has not received media coverage and attempts to remain under the radar. The page would, however, be of interest to members as well as those curious of the existence of such societies so I believe there is merit in allowing the page to be saved from deletion as, especially given the subject matter, it is likely to receive more expansive and in depth additions once it has become available for broader viewing. That something like the Men In Black conspiracy theory which is equally unverifiable as an event of fact appears on Wiki (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_conspiracy_theory" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_conspiracy_theory" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_conspiracy_theory</a>) provides equal justification for inclusion of information about something also speculative, that being S.U.C.K.S. I suggest it is given time to flourish.</li>

<li>"mere mention of the society here has verified many specific details that I had already heard elsewhere" - Mere mention doesn't verify anything, and neither does hearsay, even from people who aren't "the kind of folks who'd be authoring a piece on Wiki" (whatever that means).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Bankers in their 60's are unlikely to be spending time on the net working on a piece about their secret society... and none of what was on the site read like something written by well-educated bankers (i.e it was riddled with spelling errors until I cleaned it up). If I'm to make a fair assumption that they haven't written this, then someone else presumably also knows about this society. I raised the appearance of this page with my Australian contact this evening and while he sounded a little perturbed about the existence of the information he offered that the best he could do would be to contribute a photo of one of the group's items of clothing bearing the society's logo for page verification. Might this serve to satisfy some of those eager for more proof of the body's existence?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per OmegaWikipedia. Theme from Mahogany is an independently notable song as witnessed by the huge number of cover versions over the years (including at least one that was made its own article, albeit AFD'd), and Diana Ross' version is the preeminent recording of this song. If the material in the article is too much a carbon copy of the movie article, then <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and rewrite it. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:04, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When it gets rewritten, it can be kept. I don't have any information o nteh record beyond basics, nor do I have the time to go out of my way to research it. And I've never heard of a single cover of the song notable enough for its own article. If someone can write an article with information that is not redundant with an article on the movie, then do so. However, as it stands now, the article should be redirected. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 21:26, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>Having grown up in "The Lake", I am very aware of a very distinct set of words used exclusively there. Whether this qualifies as a "language", a "dialect", an "ideolect" or just an interesting vocabulary is not for me to decide. I can only say that this might be linguistically interesting. I have found only few brief references online so far refering to it. For now, I vote to keep it.</p>

<li>That's not what the nominator said. The article's sources are websites <i>of dubious credibility</i>, and the article seems to be built up from a lot of first-person stories on the Web. The veracity of those primary sources cannot be verified by Wikipedia readers, who are thus required to take the article on faith. Wikipedia needs to report the results of other people who have studied otherkin; right now, this article collects the experiences of otherkin, which makes it original sociological research. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> notes that it is rare for an article to be built from primary sources alone, especially if it is a contested topic.

<li>The issue is not that deleting it will not send a message, but that it is not the appropriate way to send the desired message. It seems kind of agreed upon that otherkin is a real topic, just that there is the issue of getting proper sources and an article that reflects those sources. So wouldn’t deleting the article and putting up a warning to not recreate it be effectively hiding from the issue instead of trying to fix the issue itself? And if you intend to replace the article with something else, then I don’t see the point of deleting the article instead of normal editing. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomicDragon_d755.html" title="User:AtomicDragon">AtomicDragon</a> 00:32, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A sociological truth is one that we need a sociologist to declare before we can acknowledge it as a truth. =P You seem to be working so hard to make sure the Wikipedia-specific definitions are remembered you're forgetting the functions they were intended to serve; we follow the "no original research" policy not as an <i>end in itself</i>, but to keep Wikipedia free of crackpots and cranks who want Wikipedia to publicize their pet theories. To say that people are not credible sources for statements about <i>what their own beliefs are</i> and that we must wait until a "reputable publication" has covered them and then take that publication's word over the word of those they're reporting on just shows the hazards of taking any policy and following it too literally too long. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:35, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b> -- There are core facts that are easily verifiable here: a number of people consider themselves to be otherkin, the exact specifics of which change depending upon who you talk to. The only parts that are unverifiable are whether what these people claim to be true is actually true (though common sense should tell us otherwise). The fact that these claims are made is undeniable, well-documented, and widespread. I severely question the rationale in interpreting the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy in such an exaggerated way. If we keep things down to object facts and avoid the weirdness we get periodically where certain editors claim it's real, that certain otherkin are better than others, that they are psychic and reinarnated and have animal DNA and yada yada yada as if they were proven, then there is no problem. Documenting nutty fringe beliefs is quite verifiable, as this particular one is not so small that there's any problems involved on that end, assuming we can get past the people constantly inserting their own POV and making false claims that rewriting for NPOV is "disrespectful" shos "bad faith" and whatever other nonsense they come up with. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 20:12, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The main problem with the article (not just this version, but anything about the topic) is that it needs, perforce, to lump together a very broad spectrum of beliefs, ranging from simple alternate spirituality to pseudoscience to outright lunacy. So some of it is verifiable as much as anything in the realm of religion, spirituality, or philosophy; while other parts are very difficult to source reliably or at all.

<li>As for the content question of one subculture v multiple, that's a good, valid question. I'd be tempted to consider the spiritual side of the Otherkin movement to be a subset of modern shamanism. The problem with these kinds of content questions is, there has been no way to resolve them. With no proper sources, it's just up to editor's opinions. Thus, this article functions as a magnet for original research. We haven't even been able to resolve fundamental questions, such whether "Otherkin" is the proper blanket term for things like "Vampyres", "Dragons", "Elves", and "Therianthropes". When the Otherkin community has a variety of different definitions and beliefs, there's little hope of consensus on this article. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:36, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>By itself, the number of othrekin means little, but combine with their self-describing nature yields a lot of material written on the group from within. Many attempt to describe the group as a whole, noting various observations. To me, that seems to be the point most of the original research is being done, even though WP has to attempt to combine information from several such sources (doesn’t this happen, to some degree, for most subjects?). Looking at the bigger picture, in my opinion, an article on this would add to WP’s encyclopedic value, as many people do stumble upon it and can benefit by seeing a general overview of the subject that is confirmable at the basic level in various otherkin sources. The details are much harder to work out, and as MCB already mentioned, such a diverse group is very hard to talk about as a whole, but that is a matter of cleaning up and not deletion in my opinion. I may be misinterpreting policy though, so I’ll only comment instead of vote for now. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomicDragon_d755.html" title="User:AtomicDragon">AtomicDragon</a> 17:50, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

You're making shit up and wildly and purposefully exaggerating my statements so you can troll for defenses to your strawman arguements. Nice to meet you AtomicDragon, now stop trolling because I have no tolerance for trolls. I will not respond to your trollish statements again. <a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgriculture_50fc.html" title="User:Agriculture">Agriculture</a> 17:29, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>We have both made some exaggerations in the end as an attempt to illustrate a point. That worked out poorly, so it is at least a mistake on my part. Nonetheless, we will need to have some actual discussion to work this out, and simply not state that our own view on the situation is clearly the correct one.<a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomicDragon_d755.html" title="User:AtomicDragon">AtomicDragon</a> 17:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please remember <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a>, Agriculture, and stop making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. Neither your original argument nor your subsequent argument hold up. Your first argument was 'no reputable source will ever say "Yes, what Otherkin claim about themselves is true"; therefore, we must delete this article as unverifiable.' The enthymeme there is "all articles about Otherkin must describe their claims as truth, rather than as their claims." This is not the case. Your subsequent argument is that "POV pushers will always prevent the article from being maintained in an NPOV state." The number of articles that are actually worth deleting simply because we cannot come to agreement on them is minimal. Since you yourself have only edited <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> twice and one of those edits was simply to place three cleanup tags on it at once, I question whether you have sufficient knowledge of what happens when you <i>try</i> NPOVing the article to declare that it could never possibly work. By the way, speaking of verifiability, would you mind giving us details on the University of Minnesota study you refer to in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Otherkin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24031138" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Otherkin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24031138" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>? Since much of the discussion here has been made under the assumption that no professional study of those who believe themselves "otherkin" has been made, and since your edit (which I'm sure you marked 'minor' by accident) contradicts that, I'm sure providing details would be appreciated. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:38, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think an important distinction was made: scholarly treatment of Otherkin is NOT going to amount to a scientific effort to prove or disprove their beliefs. That would just be silly. Christianity (or any major religion) is obviously verifiable as a belief system without needing to prove or disprove their beliefs. FWIW, the closest thing I've seen to a scholarly treatment of this is over at <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_lycanthropy.html" title="Clinical lycanthropy">Clinical lycanthropy</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:32, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Stong Keep But Clean Up</b> For many, this is a spiritual path. No religion on the planet is independantly verifiable and yet there's nothing wrong with providing a basic set of information on what it's follower's believe. Writing a book on the subject doesn't make it true, it just makes it published. There are significant and serious sites which address the subject which act in the same manner of highlighting and defining the term. It doesn't matter if you share the belief or not. What wiki is supposed to be about is giving information on a variety of subjects. Why is otherkin not a valid subject to give information on? One need not share it's view to still acknowledge it is a valid viewpoint/belief/path for some people. It is, therefore, it should be discussed. You can't simply remove something because you don't believe it personally.</p>

<dd><b>Note:</b> I am the 13yr old author of this article. I would like to say that I am in no way affiliated with the band in question. They have no idea this artile was writen, so the accusation of "vanity" is not true. Thankyou.&#160;!Please Keep This Article!
<dl>
<dd>To the author: Please don't be offended in any way by the deletion nomination. This is not intended as a judgement on the band. I'm sure they're quite good. The problem is, Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, so many of us have high expectations of what goes in the main "article space". While many editors may be of the opinion that GO isn't "significant" enough to be included, there's actually an even bigger problem: Nothing in the article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. If you can show us that the music media is talking about this band, that would make them verifiable. If they're not yet to the point where they're getting that kind of coverage, there's really no way for them to go in an encyclopedia. WP does not allow what we call <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. That means your own experiences are not considered appropriate for inclusion. If you were to go review a show and interview the band for example, WP would not be an appropriate place to publish that work. I hope you understand, nobody's trying to say that the band (or your article) is bad. We're just saying WP isn't the right place for it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:08, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>From Author</b>:thankyou for the feedback. Would it count as a varification if their music was list as "1# most downloaded" on a music download site. I mentioned this fact in the article. I belive this is enough to varify them as a music influence to some degree. Also, the research was done from the bands website (2nd redirect in article).This proves this it was not, how you say, "original research" as i was not involved with the original research.
<dl>
<dd>Don't hold back on us, are they or aren't they #1 most downloaded on some notable site? I'm not sure if it would answer <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> requests, but being coquettish about it definitely doesn't help. Check out the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria and list any that GO matches, it will simplify matters. Until then:</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A Google search for '"The Hungry Man" "Oren Ginzburg"' comes up with <i><b>four</b></i> hits for this self-published book.

<li><b>Delete</b> I take a very inclusive line on books <i>so long as they are not self-published</i>. In part, this is because I have "psychic" relatives who regularly self-publish absurd predictions, so I am familiar with the range of kooks who will pay for the "honor" of disseminating ideas this way. Basically, if you self-publish (at least after 1950), I assume that your ideas were denied a label for a reason. The <b>four google hits</b>, in this instance, support my assumption. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 08:00, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

At <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the guideline for inclusion of athletes requires something like being outstanding, not just participating. There's no consensus about whether a routine professional player (as compared to an All-Star, All-Pro, league Most Valuable Player, etc.) should be kept.

<li>Wikisource has a repository of <i>noteworthy</i> source code, as I understand it, which can be used in Wikimedia projects to illustrate something important to that subject as a somewhat authoritative reference. I agree that an example of flood-fill code in such a common language is useful for an article on flood fill as a (minor) data processing technique. I don't think I agree that a bunch of mini-programs to count down "99 bottles of beer on the wall" in various programming languages provides any useful illustration of any important concept. (If comparison of simple looping structures were critical to an article, I'd change my mind.) But I see this as a collection of minutiae, related only by a trvial detail, that probably won't help Wikisource support WP or a related reference.

<p>Hi I'm the user that added the description of Kanly. I would just like to ask what additional information would be required from myself to prevent this from being deleted? and what time limit I have to make additions before deletion. Also the member/user who posted above me raised a copyright issue, I would just like to point out that the source I used is the same that has been used for the Dune Terminology page here on wikipedia which is also copied word for word from the Dune novel. Here is the link to the page I am reffering to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_terminology" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_terminology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_terminology</a> User:Garry_Johnston <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarry_Johnston_1741.html" title="User talk:Garry Johnston"><sup>(talk)</sup></a></p>

<dd>Eh, I meant "enough people will listen to change something", not that nobody noticed.&#160;;) One question for you, though: how is it harder/easier than with people, where the criterion is whether it has an <i>assertion</i> of notability? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 22:13, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough. We could impose that rule on coompanies. Except that most of even the spammiest company articles include statemetns that are at least arguably claims of notability. People become notabel through specific achievments, which arfe likely to be mentioned in any decent articel about an actually notable person. But companies are often notable as much for size and market presence as anything else, and IMO the presence or absnece of an assertion is noit a useful guide. The real question for a speedy criterion, IMO is "what obvious cahracteristic can we poitn to, that can be determined quickly by a single person, that will pretty much always identify an articel that ought to be deleted". If you think otherwise why not create Wikipedia:Proposal for speedy deletion of non-notable company articles or the like. i'll be happy to coem there and joint the discussion, and to call other people's attention to it. Look at the way the "Blatent copyvio" proposal was handled, and how it is going forward. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:23, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Because despite its being created in July 2003 (and so more than two years for growth already) and having had the gentle ministrations of no less than eleven editors, it still has only one more competition than what it began with. Its edits have been almost entirely housekeeping edits, and for all intents and purposes, its content has remained unchanged since the Decathlon was added. Even being placed on AfD, which is often a kiss of life for weak articles, seems to have done it no good. As it stands, it is out-and-out useless since both items it lists already have stand-alone articles. While I have nothing against the idea of a good article on the topic, this is not it, and at its present rate of growth, is not likely to become it. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 22:25, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Might be encyclopedic if a discussion on how different words come to have the same or simialr spellings, and the list was used asn an illustration, or even if some analysis if the included words and their sources was presnet. (Besides several of the entries are currently incorrect: for example "see" in the sense of the seat of a Bishop's authority is capitalized only when part of a specific proper name, when discussed in general it is not.) <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:35, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now I improved the intro. BTW, <i>Holy See</i> and similar are <b>not</b> proper names, as they can be precedeed by an uncapitalized article (i.e. "the Holy See"). Proper names are never precedeed by an article, unless the article is part of the name, in which case the article would be capitalized too. (E.g. <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Clockwork_Orange_0b0e.html" title="A Clockwork Orange">A Clockwork Orange</a></i> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cure_83a6.html" title="The Cure">The Cure</a>.) --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 17:51, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>:Yes, this page wouldn't normally be in an encyclopedia (apart from it being a list), but I feel that it has been on this website long enough that it still deserves a place <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">here (just to let you know where here is)</a>. Also, if you delete this list, all the other song lists are going to get deleted too. I don't think that should happen not only because I think they're interesting, but also because someone might need them for something.

<p><b>Move:</b> I've noticed these pages popping up too and I found out where they're comming from. These articles all talk about a particular campsite at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philmont_Scout_Ranch_d3bb.html" title="Philmont Scout Ranch">Philmont Scout Ranch</a> in New Mexico. The reason why they are all popping up is that the Philmont article has a link created for each campsite. It seems to me that these articles are notable for anyone looking at the Philmont page, but are not very notable to Wikipedia as a whole. I proposed in the discussion page that these articles be moved into subpages under the main Philmont article (<i>If you want to debate this issue, go to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Talk%7EPhilmont_Scout_Ranch_f94b.html" title="Talk:Philmont Scout Ranch">discussion page</a></i>).
