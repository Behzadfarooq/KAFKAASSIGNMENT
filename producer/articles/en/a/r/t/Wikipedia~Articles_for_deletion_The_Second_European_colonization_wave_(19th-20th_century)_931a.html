<li><b>Comment</b>. I am not disagreeing with forks. I am disagreeing with <b>these particular forks that you have created</b>, for the following reasons: (a) a "wave" that lasted a whole century? (b) during the middle of this "wave of colonization" (post WW2) virtually every single colony went in completely the opposite direction and gained its independence from Europe? (c) this "wave" suddenly stopped... when... on December 31st 1999? (d) how is anyone ever going to stumble across this article unless as a link from another article? (e) where did this title and chronological division come from - you? if so, it's original research. If anything a new article should be created, "History of Colonialism", not these. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 11:47, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The second phase of modern European colonization, that associated with European industrialization, ended in the mid-to-late 20th century. It began, arguably, for the British, in the late 18th century or perhaps with the Napoleonic Wars, before the first phase ended everywhere (e.g. Latin American revolution). For the French 1830s-1850s; Germans and Belgians late 19th c. So what? (Hey, is this a rolling <i>wave</i>? Just a thought... though I would prefer a different title.) The fact that in the early 20th century some societies were highly industrialized while others were essentially peasant societies <i>at the same time in different parts of the world</i> doesn't mean both things weren't true or that it is wrong to speak of the industrial era in places where that obtained even if for other places it didn't yet. A few colonies still exist. More importantly, in many ways the peak of European colonial engagement in Africa came after decolonization of India, Malaysia and Indonesia. Trotsky called it "combined and uneven development" and you don't have to like his politics to see that it's a pretty good way to describe history on the global scale.

<li>Gsd, you are now arguing that there's nothing wrong with creating sub-articles, but just with the title of these articles. First, clearly there is no reason to think a century stopposed on December 31st, 1999. Most historians date the beginning of the 20th century with the First World War, in 1914. Clearly dates are <i>always</i> debatable. In fact, the whole principle a cutting a period in two is debatable, and is probably one of the main characteristics of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernity.html" title="Modernity">Modernity</a>. I just thought it was a more or less convenient way to break the Colonialism article in two sections (and you have never argued in the Colonialism page that dividing it according to these two <i>broad</i> distinctions was illegitimate). Second, if your issue is with the title, then you should ask for the page to be moved to a better name, and not ask for deletion. If you rather name the article "History of colonialism from the 15th century to the 19th century", IMO it doesn't make any big difference. I have to add that I disagree with your proposal to remain only with "concrete articles": as if Colonialism from 15th century to the 19th century wasn't concrete. And I think an article dealing with colonialism should deal with this subject as at least an European matter, and not according to national lines. Although the British &amp; the French colonization are not the same (and you've deleted all content in the Colonialism article addressing these distinctions), clearly both belongs to a common historical phenomenon. It is not the <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khoikhoi.html" title="Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> who colonized Berlin! <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 14:59, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
