<p>The mission of the <i>Binary Research Institute</i> is dissemination of the theory that the Sun has got a companion star. The outfit has a <a href="http://www.binaryresearchinstitute.org" class="external text" title="http://www.binaryresearchinstitute.org" rel="nofollow">website</a>, which is rather well done, but doesn't seem to have a presence in the physical world. (At least I couldn't find any). The theory that the Sun has a companion star does exist, but as the pages at the Institute never mention the existing research they are run-of-the-mill crackpots.</p>
<p>Please consider in this context Walter Cruttenden as the founder of the institute, whose page is also up for deletion. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 00:07, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are not concerned with the <i>veracity</i> of the theory, merely with its <i>importance</i>.

<dd><i>"The ground-breaking and richly illustrated new book, Lost Star of Myth and Time, marries modern astronomical theory with ancient star lore to make a compelling case for the profound influence on our planet of a companion star to the sun."</i> is how the review starts. This is hardly a review, it reads like advertisement copy, and on the PBS website there is no trace of the Cruttenden-sponsored documentary "The Great Year" that is mentioned in the text. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 11:52, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The point is they didn't <i>ignore</i> the institute and the book they published. So why should we ignore them? Don't mistake me, I think the theory is bull, but you wanted a mention, and there's one, no matter how lousy. <a href="../../../o/s/w/User%7EOswax_0a10.html" title="User:Oswax">Oswax</a> 13:39, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

It looks as if the folks at the Institute sent out press releases to everyone and their dog, and some websites did put them up. Giving space to someone's advertising material is different from reviewing a theory. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 16:00, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough. Do we have an article on this binary star system theory, however basic (just saying: <i>this psuedoscience theory is x y z</i>)?

<li><b>Keep</b>, it is currently only a stub. How can the article be developed if it is attacked and shot down as soon as the stub went up. It takes <b>time</b> to attract interested contributors.

<dl>
<dd>If he financed it himself, then it would seem <i>exactly</i> like vanity press to me. Publication through normal channels proves that the author of the work <i>was able to convince others</i> to put <i>their</i> money where the <i>author's</i> mouth is.

<dd>'I do not know if he financed the entire thing himself, or what part of it he did. A more accurate description might be that it was financed through his institute I guess. I have no idea how much came from where. It is obvious that getting knowledge of this theory out into the public is an uphill battle (that might be an understatement), but the theory itself has the <b>potential</b> to alter the beliefs of many millions of people (the entire population of the planet) if it were to be proven true. Like I said before, research is in its infancy, and faces heavy attack from the scientific establishment. Witness what has happened here, within a few minutes of the stub appearing it was marked for deletion. That is the kind of uphill battle Mr. Cruttenden, the Institute, and the theory face. But the potential for it to affect the lives of every human being is there. <i>IP 65.9.158.81</i>

<li><b>Comment</b> Some who have voted keep here and at the Cruttenden vote are basing their votes on the existance of the DVD narrated by James Earl Jones. It should be re-stated that no-one knows for sure if the thing has even aired on PBS, which throws into doubt it's notability, and thus the notability of both related articles. In all seriousness, these need to go. --Jeffrey O. Gustafson - <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_Contributions_507d.html" title="User:Jeffrey O.

<li>If it actually aired, it should not be hard to verify this.

<li><b>Comment</b> <b>Did it air on PBS or not?</b> This is important to me, at least, in assessing whether we should have an article on it. If it did, it should be easy to provide verifiable evidence, and I hope some supporters will do so. For my part, I note that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000YHVMG/qid=1127737821/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-6667406-3192662?v=glance&amp;s=dvd&amp;n=507846" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000YHVMG/qid=1127737821/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-6667406-3192662?v=glance&amp;s=dvd&amp;n=507846" rel="nofollow">the Amazon listing</a> makes no such claim (nor do any reader reviews). It is trivially easy to self-publish books and get them listed on Amazon; I don't know if this is true of DVDs. Search for "Cruttenden" at www.pbs.org yields six hits, <i>none referring to this film.</i> ("Abigail Cruttenden is a British television and film actress...") Search for "Great Year" at www.pbs.org yields 46 hits, non referring to the film. Search for "James Earl Jones" returns 40 hits, none referring to the film. DID IT AIR? IF SO, WHEN AND ON WHAT STATIONS? If someone will provide this information I think it could be verified quickly. I can't find anything at <a href="http://www.thegreatyear.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.thegreatyear.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thegreatyear.com/</a> suggesting that it ever aired. If it aired <i>on the PBS network</i> I would change my vote. If it aired on a single PBS affiliate station, I would want to email them and find out more about the circumstances. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:45, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, those opposing these articles should have the ability to simply type: Walter Cruttenden in Google to come up with many sites relating to the man and his research along with the PBS broadcast. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out this is a factual and notable person who has already been discussed throughout: [<a href="http://www.thegreatyear.com/thegreatyear/" class="external text" title="http://www.thegreatyear.com/thegreatyear/" rel="nofollow">The Great Year</a>] <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 10:38, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is the discussion about the institute. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Walter_Cruttenden_a192.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Walter Cruttenden">man</a>, the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Binary_model_of_equinox_precession_05f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Binary model of equinox precession">theory</a> and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Great_Year_%28film%29_0c95.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Great Year (film)">movie</a> have each their own discussion. As far as the "Binary Research Institute" goes, it has 300 Google hits, 97 of which are unique. A bunch of these are speaking engagements on the esoteric circuit, the rest are copies of the press release on the movie and Wikipedia entries. There is no indication that the institute or the theory ever hit the mainstream. A Google search for '"The Great Year" Cruttenden' returns 48 unique hits; again many of these are copies of the press release. The movie is self-produced; there is no inducation that Cruttenden managed to find an investor. No indication is given anywhere that it was shown on PBS or anywhere outside the esoteric circuit. Walter Cruttenden himself heads an investment firm with a <a href="http://cruttendenpartners.com/team/team-walter.shtml" class="external text" title="http://cruttendenpartners.com/team/team-walter.shtml" rel="nofollow">staff of three</a>. Cruttenden exists, sure, but he has done nothing but finance a movie and set up a website. Even fervent inclusionists usually draw the line at personal vanity and self-promotion. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:10, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It hardly seems like a vanity page and does not fall into what appears to be the category of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - you can find further relevance to this article by seeking out the official site of the [<a href="http://www.binaryresearchinstitute.org" class="external text" title="http://www.binaryresearchinstitute.org" rel="nofollow">Binary Research Institute</a>] and checking the link for Board of Advisors, the names placed are of notable people which can also be Googled, this is a relevant Institute which has been around since 2001. Even fervent deletionists can't come up with a good enough excuse for deletion, until you can prove to me this is purely for vanity purposes than I rest on the case that it is a relevant encyclopedic article that ascribes to an Institute founded by a notable individual as can be seen from the notable and reputable background and coverage on the Net. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 13:29, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>This discussion is about the <i>institute</i>. It was founded four years ago, and if it had made any impact it would by now clock up more than 100 hits on Google. Again, the discussion is not about the qualification of the members, it's about what the organization has achieved. If they haven't done anything except self-publish a movie and a book they ought to go. (I guess I'm applying a standard similar to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.) <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 14:16, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>If this discussion is about the article about the Binary Reasearch Institute, then I would suggest it be kept - i've read it's less than 10 lines several times, and found it not objectionable at all, nor it falls into any category of non NPOV - it's merely a stub about what IS this institute, nothing else. If the pseudoscientific theory they're trying to promote shouldn't be here according to wikipedia (original research) then well, that's another thing - the article about that theory should be deleted. The same about article on Walter Cruttenden himself and the film "The Great Year". Registered at least, hope this helps (BattleTroll)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable crackpot institution. If it is kept I will say that the article shows remarkable restraint for a crackpottery-related topic and sticks to neutral and verifiable (or practically verifiable) statements. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 08:29, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, this is obviously a <i>bad faith</i> nomination. The delitionist attitudes here are unbelieveably oppressive. The rabid, visceral comments reek of hidden (or not so hidden) agenda and ulterior motives. Why are they are trying <i>so hard</i> to silence and suppress. It's suspicious. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthian_7789.html" title="User:Earthian">Earthian</a> 16:07, 27 September 2005 (UTC) <small>User registered on September 27 and made contributions only to this and related AfDs. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Earthian_5eec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Earthian">Special:Contributions/Earthian</a></small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, thank you Pilatus for proving my point. I couldn't have done it better myself. The rabidness with which you are going about this, and the fact that now you are stalking me and adding "special comments" to my contributions here further proves that these three nominations were in <b>BAD FAITH</b>. You proved it better than I or anyone else could. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthian_7789.html" title="User:Earthian">Earthian</a> 17:46, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If your edits are only to this and related VfDs Pilatus has every right to point that out. <i>Roughly,</i> 100 diverse edits prove an editor stopping by a VfD is "disinterested" rather than pushing their own cruft or creations. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 18:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Conflict of Interest - Question</b>: should the person who nominates articles for deletion also be making changes to those articles? In this case, <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Pilatus</a> has nominated these three articles for deletion - Walter Cruttenden, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_Research_Institute_cb5f.html" title="Binary Research Institute">Binary Research Institute</a>, and The Great Year - and has made extensive changes to them. In most of his changes he leaves behind typos and grammatical errors, broken links, and straggling headers (i.e., after he's removed everything that was under a header), not only messing up other users' work but leaving the article in much poorer shape than it was before. He also deletes extensively, and removes categories and stubs aggressively. He goes in after anyone adds anything to an article and removes everything the other person contributed. He seems to be working to <i>increase the chances for deletion</i> of the articles. In light of this, it would be appropriate, in order to avoid this obvious <b>conflict of interest</b>, for the person who nominated the articles to refrain from modifying them until the decision has been made? <a href="../../../s/y/u/User%7ESyug_2b31.html" title="User:Syug">Syug</a> 21:06, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Most articles up for deletion are not judged upon the quality or quantity or their content, but rather the appropriateness or notability of the topic. Any edits that Pilatus may have made to the content of the article are irrelevant, for he cannot make a worthy topic unworthy by bad grammar or misspellings. <a href="../../../o/s/w/User%7EOswax_0a10.html" title="User:Oswax">Oswax</a> 21:47, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>AfDs are closed by an admin who was not involved in the debate to prevent conflicts of interest. The offer still stands: instead of complaining feel free to add content to improve the article. Also note that there is broad consensus for my edits. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/y/u/User%7ESyug_2b31.html" title="User:Syug">Syug</a>, your comments are vague and general. We're talking about one particular article here. I infer that you think Pilatus has intentionally damaged the article in order to influence voting. Which are the specific edits where you think he's done this? I looked at one case of an editor "(correcting more Pilatus syntax errors)" and it didn't look to me like anything that would affect voting. Your own edits, which he removed, didn't seem like anything that would have led people to vote "keep" had they been left in. Nor do I see any evidence in the discussion that anyone is complaining about typos or grammatical errors or using them as a reason for deletion. If you think that Pilatus has been deliberately damaging the article in order to influence people to vote for deletion, you really should open a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> on this. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 16:25, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is exactly zero primary evidence for Cruttenden's notions about the Sun being part of a binary system.
