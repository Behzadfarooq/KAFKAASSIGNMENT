<li><b>Strong keep</b> Wikipedia is not a Gen Tree means that we should not make trees of non-notable people, having non-notable relatives. That is an extension of WP:NOT indiscriminate info. However, this does not included royalties, since almost all people in royalty houses are notable. This would not include single notable people with lots of NN relatives, but as said, being notable and having lots of notable people does merit a gen tree on WikiPedia. Just look att <a href="../../../f/a/m/Category%7EFamily_trees_5107.html" title="Category:Family trees">Category:Family trees</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_family_trees.html" title="List of family trees">List of family trees</a>. Now, with this said, the family of Umar is about as notable as you get in Sunni Islam. He is a <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashidun.html" title="Rashidun">Rashidun</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a>, all his same-timed relatives are also <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a> and his daughter is a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_of_the_Believers_d3a2.html" title="Mother of the Believers">Mother of the Believers</a>. His son is also an important <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a>, and his grandsons are <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salaf.html" title="Salaf">Salaf</a>. Also, his genealogy back is relevant, Muslim biographies often include this to show distance relationship with Muhammad. Sunni Muslim are proud to carry the name even today. He had also several wives. This information is notable and accurate, having Gen Trees in WikiPedia is established in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_family_trees.html" title="List of family trees">List of family trees</a>, and there is no one disputing the notability of Umar's family. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 11:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Btw, take a look at the systematic bias in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_family_trees.html" title="List of family trees">List of family trees</a>, only that is an argument for keeping this article. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 11:35, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> article lacks any context. Who is this Umar guy, what makes him important, and why does it matter what his family tree was? From the links, it <i>appears</i> to be about this <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a>, <s>in which case it would be notable just like <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_monarchs%27_family_tree.html" title="British monarchs' family tree">British monarchs' family tree</a></s>. On closer inspection, it seems that his successor was elected, rather than succeeding him through relation like the Windsors, so I don't see the relevance of this article, unless Islam places some special significance on family trees/genealogy? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 11:42, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, he was elected, but its not like "Bush vs Kerry" elected, Umar was connected to Muhammad via marriage, and so was the two "finalists" in the election after him. family played an important role back then. It is not relevant to Umar, but all Shi'a twelver imams are connected via blood.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 12:48, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> after reading Striver's comment, requesting that he transcribe his argument for notability into the article to establish context. (I know what-about arguments are frowned upon in AfDs, but if we can have SpongeBob SquarePants Family Trees then Umar deserves his family tree included too.) <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 11:48, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Genealogies of national-level monarchs (in this case, an Islamic caliph) are notable enough. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 14:51, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>The references are to a blog or website and to other Wikipedia articles. Reliable and verifiable sources should be available if he is a companion of Mohammed. Also Wikipedia is not a genealogy site, so each individual listed would need reliable and verifiable sources. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 00:12, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Rarely should we keep a family tree, but this appears to be one of the exceptions. The man the tree revolves around was the second <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">caliph</a> which is about as important as anyone in Islam can be. The other individuals on the tree lived either at the time or immediately following <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and some to be important, despite the fact that the articles are stubs. The Article should be a bit more fleshed out, describe the importance of the family, but the notability is there. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 09:39, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
