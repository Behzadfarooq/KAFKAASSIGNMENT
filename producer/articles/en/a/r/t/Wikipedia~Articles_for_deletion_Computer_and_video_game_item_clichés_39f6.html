<li><b>Delete</b> Almost the entire thing is opinion, and many of these aren't cliches.

<li>Kind of like "A peer-reviewed journal may state a scientific foundations of new theory are solid in light of our current knowledge, but that doesn't make it <i>factual,</i>" right? =) If a couple of journalists from different mags get the bright idea to bash out an article that goes "X,Y, and Z are beginning to sound like cliches", and happen to agree on those, I'm betting that's a reasonable fact to be included to <i>any</i> article on the subject.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Touche. But I for one don't think it wise to compare a gaming magazine (that tends to give bonus points for buying ad-space) to a scientific journal. Don't get me wrong, I think this COULD work. I just don't think this is how it should be done. This is a lot like looking at an Easter Eggs topic on GameFAQs. They list a lot of stuff, but most of those aren't easter eggs. The same is true here. The crate one for example is a known cliche. But most of the ones here are either gaming traditions/conventions, or just a case of saving resources (not showing every single item on the character), or just good gameplay (not having to make sure that the inseam is right for your platemail). However, I really don't see the current creators of this page cleaning it up (just judging by the listing of "cliches" in the discussion page. And just a quick bit of info on the last attempt to delete this, I really don't think that is a good example of why it should be saved. Look at it, most of it is just "This is really cool, keep it." <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGundato_bcdb.html" title="User:Gundato">Gundato</a> 01:41, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per previous AfDs. In my vehement opinion, this article <i>can</i> be made to work in a proper fashion. AfD is <i>not</i> cleanup. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 17:04, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If this article must be deleted then all clichés-related lists on Wikipedia must be AFD'd too, e.g. list of animation clichés, list of comic book clichés, <a href="../../../o/n/-/On-screen_clich%C3%A9s.html" title="On-screen clichés">on-screen clichés</a>, and so on. It should also be noted that both policies quoted by <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy">TBC</a> are closely related, and given that the list has survived a previous AFD by nearly 100% of support, I would say that <b>keeping</b> the article seems the right option. Comments about the encyclopedic nature of the list are irrelevant since many clichés-related articles exist, but nevertheless, since when <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">deletion processes</a> are a substitution to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">cleanup</a>? —<font face="Lucida Blackletter"><font color="black"><a href="../../../c/o/a/User%7ECoat_of_Arms_845f.html" title="User:Coat of Arms">Coat of Arms</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../c/o/a/User_talk%7ECoat_of_Arms_3905.html" title="User talk:Coat of Arms">talk</a>)</small></font></font> 02:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Note that this nomination is not on a <i>general</i> list on clichés (like the ones you've mentioned above), but one concentrating on <i>items</i>. Also, the AfD you cited that recieved a lot of support votes is a nomination on Computer and video game clichés, not Computer and video game <i>item</i> clichés. As for the two policies I've cited, though they may be related, they are still <i>policies</i> and therefor considered a standard that all users should follow.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 02:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Lol, actually they're more than "standards", and of course all users should follow them. But you didn't answer my question, dude. The two policies you quoted are <i>not</i> a reason for an article's deletion; in fact, the list can be easily improved by including <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">footnotes</a> and removing <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> material.

<li>You're mistaking <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">cleanup</a> for a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">violation of official policies</a>; the article certainly needs some work, but <i>that</i> is not a reason for deleting it. Got it? Also, according to Wikipedia a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">cliché</a> is "a phrase, expression, or idea that has been overused to the point of losing its intended force or novelty", a definition that clearly applies to the majority of the information here, e.g. "long metal bars or simply crowbars are common in point-and-click adventure games in order to break and open things" or "in many first-person shooters and the occasional RTS, exploding barrels are frequently seen". By the way, note that your comment didn't show out properly.

<li>First of all, most of the items mentioned in the article logically appear in the video games due to their setting. For example, toilets would logically appear in an FPS involving humans since humans <i>use toilets</i>, and a crowbar would logically appear in games involving "breaking and opening things" since crowbars <i>are</i> used in real life for breaking and opening things. As for cleaning up the article, as Wickthework mentioned below, since so much of the content is original research, removing it would leave the article too short to merit either an article or a stub--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 04:43, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Crowbar, I can give you, but the Toilet section refers to the <i>promient</i> use of toilets for humor or grossness factors. And those two don't discount the Piece of String, the use of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_satchel.html" title="Magic satchel">Magic satchels</a>, the <i>over</i>use of crates, Instant-use Medipacks(And the Turkey Leg of Healing found in the trash), One-Size-Fits-All armor, and the ever-popular Exploding Barrel. Sure, we can toss the crowbar section, and maybe cut the toilets one down to size, but those two don't necessitate the removal of the <i>entire</i> article. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESAMAS_7b35.html" title="User:SAMAS">SAMAS</a> 04:48, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just going over them,. the crate one is still arguable (but probably deserves its own page since, let's face it, it is an icon of gaming). String and rope, when used in puzzles, almost always are used for their intended purpose. Just being used a lot doesn't a cliche make. Would you rather they use chain? Wire? Two pick-axes? Metal-bars? Arguable as a weapon, but not so much a prying object. That IS why crowbars exist. The toilet one is just pathetic. Barrels, yeah that is funny (and probably a cliche at this point). The last three are more gameplay or engine limitations than not. So then, all that is left are two of the entries. <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGundato_bcdb.html" title="User:Gundato">Gundato</a> 11:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This needs some clean-up, but has a decent foundation fo references. There's no sense throwing the whole article away because not every point in comes from one of said references.

<li><b>Commment</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Any article can be cleaned up. The question is, what will be left afterwards? And will it still be purely opinion? In this case, there are only two that are widely accepted as cliche, and even those can't be backed up by anything better than gaming magazines (many of which do whatever it takes to cater to those who buy adspace). <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGundato_bcdb.html" title="User:Gundato">Gundato</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not OR due to sources being present.
