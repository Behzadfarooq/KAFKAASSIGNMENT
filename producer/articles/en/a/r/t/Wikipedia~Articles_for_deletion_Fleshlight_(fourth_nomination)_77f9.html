<li>My first instinct was overwhelmingly to let it stay, but after reading the above DRV and taking other things into consideration, i'm now saying <b>Delete</b>.

As referenced above <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_vagina.html" title="Artificial vagina">Artificial vagina</a> covers the type of device and (correct me if i'm wrong) i thought that Fleshlight was just a brand name of such, in a Hoover/Vacuum Cleaner-type way. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnebravemonkey_d240.html" title="User:Onebravemonkey">OBM</a> | <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOnebravemonkey_e8bf.html" title="User talk:Onebravemonkey"><sup><i>blah blah blah</i></sup></a> 16:10, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a pointless debate. The consensus of the DRV was that Afd should debate this. Afd is about deciding on whether an article falls within the guidelines of notability etc. As I understand it, if there are legal or other issues, this forum is not the place for discussing or deciding them. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 16:45, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not exactly. AfD is about determining if an article satifying all the critera for an acceptable article could be written — notability is only one of the criteria. If it is determined that an acceptable article could not be created, even if partially for legal reasons, a delete is in order. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:05, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thats a Merge/Delete vote as far as I can tell.

<li>Since when have we started being traditional? After voting three other times for delete, it seems like a waste of time to say it again. Notable is not the only criteria. If we list every notable commercial product, and each one pursues commercializing as much as this article did before it was deleted, and tries to block other competing products, as the editor of this one did, we would be spammed to death. Look how much time we've wasted on it already. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 12:31, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree - in an ideal world, things wouldn't keep getting renominated over and over for deletion, so you would only have to present a delete argument once. But at least you could have said "delete per my arguments at the last AfD." Believe me, those of us voting keep are as frustrated by the multiple nominations as the delete voters are at failing to have the article deleted. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 00:15, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per previous AfD results. This is obviously a useful product that has been mentioned in the press and should be covered here.

<li><b>Keep or merge</b>. Notable enough that I've heard of it through press reports, although I can't give you a cite from memory. However, I wouldn't object to a <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_vagina.html" title="Artificial vagina">artificial vagina</a>, of which it is probably the best-known example. Oh, and regarding the vibrator, a Google News search for "<a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit_vibrator.html" title="Rabbit vibrator">rabbit vibrator</a>" gives 14 hits, has featured in <i>Sex and the City</i>, and it now has a feature film, <i>Rabbit Fever</i> <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1877763,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1877763,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> named after it: definitely a notable phenomenon. -- 80.168.224.225 14:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Meets WP:V, WP:WEB, and is very notable. If you think it is an advertisement I suggest you change it. It is a well advertised, well known, well BRANDED sex toy, it probably has some of the greatest brand recognition of any sex toy out there. The article needs serious work but based on a quick survey of what is on Wikipedia, I think this article is more important than the thousands of articles on homebrew sonic the hedgehog fan-fic video games thus should stay and should be fixed. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 04:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability is something established by commentary in multiple non-trivial reliable sources.

<dd>The Montreal Mirror article doesn't count, IMO, because the reference purports to come from a "survey", and we don't know what the "survey" contained. For all we know, the "survey" may have mentioned the Fleshlight, in which case all we could say is that one columnist, in an unedited (or edited only for libel) article, thought it was notable the first time. However, <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a> has done a better job of adding references. (Why he didn't do this before is a still a good question.) If they pan out, and are "articles" rather than "columns", it becomes a (marginal) Keep. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 15:38, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
