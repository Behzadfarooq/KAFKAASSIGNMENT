<p>This has previously been debated for deletion a couple of times and kept (see <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETime_Cube_Delete_5231.html" title="Talk:Time Cube/Delete">Talk:Time Cube/Delete</a>), but I would like to revisit it, not least in the light of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aetherometry_%28second_nomination%29_349e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aetherometry (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aetherometry (second nomination)</a>. What we have here is presented as a scientific theory, which it clearly is not. No scientific theory can possibly claim as immutable fact that pi=3.20. Because it is so patently absurd it has not been discussed in any reputable peer-reviewed journals, which makes it pretty close to impossible to balance the absurdity without venturing into <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. There is no doubt that the idea has a certain degree of notability, but the theory itself is simply unsupported by any credible peer-reviewed evidence, so is fundamentally unverifiable. What we <i>can</i> verify is that <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Ray_871d.html" title="Gene Ray">Gene Ray</a> expounds this twaddle, and we can and should document it at Gene Ray, but not here.</p>
<p>Obviously redirection is an editorial action which requires no Super Powers<sup>TM</sup>, but I don't want to just do that, I want to stimulate a proper debate on the issue and hopefully achieve a consensus view that this <i>subject</i> is one we cannot cover separately, which would ensure that we don't have to have the same debate again in a month form now. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 13:49, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The question here really is, it a theory that nearly every legitimate researcher and academic discounts to the point of virtually ignoring it notable as a theory? How about as a meme if the theory has been roundly parodied and ridiculed? No opinion yet, but if this was just about the website I would say the article is eminently more deletable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> than if it is considered as the theory being a meme.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:57, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, exactly. It's almost impossible to work out fomr the article exactly <i>what</i> we're claiming it is, or its claim to notability might therefore be. A redirect to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Ray_871d.html" title="Gene Ray">Gene Ray</a> would at lest have the virtue of making it unambiguously clear that this is about one man's absurd theory and the ridicule (and flying-spaghetti-monster stylee popularity) it has attracted. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 15:42, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> well to that I would say it is not deserving of an article unless there are enough notable sources to establish it as a well known <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">crackpot theory</a>. I'm less concerned with if it is factual or not and more concerned with if it is notable.

<li><s><b>Probable keep</b></s> We don't delete articles about theories just because they're <i>wrong</i>, or even because they're too incoherent to figure out what the theory even is. If this, for lack of a better word, idea, has a following, and is discussed apart from the person of Gene Ray, than it's plausible to have an article about it. (I don't really know whether it <i>does</i> have a following, which is why I said "probable".) --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 15:10, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The vast majority of the article constitutes original research, and as such does not meet Wikipedia standards. What little content exists that doesn't amount to original research can be included in the article (or a section of the article) about Gene Ray. -- <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoondigger_c9bb.html" title="User:Moondigger">Moondigger</a> 15:22, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I agree with Trovatore's arguments, except that I see little evidence of a following. As a website, it doesn't seem to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. As for the argument that it's presented at universities: this was following an invitation of students, and I quite see university students invite some weird guy for all sorts of reasons (to brag about it, to practise debating, for entertainment). -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 15:46, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Subject is notable on the net, although no one has really written anything serious about it which makes the article imposible to comply with WP policies.Tranqulizer 17:06, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I will admit my reason for voting keep has more to do with my own interest in the subject than any objective atempt to follow WP policies. I agree with the delete camp's argument that if policies are to be followed strictly the article should be deleted. However I urge people to consider the amount of work that has gone into the current version of the article and that it has survived AFD before. I hope a consensus can be reached.Tranqulizer 18:10, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The amount of work that has gone into this article isn't really something that justifies its existance. I've seen some wonderful pieces of original research that obviously took the author(s) a considerable amount of time to create. It's a shame to have to delete something that people spent a considerable amount of time on, but if an article does not (and cannot) meet relevant policies and guidelines then it has no place here no matter how much work went into it.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:52, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>They're not policies, by the way; they're guidelines. We can decide to keep it even if it doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 21:35, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was speaking in a general sense about policies and guidelines; point being that time spent on an article isn't a reason to keep it. Of course guidelines can be ignored but personally I need to see a compelling reason why a subject should be given a pass on the relevant guideline (i.e. how does it benefit the Wikipedia project to ignore the guideline and retain a specific article).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 00:34, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No vote</b>. I wrote my "probable keep" above before going to the website. As far as I can tell, there's no theory at all, not even an obviously false or obviously meaningless one. That is, there is no exposition, no argument, no explanation, just a stream of apparently disconnected one-liners. The article gives the impression that there's a collection of unifying ideas that connect things together, but if there is, it doesn't seem to be on the first page of the website; it seems that the authors of the WP article must have done a bit more synthesis than is really permitted, unless there's another source somewhere. That said, if it's a notable phenomenon it should be kept. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:12, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete/redirect to Gene Ray (possible very cut down merge)</b> When I was at MIT, some people invited [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ray#Developments" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ray#Developments" rel="nofollow">Gene Ray to give a lecture on his "Time Cube" idea</a>]. I hadn't really heard of it before but some people I knew were going and said it would be funny, so I went along out of curiousity. The whole event was basically Gene talking about his ideas and a crowded auditorium of MIT students (and a few profs) laughing at him and asking him smartass obviously mocking questions for 50 mins. Gene just didn't seem to be aware at all that people were laughing at him and treating him as a freakshow event (I mean, he was invited by MIT students who fully intended in advance that he would be an object of derision). This was not a high point in MIT culture. The whole thing event made me uncomfortable. Schizophrenia is a very broad, vague, contested and perhaps not so useful term but Gene clearly had some problems in that general area. (and his "unique" website style is not so unique. There are other sites on the web where people with apparently similar problems post totally incoherent rants/conspiracy theories/crank ideas in a similar strange website format style... it seems to be something of a symptom.). My problem with this article is that I can't see any purpose to laying out Gene Ray's Time Cube ideas in such detail except to mock someone who may well need professional mental health help. Gene Ray / Time Cube may be widely known (okay, so keep the Gene Ray article), but what's the seemly, non-smirking purpose for this kind of detailed exploration? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:55, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Jitse Niesen", Time Cube has been debated on two separate occasions at two separate universities: MIT in 2002, and Georgia Tech in 2005. In 2003, Dr Ray was interviewed on TechTV's "Unscrewed" television programme, hosted by Martin Sargent. He has been interviewed on numerous Internet radio programs, including FreeTalkLive, RantRadio, RadioKOL, EYada (now defunct), and he was interviewed about one day ago, I take it, on a New York "WHRW-FM" radio channel, on a show hosted by one Charles Berman. TimeCube.com has been mentioned on a vast quantity of websites, as a Google-search will reveal. An Academic paper was written on the subject of Time Cube by a Taiwanese university student, Bei Dawei. In short, there has been a huge quantity of publicity. So yeah, that's the publicity.

<dd>The MIT lecture (and I suspect the Georgia Tech lecture and these other "publicity" events) as well was not a "debate". It was a freakshow. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 12:22, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>You should read my comments there to understand my argument (which is why I provided the link.) These types of articles share one thing in common - they are essentially <i>useless</i> information. They don't educate or inform or increase our understanding of the world or existence. In other words, they don't fulfill the aim of an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. If you and others argue that Wikipedia is not to be compared to a traditional encyclopedia (i.e. Britannica), then you know what? Wikipedia should stop promoting itself as an encyclopedia and simply refer to itself as a "knowledge base" or "information repository" or something along those lines. Every time Jimbo gets out there and gives a lecture on Wikipedia, he promotes his vision which <i>clearly defines Wikipedia as a potential competitor to traditional print encyclopedias</i>. This promotional campaign, spread by word of mouth and the media, has been so successful that most people come to this site <i>expecting a <b>free alternative</b> to Britannica, Encarta, and Columbia.</i> For heavens sake, Jimbo talks about a print version of Wikipedia that can be given to every single child in Africa and other poor regions. Again, this is the man who started this thing in the first place. Most people here seem to agree with Jimbo, otherwise they wouldn't be contributing. And yet why is it that most people refuse to take a stand when it comes to defending this vision, so that Wikipedia does not degenerate into a useless repository of junk and pop culture? Yes, Time Cube is junk. This article is junk. "Shock site" is junk, and so are many, many, many other articles here that <b>do nothing</b> to add to human knowledge, but like television, have only the effect of numbing the brain and lowering peoples' IQ. It would be better and more informative for people to watch a full 24 hours of Fox News than to spend only a single hour to wade through these crap articles. Again, if anyone cares about the competency and legitimacy of this project, especially it's credibility factor in the light of so many attacks in recent times, then this will require more stringent guidelines and factors for inclusion. It will have to happen at some point, otherwise Wikipedia will no longer be able to gain enough financial support to survive. Remember, Wikipedia <i>relies</i> on donations, and if Wikipedia is no longer fulfilling the aims outlined in it's mission statement, people will cease to support it with their hard-earned cash. metaspheres 15:57, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess I get what you mean; I have a little bit of hard time <i>generalising</i> it. In fact, I have a little bit of hard time generalising my counterargument. Here's my counterargument in its purest, unedited form: "One man's junk is another's treasure!" and "where exactly do you draw line between junk and factoids that are interesting in some contexts?" ... My problem when generalising your argument is this: Yes, trimming stuff no one is ever interested about is important. <i>I just don't see how it applies to "shock site" or "Time Cube", as those are probably within realm of topics that are, marginally, worth discussing.</i> My problem generalising my counterargument is this: I'm not utterly comfortable defending these two articles vigorously, and admit they're on the very boundary between plausible and not plausible. All I'm saying is this: <a href="../../../u/a/_/WP%7EUA_5bfb.html" title="WP:UA">WP:UA</a> is an example of Wikipedia's strengths. Wikipedia's strength is that we can cover a little bit more eccentric topics. "Eccentric" can not only mean "a bit unusual choice for a topic", but it will also mean "information about computer topics that isn't 3-4 years out of date". (If the "real" encyclopaedias ignore the "worthless" net culture topics, <i>exactly how the heck do they cover it at all?</i>) Sometimes the topic is a bit fuzzy one. It's entirely different matter whether or not that stuff is junk or not. In closing: I concur that Time Cube or shock sites could be discussed elsewhere, in some other article, as a section or something; I disagree that they'd be <i>entirely</i> worthless topics to cover. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:04, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> or fundamentally restructure with stronger documentation. There are two cases which would justify an article on this topic under the guidelines. First, the "theory" could meet verifiability (and other requirements) in and of itself. There does not seem to be a strong sense that this is the case; the theory is known because of the author. The argument for deletion or merger in that regard is the same that finally prevailed in the CTMU debacle. Alternatively, an article could meet WP standards by being about the <i>website</i> itself, under the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requirements. This article does not appear to meet those obligations: it is a long article focused on the content of the site (including a substantial list of claims that amounts to little more than contextless quotes). The given references are directed towards the site's content and its creator, not towards the site in and of itself. If there has been appropriate independant coverage of the site, cleanup and document accordingly. If not, follow CTMU precendent and delete (or merge, if determined desirable). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 04:46, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, that's exactly the point. The theory is unverifiable, but any attempt to remove the theory and discuss only the website is apparently reverted by the time cubers. The website's notability is sufficiewntly borderline that I would merge and redirect to Gene Ray, but delete and redirect is an option as is keep in a <i>wholly different form</i>, with credible references to support the popularity of the website <i>as a website</i> (absent right now). At the moment it's "keep the non-notable website, it's a notable theory" and "keep the unverifiable theory, it's a notable website", but I have yet to see the evidence of this being the primary focus of mutpile non-trivial coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 14:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extremely strong KEEP!!</b> Time Cube is proven to be the absolute truth of the universe beyond the faintest iota of doubt. We now know that humanity is in a dire state due to Cubeless ignorance and nihilistic brainwashing. Dr Gene Ray tells us that 1-corner Academia and singularity-religion are brainwashing the populace with evil-fraught lies: yet, Wikipedians (some of them at least) insist on suppressing Time Cube.<br />
<br />
Now if we examine the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETime_Cube_Delete_5231.html" title="Talk:Time Cube/Delete">Talk:Time Cube/Delete</a> talk-discussion page, we will notice that the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> article has previously withstood the VfD process not once, not even twice, but THREE ENTIRE TIMES. And based on the "Keep" votes on this page that have been made by strong, noble, rational-minded sane sensible people, it appears that Time Cube will again prevail victoriously for the FOURTH time. (Four is the supreme number of the universe.)<br />
<br />
Let us all acknowledge the Cubic truth. Dr Gene Ray is the greatest thinker and wisest human.
