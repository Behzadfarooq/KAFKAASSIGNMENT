<h2><span class="mw-headline">A newbie has a problem with the deletion process</span></h2>
<p>I was looking for an administrator to help me with a article deletion process, and "Requests for administrator attention" sent me here. I edited a section of an article, restoring chronological order and NPOV mostly, but also various little but necessary tweaks like a broken ref and redundacy.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals&amp;diff=69368270&amp;oldid=69309570" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals&amp;diff=69368270&amp;oldid=69309570" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Part of the changes is under discussion on the talk page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals#Holocaust_on_your_Plate" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals#Holocaust_on_your_Plate" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Someone created a new article copying the pre-edited content whole with POV and errors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_on_your_Plate" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_on_your_Plate" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> hours later, then went and linked it from many article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Farnsworth+J." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Farnsworth+J." rel="nofollow">[4]</a> I was unfamiliar with the deletion process so I went and read the deletion policies. I couldn't find anything relating to this particular problem: is it OK to bypass the discussion process and simply create a content fork using old material? I'm not asking about weither this particular section deserve it's own article (I think it don't, it's just one controverstial ad campaign among many others and merely a content fork to evade debate), but rather what is appropriate for me to do in this situation (afd, proposed deletion or speedy?) and what arguments I'm supposed to make since they don't mention content forks. I can't go and edit the new article either, since it's the basicly the same content as in the main article and still under discussion on the talk page. I'll just be accused of silencing criticism anyway (again). Any help is appreciated. <a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJean-Philippe_9cba.html" title="User:Jean-Philippe">Jean-Philippe</a> 23:54, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Content can be split out from articles. I notice that <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals_5e68.html" title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> is a very long article, so if the content was originally in that article and moved to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_on_your_Plate_f686.html" title="Holocaust on your Plate">Holocaust on your Plate</a>, that would make sense. However, most of the detail about the campaign seems to have been left in <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals_5e68.html" title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a>, so if a split is being done then some of the material in the PETA article should be cut down. Alternatively, you could turn <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_on_your_Plate_f686.html" title="Holocaust on your Plate">Holocaust on your Plate</a> into a redirect to <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals_5e68.html" title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a>, discussing it on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Talk%7EHolocaust_on_your_Plate_720d.html" title="Talk:Holocaust on your Plate">Talk:Holocaust on your Plate</a> if necessary. I don't think an AfD is necessary - a redirect would make more sense. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:01, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you think it has been forked off just to provide a POV you should discuss it on the talk page (and make sure that editors from both articles are involved). This may be useful in the discussion: <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>. It is only a guideline but at its root it goes back to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, so if you are unable to resolve the problem on the talk page you could list at AFD as a POV article. <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>,<a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">WP:RFM</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal</a> are (possibly less aggressive) alternatives to listing it for deletion if you can't resolve it amongst the editors. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 00:13, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For now I'm redirecting the fork back to the main article. I've given an explanation on the fork and it's editor talkpages. As well as initiated a discussion on the main article in addition to the content dispute. I do think it was meant as a sort of pov fork, but we'll discuss it, maybe fork it later. It should be fine. <a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJean-Philippe_9cba.html" title="User:Jean-Philippe">Jean-Philippe</a> 00:50, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">seperate closed discussions</span></h2>
<p>Would it be reasonable to move closed AFDs to a seperate page, and replace them with a one line summary &amp; link? The sheer size of the daily log and the time it takes to load is hard to work with; seperating the ones that are no longer open for discussion seems like the simplest way to shrink this. -<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanbeg_28d2.html" title="User:Sanbeg">Steve Sanbeg</a> 16:48, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sounds like a good idea to me. At times, there are over 200 AfD's, some of which have a response rate of 15 or more bullet point statments. Lets see if we can get a consensus though. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 16:51, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm for it. Speedy deletes and closed relisted discussions can sometimes take up half the log page even on the day they are listed. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 17:11, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not. It would create more unnecessary work for admins closing discussions for the sake of - what - people having to press Page Down less often? We have enough of a backlog at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Old_278a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Old">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Old</a> as it is. Scrolling down a list of 100-200 AfDs (Ctrl-F doesn't work on the edit window) looking for one in particular is annoying enough on the few occasions I'm relisting an article (taking it out of the old log and inserting it into a new one). If I had to do it on every single AfD, I would in all probability stop doing one of my favourite admin activities. Without wanting to sound elitist and "har har you don't know what you're talking about", none of the above three supporters are admins and I'm not sure they appreciate how annoying this extra step on an already sufficiently burdensome process would be. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 17:21, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To endorse Sam's position, we used to have that step as part of the archiving procedure. It was never properly followed. We lost a lot of deletion discussions that were never properly archived. We got into countless arguments over renominations - arguments which we have been able to quickly solve since we changed to this archiving procedure.</p>
<p>What you can do instead is to create a .css subpage which will automatically hide all the closed discussions from <i>your</i> view while leaving it visible for people like Sam who still need it.

<li>Check your preferences and see which Skin you are using. The default is "monobook".</li>
<li>Create a new page titled User:Foo/skin.css (where "Foo" is your username and "skin" is the name of your skin - mine is at <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_monobook.css_a8e1.html" title="User:Rossami/monobook.css">User:Rossami/monobook.css</a>)</li>
<li>Paste ".vfd { display:none; }" into the new page.</li>
<li>Save.</li>
<li>To disable the hiding, go back to your style page and temporarily blank it, then reload the AFD page. Note: You may have to manually purge your computer's cache.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure we all know how burdensome the the process is. I just wanted to know if it was reasonable to make the page a bit smaller, so we wouldn't have to wait so long for it to render each time, since this makes it more tedious to participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>If admins don't want to do it (and of course, why would they) couldn't a bot just summarize the closed AFDs, and leave a link to the full discussion?</p>
<p>It looks like Rossami's css doesn't quite do what I wanted, but seems to speed rendering up enough that I'd do something like that anyway. But a few small changes to a few templates would probably make it feasible to keep a summary and block the discussion. -<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanbeg_28d2.html" title="User:Sanbeg">Steve Sanbeg</a> 20:26, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>FWIW, while I was closing deletion discussions during my lunch break at work, I had to use Internet Explorer rather than Firefox to view the daily log, as viewing it in Firefox would crash the crappy company laptop. So I don't object in principle to making the daily logs shorter. However, it certainly shouldn't be a human activity, and I'm unsure about bots. For example, when deciding how to 'summarise' the debate, I assume that would involve saying what the outcome was, and for a bot the natural choice would be to pick out whatever the closing admin highlighted in bold. However, not all discussions get closed with a single term in bold - while the majority are '<b>keep'</b>, '<b>delete'</b>, '<b>transwiki'</b>, etc, in some cases it can be more complicated. For example, in nominations involving multiple articles, "<b>Delete</b> Article X and Article Y, <b>keep</b> <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Article Z</a>." Or I may use bolding once for the outcome, then once again for emphasis in my reasoning. Or I may just forget to bold the outcome at all.</dd>
<dd>Really, that's the sort of reasoning that should be left up to those that can actually create bots and know more about the difficulties. All I can say is, I freely admit that I was in the extreme minority when I got annoyed because I had to use a slow browser during part of the process, and wouldn't consider suggesting any more than the most minor change to remedy that. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 21:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wasn't there an experiment with closing *FDs by deleting all the content/discussion except the closing admin's result, and then compressing that between the {{*fd top}} {{*fd bottom}} templates? A link to the last full-screen edit might be useful for those who wish to view it.</dd>

<dd>Using noinclude tags in the closing templates might be a solution - it wouldn't create any more work for the admins, but properly implemented would make the discussion disappear from the log page while still appearing on the article page.See what I mean: User:Yomangani/Sandbox/AFDtest and User:Yomangani/Sandbox/AFDtestlog just has noinclude added to the closing templates. There's probably some escaping to take into account as it's one stage removed from the template and it needs a link to the discussion page, but it did take me all of 3 minutes, so you'd expect some polishing to be needed. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 22:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks to the Voodoo from Nae'blis, I have a working version of the afd templates that compact the closed discussions down to title and result, without the need for a new page and let you see the full discussion by clicking on a link.</p>
<p>See: User:Yomangani/Sandbox/AFDtestlog1 for an example.</p>
<p>It doesn't require any more work from admins as far as I can see: although the reason for deletion is a parameter to the template, it defaults to delete (as most AFDs are deleted I believe) and automatically signs it for you, so in theory it should be less work. It's not the most attractive template code in the world, but does anybody care about that? <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 16:45, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Slick work. I notice that {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_top_a9e2.html" title="Template:Afd top">afd top</a>}} uses a noinclude tag to just avoid closing the div, so that {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_bottom_9329.html" title="Template:Afd bottom">afd bottom</a>}} can envelop the whole thing. Rather than making the reason for deletion a parameter, can you emulate this behavior instead?

<p>The templates are here: User:Yomangani/Sandbox/AFDtop and User:Yomangani/Sandbox/AFDbottom. I tried to think of a way round the parameter thing, but the reason for deletion is <i>above</i> the closing of the top template now (to allow the discussion to be enclosed in noinclude tags) rather than <i>after</i> it as it is in the current template. I can't see anyway of solving it without adding a third template {{afd middle}} which would be more work.

<dd>it seems unlikely that there would be a good way around that. When it occurs at the very end, as it does now, it makes sense to keep it outside. In your version, probably not. One minor thing, it looks like you may have overdone the &lt;includeonly&gt;. Assuming I'm reading this right, they're only to break up special syntax, so you could just have an empty pair in key places, like &lt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;onlyinclude&gt; or ~~&lt;inlcudeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;~~, and the rest may be overkill.

<dd>Unless you use them to cover the whole of the tag in one way or another you get (partial) display of the tag when viewing the original template. It doesn't actually cause any problems but it looks ugly. I figured it was better to look ugly in the template itself.

<dd>I don't mind if the original template is jacked up (use a section to prettify it, if that's your concern), as it's only a Part 1 of 2 template; maintaining consistency with current template behavior would go a long way toward increasing the likelihood of this being adopted, IMO.

<dd>I think we are talking at cross purposes (or I've lost the plot). I had to move the closing admin's comment to be a parameter to the template because it has to be inserted before the end of the {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_top_a9e2.html" title="Template:Afd top">afd top</a>}} template in order to allow the &lt;noinclude&gt; tag to start after it and above the discussion (otherwise the discussion will be visible or the result hidden). I agree it would be preferable to keep the process the same for the admins, but I can't see any way to do that and hide the discussion, which is the object of the exercise. I was hoping the fact that for a "Delete" result the admin would have less work (just pasting in the top and bottom templates) would offset the disagreeable business of changing the system. On a point of trying to get concensus maybe we should reopen this discussion somewhere where <i>Category:Admins who do a lot of AFD closing hang out</i>? <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 15:14, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Is the entire aim of this to hide closed discussions so that the ones that are still open are easier to locate on per-day pages? We already have a mechanism for that. Being able to read prior discussion pages <i>in their entirety without any extra hoops to jump through</i> is useful, especially when articles are discussed again, as they sometimes are. (There have been several in the past few days alone.) Please don't prevent that. The discussion is just as important as the decision by the closing administrator.

<dd>The aim is to hide closed discussions on the log page - it does nothing to the discussion page itself. If you look at the examples above User:Yomangani/Sandbox/AFDtestlog1 is how it would appear on the log page, User:Yomangani/Sandbox/AFDtest1 is the discussion page (unchanged and in its entirety). It uses noinclude and includeonly tags to show different information on the log page and the actual page. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 17:53, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason I started the thread is that one of the barriers to participating in AFD is that it takes so long to render the log page, and it gets rerendered each time you post a comment. So there is a fair amount of latency if you want to go along and participate in the discussions. Since there are so many that get speedied out quickly, the most obvious way to speed up the rendering is to only inline the discussions that you can actually participate in, and have the archived entries be visible, and only a click away if you want to get the details on this. It seems like if these templates are used to close the discussions, it would approximately double the rendering speed of the current log page, and probably have more of an affect on older pages. -<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanbeg_28d2.html" title="User:Sanbeg">Steve Sanbeg</a> 18:04, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>You can also wrap the <i>log page</i> in a div, and do some fancy CSS to hide everything between the tags without using &lt;noinclude&gt;. For example, put a &lt;div class="afdlog"&gt; at the top of the page, and then do something like this in a global CSS page:</li>
</ul>

.afdlog *  div.vfd, .afdlog *  div.vfd ul{display:none};

<dd>But since that only hides the items once they have been downloaded, so it wouldn't speed the load times would it? I doubt it would save much rendering time either as I suspect the hidden divs are rendered then hidden (but I must admit I know nothing about the internals of css rendering engines).

That's why we judge '48 hours' to be from the very minute it starts. But AfDs run for a minimum of 5 days, and often don't get closed that early due to backlog.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A bot to seperate closed discussions</span></h2>
<p>I've been following the discussion on the voodoo and seperate closed discussions thread. I'm wondering if a bot should handle this work instead. Thus alleviating anyone having to do it. I have someone willing to make the bot, and I'm willing to run it. If I can get a consensus here, I'll post it to <a href="../../../b/r/f/WP%7EBRFA_d541.html" title="WP:BRFA">WP:BRFA</a>.

<dd>Do you mean tracking through the page after the afd templates are put on and adding noinclude tags around the discussion? It would have the problem of trying to detect the end of the admin's comments, but if they alway date stamped them it would be fairly straightforward and isn't a bad idea. Personally, I think my template is an easy solution (as it saves the admins work most of the time) but getting people to change to it will be a struggle because it requires a slight change in how things are done. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 19:40, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, the idea I had in mind was for the bot to remove the closed AfD altogether (to a subpage), and leaving only a link, similar the one found here: User:Yomangani/Sandbox/AFDtestlog1. I'm not entirely sure how it would work, as I wouldnt be the one designing it. Although I can say that I dont think there would be much of an issue in tracking, the bot would look for the template top being used, possibly even if its subst'd. So anything under {{Afd top}} and above {{Afd bottom}} would be moved to the subpage. Any suggestions for improving the bot or concerns can be raised, and addressed here if needed. The builder is <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle_101</a>, who has created <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_WikiVoter_e4f5.html" title="User:Eagle 101/WikiVoter">WikiVoter</a> for AfD's, and I believe has also helped work on <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VandalProof_1bdb.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof">VandalProof</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VP2_214c.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VP2">VP2</a>.

<dd>If the link on the log page says it is closed it only has to link to the discussion page, there is no need for another subpage (and in fact another subpage would be pointless). I think the information in User:Yomangani/Sandbox/AFDtestlog1 is probably the bare minimum that should be left. That isn't supposed to be a subpage, it is supposed to show what the link would look like in the main log page (I probably should have surrounded it with some dummy open discussions to illustrate). <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 20:13, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah you're right. I forgot that the discussion is its own page. Then all the bot would need to do is provide the closed template. Which in my opinion, would require no new changes to closing by admin's and non admins. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 20:23, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for supporting the idea. I'm also looking for any objections from others before we begin working on the details of the bot, coding and what not. I'm still concerned about how often the bot should be run. I'm leaning toward every few hours, or possibly something like the Mediation Cabals bot is run. Its spots a change, and automatically adjusts. I'm just not sure if it would be better for the bot to run 24/7, and check all five current logs, so it can catch the close as soon as possible or not. The downfall of not letting it run 24/7 would be making it a semi-bot, and running it only at special peak times. And in a large stretch of time, many AfD's could be closed, as speedy delete, speedy keep, etc. This however wouldnt help out much, since approx. 15 AfD's will close in the first 6 hours, but there is really no way of knowing how many will be closed, or relisted elsewhere (to MfD, TfD, CfD, etc. ). <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 21:35, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it is necessary for it to constantly cycle checking for changes. The size of a new log page doesn't become a problem for several hours and an occasional pass to compact the closed AFDs should take most of the sting out of it. Running it something like every 4 hours would probably be fine. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 22:39, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well thats the great thing about it being a bot, to the previous two talk headers to which this thread sparked from. You wouldnt have to change the way you close.

<p>There was discussion on the other thread about the possibility of doing it with a bot before the template voodoo came about. Considering how frequenty AFDs get speedied on the day they're submitted, I'd think the bot would need to run fairly frequently, at least on the current day; maybe every hour or so. For previous days, maybe not so much. Although I do like the instant gratification affect of the templates, I'm not too worried about how it's done; if a bot did the updated frequently enough, that would be cool. -<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanbeg_28d2.html" title="User:Sanbeg">Steve Sanbeg</a> 13:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone recall if this article ever went through an AfD, perhaps under a different name? It was deleted April 14 as speedy non-notable and recreated May 26 this year. It was tagged today as a speedy but this time as reposted AfD article. I can't find the AfD and it appears to me there is some claim of notabilty that I believe stops it being a speedy.

<dd>My best guess would be that it never went to afd and the person who says it did doesn't know that afd specifically means this process instead of speedy deletion (he has no edits in afds himself).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Link back to the log page in the template?</span></h2>
<p>Sorry if this has been suggested/discussed before, but I'd like to suggest that a link to the appropriate log/day page appear on each individual AfD. The log pages transclude the AfDs themselves, so when you've edited an AfD to record your comment, the link at the top is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>, from which you have to scoot down to the day links at the bottom. Am I missing some obvious navigation back to the log pages here? If not, it would be nice to have those AfD articles have a link back to the log page, so that for example on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Banjo_Story_%282nd_nomination%29_e072.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Banjo Story (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Banjo Story (2nd nomination)</a> there would be a link that leads to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2006_August_20_f3d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 August 20">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 August 20</a>. If it could lead back to the #section title, that would be even better; that would drop you right back in to the list where you were before you edited. Hope this makes sense. I don't yet understand templates well enough to go and experiment in my sandbox on this, but it seems to me that a change to afd2 is what would be needed. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 00:25, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think it is straightforward as the template on the individual AFD page would need to link back to the log page it was linked from, and, since nothing is transcluded from the log page into the individual AFD page, I don't know how you would know on which log page the AFD was listed (think about relistings for example). However it is late here, and my brain may be broken. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 01:26, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Could this be combined with the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_977d.html#Header_-_time_stamps" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion">suggestion above</a> for header timestamps? If so, on creation the template could perhaps parse the date for the appropriate log page to link back to? I'm arguing by analogy from other coding languages here, so the argument may not go through for templates, but essentially I'm suggesting that if we pass in a date we can use it to create the link at article creation time. Again, I hope this makes sense. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 01:33, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's possible, but again brings up problems for relistings and AFDs where the main page is created at, say, 11.58pm and the article listed in the log at 12.02am the next day (both of which would go "back" to the wrong page). Personally, I use the back button or history in my browser to get round this, or launch the link to the article from the log in new window and work from that. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 09:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Talk page notice template</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps am overlooking it, but I am suggesting that we create and make available a notice template for inclusion in the talk page(s) of related article(s) to one being suggested for deletion and to make this part of the steps suggested. This is useful in AfD for sub-articles, when a large number of editors might want to be informed of an AfD, and easier than informing each one. However I do not mean it to be a substitute to notifying the page creator in his/her talk page.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>

<dd>Personally, each time I see a discussion contribution via wikivoter I discount it. It may not be rubberstamping—there may have been long rumination before deciding which <i>button to push</i>—but the appearance is that of rubberstamping. There is much brouhaha over not calling what we do at afd voting. I think we do no violence to the word <i>voting</i> by employing it, but I understand the reason for that semantic prohibition. If it is discussion we want, and not <i>simple</i> voting, this automated process is our worst enemy.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 03:35, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only automation this program does is filling in some of the manual-labor type stuff.

<dd>I agree, it's really not automated, you actually have to manually type in a reason as to why you are making such a vote.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggested changes to guidelines</span></h2>
<p>Can I suggest that step one of the process is tweaked in the following way to help make the edit summaries more helpful?</p>
<ul>
<li>Current text: "Please include the phrase "nominated for deletion, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>" in the edit summary"</li>
<li>Suggested text: "Please include the phrase "nominated for deletion, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/<i>PageName</i>]]" in the edit summary, replacing PageName with the name of the page you are proposing for deletion"</li>
<li>Reason: Takes people directly to the discussion from the edit summary</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, step two could be improved with the following changes:</p>
<p>(1):</p>
<ul>
<li>Current text: "replacing <i>PageName</i> with the name of the page to be deleted"</li>
<li>Suggested text: "replacing <i>PageName</i> with the name of the page you are proposing for deletion"</li>
<li>Reason: current text assumes deletion will happen, the change removes this prejudicing statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2):</p>
<ul>
<li>Current text: "Consider the Edit summary "First deletion reason"</li>
<li>Suggested text: "Please use an edit summary such as "Creating deletion discussion page for [[<i>PageName</i>]] and providing reason for deletion nomination", replacing <i>PageName</i> with the name of the page you are proposing for deletion"</li>
<li>Reason: current suggested edit summary too short and uninformative.</li>

I was already not very fond of the new strong suggestion about putting the AfD discussion link into the AFD1 and the article title link into the AFD2 edit summary. Now we have a requirement that involves clicking an external link and looking down an ill-conceived table for a category. The most offputting thing to me is that I can't seem to locate an edit history for the template that gets inserted into this page describing all of this to see if there is some decent reason for the changes other than making nominations more difficult. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 02:54, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How to delete articles on smaller Wikipedias?</span></h2>
<p>I'm trying to delete spam articles from some of the smaller Wikipedias, and I can't figure out how to do it. I insert the &lt;&lt;subst:afd1&gt;&gt; tag (according to the English instructions), but all that happens is that the tag is shown as the content of the article. I also can't figure out how to contact the administrators for those languages. For example, I am trying to delete an inappropriate article from the lu.wikipedia, and so far I haven't found any way to do it. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangali_5158.html" title="User:Malangali">Malangali</a> 18:46, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow. I see your point. And looking at the very few contributions made to that project, almost all seem to have been vandalism of one form or another.

<p>Hey, I believe this article was deleted inadvertantly during a group of deletions in the commemorative coin department.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What should my action be in this case?</span></h2>
<p>The article Virtual record (or "virtual album") has been created. The article claims to define an album that is only available as a download (such as itunes exclusive albums) as a "Virtual album" and cites Tim Armstrong's album as the coining of the phrase. The thing is that the article is created and maintained by the guy who also created the article for Tim Armstrong's CD; so I asked the person if there was any actual citable source that uses the term virtual record besides Tim Armstrong's. He didn't reply. I posted the same question in the article's talk page, and I'm waiting to see if anyone replies there. In the meantime, assuming this is what it seems to me to be - an article that is attempting to actually spread the use of this term virtual album as a real used term (which I've never heard in any capacity as official), what should be done. Should the article just be deleted or what? I don't think the list itself is necessarily "Crap" but the actual intro and title "virtual album" seems baseless. The same person is going about changing entries for albums to make them read as "virtual albums" and I don't think that a term that I (am pretty sure) no one knows should be being put in the header when the basic definition of the term is usually right after that term (that the album is only available online). I don't know what makes a virtual album that special either. Albums used to be on vinyl, and 8track and cassettes. Download is just a new medium. It's still just an "album". It's not a special album.

<dd>That's a mere 5 day backlog. We've had far worse backlogs before. Closing AFDs is a volunteer activity and a relatively thankless one. Furthermore, there are only a few regular closers and the closure has to be carried out by someone reasonably independent.

<dd>You may have a false-positive there. In the past, discussions were not always explicitly "closed" with the formal addition of the header and footer and a detailing of the decision. The prior process was to simply unlist the discussion from the main AFD page with a note in the edit summary about the decision. The actual decision was "recorded" through the action - either the article was deleted (in which case, it would show in the deletion log) or it was kept (in which case, we usually tried to make a note on the article's Talk page). Given the nature of this debate, I can see why it would be hard to find a record of the actual decision. Even today, we struggle with the process for these mass-nominations. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 14:23, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This sort of thing might be very fascinating from a historical standpoint, although I must admit it lacks general interest at the moment. For some reason, things have to go through an extended "old phase" before they're old enough to be of real historical interest. For example, I think I'd be pretty interested in reading the bid process info on the 1980 and 1984 Olympics. I think these old articles could certainly be trimmed down, but perhaps we might consider retaining anything of potential historical value. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnivron_b135.html" title="User:Anivron">Anivron</a> 01:09, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This seems like a textbook case where AfD isn't needed. Such articles could simply be redirected into the parent article - to use your example, if it's decided that <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_2012_Olympic_bid_39f3.html" title="London 2012 Olympic bid">London 2012 Olympic bid</a> is excessive detail, it could be redirected to <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. That would also allow material to be merged. An AfD on such an article would almost certainly result in a keep consensus - albeit probably with a mixture of 'merge' and 'keep', but there's functionally no difference at AfD. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 01:18, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alternatives to AfD - Pruning</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes I see articles nominated for deletion that should in fact be tidied up and improved and have sources added. Some articles are a mess of Original Research, lack of sources, etc, but clearly there is scope for some sort of article on the subject. In these cases, is it proper to nominate for deletion? I would have thought that a better options is <b><a href="../../../p/r/u/Pruning.html" title="Pruning">PRUNING</a></b>. ie. reduce the article to a stub by vicious pruning, and then step back and watch it grow again, hopefully in the right way this time. The horticultural analogy works quite well. When you prune a plant, you often encourage new growth. So is it possible to encourage those nominating for deletion to try pruning instead? <small>The example in question here is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Themes_in_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_2961.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Themes in The Lord of the Rings">this one</a>.</small> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:36, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not too unusual for articles to improve a fair amount while they're in AFD. The issue when you're nominating it is whether the article is worth the effort to prune it, and whether there would be anything left. I guess the same holds if it's already in discussion; you could always prune the article, then note that in the discussion. -<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanbeg_28d2.html" title="User:Sanbeg">Steve Sanbeg</a> 19:12, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>There are also, quite frankly, articles so bad that an editor may judge (and I often agree) that it would be better to deepsix the whole thing. The problem with pruning (especially on articles that are full of OR and POV) is that there's nothing to stop the original author from going right back at it. One of the common issues is authors who genuinely believe their OR is not OR, and their POV is NPOV. If nobody wants to take on the task of babysitting the article to prevent it from devolving again, it may be a better course to just kill it and hope that, if someone wants to write a real article on the subject later, they can start from scratch. Of course, each situation is different, but I think that's the logic behind deleting an article that, theoretically, could be pruned. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:20, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More description in reasons</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure if this is the correct place to raise this, but it would be helpful if the reason for deletion gave a few words of detail about the nature of the article, where this isn't obvious from the title. This would allow casual browsers of the AfD pages to pick out those debates that they are likely to be able to contribute meaningfully towards, without always having to click through to the article page. This is a particular problem with biographies, where the article name often gives no clue as to whether it's about, say, a wrestler or a woman's studies academic.</p>
<p>I'm aware that there's already a considerable burden on submitters, but this would only take a few extra seconds for the submitter and would save time for all the hundreds of AfD browsers. It would also make it less likely that controversial items get missed in a host of less controversial ones. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 01:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AFDs are sometimes revisited, either in subsequent deletion debates or in Deletion Review discussions. This would seem to make the follow-up review a bit harder. Why would you want to bother, though? What is gained by breaking the links? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 04:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I usually check whether some users post links from sites like Digg, Slashdot, Reddit, MySpace and YouTube to increase the amount of clicks for their own posts there, or to promote products in eBay or other trading sections. With time, it becomes harder to navigate through logs. Take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Linksearch&amp;target=%2A.ebay.com&amp;limit=1000&amp;offset=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Linksearch&amp;target=%2A.ebay.com&amp;limit=1000&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">eBay</a> log, in example. It is already too hard to notice if a user has added an external link for his own purposes (in example, selling an item), as the links are long, and the archived ones (talk pages and discussions) are not necessary. As I already said, so far I have been unlinking items in archived talk pages, some innactive talk pages that needed archiving, removing from inside the body of articles, etc, but I am trying to either search for a precedent or for a counterexample, as I am sure I am not the only one who has been doing so (I believe the WikiProject Spam is doing something similar as well, although with less recognized sites for now). -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 05:03, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also would recommend leaving the links. The costs don't seem to justify the rewards. But if you feel that you absolutely must remove them, I would recommend a completely different approach for AFD sub-pages.<br />
Rather than tamper with the specifics of the discussion, blank the entire discussion. In place of the discussion, leave a comment on the page such as "For privacy reasons, this discussion was archived into the page-history at <tt>~~~~~</tt>. If you need to review this discussion, please restore it from history." This will still make it possible for others to find and review the discussion when they need it and will fully disclose that you changed the page. You should also provide a self-referential link to the discussion page since AFD debates are transcluded onto other pages and it can often be a bit tricky to find the source page.<br />
There might already be a template for this purpose. We've blanked some discussions before when there were extenuating circumstances. I still would recommend against it but if you must remove the links, this would be a less intrusive technique. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 16:01, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

There is an RfA currently underway here&#160;: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#User:Jean-Thierry_Boisseau_.28formerly_User:Musikfabrik.29.2C_et_al." title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#User:Jean-Thierry_Boisseau_.28formerly_User:Musikfabrik.29.2C_et_al.</a>.</p>
<p>As one of the principals involved here, I have no problems with any of these articles being considered for deletion. However, on this AfD listing, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jean-Yves_Malmasson_ffdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jean-Yves Malmasson">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jean-Yves_Malmasson</a> three individuals are listed including one <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Marie_Londeix_e829.html" title="Jean-Marie Londeix">Jean-Marie Londeix</a> who has absolutely no connection at all with our company, other than being a slight acquaintance of one of the owners, who was only listed because our "company" account made a slight edit on this article (changing "Jean-Marie Londeix" to "Londeix, Jean-Marie" in the category section.</p>

<dd>It doesn't seem fair that this person is in this group deletion, since he has nothing to do with this situation and his article should be judged on it's own merits. The same could be said for the other listings, since they aren't "just" published by us. Could this be changed into three seperate discussions?

<p>I'll guess this has been covered a bajillion times so if someone can point me in the correct direction... Policy states an AfD is not a vote. But that's the format most AfD's take. If someone agrees with the nom or a previous statement and has nothing to add, they'll state "Delete/Keep per whoever" which adds nothing to the dicussion - except for a vote. Wouldn't a better structure be for noms to list where they think an article fails, and have each point answered in a separate subsection? (Insert perennial disclaimer here).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia's book burning</span></h2>
<p>It seems like there is currently a wiki-wide effort to delete articles from wikipedia. Many of the articles I have seen tagged as AfD have useful information on it. However, once they are deleted, that information is gone for good. I agree a balance needs to be set between bredth of subject matter and quality of work. Right now, balance looks off. Most of the contributions being trashed are from new users, who are put off by the quickness in which their work is destroyed. Has wikipedia reached a limit where the servers can no longer accept new pages? What is going on? Its no surprise people feel no longer welcome to contribute. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlpharigel_7558.html" title="User:Alpharigel">Alpharigel</a> 17:51, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The article at issue describes a philosophical argument. The subjects of the argument are naturalism and evolution, but the argument itself is philosophical, NOT scientific. It has been placed in the category AFD:Science and technology. Is there a more appropriate one? This is a problem because (in my opinion) the afd discussion has attracted science-oriented Wikipedians who dismiss the argument (and by extension, the article) out of hand because it is unscientific. Philosophical arguments don't have to be "scientific." I think something like "humanities" would be a much more appropriate category, but there is no such category.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">more newbie problems</span></h2>
<p>?right place As a newcomer, I find the whole deletion process to be highly arbitrary and authoritarian, almost the complete opposite of what I had imagined wikipedia to be. One way to improve the situation would be to adopt some software from slashdot, www.slashdot.org. Slashdot has features that, in wiki language, allow random and not random users to give opnions on random pages. This would at least remove some of the highly arbitrary small numbers problems in the current deletion process, whereby a very very small number (relative to usrbase) effect the decisions. I guess the current philosophy of deletion, which i find highly offensive, goes somewheres else...can someone redirect me&#160;? For instance, why are non notable articles candidates for deletion&#160;? The only rationale is that wiki is in fact a paper dicitionary, with paper limits; if the search and other software features actually worked, then you would not need to worry about a gazillionn non notable aritlce clogging up the space; they would transparnetly vanish. I also don't understand why there are not obkective citereia <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_Charms_fe03.html" title="Chelsea Charms">Chelsea Charms</a> eg, if a person has a certain number of hits on google, they are , by definition (not counting spamm/ballot stuffing/bots etc) important and the software should automatically generate a place holder aritcle stub with a plea for info.. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.60.137.141 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.60.137.141.html" title="User talk:24.60.137.141">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.60.137.141_5ab2.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.60.137.141">contribs</a>) 15:30, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Your suggestion about the google thing can't work, since google can't distinguish between names and other hits, it can't distinguish whether a name is simply common or notable, and we really don't need articles that say "There isn't an article about this subject and we don't know what it should be about, but google gives a lot of hits so it's here". If anyone wants google, they can use google, this is supposed to be an encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>About the notability thing, if something seems non-notable today, it can be deleted today. There are <a href="../../../n/b/d/WP%7ENBD_62b7.html" title="WP:NBD">no binding decisions</a> so the article can be recreated if it becomes notable tomorrow. In the meantime, it's not feasible to have an article about everyone or everything that might become notable in the future.

<p>REspectfully: sure there are problems with using google hits as a auto include for notability; the discussion shouldn't, at this point, revolve around technical issues, but around the concept of automatic inclusions; to make the point, surely there should be an article on each nobel prize winner As for the idea of recreating articles - is that not precisely the sort of things that computers are supposed to alleiviate you from, tedious repetiton of manual tasks. Stepping back, I have not hear a good reason why it is better to prune and delete, then include everything and give the user prune and delte tools to choose as they wish. I recently authored an article, retrogrouch, which seems to no longer exist. Assuming it was decent article, in that it concisely and pithly summed up the subject, why should I have to re write it&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>You took part in the discussion so you should know why that particular article was deleted. Wikipedia isn't a dictionary and you provided no reliable sources. In the more common cases you list: as far as I know, there is an article for every Nobel Prize winner, people are perfectly capable of creating them without a bot. In most cases, having a redlink is a lot better than having a placeholder, since it will tell people that the article doesn't exist so they won't waste their time clicking on nothing.

<p>BTW, kids - this is why public-facing levels of civility are needed on AFDs. They're not just internal communications. Doing press, I get people upset that Wikipedia has called them a "vanity author" when their article was marked as "vanity" and they had no hand in it, and asking who to sue. Explaining it's a jargon term only goes so far. (And I thought the word "vanity" was supposed to have been expunged from AFD vocabulary for this reason anyway.) If it's a jargon term, please urgently pick another jargon term that doesn't say actual disreputable things about a third party if read as being conventional English. We're #12 website in the world now, we're going to be Top 10 very soon. To be sure, <i>almost all</i> such living bio articles marked for deletion on AFD are just that ... but the term causes us a hell of a lot of trouble.

<p>I don't see the point that Noam Cohen is trying to make. Is it that we have an open process for determining if something is worthy of inclusion? To try to make us look ridiculous because we are forced to debate the inclusion of what many would consider trivial? Or, was he having a lazy day and decided to pad half his word count with GFDL content?

<dd>(edit conflict reply) It's because some of the discussions were moved to the articles' talk pages, and those are included now.

<p>AfD has made the news again. Not quite the NYT, but have a look at this from <a href="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXXVII/Issue_3/Opinions/opinions4.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXXVII/Issue_3/Opinions/opinions4.shtml" rel="nofollow">The Stanford Review</a>.

One of the better points was this bit: <i>"The language used amongst Wikipedians is intimidating and bewildering to outsiders. Words like “walled garden” and “spamvertisement” are used to degrade articles. Inexperienced users are called “SPAs” or “single purpose accounts” as an attack on the credibility of anything they write on Wikipedia."</i> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:17, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right in citing that sentence, which shows the bad parts of AfD; however I'd also like to mention some other sentences from that article:
<ul>
<li>does it make sense to sustain an active and easy process to eliminate information?</li>
<li>Wikipedia and similar communities on the internet allow people to occupy themselves with seemingly useless tasks, such as researching and recommending random Wikipedia articles for deletion</li>
<li>It’s unbelievable to me that a person with no connection or self-interest in an article on The Review goes to such effort to compile reasons to delete it</li>
<li>Several Wikipedians [...] making the argument that opponents to the deletion were inexperienced, and probably only contributing because of self interest (which was actually the case)</li>
<li>it’s actually really silly. The entire article on The Stanford Review is only four lines long.</li>
<li>In some ways, the article helps legitimize our paper as a source for news and commentary.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In other words, Wikipedia is a free web host; there is no point in deleting stuff, even a 4-liner and especially our article we wrote to promote ourselves and with which you have no business anyway. <a href="../../../t/i/z/User_talk%7ETizio_6b5c.html" title="User talk:Tizio">Tizio</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tizio_ea31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tizio">Caio</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/z/User%7ETizio_edab.html" title="User:Tizio">Sempronio</a> 10:10, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My favourite part is the bit about college students being so busy that they just don't have the time to conduct counter-research against massive Wikipedian afd research efforts.

<dd>Am I alone in believing that AfD tends to attract people who are primarily interested in deleting articles? Obviously I don't mean everybody who contributes to AfD, but there are some individuals who take great delight in seeing anything (that does not match their particular frame of reference) get deleted. There must be a certain psychology at work—perhaps a sense of empowerment? It's certainly much more difficult to compile a good article than it is to delete it, so possibly the later route gives a quicker "fix"? I'm just curious. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 16:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The psychology of AfD is indeed something worth of consideration. Another interesting phenomenon is the following one: even if an article requires a complete rewrite (by that I mean not just copyediting, I mean going back to the research phase are rewrite the article completely), some people feel compelled to rewrite it rather than going to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">Wikipedia:Requested articles</a> and choosing an article they feel important enough to write (or thinking of one themselves). It is certainly plausible that that article was the next one they intended to write, but that seems unlikely.</dd>
<dd>I guess there is some psychology at work here as well, something like "I would be bad in deleting this article, even if there is nothing in it that can be saved and I could better spend my time writing something else." Note that sometimes not even the original title survives. This may be related to the sense of guilty in removing something someone else has written; the strange part is that sometimes nothing of the original text or information survives.</dd>
<dd>Amazingly, the editors I am referring to are among the best ones partecipating in the AfD; they are certainly much better editors than the ones advocating keeping articles without actually editing them (nothing of this refers to this particular case).</dd>
<dd>BTW, the quote from the article you posted above shows an attempt of building a walled garden was actually taking place. Why this is bad is something we should certainly not be discussing. <a href="../../../t/i/z/User_talk%7ETizio_6b5c.html" title="User talk:Tizio">Tizio</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tizio_ea31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tizio">Caio</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/z/User%7ETizio_edab.html" title="User:Tizio">Sempronio</a> 18:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If it were three times in three months speedy-closing for disruption might be in order, but twice in four/five months seems reasonable.

<dd>On the consensus front, the problem I keep seeing is consensus may fail to form due to the following, regardless of delete or keep. Say there's an article about moose. Half the editors vote "Keep" citing policy, etc. The other half vote delete because "a moose once bit my sister", or, more likely blatant denial of how the article passes requirements. That's logged as a "keep, no consensus" and the article shows up again in a few months because "no consensus had been formed". It keeps the door open for repeated nominations.

<dd>The opposite is also true; I put up an article on AfD, and despite the clear violation of policy, there were so many supporters of the article's content - fanboys, so to speak - that it was simply judged "no consensus" despite the irrationality of the arguments on the keep side.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh"><font color="olive"><i><b>Michael Dorosh</b></i></font></a><sup><small><small><i><b><a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichael_Dorosh_51c9.html" title="User talk:Michael Dorosh"><font color="black">Talk</font></a></b></i></small></small></sup> 15:06, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That AfD you added was bad faith, initiated due to your ejection from the website that the article discussed, and the arguments on the "keep" side proved conclusively that there was no violation of policy. In fact, in the discussion on that particular AfD, you and your sockpuppets were the only "people" arguing for "delete". You put up an AfD and lost. Suck it up, Princess.</dd>

<li>Reply to ais523: That's what I suspect, but I question what's been labelled elsewhere as a "pitch 'til you win" mentality with certain nominations. Especially when it's the same nominator and the article has only gotten more scrutiny and better references since the previous AfD. I know there's no timeframe surrounding AfD's, and this one isn't a particularly egregious case (just a current one that caught my attention), as I've seen some renom'ed within 24 hours, but, and I suspect this is a constant suggestion, perhaps timeframes should be placed around AfD renoms. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></a> 14:58, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Your example is about repeated nominations of a particular article. I'm more worried about general, widespread misuse of AfD to nominate articles that could be rewritten or merged. In fact, I recently came across an old arbitration case that reminded me how much the atmosphere at AfD (then VfD) can change from year to year. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_GRider_e674.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/GRider">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/GRider</a> and the Request for comments linked from there. Back then, VfD/AfD was different.

It clearly needed a re-write, so much so that when a user who was unaware of the company and didn't know what a major part of internet history this company played by the article as written, nominated it for AfD within 5 days of article creation. I came across a similar case with <a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor_Blue_Clothing_Company_aeab.html" title="Anchor Blue Clothing Company">Anchor Blue Clothing Company</a>. It seems that more and more users are nonchalantly nominating AfD's without consideration for rewrites or improvements.

First, I know for a fact bat bathing happens in Guatemala and Honduras, and I guess the name given it there is not in English. Second, I did not make up the term--that is how is was described to me. Besides, what else would anyone call it? Third, it is not original research--I can assure you I have never gone bat bathing. Fourth, it is definitely verifiable, but just because Google does not mention it doesn't mean it is not verifiable.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Moving comments on AfD for length reasons</span></h2>
<p>Is it appropriate for a user to move another user's comments on an AfD discussion page to that AfD's talk page on the grounds of excessive length (<a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html#Good_practice" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines#Good_practice</a>)? And is an AfD page considered a "talk page" in terms of policy reference, for example things like <a href="../../../a/r/c/WP%7EARCHIVE_af20.html" title="WP:ARCHIVE">WP:ARCHIVE</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREFACTOR_6166.html" title="WP:REFACTOR">WP:REFACTOR</a>? It's a bit confusing to a newbie since those pages have their own talk pages? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 12:29, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AFD pages are generally only active for a short period of time - typically 5 days - before they are permanently archived. We can tolerate a lot in that short time. The changes which are generally allowable include:
<ul>
<li>Standardize the indentation. By convention, AFD discussions use nested bullets. Users who mix bullets and tabs or who forget to use the bullet can make the discussion harder for the rest of us to follow. Feel free to fix those.</li>
<li>If edits are added which disrupt the generally chronological flow of the discussion (for example, new comments added at the top), you can correct those.</li>
<li>Add attribution if someone forgets to sign their comment. {{<a href="../../../u/n/s/Template%7EUnsigned_e4f5.html" title="Template:Unsigned">unsigned</a>}} is helpful.</li>
<li>When the discussion gets very long (my personal rule is about 6 screen-shots), go to the AFD page and untransclude the discussion. Replace the transclusion with a short explanation that it was untranscluded for length and provide a regular link to the discussion page.</li>
<li>In especially egregious cases, consider <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">removing any personal attacks</a>. Note, however, that this can be a <i>very</i> controversial practice.</li>
<li>If the some participants drift off on a tangent which is irrelevant to the deletion decision, those tangential comments will sometimes be moved to the discussion's Talk page. That's not as helpful as you might think, though. The closing admin still has to read through all the comments regardless of where they've been moved.</li>
<li>And of course it's always allowable to revert vandalism.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Those are the only changes I can think of which are generally tolerated in AFD discussions. Refactoring merely for length is not among the edits we encourage. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 19:57, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps the user above should have clarified that it was his comments that were moved to the discussion page, as they were a well-beyond the pale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lostpedia_%28second_nomination%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83214963" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lostpedia_%28second_nomination%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83214963" rel="nofollow">3-page 1500 word response</a> to an earlier "delete" comment posted by one user-- although the above user claimed an "abstention" and provided no actual recommendation on the article in question, or basis in WP policy. The AfD comments were the user's fourth edit on Wikipedia, indicating (at the time) his was a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">WP:SPA</a>. He has subsequently made additional edits.--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 18:26, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't believe any of that changes my original question. Is "newness of user" or "beyond the pale" (whatever that means) or "response to other comments" or "abstention" grounds for moving comments from an AfD page? I also take offense to your suggestion that my comments had no basis in WP policy (I referenced it throughout my comments) and your accusation of SPA. This is the talk page for AfD, I don't see how debating my comments here is on-topic. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 19:33, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">If a topic is deleted, then similar topics should be deleted.</span></h2>
<p>Example: Someone deleted the Myg0t page. Myg0t is an association of trolls. However, the GNAA page is still up and running, and GNAA is another association of trolls. If someone want to wipe out a topic, then shouldn't pages relating to that topic be deleted? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_velociraptor_badb.html" title="User:The velociraptor">The velociraptor</a> 02:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>CounterExample: A software program called X is deleted. Should software program Y (or all articles about software programs) be deleted? Clearly not. If X = some software I created 3 minutes ago in my basement, and Y = Microsoft Windows, it becomes clear that there is a question of notability involved in the decision on whether to keep an article. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a> 02:23, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>BTW, people have, in fact, tried to use that argument. I've seen a number of AFD's where someone from a small software company with a dozen employees tried to claim that they should have a page if Microsoft has a page. Nobody's bought the argument yet. Both GNAA and myg0t have been repeatedly reviewed and discussed. Consistent judgement has been that GNAA are <i>notable</i> trolls, and myg0t aren't. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:29, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The correct way to deal with this is to use an umbrella nomination. It is important that all the articles are mentioned at the start of a debate, and not introduced halfway through, or later. If a group of articles is being nominated for deletion or transwikiing (see <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">Wikipedia:Walled garden</a>) then an umbrella nomination is essential. You <b>cannot</b> delete articles on the basis of previous AfD discussions. That way lies chaos. And each article should be debated on its own merits, as sometimes articles in an umbrella nomination can be merged, rather than deleted. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:01, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not sure if this has been pointed out, but it looks like AfD screwed up. Just to start the ball rolling and institute a culture change, I'm trying to get all admins closing things at AfD to remember to check the page history of an article before deleting, so that drastic changes in the nature of a page are spotted, and also urging those voting at AfD to do the same. See the following for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambar.html" title="Ambar">Ambar</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ambar_e200.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ambar">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ambar</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Copied to closing admin, restoring admin, deletion nominator, all who voted in the AfD discussion, and the AfD talk page. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
