<li><s><b>Weak Keep</b></s>. The cleanup exposed some things, such as that he has had a minor, but not trivial, role in a major US film, a fair number of German roles which sound reasonably impressive (I'm not a German acting buff, so open to changing opinion if someone more knowledgeable says that these roles are either very impressive or not impressive at all), and that the Marilyn Monroe expose has had some coverage - that adds up to a keep, weak only because of lack of German acting knowledge.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the nominator in the first afd, I wish someone would have informed of this renomination. Anyway, well done to Guinog for making the effort. I'm looking over the new article now - first thing that comes to notice is the first footnote reference is unreliable, as was noted in the first afd nomination. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Weak keep on condition that the Marilyn Monroe section is cut down + further referencing or removal of unsourced claims</b></s> Firstly, thanks again to Guinog and others for their efforts in revamping this article. I still think this article is problematic, but is a borderline keep needing better referencing - based on his TV acting career, and absolutely NOT on the Marilyn Monroe stuff.</li>
</ul>

<dd><small>The comment by Downtownstar below was removed from here to avoid the breaking up of Bwithh's text. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 16:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>
<dd>Many of the article's claims have yet to be referenced - his early purportedly "championship winning" skating career is unverified. His stage career is unverified (and we have little idea of what level he was acting at - key player or minor role). The claim that he was the lead in an award-winning short film is unverified -"Susanne Aernecke"+"Josephine" gets 9 google hits of which 2 are somewhat relevant (counting all the multi-language imdb hits as the same), neither of which confirm that the film won any recognition - its not even listed in Aernecke's IMDB profile<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=zS7&amp;q=josephine+%22Susanne+Aernecke%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=zS7&amp;q=josephine+%22Susanne+Aernecke%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I can't find anything much with an alternate search using the film festival name either<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=otm&amp;q=%22hofer+filmtage%22+josephine&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=otm&amp;q=%22hofer+filmtage%22+josephine&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (24 hits for festival name + josephine + susanne; perhaps my German isn't good enough but I'm not seeing anything relevant here).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition there was some puffery-by-association over his film roles that I've now removed - his role in The Name of the Rose was a minor bit part as I pointed out in the first afd. Just because you've had a bit part in a movie with a Hollywood star (or in a German TV screenplay by a famous writer) doesn't confer encyclopedic notability by association.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming that the database references used are reliable, I think being a non-bit part actor in a major-award winning TV film is arguably sufficient here (though we don't know the extent of his role). Though as far as I can tell by references/searfching, Fremde liebe Fremde won ONE Grimmie not multiple and that was for its lead actress. Other awards went to the cinematographer, director, writer (again, the problematic notability-by-association puffery issue). I'm going to make adjustments accordingly</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the Marilyn Monroe business is not significant encyclopedically (there is no evidence even that he is an especially important collector, or that this legal case is especially significant, plus Wikipedia is not news report archive), and is at best a cut-down trivia section - otherwise there are undue weight issues which verge upon <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAPBOX_345c.html" title="WP:SOAPBOX">WP:SOAPBOX</a> misuse of Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marylin_Monroe_3cb5.html" title="Marylin Monroe">Marylin Monroe</a> part is clearly using Wikipedia as a soapbox per <a href="../../../b/w/i/User_talk%7EBwithh_8d3d.html" title="User talk:Bwithh">User talk:Bwithh</a>, so it fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, not to mention the many <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> flags all over the article.

<li>Growing up in Germany and holding German citizenship helps a bit with the TV expertise, but I commend you for not trusting me on this. I have no credibility that would be sufficient for a Wikipedia entry, which is why I searched for reviews of his performances. The shows and movies he lists are amply covered on the web, so his roles are certainly verifiable. Do they give him notability? I don't think so, unless I read some review that actually comments on his acting. On the MM scandal, I only glanced them over and watched the KCAL clip, but in what way do those clips differ from interviewing the next-door neighbor of a shooting victim at the scene of a crime in your local 9 o'clock news? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:59, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(unindent)We are not assessing the article as originally written by the subject. We are assessing an article which is the result of a standard editing process by other editors, including myself, none of which, to my knowledge, had any acquaintanceship with Mark Bellinghaus beforehand, so there is no COI. As far as I know, none of these editors has any personal investment, or any particular interest, in Marilyn Monroe memorabilia (I certainly don't), so the accusation of soapbox is equally misplaced, as is the suggestion of a campaign by a single purpose editor. These are simply <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herrings</a>. It is not an argument for deletion to single out the least important roles. These are there to flesh out the picture, and could for that matter be left out with no great detriment. It would be more useful to have proper observations on the more important (and referenced) roles, for example, <i>In 1991 he played actress Meret Becker's brother Kurti, in the multiple award-winning Fremde, liebe Fremde (Foreigner, Dear Foreigner). In 1993, he played Malte Borrell in the TV show SOKO 5113. He played Knut Sonntag in the hit TV show Immer wieder Sonntag, written by Herbert Lichtenfeld.</i> There does not seem to be a refutation of their worth, only that no reviewer noticed them (or at least no reviews are quoted, which is a different matter), but they are referenced, which is the wiki requirement. There is no wiki stipulation that reviews per se are mandatory. Regarding the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> flags {{Template:fact}}, these are specifically for information which "is not doubtful"; I see no reason, from observing the original editor's general behaviour, not to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> that they are true, unless anyone can point me to evidence that indicates differently. The MM clips and quotes differ from a next door neighbour, because the latter is interviewed as a bystander (i.e. it could be anyone), whereas Bellinghaus is interviewed purposefully because he is considered by those media to have something of particular significance to contribute through his prior learning and knowledge. I consider that I and other editors on this article have followed the guidelines properly and not thrown them anywhere. At the moment there are two reactions to the two parts of the article: 1) the Monroe is the important part 2) the acting is the important part. I suggest that, taken together, they delineate an individual who is not major, but who is of note, i.e. "notable". <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 19:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's a nice (in both senses of the word) lateral approach, but of course has to remain hypothetical and has not (yet at least) been incorporated into the guidelines. I'm particularly interested in the less mainstream aspects of culture and society, as I find they're a valuable aspect of the whole and think there should be a place for them in wiki, provided a degree of notability is credible. I've speedy-deleted plenty of "non-notable" articles which are commonplace — mostly subject-created — but occasionally one seems worth bothering with, despite its genesis and even its initial state. I have enjoyed and found my knowledge enriched by articles of this nature, some of which might well not have been started without their self-author, but would certainly (as in this case) not had any chance of being kept had independent editors not found them worthwhile. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment from Mark Bellinghaus</b> For anyone interested, Mark has left me a lengthy argument for keeping this article on my talk page (he mistakenly addresses me as Brad Patrick, the Legal Counsel of the Wikimedia Foundation, presumably because he saw the link I have to a Brad's anti-spam message on my userpage). As the argument is lengthy, I think it best that interested persons should look at it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bwithh#Your_contribution_to_Mark_Bellinghaus_page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bwithh#Your_contribution_to_Mark_Bellinghaus_page" rel="nofollow">my talk page here</a>, rather me pasting here. If it is preferred that it is pasted here, please go ahead and do so. Note that I have previously emphasized to Mark that 1) this is a community discussion 2) he is welcome to join in 3)it is not my sole decision whether to keep this article or not or whether to cut down the Monroe section in a kept article or not. As Mark's message is intended to persuade people to keep this article based on what he views as the importance of the Monroe controversy, I am bringing it to the attention of the afd discussion group here. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 11:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>sidenote</b> Mark has pointed out to me that there are other unreliable blog-based sources in the article (in the Monroe section) - I agree with him on this - such as the "Citizen Media" link - (I did not <i>add</i> these links however, as he thinks). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 11:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I added the Citizen Media link, and it doesn't look like a blog by the classic definitions. It claims to be a New Mexico news and education group, has multiple articles on different subjects, and the writing reads like it's written by someone who knows a few things about journalism, and is trying to appear balanced. Anyway, even not counting The Citizen, that leaves the Long Beach Press Telegram, KCAL, and two from the Los Angeles Independent, which would be all right sources for the controversy and subsequent lawsuit, but aren't really about Bellinghaus per se - they don't say much about him, they're really about the exhibit. Trialsanderrors writes the German roles aren't much. So I'll change my opinion to delete on an article about Bellinghaus, and a weak vote for rewriting about the controversy - weak, because I've had enough and am not going to do it if no one else will. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'll debate the issue with Tyrenius after the AfD, but until then, why spend the time on nuances until the AfD is decided? A draft for a trimmed version is at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mark_Bellinghaus/Mark_Bellinghaus_%28collector%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mark_Bellinghaus/Mark_Bellinghaus_%28collector%29" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
