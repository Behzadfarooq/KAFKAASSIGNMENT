<dd>There are a lot of outlandish claims and obvious problems with the article. They start at the third sentence: "<i>He was almost immediately born as an orphan because of his parents's subsequent exposure and fall to the AIDs virus and the perpetual lacking of clean drinking water.</i>" There is exactly one confirmed case of <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> from the 1950s, and it was stored plasma from someone in Sub-Saharan Africa in 1959. If he was born in 1959 this means his parents had to have both died from AIDS in 1959 or 1960, long before it was known to exist (the next single known case is in 1969.) This sentence is obviously false and I think much, if not all, of the rest of the article is too, and I won't waste my time checking every single claim in here. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font><font color="blue">master</font><font color="green">ka</font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Blend Flag.jpg">Image:Blend Flag.jpg</a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font style="background:purple"><font color="yellow">Impart wisdom</font></font></a></sup> 05:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Michael is a popular name in America and Tang is the most popular name in China so to have a another person attend the same high school is not rare...but rather very likely. Thus the former reason does not make sense at all.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ever since I stumbled upon this article, I have been captivated by this overwhelmingly intriguing biography and have done some extensive research thereafter.

<li><b>Comment</b> It is quite intresting indeed because some users on wikipedia might not remember that they too were once "newbs" on this site by nevertheless wish to contribute just the same. Just because u dont have a long list of contributions behind you does not mean you have not spent hours on hours reading articles from this site and gaining experince on how this site works. Instead of labeling articles as "crap", one might take the less agressive approach to suggest change and actually SCROLL DOWN THE PAGE to find the link. I m sry to inform u that this is not a page on Geroge Washington or Newton, but rather a page on a smaller figure of science and education. Though his contributions to science were just as important, there have not been countless sources written about Mr.Tang yet. Well initially, this article has a base. Though small, it is there and one should attempt to EDIT and HELP and PROVIDE SUPPORT and CHANGE rather than partake in a warpath with lists of accusations. A person of experince should rather, in my opinion, take the time to find the correct info and edit the actually article. Besides, experience should fear the vitality of youth. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Zhou_3a2c.html" title="User:Johnny Zhou">Johnny Zhou</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnny_Zhou_4193.html" title="User talk:Johnny Zhou">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnny_Zhou_86fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnny Zhou">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Fact that the only "keep" votes are obvious sockpuppets and/or friends really cements the case. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:04, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> Believe my children believe in the truth...have faith for all the extra info was from a personal phone interview with the professor himself.

<li><b>Note:</b> I have struck out all of the clear duplicate votes. All of the other "keeps" are no doubt sockpuppets or meatpuppets as well, of course, but having not run a CheckUser I won't cross them out. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:22, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>As a consolation to Mr. Zhou, this should get a sock puppet award. It's up there with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Spanjo_1ad0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Spanjo">Spanjo</a>, but more creativity in the article space. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE">TKE</a> 03:16, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I will say this once: those ppl are not "sock puppets" ...they r inhabitants of my district that feel passionate about the professor. THEY ARE NOT SOCK PUPPETS ...OMG...HOW MANY TIMES MUST I REPEAT IT....ALL THE ppl voting for deletion ARE SOCK PUPPETS and MEATPUPPETS..ur accusations r just as baseless as this one...and one more thing...life is creative if u want it to be and mr.tang did do just that <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Zhou_3a2c.html" title="User:Johnny Zhou">Johnny Zhou</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnny_Zhou_4193.html" title="User talk:Johnny Zhou">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnny_Zhou_86fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnny Zhou">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Yes. You, Mr. Mike Tang of Connecticut, are being very creative with your life. I was giving a compliment, backhanded as it was for your biography. However, any rational person can identify about a dozen historical discrepencies on a quick scan alone: first being that the real Professor Tang lives in <b>China</b>, as can be found on your reference to the real professor's website.. At this point, I'm only carrying on the discussion because you continue to insult the intelligence of every person on Earth with this posturing. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE">TKE</a> 18:52, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thx you for ur compliment, I m honored. I've never said that the professor had any relation to me but rather that the chinese community of my area held him in high regards thus "creativity" is not the main point of the issue but rather that of mere "truth and facts." You may take out what u feel is ..as u deemed "historical discrepencies" for wikipedia is a land where "anyone can edit" even u! <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Zhou_3a2c.html" title="User:Johnny Zhou">Johnny Zhou</a> 04:20, 22 March 2006 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Zhou_3a2c.html" title="User:Johnny Zhou">Johnny Zhou</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnny_Zhou_4193.html" title="User talk:Johnny Zhou">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnny_Zhou_86fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnny Zhou">contribs</a>).</small>
