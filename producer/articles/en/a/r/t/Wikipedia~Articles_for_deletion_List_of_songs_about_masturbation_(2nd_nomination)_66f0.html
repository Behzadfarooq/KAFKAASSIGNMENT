<p>Due to some policy constraints set for this article, some circumstances have changed. See the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_songs_about_masturbation_6dc9.html" title="Talk:List of songs about masturbation">talk page</a> for more details on these circumstances. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_songs_about_masturbation_%281st_nomination%29_3d4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs about masturbation (1st nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs about masturbation (1st nomination)</a> for the previous ballot. The previous ballot was filled out back in the days that AfD (articles for deletion) Was called VfD (votes for deletion). The new policy on this song list has prompted a second nomination for deletion therefore votes on the previous ballot may not apply anymore (well maybe).</p>
<p>Before the policy was implemented, the list was at the point of unmaintainability as people originally thought that it also included songs that people think are about masturbation. If we look for songs that are intended to be about it, the list has become subtrivial listcruft. But if we let people add songs that have phrases that are <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innuendo.html" title="Innuendo">innuendo</a> to masturbation, then it would probably be unmaintainable.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It passed AfD (or VfD at the time) once.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikibofh, I think the fact that you put so much (wasted) effort into trying to salvage this entry is an excellent example of why we collectively need to be more proactive about not starting such non-articles to begin with and doing a better job of deleting them the first time when they do get made. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:39, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> Unencyclopedic. The discussion on the talk page illustrates the problem with lists like these. There are arguments over whether "milkshake" consitutes "ass-shaking", breast-shaking", or something else altogether. Deciding one way or the other requires an arbitrary call; because many implicated lyrical terms will be protologisms of uncertain usage, making that judgement call also by necessity contravenes WP:NOR. Further, it appears that the page is being populated under an entirely arbitrary criterion—a song is allowed if it seems to some editors to be "definitely about masturbation", but other songs that could also perfectly well be "about masturbation", but are not recognized by the editors as such, will not be admitted. Non-NPOV contruct. Next, we have the problem with the title. "<i>About masturbation</i>"? If a love song clearly mentions the word <i>masturbation</i> several times, I have little doubt it will be admitted. Yet, it may be highly inaccurate to list such a song under a title that claims it is <i>about</i> masturbation, when that word might simply be a minor feature of the lyrics. I think we should remember that <i>lists</i> and <i>articles</i> are very different contructs. By placing something in a list you are making a statement about that item, and you cannot qualify or nuance your statement the way you might in an article. Therefore lists should only be used for things where such a binary determination is clear and unambiguous. It either is, or it is not. For example: "List of member countries of the UN." "List of Japanese states." "List of Ford models manufactured and sold between 1970 and 2004." "List of astronauts who have landed on the moon."

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Interesting list, cruft is not a deletion criteria, and it passed a previous AfD. When that AfD passed, songs like Another Brick in the Wall were on it. Now we've cleaned it up so every song there is actually about masturbation, so its a worthwhile list. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>—How's my driving?) 19:53, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a>, although I could go either way.

<li><b>Keep</b> As per BD2412. Some would say this list was useless because the subject matter seems silly, but a social scientist or historian would find a list like this tremendously useful.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as unmaintainable and unencyclopedic list. It's not that the "subject matter seems silly", but that its contents are inherently ambiguous and unverifiable. It cannot be "kept orderly", since the criterion for being on the list is that some person thought some lyric was an allusion to masturbation. That is not remotely encyclopedic. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 23:30, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. No, thats what the list used to be like.

<ul>
<li>That's admirable, but it's not practical to have "policy constraints" on the content of Wikipedia articles. No one owns the article, the "keepers" may lose interest, and it's just an open invitation to edit wars.
<ul>
<li>So you think it would be better to not have any, and never remove a song that was placed there? I refer to how such songs as Another Brick in the Wall (Pink Floyd) and High Hopes (Frank Sinatra) and Iron Man (Black Sabbath) and Pinball Wizard (The Who) and Thunderstruck (AC/DC) and TNT (AC/DC) were on the list. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>—How's my driving?) 19:23, 16 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I would rather just not keep the article at all. It's inherently just a matter of opinion what should be included, the criteria are ultimately arbitrary, and why should one (or two or three) editors' opinions be considered definitive? There's no ability to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the contents. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 04:15, 17 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The consensus opinions of the editors contributing to an article should be considered definitive (at least until other editors choose to chime in and potentially change the consensus) because this is a wiki. It's no more arbitrary than any other article that requires the good judgement of the Wikipedia community. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 17:09, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikibofh has done what should be done with lists like this, so it can stay.
