<p>The main reasons for deleting this article are outlined on the talk page; basically a particular section was called into question and upon further inspection with the Mediation Cabal the entire article was found to be in violation. The opposing users have said they support a deletion in a private chat. I am also nominating the following related page because it is essentially an extension of the above page:</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although I agree that the YTMND article (as well as the "List of YTMND Fads" article) may have grown a little too large, I do not agree with deleting the article entirely. Apparently the root of the current problem can be traced to one or two trolls/vandals. Some concerned YTMND users are currently going through the proper channels to get the issue resolved.

<li>I don't know where else one would go for facts about a site like YTMND other than the site itself. Unlike corporate sites like Google or AOL, there is very little "legitimate" news and research on private yet popular sites like YTMND. I believe most would agree that YTMND is popular and significant enough to merit its own article, but I think many are not sure what would have to be done to make it compliant with Wiki rules. My knowledge of Wiki guidelines is admittedly not great, but I'm trying to learn as much as I can. InfinityDUCK 07:32, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The current article, in all its glory, is tragic. It is akin to a disaster zone, like MySpace. To sum up all the inane fads that have come and gone through the history of YTMND is monumental. Would anyone really take the time to groom this mess; to properly categorize, be it alphabetically or chronologically, or even link to specific YTMNDs that adhere to the alleged fad at hand? Does anyone really care for esoteric fads that have fallen into deeper obscurity? The list is as asinine as a good majority of the fads themselves. <a href="../../../l/a/l/User%7ELaLutteAvecCecil_708f.html" title="User:LaLutteAvecCecil">LaLutteAvecCecil</a> 07:29, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree... sort of. What I would like to see is a YTMND article that covers what the site is, the site's history, etc. and completely avoids going into detail about fads or particular sites. This would require cutting the "List of YTMND Fads" article entirely, then making major cuts to the main article. From there it would simply require rigorous moderating to prevent further "contamination." InfinityDUCK 07:38, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> The YTMND articles has always been historically accurate as possible, and has been maintained by good hearted YTMNDers/Wikipedians who believe in keeping this article accurate. This AFD was brought on by the users "Stukas" ("Dr. Ke" (Proof of this can be found at ytmnd.com/wiki/index.php?title=Stukas&amp;oldid=4181 / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=51949530&amp;oldid=51949271" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=51949530&amp;oldid=51949271" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=51949530&amp;oldid=51949271</a>) and "Refault", in response to their posts here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51923444" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51923444" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51923444</a>. They also raided the YTMND.com/wiki/ page with their trolling, found here: www.ytmnd.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;diff=4188&amp;oldid=4177.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Max, the owner of YTMND himself, researched the troll by IP search, confirmed that the Stukas of YTMND.com and YTMND.com/wiki were the same, and removed him from the ytmnd.com user list, deleting his YTMND sites. An email was sent to Max from Stukas, saying he was unjustly banned. Soon after, Refault posted a new section called "Admin Abuse" in response to the actions taken by Max (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=52207419&amp;oldid=52205860" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=52207419&amp;oldid=52205860" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=52207419&amp;oldid=52205860</a>), further adding false information to the article. In an attempt to revert this vandalism, Dr. Ke continously restored me deletion, proclaiming that it was a valid section of the article, when it fact, it has been completely orchestrated by both Dr. Ke (Stukas) and Refault, in an attempt to delete this article. I hope an administrator sees that I have researched this thoroughly, and I believe that the owner of YTMND, Max, would be happy to assist any Wikipedia administrator in order to revert this act of trolling. <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyrestorm_d9c6.html" title="User:Fyrestorm">Fyrestorm</a> 08:14, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. The first portion of the article is clearly encyclopedic. If problems exist with the rest of the article, they can be resolved within the article, not here in AfD. Third time's the charm... if this attempt at deletion fails, let's not rehash this debate a 4th time, folks. Wholescale deletion of an entire atricle is not the way to handle an item that has grown too large or contains too much minutia. That's what editors are for. I'm not sure that the YTMND Fads page is Wikipedia-worthy as a topic, but that article is separate and should have a separate AfD discussion if the result of this debate is "Keep". <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidGC_8793.html" title="User:DavidGC">DavidGC</a> 16:24, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
