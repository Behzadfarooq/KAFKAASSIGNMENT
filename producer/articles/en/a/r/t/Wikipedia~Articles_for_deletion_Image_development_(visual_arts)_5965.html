<p>Wikipedia is not a Dictionary, the definition here contradicts sources and the meaning ascribed to the phrase is Original Research.

<dd>What's your real problem? Just because you've never heard it used, doesn't mean it isn't. And now you seem to have a problem with the consensus to keep the article.

<dd>It doesn't matter how many times you challenge it. It doesn't matter how many people you dispute. It doesn't matter how many times you repeat your accusations. Denying the obvious doesn't make it any less obvious. Those two words have clearly defined factual meaning in printed dictionaries. When the words are combined, the meaning is clear in the referenced context of how they are used. It's like denying that 2.13 + 2.17 = 4.30 because you haven't seen the equation in print. Unless you can get the words "image" and "development" removed from every dictionary, It's your opinion versus common sense. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 19:49, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have achieved some consensus: "Those two words have clearly defined factual meaning in printed dictionaries". I agree 100%. Any further 'explanation' of the words is obviously erronous in that it precludes the obvious meaning and narrows the definition. This makes the article entirely misleading and there's certainly no need to have an encyclopedia entry about it, unless of course, there is verifiable evidence to the contrary? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavemon_bc43.html" title="User:Davemon">Davémon</a> 15:28, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are cleverly trying to make it like the article is defining the term. It's not. The sources define the term by using the term in context. Just because you expect to see it word-for-word as stated in the article, doesn't mean the article is the primary source of the term. The article does not narrow the definition, because the article is not defining it. The article is citing usage, how it may be used, and contrasting it from terms less broad or the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homonym.html" title="Homonym">homonym</a> uses of the term. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 22:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Question:</b> Is <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image_development_%28visual_arts%29.html" title="Image development (visual arts)">Image development (visual arts)</a> used in relation to three dimensional creation, or is it only used in the context of bringing into existence two dimensional entities?

<dd>Not that I'm the authority for all uses of the term, I would say that any method of creating or editing images is image development. If you are talking about scanning or modeling images, it wouldn't be a stretch to call <a href="../../../3/-/d/3-D_modeling_6d92.html" title="3-D modeling">3-D modeling</a> image development.

<dd>I don't know where it originated. The first time I saw it was back in 2000 on a poster for a creative advertising awards event. It showed symbols for each category. The "image development" symbol was a camera and a paintbrush. I wish I could remember the sponsor. I remembered the term because I was putting together a talk on art specialties and was conflicted about calling photographers "illustrators." I don't know if anyone has ever officially defined it in print word-for-word, seeing as how the meaning is obvious when used in context. The wikipedia is full of these umbrella terms and loosely defined terms. I don't see a problem with visual arts having a few. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 06:14, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article does not state that image development is specific to computers. It says mainly but not exclusively computers because most of the sources referenced refer to computer graphics. The term would probably not have emerged if it were not for computer graphics making it easier to combine techniques and blurring the distinction between the techniques. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 19:49, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Davemon, now you are trying to make it like everything anyone says on the wikipedia, including discussion pages, needs to be sourced. Wikipedia policy allows for people to have opinions. You seem to be stuck on the computer graphics aspect. Again, image development does not exclusively apply to computer graphics. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 22:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Simply offering opinions doesn't help progress a debate which is fundamentally about verification. As an aside, if image development isn't about computer graphics, then you must admit that the article is heavily skewed in that direction - and has mislead the anonymous user below. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavemon_bc43.html" title="User:Davemon">Davémon</a> 15:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article is not skewed. It's not saying that image development requires computer use.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> While browsing around Wikipedia in attempts to learn more about graphic design, desktop publishing, illustration, etc. various topics, I saw 'image development' and a link to this article more than just once or twice. I found it to be a useful and interesting article (I'm already aware of your 'notability is not subjective' point, no need to remind me), and it clarified my previous hunch on what it basically was (mostly stuff like computer graphics, photo editting, etc.). The way I see it, if I already thought subconsciously that 'image development' had to do primarily with a generalization of computer graphics rather than, say, development of images such as paintings or sketches and such, then the term must be used in that context enough for a general amount of people to view the term in that way. There is such a thing as slang terms and jargon, which Wikipedia holds a plethora of articles on, I can assure you (I like to look up slang terms and such that I find interesting here when bored, they've got much smaller-scale, less-widely-used term definition/articles than 'image development', trust me). I also found the article was a good generalizer so that I could find something that linked or referenced to various other related articles, which I, and probably others that are attempting to learn more on the various related subjects, was interested in. I find no 'good' reason to delete this article outright, and the reasons cited to delete it seem highly exaggerated or untrue, especially that last note, with '...doubtful, and not notable'. What do you mean by 'notable'? Many different sites, scraper sites or no, and articles in Wikipedia itself seem to find it notable enough to apply the terms in themselves and link to this 'unnotable identification of the word-pairing as a phrase'. At the very most, maybe a clean-up tag or something of the like, but full-on deletion is somewhat ungrounded and a tad on the ridiculous side. I've seen much worse articles that still have plenty of chance to be altered, merged, or improved rather than deleted outright.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Hi, could you sign your comment please? I note this is the only edit to come from this users IP address. With regards to not notable - I mean that it hasn't been written about by reliable secondary sources, i.e. if you looked it up in a "Dictionary of Art" or a "Dictionary of Design" it would not appear - it simply doesn't have status as a term any more than 'sandwich making' does - it doesn't matter how many people use those two words together, if no reliable source has written <i>about</i> the use of the term, then it's not notable (i'm basing that on <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> - and am aware that whilst the words are not new - the idea that they carry a specific meaning is new). Scraper sites are just robot-sites that copy wikipedias content and add advertising to it - so don't help establish the terms use or notability. Secondly, your assumption about "image development" having to do with computer graphics isn't actually borne out by the references given in the article - 'image development' is generally used in it's broadest, most obvious sense - to mean anything to do with the process of making an image (there are examples of this misappropriation of references on the talk page, two of them specifically use the term with reference to sketching, painting etc.) - so your previous hunch wasn't clarified - so much as you have been mislead by this article. If it were to be cleaned up to reflect the reality of the use of the 'phrase' it would just be one line: See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image.html" title="Image">image</a> <a href="../../../d/e/v/Development.html" title="Development">development</a>. As for a 'good' reason to delete it, nothing stated in the article is verifiable - it contravenes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>,<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enot.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="Wp:not">Wp:not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary</a>, and it will not only mislead people as to the actual nature of the word-pairing but also lowers wikipedias standards as an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavemon_bc43.html" title="User:Davemon">Davémon</a> 14:53, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article states why the term is used and contrasts it from corporate image development. According to Davemon logic, there doesn't need to be an article for any term that includes more than one word if the words are individually defined. So Davemon must not think terms like "computer science" and "graphic design" need articles as well. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 22:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
