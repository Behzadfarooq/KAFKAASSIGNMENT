<p>Philadelphia Stickers are a group of people, or characters that are drawn on some sort of adhesive paper, and then apllied to public items as a form of grafitti. The act of stickering was started by EM3 who wrote that in letters on stickers. Later, El Toro and Bob Will Reign began, and used free postal stickers, with deco paint markers. After them, Nose began, and following him Fingaz and Frog. These people along with question Josh formed the sticker crew known as NBC. These people remained fairly alone in the sticker world except for perro, and some other sticker artists. In 2006 several more sticker artists began and the number of stickers increases extremely. Formerely, sticker artists to mention are Under Water Pirates, Bloopa!, MORG, Malic, Tic Toc, CZR 7, Sea r Zea, Mousse, Commy, Juce, Sae42, Tweekz, Ronin, Zu Dragon, One Eyed Fee, Spook, Wheres Dash, Sophlice, Mr.G, Anonyme, Gump, Sour Mash, Creeper,</p>

<p>He lived and studied under his father in Najaf until 1991. During the Shia uprising of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> he actively took part in the fighting against Saddam's <a href="../../../b/a/27/Ba%27ath_Party_2744.html" title="Ba'ath Party">Ba'ath Party</a> but also acted as a force of moderation attempting to minimize revenge killings. When the uprising was crushed he was forced to leave <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. His father died a year later in 1992 at the age of 93, while still under house arrest in Iraq.</p>
<p>In exile in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, he worked for the al-Khoei Foundation a charitable foundation set up by his father in 1989, becoming its head in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> when his brother, <a href="../../../s/a/y/Sayyid_Mohammed_Taqi_al-Khoei_b1ba.html" title="Sayyid Mohammed Taqi al-Khoei">Sayyid Mohammed Taqi al-Khoei</a>, was assassinated whilst driving back to <a href="../../../n/a/j/Najaf.html" title="Najaf">Najaf</a> from a visit to <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerbala.html" title="Kerbala">Kerbala</a>.</p>
<p>He was also an outspoken critic of <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s rule: "The regime's criminal acts, beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, have been never-ending. Executions, the closing of schools, mosques and shrines sacred to Shia worshipers; the burning of old religious scriptures; looting the sacred sites of gifts left by presidents and kings.". He did however, also call for unity. Speaking in December 2002 he said "We are looking for a new Iraq in which everyone has a share... we want to forget the past and shake the hand of everyone"</p>
<p>He returned to Iraq in April <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> after the fall of Saddam despite being warned of the dangers. He arrived in Najaf on 3 April. Speaking to The Times upon his arrival to the city, he said everyone "wanted news on Baghdad because they see that as the key test to whether this will be 1991 all over again." Though assigned protection, the protective unit could not follow him into the shrine of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_924a.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Talib">Imam Ali</a> in Najaf on 10 April 2003. Here he was attacked and hacked to death by a mob.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/q/Moqtada_al-Sadr_6c54.html" title="Moqtada al-Sadr">Moqtada al-Sadr</a> was suspected by U.S. and Iraqi authorities of ordering the assassination. According to witnesses, at the mosque he was walking with Haidar Raifee Killidar, the custodian of the shrine under Saddam, and they were confronted by an angry mob, some of whom are reported to have shouted "Raifee is back" and others "Long live al-Sadr". The mob killed Raifee with bayonets and knives; al-Khoei, who was critically injured by this time, was killed later. One witness has claimed he was taken to Moqtada's residence, on whose order he was fatally stabbed to death, though this account has been contradicted by others.</p>
<p>Al-Sadr claims the murderers were not his followers and that he in fact sent men to save al-Khoei from the murderers, but he seemed unconcerned over the death; additionally witnesses say that members of the mob claimed to be there on al-Sadr's orders, and that he had instructed them not to kill al-Khoei inside the mosque. Al-Khoei's close followers did not blame al-Sadr for the murder<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, but instead publicly blamed former Baath party members who also hated al-Khoei. On April 5, 2004, a warrant was issued for Sadr's arrest in connection with this killing. Arrest warrants were also issued for 12 men on charges of planning and carrying out the murder. The arrest warrants were issued by an Iraqi Judge, Raed Juhi, who is also the investigative judge in charge of the Saddam Hussain case.</p>
<p>Although a religious cleric himself, he was hated by some Iraqi religious scholars and leaders because of his close links with the American and British governments. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> In a trip to <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> in 2002, he was poorly received by the Iraqi community <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> who heckled "Go Back To America" as he was giving a speech in the city of <a href="../../../q/u/m/Qum.html" title="Qum">Qum</a>, some 150km south of <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>. When he arived in Najaf a few days before his death, none of the four <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marja.html" title="Marja">Grand Ayatollahs</a> in the city accepted to receive him, not even <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sistani.html" title="Sistani">Grand Ayatullah Al-Sistani</a>. This was mainly because he arrived in the city on the heels of the US forces and was assigned a special forces protection unit.</p>
<p>He was seen as a moderate cleric by the west and as pro-US by many Iraqis. British Prime Minister <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>, who met al-khoei for talks before his departure, said he was "a religious leader who embodied hope and reconciliation and who was committed to building a better future for the people of Iraq". His murder was also "strongly condemned" by US President Bush's administration.</p>
<p>He is buried alongside his brother and father inside the Imam Ali shrine in Najaf in a designated room for the al-Khoei family.</p>
<p>He leaves behind a wife and four children who live in London.</p>

<p>Travis Randall (Travis Michael Randall) was born December 9th 1972 in Spooner Wisconsin. Travis was the long time bass player for notable 1990's indie band Stone Bogart. Travis continued on to play in bands (Pink Slip, Midnight Fight, Defaulting) and has recently been connected to the band Guns and Roses. He joined Stone Bogart as the bass player never having played the bass or guitar. Travis is a trained drummer and continues to make guest appearances on various CD's playing bass, guitar, and drums.</p>
<p>In 1999 Stone Bogart released it's 2nd critically acclaimed CD “Whadayabench” in which Travis has song writing credits. Travis was known for his often alcohol fueled stage performances. Travis and drummer Steve Doerr were considered to be a highlight in the Tempe AZ music scene in the late 90’s. Upon the release of their 1996 release of “Enjoy” Stone Bogart was voted #2 best band in France by France’s main rock radio station.</p>
<p>In 2001 Travis founded Rock and Roll BBQ. Rock and Roll BBQ quickly became a popular cooking and music website (www.rockandrollbbq.com) and quickly grew into a small enterprise.</p>
<p>In 2004 Rock and Roll BBQ became a television show. The pilot was filmed with Jimmy Kimmel and Alice Cooper and was originally accepted and quickly dropped by Food Network. Food Network considered the food/music format to be too aggressive for their network.</p>
<p>In 2004 Rock and Roll BBQ released three original BBQ sauces that are available around the world. Travis is releasing and touring a solo CD in 2007. The rumored title of the CD is “The Whiskey is Talkin’ (So you need to Quiet Right Down)”</p>
<p>In 2005 Travis appeared in the award winning indie movie "Never Been Thawed".</p>

<p>Regulated Rewriting is a specific area of formal languages studying grammatical systems which are able to take some kind of control over the production applied in a derivation step. For this reason, the grammatical systems studied in Regulated Rewriting theory are also called "Grammars with Controlled Derivations". Among such grammars can be noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix Grammars</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Basic concepts</b><br />
<b>Definition</b><br />
A matrix grammar is a four-tuple <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i> = (<i>N</i>,<i>T</i>,<i>M</i>,<i>S</i>)</span> where<br />
1.- <span class="texhtml"><i>N</i></span> is an alphabet of terminal symbols<br />
2.- <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i></span> is an alphabet of terminal symbols disjoint with <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i></span><br />
3.- <span class="texhtml"><i>M</i> = <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>,...,<i>m</i><sub><i>n</i></sub></span> is a finite set of matrices, which are non-empty sequences <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/6/8/7686e5d493e5a88d88bb9134a15b9598.png" alt="m_{i} = [p_{i},...,p_{i_{k(i)}}]" />, with <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/2/3/023cc810f0ec386a71e5846889b5d75e.png" alt="k(i)\geq 1" />, and <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/0/1/e0126ca144c4391269883a91304ade8d.png" alt="1 \leq i \leq n" />, where each <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/d/c/ddc723efeabe0d7511df4f4caec915ba.png" alt="p_{i_{j}} 1\leq j\leq k(i)" />, is an ordered pair <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/0/6/40621cf3f5ea1fa2bf77e363582f80c2.png" alt="p_{i_{j}} = (L, R)" /> being <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/4/7/e473c96432cebb08bed27ca7a85c8b38.png" alt="L \in (N \cup T)^*N(N\cup T)^*, R \in (N\cup T)^*" /> these pairs are called "productions", and are denoted <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/6/d/56d99bf31fdb93136ab35d1d73c6cada.png" alt="L\rightarrow R" />. In these conditions the matrices can be writed down as <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/6/6/366a920c60d8911ffad91dd3e807b3fb.png" alt="m_i = [L_{i_{1}}\rightarrow R_{i_{1}},...,L_{i_{k(i)}}\rightarrow R_{i_{k(i)}}]" /><br />
4.- S is the start symbol<br /></p>
<p><b>Definition</b><br />
Let <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i><i>M</i> = (<i>N</i>,<i>T</i>,<i>M</i>,<i>S</i>)</span> be a matrix grammar and let <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> the collection of all productions on matrices of <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i><i>M</i></span>. We said that <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i><i>M</i></span> is of type i according to Chomsky's hierarchy with <span class="texhtml"><i>i</i> = 0,1,2,3</span>, or "increasing lenght" or "linear" or "withou <span class="texhtml">λ</span>-productions" if and only if the grammar <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i> = (<i>N</i>,<i>T</i>,<i>P</i>,<i>S</i>)</span> has the corresponding property.</p>
<p><b>Definition</b>(Derivation step)<br />

One of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal's most convoluted family trees belongs to the band known predominantly as Satan. Besides regularly undergoing name changes (Blind Fury and Pariah were only two of the aliases employed each time the group decided their original name was compromising their chances of success), the band's history regularly intersected that of any number of competing groups out of the Northeast, most notably Blitzkrieg and Skyclad. The seeds of the band that would become Satan were planted in Newcastle, England, toward the end of 1980, when a semifirm lineup consisting of vocalist Trevor Robinson, guitarists Steve Ramsey and Russ Tippins, bassist Graeme English, and drummer Andy Reed finally coalesced. The band's first single, the imminently collectable "Kiss of Death," was released by independent label Guardian Records in the first months of 1982, and after welcoming new drummer Sean Taylor and replacing singer Robinson, first with one Ian Swift, then with the more experienced Brian Ross (ex-Blitzkrieg), sessions began for a full-length album. The very heavy, almost thrash-like Court in the Act opus finally emerged in January 1984 through Neat Records (who else?) and was given mostly enthusiastic reviews. An equally successful bout of touring across the Channel in Europe followed, but the group was handed a major setback when the ever restless Ross decided to quit shortly after their return in order to resurrect Blitzkrieg. Lou Taylor, former frontman with Kevin Heybourne's post-Angel Witch project, Blind Fury, was soon tapped as replacement, but his domineering ways soon led to the questionable adoption of the Blind Fury handle, causing no small amount of confusion among the fans and effectively disassociating what used to be Satan with any benefits arising from their recently released album -- smart one boys! Taylor also convinced the band that they would be better served by toning down their intensity somewhat for 1985's more hard rock-oriented Out of Reach, which was released by the fledgling Roadrunner label. Not surprisingly, the album's poor performance in the marketplace inevitably raised serious doubts about all of these stylistic changes and name-swapping shenanigans, resulting in the abrupt and convenient dismissal of both Taylor and Out of Reach as one and the same big mistake, followed by yet another about-face to resurrect the Satan name.Enlisting with German record company Steamhammer, Satan hired new singer Michael Jackson (not "Jacko," of course) and saw a return to heavier fare, first on 1986's Into the Future EP, then with 1987's semireturn to form, Suspended Sentence. Oddly enough, both of these releases fared far better in continental Europe (where they toured with Running Wild later that year) than back home in the U.K., revealing a territorial shift in heavy metal appreciation that also affected the careers of English contemporaries like Savage and Jaguar. Still, it was by now clear that Satan's window of opportunity was most definitely closing, and as if to prove themselves further unworthy of true stardom, the band once again decided to drop their moniker in exchange for the purportedly less confining Pariah -- whatever! The Satan saga ends here, but in later years, Pariah would go on to record two albums before certain members departed to join the ranks of avant-folk-thrashers Skyclad.</p>

Micro-dieseling is a process in which an air bubble transitions from a low pressure zone to a high pressure zone resulting in adiabatic compression. This is also called Pressure-Induced Thermal Degradation. This may produce localizad temperatures in excess of 1.000ºC resulting in the formation of carbonaceous by-products and acelerated oil degradation.</p>

<p><b>Don Flack</b> is a fictional character on the TV series <a href="../../../n/y/_/CSI%7E_NY_63ad.html" title="CSI: NY">CSI: NY</a>. He is played by <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Cahill_5180.html" title="Eddie Cahill">Eddie Cahill</a>.</p>
<p><br />
Flack is a detective with the NYPD, known for both his wry wit and his determination to hunt down suspects (even to the point of chasing them down alleys and over rooftops). He was mentored by another cop, Gavin Moran, who he is later forced to arrest after it comes to light that Moran concealed evidence during the course of an investigation (episode 117, "The Fall"). He is both a colleague and a friend to the members of the New York Crime Lab. After <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_Bonasera_2416.html" title="Stella Bonasera">Stella Bonasera</a> is attacked in her apartment by her unstable boyfriend, Flack gently helps her through when he comes to the hospital to take her statement (episode 221, "All Access"). His friendship with <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_Taylor_5aad.html" title="Mac Taylor">Mac Taylor</a> is tested when Taylor uncovers evidence that one of Flack's men is a dirty cop and asks Don to turn over his memo notebook to prove it. Though Flack eventually capitulates, their relationship is a bit tense for a some time after (episode 308, "Consequences," episode 310. "Sweet 16").</p>
<p>Flack is critically injured when a bomb goes off in a building he and Mac are evacuating. Until their rescue Taylor is able to keep Flack alive using a shoelace and prior experience in the Beirut barracks bombing. Flack remains unconscious for the remainder of the episode, but has since fully recovered (episdoe 224, "Charge of this Post").</p>

<p>For over forty-three years Hampstead Theatre has enjoyed theatrical success. Founded in a Scout Hall in the heart of Hampstead village, Artistic Director James Roose-Evans instigated artistic policies which remain today.</p>
<p>Philosophy Hampstead Theatre identifies and produces important new writers. We challenge established writers and seek out the best international work to bring to London. Our plays are sometimes provocative, always intelligent, often full of laughter. The opening season in 1959 - 60 included two new plays by Harold Pinter, The Room and The Dumb Waiter, which transferred to the Royal Court Theatre, Eugene Ionesco's Jacques and The Sport of My Mad Mother by Ann Jellicoe.</p>
<p>A move into temporary accomodation In 1962 Hampstead Theatre moved to a temporary portacabin in Swiss Cottage. Under successive directors - Vivian Matalon, Michael Rudman, David Aukin, Michael Attenborough, Jenny Topper and currently Anthony Clark, Hampstead Theatre has developed a national and international reputation for the presentation of new plays. And the portacabin become a much loved performance space by writers, directors, actors and audience alike. Until now.</p>
<p>Our new home In our new building the artistic policy will remain the production of the best British and international new plays. The Auditorium has been built for writers who understand actors. The Michael Frayn Space will provide a dedicated arena for our rich and varied education and workshop programme.</p>
<p>From the very beginning actors and writers have loved working at Hampstead Theatre, often starting their celebrated careers with us. It will be no different here in our new building.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Hampstead Theatre is not only a magnificent purpose-built state-of-the-art theatre about to celebrate its fourth birthday but a company fast approaching its fiftieth, with a particular mission: to find, develop, and produce new plays to the highest possible standards, for as many people as it can encourage to see them.</p>
<p>Their work remains rooted in the community but is both national and international in its scope and ambition. Occasionally, it will do a revival of an old play but only when there is an artistic and financial imperative to do so.</p>
<p>The list of playwrights who had their early work produced at Hampstead Theate who are now filling theatres all over the country and beyond include Simon Block, Michael Frayn, Brian Friel, Terry Johnson, Hanif Kureishi, Mike Leigh, Abi Morgan, Rona Munro, Tamsin Oglesby, Harold Pinter, Philip Ridley, Shelagh Stephenson, Debbie Tucker Green, Crispin Whittell and Roy Williams.</p>

<p>CIC'S first show was September 22, 2000 in the front of the bar "Wise Guys" 2 months later the bar changed owners and it became "The Prodigal Son" famous for the free bacon Wednesdays. Sadly the Prodigal Son had a grease fire and is no longer with us.</p>
<p>In October 2001 CIC moved to Frankie J's on Broadway becoming one of the first companies to produce shows in that space. Frankie J's on Broadway changed its name to "The Spot" in 2006.</p>
<p>In November 2003 CIC moved to its current home "The Cornservatory Theater" where they are currently the resident late night company.</p>

<p>Pundit Sahadeo Tiwari</p>
<p>Pundit Tiwari was born in the village of Sarwan in Bihar,India on 25th February,1892.He came to Trinidad as an Indentured Immigrant in 1910 and later married Sunbass Tiwari(not related).This marrige produced two sons:Ramakant and Surrindra and, five daughters: Mayanti,Shanti, Savitri,Kanti and Reanti.In January 1932,Tiwari established The Sanatan Dharma Board of Control(Port-of-Spain Gazette:17th January 1932).The principal objective of the organization was to unify Hindus and further the interest of the Hindu religion among the Hindu section of the local community.The Sanatan Dharma Board of Control was based in Tunapuna and was composed of predominantly orthodox,practising Pundits. Pundit Tiwari was the first Pundit to perform a Hindu marriage ceremony or Vivah Samskara in the day despite vehement opposition from other Pundits who even threatened his life.The Hindu marriage ceremony at the time was performed in tht night and this resulted in the procession from the boy side or Baraat having to stay overnight.The family of the girl side or Dulahin had to look after and entertain the Baraatians,a rather costly exercise. It was because of such economic circumstances that Pundit Sahadeo Tiwari felt it best to perform the marriage ceremony of Francis Jairam Bhopalsingh and Rajoo Narayansingh in the day.The ceremony took place on April 23rd 1933 at 11:00 am in Tunapuna at the Old Railway Station(Port-of-Spain Gazette-20th April,1933).Pundit Tiwari refused to succumb to the opposition against him for doing the ceremony in the day.He imported a book from India called the Vivah Paddhati,a Hindu manuel on the marriage ceremony and was able to silence his opposition.Debate among the elite (Panchayat) was simple.A wedding performed in the night meant that the Dhruva Taara (North Pole Star) was shown to the bride and because the star was fixed, it was used to demonstrate to the bride that she should remain fixed in her commitment to her marriage.However, if the ceremony was done in the day, then Surya Darshan or the Sun was shown and it was made clear that the Sun held the same significance of the North Pole Star which was that it is in a fixed position.Thus,the validity of the day wedding was established. Pundit Sahadeo Tiwari died on the 14th April 1972.During his life he tutored a number of well known Pundits such as the late Ramcharan Byragie,the late Satnarayan Panday and Pundit Param among others.</p>

<p>Dana L. French (1958 - ) is a prominent U.S. computer scientist working in the fields of business continuity, disaster recovery, and high availability. He has designed and written numerous software packages to automate the processes of disaster recovery and high availability. He is most noted for his approach to system administration as an automated process, rather than an interactive one. His work as a programmer and system administrator has influenced the design and implementation of Unix systems in organizations all over the world and is the source of the commonly used phrase "enterprise wide unique". His business function approach to system administration has caused a global shift in the way Unix system administrators perform their work.</p>
<p>He operates several companies that specilize in providing business continuity services to large world wide organizations. These companies provide services that include consulting, disaster recovery facilities, application and business function hosting.</p>
<p>French is well known in the Unix community for his advanced shell programming skills and is a noted advocate of Korn Shell programming. He provides source code for most of his programming work on-line free of charge. One of his most well known shell libraries is "shell curses", which is a shell script implementation of the "C" language "Curses" library. Another is "kshSQL" which is a Korn Shell implementation of a complete SQL database system. French is also the author of "shunix", which is a project to implement all of the GNU Unix utilities entirely in shell script code.</p>
<p>French is also well known as providing a MicroEMACS binary executable repository for a very wide variety of operating systems. MicroEMACS is a widely used programmers text editor. Linus Torvalds, the developer of linux, is a notable MicroEMACS user, and is known to frequent this site. French has provided continuous access to this repository since 1995.</p>
<p>French currently works as a business continuity consultant, and teaches courses in disaster recovery planning and Korn Shell programming. He is an author and publishes articles on these topics regularly.</p>

<p>Urban is a massively multiplayer on-line RPG game based on the streets and cities that we live in today. Originally created in 2002, Urban is based on a basic RPG format with a theme of street life with gangs, thugs, street racing, business, the list is endless. As development of the game has progressed, it has expanded to include businesses and complex levels of society dictating how the game works. The game is free to play and in development all the time.</p>
<p>Urban is played directly through your web browser without the downloading of any files and can be accessed from any computer with an internet connection in the world. Urban can be played for as much or as little time as you like each day and is a continuous unending community. As it is a role playing game, you create a character in the game and take the persona of the character in the game. This means that you make all choices for the character in the game including which gang to join, which car to drive and which characters you associate with. The choices you make in the game, affect you and others from that point on in the game. There is no "undo" button in Urban. Every action you make, every word you say forms your reputation which other players and the game judges you from that point on.</p>
<p>Urban relies on players interacting to create the society in the game. From the first time you log in to the game, you will have players contact you for trades or to join gangs, suburbs, sponsors e.t.c. To be successful in the game, you need to have those who you trust and deal with and those whom you dislike most. After only a few days, you will have developed a network of friends and contacts in the game. Working together in gangs, suburbs, sponsors or against each other using hit lists, factory raids, you will progress faster through the game. In addition to this, urban has a chat box which can be used while playing the game, a chatroom and several message boards ranging on topic from game issues to issues in the wider world. The game also has a newspaper produced by the players for the players reporting on events happening in the urban world.</p>

<p>Mr. John was founded by Morton Weiner in 1964 as a portable toilet service company. In 1981, the acquisition of Russell Reid was completed, expanding our scope of services into the non-hazardous liquid waste industry. Today, Russell Reid / Mr. John remains family owned and operates from 7 geographic regions serving New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware.</p>
<p><br />
<i>History of the company</i></p>
<p>In 1964, Morton Weiner was an entrepreneur living in Old Bridge, New Jersey. With a background in sales and a strong drive to be self employed, Morton teamed up with his brother David. They had an idea to start a route-based service business. At this time, Monmouth County was undergoing a building development boom, creating a need for temporary restroom services. Morton and David worked with a carpenter to build their first portable restroom (as seen in the picture to the right). Morton rented the unit to different construction sites across Monmouth County. After the success of this unit, Morton arranged to have several others created. The idea quickly grew into a successful business, shown through a 100% revenue in profits.</p>
<p>Over the years, Mr. John has continued to grow into a thriving business. Thanks to strong organizational efforts and its ability to adapt to technological changes, Mr. John has established a name for itself within the temporary restroom industry. Mr. John has since become a resource for a wide variety of companies in need of its services.</p>
<p>The Mr. John company has achieved much success over the years but it is still a work in progress. Every employee seeks to figure out how to adapt to changes in the industry and in society in order to meet each customer's individual needs.</p>
<p>Our current capabilities include a large variety of standard and VIP restrooms, luxury restroom trailer suites, restroom support services, wastewater and solid waste management, responsible disposal practices and much more.</p>

<p>The "Little People" is a peripheral social unit within the wider communal fabric of Hertford College, Oxford. Contrary to popular belief, the 'Little People' are not short in stature (PORGs) but are a healthy, functioning group of mature young adults. Their alienation within the social groupings of the college reflects in many ways the inferior judgements of their contemporaries in the year. Occasionally inter and outer college branching may take place, but they tend to operate as a single organism. Common features include a)what we call euphemistically an 'acid' wit b)a tendency to march aggressively into hall c) accepts new members by interview and d) an identifying tattoo on the left buttock.</p>

<p>NYCO is a four-man alternative rock group based in Chicago, Illinois. NYCO is led by Ted Atkatz, a former principal percussionist for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Other band members include Dave DelCiello, Dave Bowers and Devin Staples.</p>
<p>NYCO stands for New York, from which Atkatz hails, and Colorado, the home of a co-founder who has since left the group.</p>
<p>Atkatz's decision to leave a tenured position with the Chicago Symphony and make NYCO his career choice has become the main story line in articles about the band.</p>
<p>On Feb. 6, 2007, The New York Times featured NYCO in an article titled "From Lead Percussionist to Different Drummer," noting that it is rare for an orchestra musician to abandon the classical realm for a career in rock," and "It is even rarer for someone of Mr. Atkatz’s stature to do so."</p>
<p>Atkatz also teaches percussion at Depaul University.</p>
<p>Performing Songwriter magazine named NYCO's debut album "Two," released in 2005, one of the 10 best "do it yourself" albums of 2006.</p>
<p>Volkswagen Motors America included a NYCO song, "Let Me In," in its music promotion efforts for the 2007 U.S. Auto Show.</p>

<p>Greg McManus (1273-Present) is perhaps the most famous person who ever lived. His life story is in fact the basis for the Star Wars movies which were produced by George Lucas without consent of Mr. McManus. He also climbed Mount Everest....naked.....twice, just to prove that he could. This is because he is without a doubt the greatest human being (some believe he is in fact a God) to ever walk this earth.</p>
