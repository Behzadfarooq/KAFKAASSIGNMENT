<ul>
<li>Okay, I overlooked that. I can provide reasons why the film is notable, however, and I'll add them to the article once I've finished outlining them here. The first one that comes to mind is that the project is made completely by a group of non-professional teenagers aiming to produce a professional-level film. This is not "normal" either for independent films or Hollywood films. Second, the film is being shot entirely with entry-level consumer DV cameras, in order to demonstrate the potential of the format for films. While more common in independent filmmaking than in Hollywood, this practice is still notable due to considerable prejudice against using the DV format. Third, the film is being shot for sale with an extremely low to non-existant budget--also not a common practice in independent films, and certainly highly unusal in film as a whole. I could continue the list, but I hope this will be sufficient to establish the uniqueness of the project. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutcastJiob_0154.html" title="User:OutcastJiob">OutcastJiob</a>
<ul>
<li>It sounds like it's all about the technology. But you're not making any technology breakthroughs yourself, you're just using off-the-shelf equipment. How notable can it be that someone unable to raise enough money for normal equipment would try to use cheap equipment? I don't see how a low budget makes a film <b>project</b> notable prior to release. The fact that <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easy_Rider_4451.html" title="Easy Rider">Easy Rider</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blair_Witch_Project_a6fd.html" title="The Blair Witch Project">The Blair Witch Project</a> was made on the cheap is notable only because those movies were big commercial box-office successes. I'm baffled by your "objective of proving that this eqipment [sic] can provide a quality film." If a 16mm blowup like <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaving_Las_Vegas_59a0.html" title="Leaving Las Vegas">Leaving Las Vegas</a> can be a commercial success, I don't think there's much left to prove. All you need is a really good cinematographer. And really good lab work. But the big challenge is to get commercial-quality <i>entertainment</i> out of your "purely amatuer [sic] actors." Enjoy your premiere and the local press coverage I'm sure you'll get... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a><a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:38, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Apologies for the spelling errors, I will go fix them. Your criticism of the film "project" due it using off-the-shelf equipment and low-budget is uninformed at best. That is the entire point of the technical side of the production: that professional-quality films can be made with consumer equipment. You've missed the entire point. The "breakthrough" is that there is no breakthrough with the equipment. The low budget does not make the film notable; rather, the low budget coupled with the high standard for quality and the objective of a commercial release makes the film notable. Additionally, comparing 16mm to DV demonstrates a fundamental ignorance about film in general and the merits of the various formats in particular. While not as desirable as 32mm, 16mm is generally accepted as a quality film format, unlike consumer DV. To say that a terrible film can be shot on 16mm and still be a success proves nothing, as we all know that terrible films are produced on 32mm by Hollywood and still have great popularity at the box office for unknown reasons. Your argument about only needing a really good cinematographer (I assume you mean director of photography) is also invalid--if DV is truly a useless format, cinematography will not save the film.<a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutcastJiob_0154.html" title="User:OutcastJiob">OutcastJiob</a></li>

<li>I've seen hundreds of student film projects with no budgets that set out to prove the abilities of entry-level consumer cameras. I can't see how that makes this project unique. Also, about <a href="../../../r/e/v/Star_Wars_Episode_III%7E_Revenge_of_the_Sith_4ecb.html" title="Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith">Episode III</a>: this page is allowed to exist because it has already got significant press attention and it's part of a very famous film series. 131.211.210.12 07:44, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC) (Actually <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">User:MacGyverMagic</a> while not logged in, I already voted above).
<ul>
<li>True enough, but how many of those student films were made for sale? Regarding Episode 3, an unreleased film is an unreleased film--I agree that Episode 3 is special, but so is Trick'd Out. The popularity is nowhere near the same, of course, but just because it can't compete with one of the most anticipated films of the year doesn't make the project unimportant or non-notable. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutcastJiob_0154.html" title="User:OutcastJiob">OutcastJiob</a></li>

<li>Alright, I can have a laugh at myself, 32mm indeed, you'll have to excuse me, I was a bit tired at the time. That aside, all you experienced Wikipedians seem to have forgotten the rule about being polite and not calling people sock puppets unless you can prove it. Vanity is not valid, self-promotion is not valid (how on earth can it be self-promotion when there's no link to any associated website?), crystal ball is not valid (see above), non-notable is not valid (also see above), and sock puppetry is an unfounded and unproved insult. And 32mm was a result of exhaustion, not of an ignorance of film. Cinematographer is an extremely broad term. According to Wikipedia itself it means "A cinematographer (from 'cinema photographer') is one photographing with a motion picture camera. The title is generally equivalent to director of photography (DP or DoP), used to designate a chief over the camera and lighting crews working on a film, responsible for achieving artistic and techical decisions related to the image." That, however, is not the only possible usage, as the term can mean anyone who operates a film camera. And obviously just having a good cameraman--or even a good DP--won't cut it if the format is useless, as I said above. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutcastJiob_0154.html" title="User:OutcastJiob">OutcastJiob</a>

It's not really an apples and oranges comparison though, there was a fair bit of controversy about the similarities. I disagree that it's a POV rant, if you take out the bit about it being "<i>doubtful that they were intended for a future series at the time</i>" and "<i>(DS9) began doing so in later seasons, though its producers contend that the entire series was one long story arc</i>", then it's just showing you the similarities.

The fact the two shows have similarities, and that fans of B5 accuse DS9 of ripping off the idea -- and vice versa -- was one of the major sci-fi controversies of the 1990s.

<li>I agree. We just need someone to do this who has read enough on the subject without having a racist POV.

<li><b>PS</b> I'm not sure I understand the point of userfy-ing a vanity page if the author's sole contributions are to their own vanity page. If an established editor has a lapse in judgement and pulls a vanity, then userfying would make sense. But if someone comes here entirely and solely to promote themselves, I don't think userfying their vanity page is a good idea. At worst, it almost seems to encourage such vanity (<i>Hey, guys, those wikipedia dudes deleted that page I made to promote my lawn-mowing business, but they just put it right back up again in another part of their site! Sweet!</i>) and at best it just creates a page on Wikipedia that nobody, ever, will have reason to visit. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:46, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- this entry deserves to exist in the same way that it would be mentioned at a museum. i used encyclopedias as a kid in order to research topics, their history, etc... if you wanted to research the origins of the sex toy industry, and this couldn't exist on wikipedia, you'd have to take everyone's word for it based on what is on their commercial websites. isn't this supposed to be an unbiased source of that information? i think the entry should exist. i think that there is not enough information on here yet, but that's what's great about wikipedia. its entries can be improved with time.

<li>We are a 15-year old internet company. We're well-known and highly regarded within the alternative-sexuality communities we serve, and have aspired to a high ethical standard for as long as we've been in business. As a result, I've become accustomed to a warm reception 99% of the time when we reach out on the net. In this case, I simply assumed that since there were so many entries for companies of all kinds (including adult ones) that starting an entry wouldn't be a problem. Others would be free to edit or add to it. But it seems people object to having an entry for my company, and we don't really want to be where we are apparently not welcome. So I'll offer no further comments or argument. <a href="../../../j/t/40/User%7EJt%40stockroom.com_a31e.html" title="User:Jt@stockroom.com">jt@stockroom.com</a> 10:06, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Let me assure you that it's nothing personal, and we don't mean to be hostile. It's just that we deal with dozens of deletion requests per day, so we tend to be a little short-spoken about them. It happens quite often that people create pages about their own websites or small companies, in order to promote them or simply to have a page here. I'm <i>not</i> saying that you did just that, but it is generally assumed that if you (or your company) are famous, someone else will write an article about you. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:45, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>: The Stockroom really is the oldest adult toy company online (started back in the time when .gov and .edu were the only networks). I think this gives it historical value and a reason to be listed on Wikipedia. As far as BDSM, Fetish, and the history of Sex Toys and the Internet go, the site would be incomplete without at least making reference to this trailblazing company. - Juli Crockett, 9:16am 5 Apr 2005</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>: The Stockroom is a fixture within the BDSM community, and has been since the beginning of the internet. They help BDSM/fetish/kink groups in countless ways, and have been a pillar of the community. They strive to educate people, and present a beautiful aesthetic which you don't see on the newer "sex toy" sites. They seem to work hard to be more than just a company selling the best BDSM products, they care very much about the community they serve. - JH 9:46AM 5 Apr 2005

<li><b>Keep</b> and I'll add that it needs additional writing or a re-write so the copy feels less self-congratulatory. Yes, this is my first Wiki Edit. I was also contacted by a friend telling me the Stockroom was up for deletion and I disagree with that choice so I've decided to comment. I use Wiki daily but haven't feelt comfortable editing - it's clearly not my forte. <b>BUT!</b> It's true that the Stockroom was a pioneer in selling sex toys online and most importantly, they made readily available BDSM basic supplies early in the game. While many of you may not be familiar with the BDSM world and how the internet has greatly changed the way we traffic in this business, I am quite familiar. I can say, although not encyclopedically, that The Stockroom has had a major effect on bringing BDSM into the glowy light of our computer monitors and basically out of the dungeon. Sex and the internet are tied to one another and it's quickly becoming true that BDSM and the internet are nearly inseparable - certainly if you're working as a professional Dominatrix, as I am. JTs is rather crucial to the BDSM industry and with their attractive catalogues, website, and ability to create catalogues for both men and women, they have really cleaned up the image of BDSM and made it more accessible and a lot safer for those looking to experiment. The impact that JTs and its imitators has on Joe Blow From Idaho is astounding - the dark and mysterious objects fantasized about secretly now have pictures, descriptions, improvements, and are at the fingertips and available for experimentation from the comfort of the home. I think that's important. Just like books and DVDs - or Cloisonne Boxes on Ebay - I believe the effect is there. The tools of the trade were exceptionally hard to come by in the 80s and earlier and there was very little variation - by opening the online doors for BDSM and sex toy sales it really brought the business up several notches as well as private interaction. It's hard to put this in terms I feel are best for shorthand and Wikipedia, so I'll stop. In my experience the impact has been felt in a prfound and positive way and if you have questions I'll be happy to try to answer those specifically. (I've 12 years in the business and 6 more privately before that time). I do think the entry needs re-working but not a full deletion. M. Violet 05:25, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>This company's alexa rank is currently running in the 40,000s. Looking at the history, alexa rank has been highly variable but never better than 20,000. $5 M revenues makes this a pretty small company. While there are no hard and fast rules for companies, these are smaller than we generally keep. I'm a bit skeptical of the claim that they were first to sell to this niche via Internet and changed the industry. There were anonymous mail order companies before. Finally, the fact that the article was started by the founder counts against it. I believe the logic behind <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">no autobiographies</a> applies here as well. I have to vote <b>delete</b> for now but I'll look at the article again toward the end of the discussion period to see if Mviolet's edits can change my mind. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:08, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>While your sarcasm is irritating &amp; smacks of what is distasteful about online "community", I agree that I don't have verifiable sources for their affect on the industry other than experience &amp; observation. Reading the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">No original research</a> article, we're back to square one of their being original sellers of sextoys online (provable) &amp; the rest is experienced opinion.

Violet 23:35, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Experienced opinion" is exactly is out of place according to the policy in question. As for sarcasm, didn't I say "welcome"?

</ul>
<p>The Dru√Øcca Tradition is a Dutch coven, the main site is in Dutch (druicca.nl) and more will be translated at druicca.org.uk. For the english countries the Druicca Tradition is indeed not more than a webpage. But also in the english speaking countries people have made their own synthesis between neo-druidry and wicca and this is called druicca. There is no athority who can say who is druicca or not, everony who had made his/here own synthesis between druidry and wicca can call him/here self a druicca. No need to be initiated by a coven or whatever. An example of someone with here own synthesis of druidry and wicca is Laurie Cabot (lauriecabot.com), she calls this celtic wicca, I would call it druicca.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Articles on a particular coven are no more notable than articles on a particular church (unless it's a particularly large or historically notable church).

<li><b>Dont Delete</b> Druicca is just another term for celtic wicca, celtic wicca is an inacurate term for the synthesis of druidism and wicca, druicca is better. Druicca is not just one group in the Netherlands, its larger and known as celtic wicca. But I thought Druicca was a better name (celtic wicca&#160;? <a href="http://cyberpict.net/tns/ntwcc.htm" class="external free" title="http://cyberpict.net/tns/ntwcc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cyberpict.net/tns/ntwcc.htm</a>).

<li>I'm only suggesting, I'm not moving things (don't plan to also). It also could be the other way around, if you want to <b>redirect Druicca</b>, redirect it to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_Wicca_bcc5.html" title="Celtic Wicca">Celtic Wicca</a>; Druicca is a contraction of <b>Drui</b>dism and W<b>icca</b>.

<ul>
<li>Eh, what isn't made up? Gerald Gardner 'made up' wicca, someone 'made up' celtic wicca, of which serious students of the celtic culture say it is nonsence, it doesn't excist, just because you put celtic before wicca doesn't make it celtic. There is no celtic wicca, it is wicca with celtic elements, not celtic wicca. Most of the wicca traditions were 'made up' still I find a lot on wikipedia about these. I have not made up a tradition, I only thought of a better name for it, since there is no 'celtic wicca' because it is a synthesis between wicca and celtic ideas, a better name for this would be Druicca. It is a better 'made up' name for an excisting tradition. I don't understand why this is such a problem. I'm oke with the remarks above that it is to small to be noted as a separed subject. I'm asking all the people above who want to delete or redirect it, if it is oke with them to redirect the druicca subject to the celtic wicca subject, and <b>if</b> it is oke if I put a footnote under the page about my objections to the name 'celtic wicca' and my suggestion to rename it to 'druicca', that there are people in the Netherlands who already did that and why. If most people don't agree with me I realy won't push it, I thought this page was ment to discuss this subject? If most people want to delete the druicca subject, it will be so, if most people want to redirect it to celtic wicca, it wil be so, if most people want me to shut up about druicca on wikipedia, it will be so (just tell me), if most people think it's oke for me to put a footnote on the celtic wicca page, I will do so. I was just excited that I thought of a new name, I realy like the name, it has a nice sound to it. I also understand the value of people who guard the integrity of wikipedia, you have valid arguments, I give you mine arguments, you decide. It is up to you all. MoonCrow</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/r/u/Druidcraft.html" title="Druidcraft">Druidcraft</a> gets 623 unique Google hits, and is even used in the title of at least one book.

<ul>
<li>Yeh that's right, Druicca is not that well know jet, to small for a page of it's own, I agree with that. Google: with <b>Dru√Øcca</b> 13 unice hits, with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=druicca&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=druicca&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Druicca</a> you'll get a little bit more. But is the Druicca page still the vanity page you want to delete or is it a marginal subject that maybe could be redirected (maybe to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_Wicca_bcc5.html" title="Celtic Wicca">Celtic Wicca</a>)? Some of the Google hits for Druidcraft are for the Druidcraft Tarot, with is in Dutch translated as the Tarot of the Druids, a wrong translation, they thought Druidcraft means the Craft of the Druids. But it stands for the synthesis between Druidry and Witchcraft. I feel very strongly that Druicca is a better name for this. But maybe it's not the time to plublish this on wikipedia yet and should I first publish something in the Touchstone magazine of OBOD and write that book that I wanted to write for so long.

<li>Ofcourse I write positive about druicca, but there is no organisation you can join. Wicca, Druicca and Druidry don't look for people to convert; like they say in Hindoeism: all traditions are different like different rivers, but they al go to the ocean. Druicca is also much inspired on nature: the more varation there is (in nature, in traditions), the better. MoonCrow, april 12, 2005</li>

<li>The UK general election and the Bejing Olympics are specific events that will happen on a specific schedule in the future. These towers are towers that are planned for construction at some nebulous point in the future. The freedom tower is a better analogy, but in that case, it has been covered extensively in the media to the point that is encyclopedically notable. I would argue that the freedom tower is the exception to the rule.

<li>Not only is the nomination not political, I honestly don't understand how it could be. I landed on this page after following the random page link, saw it was nothing more than a dictionary definition. Following a quick google search nothing suggested to me any potential to expand it into an encyclop√¶dia article and so I nominated it for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay, I can redirect it to <a href="../../../h/u/a/Hua_Mulan_7c4b.html" title="Hua Mulan">Hua Mulan</a> easily enough. My original intent was to do that after deletion in order to get rid of the copyvio part, which in this case comes to half of the content. Does the uncertain copyright status of the English translation merit a revision to the history, or is it just not big enough a deal? It is all over the web, so there is no one likely to sue anybody, but it is also unlikely to be public domain. If it's not a big deal that it's in the history, then this can be taken as a withdrawl from VfD. --<a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDiderot_346d.html" title="User:Diderot">Diderot</a> 10:06, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>I say <b>delete</b>.

<li>As stated see Duke Nukem Forever. I find it very hypocritical that many of you voted based on it being unreleased when countless television shows, films, books etc that haven't been released have their own article (ex. <a href="../../../i/n/g/Inglorious_Bastards_69de.html" title="Inglorious Bastards">Inglorious Bastards</a>, which doesn't even have a finished script! See also <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_film.html" title="2006 in film">2006 in film</a>). STALKER is a very notable game with over 200K listings on Google including tons of previews, fan websites etc etc etc. The article merely needs a cleanup and expansion. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 18:56, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)

For much of the past 2 years, they couldn't even make the chart. The 43k rank is a 3 month-average spot ranking and is comparatively poor as websites go.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Shroomery is a unique website with over 31,000 registered users. It definitely is a source of knowledge, and like Erowid and other sites, should be mentioned here on Wikipedia. It is primarily about mushrooms, and even though hard drugs like heroin and such are discussed for the sake of information, isn't it the same with Wikipedia? Wikipedia has entire articles on drugs ranging from the harmless like cannabis to the harmful like tobacco and heroin. Don't limit the exchange of information. -Ravus

<p>Weak <b>keep</b>. I've heard of it before, and the website is apparently common knowledge among druggies. Not exactly on par with the cultural relevance of Erowid, of which one of the primary purposes of the site is to explore the effect of various drugs on consciousness. This seems to be almost entirely an informational resource, which is fine, but not necessarily wiki-worthy. However, the significance of the site in the drug-using community, it's uniqueness, and its overall popularity make it a keep.

<p>Heartwarming story, but this person gets only 19 Google hits, and the article reads like a promo, possible a copyvio (although nothing turns up on the internet). Improperly named, but I don't want to move it until notability is estabilshed, and not much in the article suggests encyclopedic notability. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 20:24, 2005 Apr 5 (UTC)</p>

<li>Is this only an encyclopedia for famous people? Or do the "unsung" heros of local communities have a place as well? It seems to me if this is to establish an internet community based encyclopedia, it needs to include information regarding people who are not yet well known, but still play a significant role in the grass roots development of our society. The organizations this man has established have already begun to make very significant impacts in Portland, Oregon. He has a substantial congregation, and is known by virtually every significant political leader in the city of Portland and the general state of Oregon. Perhaps the article needs to be re-worded in effor to not sound so much like a personal promo?

<ul>
<li>The question, "Is this only an encyclopedia for famous people?" rather captures the point. This is an encyclopedia, not a directory, so indeed the "unsung" heroes get left out (at least until they get "sung"). However, if this pastor's prominence continues to grow (as the trajectory outlined in the article suggests), then he may certainly cross the bar of notability in the future. It would help if the article was not written in such a promotional tone. Frankly, most biographical articles about contemporary figures contain both the laudatory accomplishments of their subjects, and criticism of the same. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 21:27, 2005 Apr 5 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree, but I also want to add that if the VfD does not pass, then this article we're voting on should be renamed to Y√∂ (Brazilian band) with <a href="../../../y/%C3%B6/_/Y%C3%B6.html" title="Y√∂">Y√∂</a> turned into a disambig page, as the Finnish band is more notable than the Brazilian one, and having the Brazilian band as the "main" article would be stupid. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> ‚Äî <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 12:52, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've tagged it as speedy three times; the first couple of times it was created by an anon. The third time the creator had opened an account of the same name, and I moved the page to User:Clout; unfortunately, the VfD appeared while I was doing it. If Clout (<a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClout_d284.html" title="User talk:Clout">talk</a> ¬∑ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Clout_1d47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Clout">contributions</a>) recreates the article, then it could be VfDed again (though I do think that it's a speedy candidate), but could this VfD be lifted now that it's a User page? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">ŒúŒµŒª ŒïœÑŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ</font>)</a> 21:33, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>It is a speedy candidate if it is recreated, since recreations of items that were VfD'ed can be speedied if deem fit to warrant it. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 00:27, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>i am sorry if this is prying, but I ask that you allow the definition to be left up for 48 hours until I can put up a proper link which decribes Clout more. thank you for your time</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It has been created four times, after two speedy deletions and one move to the creator's User page. It contains nothing that suggests that it's genuine, and the author (or authors) has had ammple time to produce something worthwhile. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">ŒúŒµŒª ŒïœÑŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ</font>)</a> 21:38, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>it is genuine in the way that it is a real religion, other religions are allowed to be defined on this site, so i ask that clout is also given that right</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I tagged it as a speedy a couple of times, too, as nonsense. The author is removing the tags, or else recreating it, and has also vandalized a few other articles related to religion. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:22, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've now deleted it a number of times (and its creator has vandalised my user page three times, and sent me abusive e-mails). The creator also vandalised other Wikipedia pages, and created another spoof article a cuple of times. He's now been banned for twenty-four hours, though he has at least two other accounts, so I'm not sure that that's a solution. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">ŒúŒµŒª ŒïœÑŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ</font>)</a> 17:28, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Provisional Keep</b> If it was re-written and more substance added, it could be a useful addition. As it stands, it's far too light-weight, quite parocial (clearly written with a N American audience in mind, references to warm weather but not cold) with dubious assertions like: " It is known that in a busy parking lot a dirty grungy car will accumulate more knicks and scrapes than a clean car."

<li><b>Comment:</b> Is it possible for an article of this sort to be NPOV? Certainly an article about car-washing techniques, or even about a particular car-washing technique, could be written neutrally, but it seems to me that an article that instructs the reader to do something necessarily advocates that that thing be done. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimmin_7c2f.html" title="User:Shimmin">Shimmin</a> 00:23, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jaberwocky, this article already exists as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_Wash_69df.html" title="Car Wash">Car Wash</a>, but could definatly use your improvements. Add the stuff from your "lab," but DO NOT turn it into a "How-to" <i>please</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> for reasons stated. I was the one who originally posted the Wikisource notice which seems to have started a misunderstanding, now straightened out. If Jabberwocky is ready and willing to wax this with the "Carnauba of NPOV," I'm for letting it stay. Remember the one about dishwashing a few months ago?
