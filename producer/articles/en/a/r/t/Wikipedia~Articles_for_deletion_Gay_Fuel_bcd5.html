<li><b>Question</b> Would any packaged drink you could buy at a single bar be suitably notable? (Probably not) 100 bars? 100,000? (almost certainly yes) I honestly don't know about this one. Do we have any sales figures for it? Do we have articles on every microbrewery for example? I'm convinced this is not a hoax. Any proof that it's influenced anything though? The articles given verify that it exists, but not that it's notable "enough". Hence my question. Anyone already determined how many beverage articles we have total? <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:09, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I think my view is fairly pragmatic, and I'm not at all anxious about it. But I'd like to ask you perhaps to consider being a bit less cryptic if you can (your comment was right below mine, after all so it certainly seemed like it possibly was directed at me) and perhaps not quite as sarcastic. "It's not dreamt of in Hahnchen's philosophy so out it goes!" as you said elsewhere just does not seem like it's adding a lot to this search for consensus, which turns on notability (I feel verifiability is satisified)... it's a legitimate question being asked. Show us how notable. How well does it sell? If it doesn't sell well, how much impact has it had in other ways? I'm coming around to "it's notable enough to merit a keep" but it's not because of your comments. I have found in the past that comments that might be perceived as combative undermine the case. People ask because they care. Even deletionists care. Hope that helps. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:34, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you feel verifiability is satisfied, only you know why you're still arguing about it with me. You must surely know that I, and many others, simply will never agree that a thing needs to be your or Hahnchen's idea of "notable" before it gets an article written on it here. Given that, it comes down to whether you are able to muster up sufficient votes for deletion to convince an admin to delete it. The notion that a good argument wins over many, many votes is laughable. Anyone who has made a good argument for keeping an article that was subsequently deleted knows that. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 02:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
