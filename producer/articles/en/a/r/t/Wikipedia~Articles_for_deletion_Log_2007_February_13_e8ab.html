<p>This was nominated for AFD before.</p>
<p>When I found this article, I began to question why this is on Wikipedia. What this is a summary of the various logos used by Viacom since their existance. This includes the "V" that was used in the 1970's and 1980's and some of the more stylized versions later on.</p>
<p>Articles on other logos do exist, such as the Nike <a href="../../../s/w/o/Swoosh.html" title="Swoosh">Swoosh</a> and, similar to the Viacom article, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_logos_58a2.html" title="NBC logos">this</a>. But, this one is different. I see a lot of content that was be considered non-enecylopedic and are denoted in every heading using notes that are seen upon pressing edit. Second, I remember somewhere that while Wikipedia wishes to present the world knowledge, it is not the host of indiscriminate information. I believe this article is full of nothing that adds to the value of what Viacom is or did during their existance. While an outright delete is my main goal, a redirect to this article would suffice or even just a link to a Viacom logos website.</p>
<p>I also wish to point out that because of the Viacom vs. YouTube issue, many copies of said logos, including parodies, have been uploaded to the site. Since they are new, I have no idea if this will be a lasting impact on the logos themselves or part of some cheap and quick viral campaign. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 07:23, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is more or less a campaign page for a group of people running for the Federation of Young Republicans, not for any government office. None of the current candidates hold any political office. In essence, non-notable political ticket with a definite POV. I am not suggesting that the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Republicans_96d7.html" title="Young Republicans">Young Republicans</a> article be deleted, just this and individual pages for the various candidates.

<li><b>Question</b> for both this and the following AfD. I notice there's no article for this organization they belong to (Young Republican National Federation). As opposed to the generalized movement <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Republicans_96d7.html" title="Young Republicans">Young Republicans</a>. Is this "YRNF" a notable group in it's own right by Wikipedia standards? My thought is if that question can be answered, the sub-questions of these articles should be simpler. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 00:25, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Depends on your standards. I wouldn't think so. You will probably have the odd mention of the organization in media outlets in connection with a national campaign. But they don't do any major advertising during campaigns, rather its an organization that provides volunteers during campaigns and perhaps raises some funds. Speaking for my own YR organization, the group is at rest in between elections, only really moving forward once the party has determined its candidates for the fall elections. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 00:35, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I wonder if they should be deleted under the deletion policy, and generally I check five things:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The article text</li>
<li>References, or lack thereof</li>
<li>History (if only one non-bot user edited, it's not as good)</li>
<li>What links here (is this information relevant to some other topic?)</li>
<li>Search engine test. (Does the quantity <b>and</b> quality of Google results affirm notability?)</li>
</ol>
<p>The text and incoming links were inconclusive, the references were absent, and the Google results were not so many. So I nominated it.

<p>This article is not written in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>; it reads partly like an advertisement, partly like an argument, and partly like bylaws of an organization. It does not read like an encyclopedia article. The editor(s) who have authored it claim that the basis for notability is "Notability wise, the temple has over 900 members, and is substantial because it is one of the few Jedi groups who actually have been recognized by the government in any capacity". This does not pass any of the notability tests in <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>From a google search engine test, using "Temple of the Jedi Order" (in quotes), we get 49 unique articles, nowhere near the "1,940,000 results" that the editor claimed in the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_the_Jedi_Order_%28Real%29&amp;oldid=107248549" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_the_Jedi_Order_%28Real%29&amp;oldid=107248549" rel="nofollow">diff</a>
<ul>
<li>All of these results fall into one of these classes:
<ul>
<li>the organization's own website</li>
<li>exact duplication of the organization's website content (mirror)</li>
<li>state of texas corporate registrar (simple listing; no context)</li>
<li>blog</li>
<li>myspace</li>
<li>personal unreliable non-notable website</li>
<li>critical website (claiming they are a hoax)</li>
<li>Google Answers Expert Opinions (all say it is not a religion and/or may be a hoax)</li>
<li>mirror of wikipedia content (eg. answers.com)</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p>In the edit summary, one of the contributing editors threatened legal action if his content was removed again: "I will seek a federal injunction if necessary".

<dd>Perhaps I should have explained my reasoning more fully. There is an archipelago off the north west coast of Europe. It has perhaps twenty different labels attached to it. The most popular term, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, is somewhat controversial. Perhaps for this reason, several other articles have been created that describe exactly the same thing - <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_and_Ireland_7bc2.html" title="Great Britain and Ireland">Great_Britain_and_Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain_and_Ireland_3cad.html" title="Britain and Ireland">Britain_and_Ireland</a> for example. There are also very full articles on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_naming_dispute_9e6a.html" title="British Isles naming dispute">British Isles naming dispute</a>. Use of the phrase <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_and_Ireland_7bc2.html" title="Great Britain and Ireland">Great_Britain_and_Ireland</a> is covered in these. Looking at the policy <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> it is difficult under these circumstances to see why <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_and_Ireland_7bc2.html" title="Great Britain and Ireland">Great Britain_and_Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain_and_Ireland_3cad.html" title="Britain and Ireland">Britain_and_Ireland</a> merit separate pages from <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British_Isles</a>, any more than <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberia.html" title="Iberia">Iberia</a> would merit a separate page from Spain_and_Portugal or <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color.html" title="Color">color</a> from <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colour.html" title="Colour">colour</a>.--Triglyph 08:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm still not convinced. Other than keeping the article as is, there are far more appropriate options than deletion which you may not be aware of (setting up this deletion being your first and only edits from this account). The first is to redirect, but what to redirect to? <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>? <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain_and_Ireland_3cad.html" title="Britain and Ireland">Britain and Ireland</a>? <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>? There's no obvious answer, so a disambiguation page may be the answer as "Great Britain and Ireland" is a valid and likely search term. However, this is what the page actually is: it explains the above possible uses of the term and links to the equivalent meanings. It may need a bit of cleanup, but it looks fine to me. I'm afraid I don't agree with your original nomination or your expanded explanation as to why it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 11:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, however I disagree with the two above votes.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is insufficiently referenced (only IMDB listing is referenced, which is really only reliable for stats and casting details, not behind the scenes info and such). Also, as above, the article gives no reason or evidence why this show, which ever aired, meets notability guidelines. While <i>some</i> unaired pilots are notable, they still have to provide sufficient independent references to prove that it was indeed notably discussed by published sources. Thus, barring the article meeting its burden of proof, it fails to meet the guideline to demonstrate its own notability. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:13, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Change</b> I agree with MLA. The scope can't work, but can be altered. Something addressing active wrestler deaths would be more appropriate.

<dd>I mean, an encyclopedia isn't going to mention Moose the drinking game, but there are a lot of bar, drinking and beer related websites with the first Moose on them. I've found a couple with the second, like that one. I'd be OK with deleting the second part though, if we can't find more.

<li><b>Delete</b>. At present I'm not inclined to treat student newspapers as acceptable publications for reference, as the risk of including "stuff made up at school" is too high, and on that basis I don't see adequate referencing to support this article. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I thought the problem with "stuff made up at school" was that either (a) the stuff was made up at one single location, so if it wasn't widespread it was unlikely to be notable, and (b) it was possibly a hoax or unreliably sourced for other reasons (accuracy, exaggeration, etc.). What we have here are three different campus publications — in California, Idaho and Michigan (I think it's Michigan). For me, that's enough. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:58, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_Weekly_bc76.html" title="Boise Weekly">Boise Weekly</a></i> isn't a student newspaper. Plus like Noroton said, I've played this in Washington, DC, and a Canadian guy taught it to me. So I think it's pretty widespread. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> 19:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. At the request of <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> I have reviewed these comments. I still don't feel we have "multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other", which is our criterion for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enotability.html" title="Wp:notability">notability</a>". One source, at best, though personally I feel the article cited is trivial - filler for a local newspaper - and that's not "multiple". Sorry, I'm not ( yet ) swayed. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 16:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I still don't see multiple non-trivial sources. However, the one source that's left when the student newspapers are removed is an award winning one, so.... I'm actually wavering on this one, but I think the guidelines are pretty clear - if someone can come up with another non-trivial source I may be forced to watch my thinking change. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilippebeaudette_89c4.html" title="User:Philippebeaudette">Philippe Beaudette</a> 20:08, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's not listed on Alec Baldwin's IMDb page and when I tooled around some of those ghits I couldn't find a review except from some extremely obscure sites (like a blog). Amazon sells it (for five bucks), but I see no outside reviews except what the creators made for publicity purposes. I was a bit put off by the nominator calling it "propaganda" but that's actually a fair description of it. If it were put together independently from an activist organization, I think it would be more worthy of an article, given all those hits. But if those 90K hits are a result of PETA's propaganda efforts over the past few years, then why should Wikipedia get drawn into that? If there were some independent confirmation that this propaganda had a notable impact, then that could be a reason for an article on it. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:41, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure I understand your argument here. There is a <i>USA Today</i> newspaper article about Baldwin's PETA award. <i>USA Today</i> is independent of PETA, right? <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 22:49, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, you make a good point, Zagalejo. The article lends some support for notability. I originally thought the award was <i>from</i> PETA as well, but looking again I see it was something given out by the Linda McCarthy Foundation. (I'm more impressed by the information on changing Burger King's policies, but the problem here is the information all comes from PETA. Independent confirmation of that would change my vote.) I can't bring up anything on the AP article by following the link above. Wikipedia has articles on TV commercials (the Mac/PC series of commercials a good one), so in theory this could be an article, even considered as propaganda. But we still need more citable evidence. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:05, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I know there seems to be precious little information on this page, but it is still the best source of information out there. Just the fact that there are multiple versions and the latest is from 2003 is potentially useful info that is not easy to find elsewhere without really searching around. It's not that there is no outside info on this video (although it is certainly scarce), but rather that the info is hard to get with a simple Google search. I understand other WPians are saying this article is just part of the problem as it seems like a link drop; I'm arguing that it is also part of the solution because it provides <i>some</i> information not otherwise easy to locate. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinasaur_7224.html" title="User:Chinasaur">Chinasaur</a> 22:39, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Firstly, to summarise, this article has been split off from <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_2006_%28UK%29_9ce0.html" title="Big Brother 2006 (UK)">Big Brother 2006 (UK)</a> and I am arguing that it is now redundant to a table already existing in the article for the TV series.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Big_Brother_7_Chronology_248d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Big Brother 7 Chronology">Previous nomination</a></li>
<li>For those unfamiliar with the subject matter, 'Chronology' and 'Weekly summary' mean essentially the same thing, and series 7 is the series of Big Brother broadcast in 2006.</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been several discussions already about whether this page should exist or whether it should just be a section in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_2006_%28UK%29_9ce0.html" title="Big Brother 2006 (UK)">Big Brother 2006 (UK)</a> article. The main arguments expressed over May and June 2006 (around the start of the TV series) were that the section could get too long, and it should therefore be split, whilst others argued that it would be better for the section to be cut back.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_UK_series_7/archive#Chronology" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_UK_series_7/archive#Chronology" rel="nofollow">[13]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_UK_series_7/archive1#Length" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_UK_series_7/archive1#Length" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>The article was created and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Big_Brother_7_Chronology_248d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Big Brother 7 Chronology">nominated for deletion</a> where concerns were raised that the article was unencyclopaedic; the importance was questioned; it was suggested that the weekly summary should be trimmed; and it was also suggested to wait until the end of the series before taking action. The result of that debate was to delete the article but the weekly summary remained as a section in the article for the series. However, during the series there were further discussions about whether the weekly summary should be trimmed or split on to a separate article.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_%28UK_series_7%29/archive2#Chronology_cutbacks" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_%28UK_series_7%29/archive2#Chronology_cutbacks" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_7_%28UK%29/Archive_4#Chronology_section" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_7_%28UK%29/Archive_4#Chronology_section" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>
<p>After the series finished, the series article underwent a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Big_Brother_7_%28UK%29_012d.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Big Brother 7 (UK)">peer review</a> where it was suggested that the weekly summary was trimmed down. It was therefore trimmed down to around half its original size. Later on in the duration of the peer review, it was suggested that the weekly summary was split off into its own article.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_7_%28UK%29/Archive_4#Chronology" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Big_Brother_7_%28UK%29/Archive_4#Chronology" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> This happened and since then, it has received very few edits, apart from fixing some dead links and correcting formatting. Meanwhile, the weekly summary section in the series article was turned into a table and trimmed down further, but not significantly.</p>
<p>Now, we are at the stage where Weekly summary of Big Brother (UK series 7) is essentially redundant to the table at <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_2006_%28UK%29_9ce0.html#Weekly_summary" title="Big Brother 2006 (UK)">Big Brother 2006 (UK)#Weekly summary</a> where the only noticeable difference between the two is that one is formatted as a table whilst the other is separated by headings. For this reason, I think Weekly summary of Big Brother (UK series 7) should be <b>deleted</b>. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 02:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Agree that article is redundant when compared to the table. Suggest that the footnote citations be copied over from the article into the table, as several points/facts are without reference.

<li>I don't think there's much point in worrying about the page history. Since the article has existed, the only changes made were formatting the references section, correcting a few spellings and dead links and nominating the article for deletion.

<p>The <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Webster_c9c1.html" title="Sam Webster">Sam Webster</a> article was cut &amp; pasted directly from <a href="http://www.egnu.org/thelema/index.php/Sam_Webster" class="external text" title="http://www.egnu.org/thelema/index.php/Sam_Webster" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Looking in the history, and by comparing the autiobiography of the creator of the entry <a href="http://www.egnu.org/thelema/User:Aleph" class="external text" title="http://www.egnu.org/thelema/User:Aleph" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it is quite clear that the article was written by Sam Webster himself. Then banned user <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> copy &amp; pasted the article to wikipedia. So in the original format, this is clear <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. Most of the references and links circle back to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=*.egnu.org" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=*.egnu.org" rel="nofollow">*.egnu.org</a> domain the original article was hosted on or the spammy personal website <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=*.hermetic.com" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=*.hermetic.com" rel="nofollow">*.hermetic.com</a> which has 226 links from wikipedia. I think this is clear undue weight, since hermetic.com is essentially someone's private website. Also, the subject of the article has not authored a single book, and the scant interviews and secondary mentions of him are in zines and self-published books which do not meet notability requirements. - <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> 03:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>weak delete</b></s> At least he is an actual person, and there are two mentions from outside his own cult, and he has actually received a degree from a well-known mainstream theological school. It is hard for an outsider to tell which of these individuals, (or groups, which may be much the same thing), is actually notable. There are no sales figures for the books, and the web sites change and mirror each other. What we need to know is how notable they are within their own community. In more conventional religions there is are offices and distinctions that are commonly accepted and discernible from outside.</li>
</ul>

<dd>From another AfD, I put some credit on the listing in <a href="http://www.93current.de/groups.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.93current.de/groups.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.93current.de/groups.shtml</a>, and a little on <a href="http://www.globalserve.net/~sarlo/Fcrowley.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.globalserve.net/~sarlo/Fcrowley.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalserve.net/~sarlo/Fcrowley.htm</a>. They both seem to list groups other than their immediate affiliation. He is mentioned in neither. The wiki article in <a href="http://www.egnu.org/thelema/Sam_Webster" class="external free" title="http://www.egnu.org/thelema/Sam_Webster" rel="nofollow">http://www.egnu.org/thelema/Sam_Webster</a> lists links for more of his writings than the one here, but examining them would require deciding on their theological merits, which is fortunately not relevant to WP. There is a problem with evaluating the in-universe sources as compared to the mainstream: a totally insignificant person to the initiated may be good at getting conventional interviews. I accept the material as V, but not as showing N.
<dl>
<dd>and we have deleted articles for ministers of ordinary well-known religions who have done at least as much. The key distinctive accomplishment of this less-than-conventional figure is that he has acquired the basic degree that all conventional ministers acquire.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems to have enough credits as a writer and liturgist to merit an article. A journalist or other type of writer need not write books to be notable if there's a big enough and respected enough body of articles &amp; essays. The data in this article keeps growing; I urge those calling for a delete to at least wait a while longer and see what else those supporting the article come up with, then revisit the issue. (However, it might be advisable to limit the list of essays to ones that have been published; including a link to the rest might be preferable.) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 23:23, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> As I stated previously when I removed the PROD notice from this article, expanded the article, and tried to revise it in a manner that presents a relatively balanced view of the topic, I think the real reason for the proposed deletion is the allegation that the article topic is a fraudulent organization. This is one of the types of "reasons" discussed at <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions</a>. Fraudulent organizations can be notable (for example, see <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a>). If a notable organization is alleged to be fraudulent, it seems to me that Wikipedia should make the information available to people, rather than hiding it by deleting the article. I believe the topic is notable, as indicated by the fact that prominent <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mills.html" title="Diploma mills">Diploma mills</a> cite NAHE to support their claims of credibility and several "quackwatch"-type organizations include it in their lists of known unrecognized accreditation agencies.--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 04:30, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Based on current state (and a credit to the rewriters) - the original looked terrible. As Garrie noted, it's become a cultural term even at times divorced from its original meaning.

<p>I'm not sure if the (unsourced) assertion that these people were the first to found a webcomic collective is an assertion to notability, so I'll bring it here instead of speedy deleting it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Two of the comics apparently included in the original ABS (according to the article) are notable enough to have their own articles on Wikipedia, and 1-2 others of those may be; among that list are both <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blank_Label_Comics_d9bb.html" title="Blank Label Comics">Blank Label Comics</a> authors.

Above all other considerations, either of those guidelines (which I realize are not at all absolutes) insist on "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." In it's current form one has to presume that this wikipedia article is a first-account piece of text written by either the artist herself or an admirer, and has absolutely no relationship to any verifiable secondary source (much less multiple). Find a few reputable articles about this person or her music or her influence on internet culture...and then an article on her can be started. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:46, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Heck-I-Don't-Know</b> - Thank you for the discussion and for giving me some education on the foundations of wikipedia. I am starting to see the distinctions between an unbiased factual article and a review by an admirer and I will keep an eye out for "reputable" articles about the subject singer to validate the need for a wiki article. My interest in the subject, aside from the entertainment value, lies in my amazement at the power of the Internet to allow ordinary people to publish works on their own and easily distribute to a global audience with little control by government and commercial enterprise. And to see that audience interact and voice its many opinions. At some point enough people would be influenced by the subject's work to merit some acknowledgement in the pages of "reputable" sources such as the wikipedia. I guess that is what we are exploring here. How many people does it take? By the way, I do not know the performer personally nor do I have any commercial or personal interest other than as an admirer of her work. My motivation is just to let other people know about it and share the enjoyment I get from the entertainment. I suppose I like hearing myself talk too, and writing way too much about this, but I do like learning about the process wikipedia has established. Anyway, certainly, there is a need for standards governing the content of wikipedia, but I have to wonder about their interpretation. It seems like the wiki requires a middle-man between the performer and her audience to validate her work. I.e. commercially produced recordings, advertising to aquaint people with the performer, radio or TV play time, an agent to get reputable publications to notice and write articles, etc. I am impressed by the simplicity of YouTube in providing a medium in which the performer can display her talent with no outside help, and her audience can easily access and choose to watch and listen to her works. What is notable about this performer is the huge following she has acquired in such a short period of time, and the acknowledgement she receives from her fans. I think her impact on internet culture is significant and people would find it interesting and useful to find out about her in the pages of wikipedia. It seems to me that the wikipedia is a place to note such people and what they have done. Now, in my mind the subject, i.e. MaryAnne, is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. I do see the points made by contributors to this page about how an article should be written, the neutral point of view, the need to prove assertions made, and so on. Based on those, perhaps it should be deleted. I would much rather see it improved upon, to bring it up to standards, so it can stay in wikipedia. Readers will enjoy discovering a singer who provides good entertainment for them to enjoy. Voyagr7 02:00, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Greetings, Voyagr7, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your question <i>How many people does it take?</i> is beside the point; it takes a few of them being reporters or whatever who "note" the subject in the media. Your observation <i>It seems like the wiki requires a middle-man between the performer and her audience to validate her work.</i> is spot on, as Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> compiling the work of others. It is no longer unusual for a YouTube "celebrity" to develop a following in a short period of time; what makes one stand out is making the jump to another source or medium. It's possible that could happen starting tomorrow. As of now, however, she is just one of many. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:05, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, his web site is written as if it were a commercial organization, and is very hard to take seriously from the home page--He has titled it "Garnering Innovation"--but it is different when one looks inside.

<li>Probably my momentary confusion came from the fact you would even support merging yourself (which is kinda an indirect vote for keeping, for now at least).

<li>So you want this article deleted on the basis Wikipedia might perhaps end up with thousands of articles if it isn't??

<ul>
<li>Yeah, apparently, you didn't see where I was going with that. Perhaps it was my fault for wording it in such a fashion. It was basically another statement supporting the fact that it's still not significant enough to have a page; I'm basically trying to say that lots of unnecessary pages would need to be created if this one is allowed to stay. For instance, Roy Knife is a <i>main antagonist</i> from the "Gun.Smoke" video game; we don't know 2 cents about him other than his name, so, just because he's a "main antagonist," he deserves his own article?

<dd>Speculated to be made, even on a reliable source, does not constitute "made". Crystal balling isn't superceded by reliable sourcing. It's a straight to TV movie, or DVD (or whatever), on something that has yet to be. Fits the crystal balling policy, and lacks notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 02:10, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, he has had a couple articles in various newspapers (and Tulsa would be local, but I see your point). But I believe he fails several of the other alternative tests (and I know they aren't rock solid). I feel he fails the expandability test and the 100 year test. As Bob said, he is very obscure and most Google links are people making fun of him so I consider a Google search hard to rely on.

<li><b>Comment</b> - seems to be rather an obscure figure, although I'll leave it up to others to decide whether he is notable enough. The article was speedily deleted as failing WP:BIO, due to being an autobiography<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bikerfox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bikerfox" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> in September 2006<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Bikerfox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Bikerfox" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, and re-added in October 2006, so could be classified as a re-post.

Was kept in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hullabahoos_c60c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hullabahoos">first nomination</a> because the group allegedly "Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture."

<li><b>Delete and merge</b> into Arlington Heights, although only about 10 percent of this short article is even worth merging. No claim to notability is given, and the book clearly isn't enough. The book should provide some good information for a section in the Arlington Heights article: Year started, some landmarks in the history of its growth, number of books or other material, the large number of library card holders (and percentage), perhaps even size of buildings and branches in square feet, and especially anything else unusual that sets it apart from other libraries. It could make a fine section.

I wouldn't just delete it outright, under long precedent that effort should be made to merge things like local libraries and schools into articles on the larger systems/towns to which they belong. The other books results appear to be in-passing, not in-depth, and the "news" results are either local or in librarian specialty publications, and don't seem to support a claim of notability either in general or in the field of librarianism, being also in-passing and not detailed information about the library <i>per se</i>. The fact that the library board had a meeting recorded in a local paper helps establish that the library <i>exists</i>, but lots of things exist that don't need articles. &#160;:-) — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 20:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Seems to me if you can source and define one type of animal crossing, you could get them all.

<li>I created this article and duck crossings are genuine, wether or not they could be encapsulated into another article is another question. Despite suggestions that it could come under something like waterfowl or animal crossings, duck crossins are most well known and in britain there are not any or rarely any other type of animal crossing. popular culture references include the simpsons episode - homer the heretic 9F01.

<li><b>Keep or merge into some sort of unusual crossings article</b>. Duck crossings certainly exist (I'd add a picture of one near here, except the sign was recently stolen. Guess I wasn't the only one who thought it was cute).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Real, and yes, Anthony, ducks can quite often be seen walking across roads. Ducks do not fly short distances well, requiring a lot of effort to get airborne. It makes far more sense for them to walk short distances - like across roads - especially if they have (non-flying) young with them. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:55, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this list is well maintained and of specific scope and likely to be desired by those interested in Presidents.

<li><b>Keep</b> per reasons here and at the other half-dozen presidential lists that people are trying to delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with you that this is interesting, and I am interested in politics, but interesting is a matter of opinion and it is not a reason for inclusion (just as "boring" is not a reason for deletion). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:47, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, I know. But I'm tired of stating the case that I and others have made at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Children_of_the_Presidents_of_the_United_States_99a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Children of the Presidents of the United States">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Parents_of_the_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada_4937.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Parents of the Prime Ministers of Canada">here</a> and several other places. These lists are clearly encyclopedic, and I'm really struggling to assume good faith to editors who classify this sort of information as frivolous trivia, and are nominating all these lists for destruction. "Notability" is a matter of opinion as well, and apparently the definition of the word "indiscriminate" is a matter of opinion on wikipedia. I'm genuinely frustrated by these nominations. The ability to index something in multiple ways makes wikipedia <i>better</i> than any other source of information. These lists are notable by any standard, verifiable, relevant, useful, discriminate, more important than 95 percent of the content on wikipedia, etc., etc. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a>!!! There's no good reason to destroy these indexes.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 22:17, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>And there are those of us who are probably tired of stating our contrary case in these discussions. You're right, notability is largely a matter of opinion, and as such we're all entitled to our opinions. What you may see as "destruction" others, like me, may see as diminishing the overall value of this encyclopedia. Throwing around loaded terms like "destruction" doesn't really convince me that this list is "clearly encyclopedic". Saying so doesn't make it so. I see this list as clearly trivial, but likewise, saying so doesn't make it so, so I rely on the observation that this is simply a bunch of otherwise inconsequential facts strung together only by the fact that there happen to be "presidents" involved. I'm also not clear why anyone with a contrary opinion is being lumped into whatever spat is going on with Philippean-related topics. Some of us just browse AfD and comment on those articles that garner our attention. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:39, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You honestly think that it's unimportant what presidents did before they were presidents? Even though it's incessantly covered and important to millions of people when they vote? Even though a president's early career is covered in probably countless news articles before the election, and however many biographies after? It's unimportant what sort of previous experience the people that lead countries have?--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 08:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It shouldn't be too difficult to come up with guidelines or rules that could rope in the more serious "Presidents by XYZ" lists. Topics that are or were important to voters or to the lives of the presidents themselves could stay in and those that are not could stay out. IN would be height, military service, religion, basic information about their wives and family, reasons for dying; OUT would be things like taste in music, dental hygiene, what musical instruments they might have played. All the IN stuff would be potentially useful (very broadly defined) to people seriously studying history and of some interest to the rest of us, the OUT stuff would be totally useless to the historian. Them's my thoughts, anyway. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:49, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I care if President X used to clean toilets! Isn't that opinion Jcuk? Just because the Philippine lists aren't getting enough support doesn't mean Kevin Ray has to lash out at the related lists. Being insulted is no reason to start a nominating frenzy. The information can be merged and people interested in world politics can be given the heads up instead of this. Many of these lists are good tools for research no matter what country's leaders they are about. It can save a lot of time when trying to gather information. Many people would find it interesting of informative to find out what world leaders did before and after rising to their status, like <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor-General_of_the_Philippines_c89d.html" title="Governor-General of the Philippines">Governor-General of the Philippines</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Howard_Taft_3129.html" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a>.... <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 23:48, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, thats your prerogative to care.

Bush">CEO President</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">actor President</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b> without prejudice to re-creation. The unreferenced claim of the article that this corporation is owned by an apparently local aristocratic family (see <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negeri_Sembilan_86b0.html" title="Negeri Sembilan">Negeri Sembilan</a>) may make a case for notability in some future version of this article. I think more is required, though, as is some information about what they do. This article may contradict the brief article on the monarch of this district (<a href="../../../y/a/n/Yang_di-Pertuan_Besar_f42f.html" title="Yang di-Pertuan Besar">Yang di-Pertuan Besar</a>) which suggests that the monarchy is elective. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:21, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> That an article is a stub, or contains factual inacuracy is not a criteria for deletion. A factual inacruacy should be corrected or removed. The only applicable reason for deletion here is if the company is notable or not.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Septier is a multinational company that delivers a very narrow technology to a very small customer group - mobile telephone networks. Their customers though include multinational giants like <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodaphone.html" title="Vodaphone">Vodaphone</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprint.html" title="Sprint">Sprint</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telefonica.html" title="Telefonica">Telefonica</a>. The company has only 20 employees, but it seems to me that if they are a small, global niche company with a very concentrated clientell they still meet the criteria for notable. This type of company can be very important and thus notable in their industries, without them ever having any newsworthiness. Newsworthiness is not a criteria for notability in Wikipedia. Still, I don't acutally know how notable this company is, as I know absolutely nothing about the mobile telephone network subcontracting market. <a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsenikk_9ef3.html" title="User:Arsenikk">Arsenikk</a> 19:48, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article Nat W. H. Chan has been proposed for deletion as there is no real significance as an "top rated Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game player" as he's not listed in the current Top 50 players. Also, much of the information does not have a listed source and has little to prove of his nobility to have an article. I can't really put it in words, but if you look at the article, I think you'll get the picture. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDiamondDragon_6095.html" title="User:DiamondDragon">DiamondDragon</a> <small><a href="../../../d/i/a/User_talk%7EDiamondDragon_1930.html" title="User talk:DiamondDragon"><font color="red">contact</font></a></small> 20:01, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think this is all rather unfortunate.

As Professor, Head of Department and Head of a Research Centre, he might well be notable enough for an article, but this one would need a lot of cleaning to become a worthy article. I am unsure what to say. If it could be cleaned up and the vandals controlled, it should be kept. Otherwise it should be deleted and maybe later someone will write a decent article on him. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 12:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as initial prodder (thanks for making this an AfD, good call!). The main objection raised on the article talk page was that many other webcomics are equally non notable (two of the examples given by the objector have since already been removed).

<dd><i>Reply to Fram</i> Among the much more numerous hits for "The parking lot is full" + comic (~1000), there are is an interview<a href="http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/plif/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/plif/" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> that gives a brief history of the comic, starting with a print origin in a student newspaper. As this review asserts<a href="http://www.masterzdm.com/enter/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=122" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.masterzdm.com/enter/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=122" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>, in spite of its lack of fame, it may have been one of the very first webcomics. It mostly seems to be reviewed in webzines<a href="http://www.justlaugh.com/online/plif.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.justlaugh.com/online/plif.php" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>, but I'm having no trouble finding a lot of webzine reviews.

<dd>None of these sources are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> as far as I can see. The Humaniststudies.org one comes perhaps closest, but then again, it is not a review of the comic, just mentioning that they publish it along with others in their ezine (this link gives the staff of the magazine, making clear that it is not the kind of magazine we normally consider as reliable, having only one editor<a href="http://humaniststudies.org/staff.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://humaniststudies.org/staff.html" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>). 1995, while certainly not late, is not exceptionally early for a webcomic (the review you cite talks about 1993, but then it was published in a student newspaper, not as a webcomic, giving an indication of the reliability of such reviews). As for groundbreaking... in what independently verified way? I know that deletion isn't a substitute for cleanup or sourcing, but then again, that wasn't my intention. I had seen the other reviews as well, but they are non notable or non reliable (mostly online) publications (webzines), so I don't see what they change to the deletion rationale. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 16:19, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>About half of the ones I mentioned fail independence, which is why I didn't say "strong keep," and the rest are marginally "published" online; however, if I could find that many sources hovering near the borderline of the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> standards in less than five minutes of looking, it seems a pretty sure bet that it passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> standards overall. In retrospect, it's not surprising that there are only a couple thousand pages on the web that mention this comic, seeing as it ended five years ago. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 17:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Many sources which fail <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> does not mean that there are probably some sources meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as well. Let me point out that your previous posts, while perhaps not having that intention, at least convinced the next editor wrongly that the comic is "recognized as having historical significance", when no such thing is shown except in one user-supplied and mistaken review. As for the "couple thousand pages", <i>all</i> 5 pages you gave as a reference were included in my initial search of 57 distinct Google hits, indicating that a) it was a quite good and fair search for reviews of this comic and b) there isn't probably that much more you can find about it on the internet. So basically, we still have a webcomic with only about 50 websites referencing it in slightly more than a passing way (at least mentioning the author), and depending on your criteria, only one or none of these sources could pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Which rather conclusively means that for all we have been able to find, it still clearely fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:28, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, since I don't start getting unrelated hits until the eighth page of search terms (results 71-80), and I keep finding relevant reviews of the comic hundreds of results down the list, your search <i>definitely</i> underrepresents the number of pages about TPIF, just as your searches have typically severely underrepresented comics. Those pages that I pulled out, several of which either come very close to meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, or could be argued to meet it, although typically not also the independence criterion for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, are simply the first few reviews. Five years is a long time on the internet, and I have to say that I was shocked to find such a quantity of solid reviews online after all this time.</dd>

<dd>To emphasize how much you're missing through your inadequate searches, hit #463 was tantalizingly titled "Notable Webcomics" and dated from last summer. It did only contain a relatively brief user-posted review, of course, but it's gross misrepresentation to claim that it's only referenced on 50 websites.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 23:06, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So basically, "how much I am missing through my inadequate searches" which returned all your previously given links, are all not meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, just like I expected. So in what way, relevant to this discussion which is intended to see if this comic meets the Wikipedia guidelines, was my search inadequate? It was a search to look for multiple independent reviews (excluding trivial mentions) by reliable sources, of which your extended search didn't return any: this was to be expected, since it would be very unusual to have a thorough review in a serious magazine or newspaper that didn't even mention the author of the comic. Look, could you please provide the necessary reliable sources to support your keep&#160;!vote instead of attacking the methods used by the nominator? I appreciate the effort you have put in your search, but if it doesn't return anything further, just say so please.~ <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>The Parking Lot is Full</i> began in 1993, but it didn't go online until 1995. However, in my book, while 1993 qualifies as <i>amazingly</i> early, 1995 still qualifies as very early indeed: we only have a couple of webcomics on all of Wikipedia that were around before 1995 (<a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Fun_e46c.html" title="Doctor Fun">Doctor Fun</a> from 1993 and <a href="../../../w/h/e/Where_the_Buffalo_Roam_%28webcomic%29_b001.html" title="Where the Buffalo Roam (webcomic)">Where the Buffalo Roam</a> from 1991—neither of which have any more reliable sources than this page). The only other comics on Wikipedia that are from 1995 are <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymer_City_Chronicles_2eee.html" title="Polymer City Chronicles">Polymer City Chronicles</a> (March), <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argon_Zark%21_cccf.html" title="Argon Zark!">Argon Zark!</a> (June), <a href="../../../s/e/v/Sev_Wide_Web_b212.html" title="Sev Wide Web">Sev Wide Web</a> (July), and <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_and_Kell_7cca.html" title="Kevin and Kell">Kevin and Kell</a> (September).

<li>If it had been on the web on 1993, I would have agreed. Since it was 1995, I think it was somewhat early, but not early enough to be truly notable for that aspect. As for influential... I would expect it to have reviews like this one for <i><a href="../../../a/r/g/Argon_Zark%21_cccf.html" title="Argon Zark!">Argon Zark!</a></i>, which is from 1995 as well but gets at least a lot more recognition<a href="http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>. It also discusses <i><a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert.html" title="Dilbert">Dilbert</a></i>, which went online in 1995 as well, and a bunch of other truly influential (but later) webcomics. It just indicates that 1995 was the start of the boom for webcomics: anything earlier is truly early, anything from then or later is no longer, in my view, notable for being early. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Which article? The one that says the breed is "primarily used for bear-baiting and dog fighting", or the one that says it's "used for baiting and dog fighting"? I found out later they were supposedly seperate breeds, which is why I made my next comment (or do you not bother reading all the comments before you reply?), but the first pages I found when I googled "Gull Dong" referred to them as different names for the same breed. My opinion still stands...if more than a sentence can't be written about this breed, it needs to be redirected to a more common name if there is one. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 02:03, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I notice that the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gull_Terr_836d.html" title="Gull Terr">Gull Terr</a> infobox indicates that <s>Gull</s> Gul Dong and Bull Terr are alternative names for the same dog. If indeed all 3 names refer to the same breed, and Gul Dong and Gull Dong are same, we certainly don't need separate articles for all of these. That is what redirects are for. (The <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dachshund.html" title="Dachshund">Dachshund</a> article has this nicely figured out - Doxie, Dackel and Teckel all redirect to Dachshund.) One article on Gul(l) Dong/Bull Terr/Gull Terr is more than adequate, whichever name is the most popular, and assuming the implied content survives this AfD. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 20:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps we should redirect Bull Terr &amp; Gull Terr to the Gull Dong article and then the Afd will affect all articles? <a href="../../../e/n/s/User%7EEnsyc_158e.html" title="User:Ensyc">Ensyc</a> 23:07, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Gull Dong shouldn't be confused with the smaller Pakistani Terrier breed, also known as the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gull_Terr_836d.html" title="Gull Terr">Gull Terr</a> from which it developed through crosses with Indian Bullterriers and the Bully Kutta fighters.<a href="http://molosserdogs.com/modules.php?name=Encyclopedia&amp;op=content&amp;tid=889" class="external autonumber" title="http://molosserdogs.com/modules.php?name=Encyclopedia&amp;op=content&amp;tid=889" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadphonos_8530.html" title="User:Headphonos">Headphonos</a> 00:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>update:</b> it seems that since this AfD was nominated a couple of other club aficionados have come by to edit out the obvious hoax/prank claims to replace it with a much more modest account of this club's standing- ie an amateur club playing in the West Kirby (pop. 12321 <a href="http://www.nsdatabase.co.uk/locationdetail.cfm?locationid=1647" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nsdatabase.co.uk/locationdetail.cfm?locationid=1647" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>) Regional Division 1. However, despite this attempted recovery from the own goal of inflated/joke claims, given that this appears to be a rather minor minor league which does not itself rate an article, my delete vote above stands per notability guidelines (not to mention, the content is presumably all original research as there's still nothing remotely resembling an independent source).

<li>"He's notable in Japan, <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">let's counter systematic bias</a>" --- does not seem true, a search on 梅原 大吾 shows <a href="http://www.google.com.hk/search?hl=zh-TW&amp;q=%E6%A2%85%E5%8E%9F%E5%A4%A7%E5%90%BE&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.hk/search?hl=zh-TW&amp;q=%E6%A2%85%E5%8E%9F%E5%A4%A7%E5%90%BE&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">1k GHits</a>, but all blogs and forums.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm still a proponent of not having a Daigo article. Having one but not having an article on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shoryuken.com_9f5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shoryuken.com">Shoryuken.com</a> or Bang the Machine (a documentary about the fighting game scene in America featuring Daigo) sets a double standard as to the notability of fighting games. As it stands, the Wikipedia article is made up mainly of tournament results and quasi-legends. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 00:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I myself don't find the logic of SRK being not notable to equal to Daigo being not notable. Daigo is in no way affiliated with SRK. His only relation to SRK is that he is a regular player for their main tournament (EVO), but he had also played in many other tournaments such as <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tougeki.html" title="Tougeki">Tougeki</a>.</dd>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's another example: there is a Wikipedia article for <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Hoang_ba9c.html" title="Ken Hoang">Ken Hoang</a>, one of the best <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros_31c5.html" title="Super Smash Bros">Super Smash Bros</a> players in the world. But is there an article about Smashboards? Daigo and Ken are notable because they are one of the best in what they do, which is professional gaming. Are SRK and Smashboards considered one of the most notable websites, and is Bang the Machine considered a notable documentary? Are Daigo/Ken only well-known by members of SRK/Smashboards? Therefore I would say that is an insufficent reason to say Daigo not well-known enough. Afterdeath 10:29, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>The DVD is barely skirting the edge of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>; the production house, INH, consists of six people, and the only place it seems to be orderable from is their own website. Also I'm not too clear on the business relationship between INH and Capcom; if this is a product produced under licence or commission from Capcom, then it's not an independent source. Don't know what to say about Arcadia as I'm not closely familiar with Japanese video game magazines. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 13:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Some further research shows that Arcadia Magazine's publisher Enterbrain are also the organiser of the Tougeki tournament in which Umehara participated (see bottom of <a href="http://www.tougeki.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tougeki.com/" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> or enwiki's page on the subject at <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tougeki_-_Super_Battle_Opera_0cad.html" title="Tougeki - Super Battle Opera">Tougeki - Super Battle Opera</a>), so again, I don't think Arcadia qualifies as an independent source in this matter, but rather as a promoter with an obvious self-interest in hyping a participant in their company's tournament.

<dd>Can you explain exactly what systemic bias I am demonstrating here? Do you think my past contributions on Wikipedia demonstrate a systemic bias against Japan-related topics without English coverage (see my userpage, for example)? I read the articles and did some checking about the magazines in which they were published. My response was in my comment above: <i>I don't think Arcadia qualifies as an independent source in this matter, but rather as a promoter with an obvious self-interest in hyping a participant in their company's tournament.</i> If this guy is truly not<i>able</i>, he would have been not<i>ed</i> by publications without a direct financial interest in those tournaments.

<p>This article about a no lonoger published webcomic meets almost no standards. Their are no refrences even from the webcomic page. The text on the page is written poorly.

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that a webcomic is no longer published has no bearing on whether or not it meets notability standards, and an AFD is not a substitute for a cleanup tag. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 14:53, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, my search at the library has turned up no sources, let alone any suggesting importance.

<li>No, that would still not be relevant to the basic question of notability. Speculation on whether or not the topic would become notable in the future doesn't answer the question of whether the webcomic has at some point before now met the standards for notability. That said, I'm going to tentatively say <b>weak delete</b> on the basis of lack of any evidence for notability (I haven't found any either), and ask the contributors to the article<a href="http://www.lazarusworld.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1557" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lazarusworld.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1557" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> if they can provide any non-trivial sources.

<li>Repeating an invalid argument does not make it any more true.

<li>And repeating yourself <i>again</i> still doesn't turn your invalid argument valid.

<li>Thank you for sharing. Sometimes editors think it's a good idea to keep an article because, for example, it is tied to an event just around the corner which may lead to verifiable info from reputable sources. Whether or not you, in your self-appointed role as validator of AFD discussions, believe that to be an idea worth expresing, that type of "wait and see" idea probably isn't worth exploring here with "This article about a no longer published webcomic [which] meets almost no standards." In other words, that the webcomic is no longer published is worth noting as it is unlikely that a defunct webcomic is going to gain new verifiable coverage in the multiple non-trivial reputable sources which will allow us to cover this topic from a neutral point of view without delving into original research, or any of our other standards which this article currently doesn't meet. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a></li>

<li><b>Abstain</b> I don't see any notablity here, but I do see some <b>SERIOUS BIAS</b> against webcomics when I see "<i>A major cleanup is needed of all webcomics</i>" given as a specific reason for this AFD. I think that the nominator of this AFD needs to do some serious explaining for this remark before the AFD is to continue. I also see that other wiki editors who have also been identified as biased towards webcomics notablitly have chimed in with deletes. Please read <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a> - cruft is not a reason for AFD in itself, just a contributing factor.

<li><b>comment</b> I did not mean to make it sound like I hold a bias. My view is that too many webcomic authors make an article on their webcomic when it doesn't meet nobility standards. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Placebo_Effect_8620.html" title="User:The Placebo Effect">The Placebo Effect</a> 00:36, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> The author didn't make the entry to my knowledge, it was made several years after he had quit. In it's day it was a popular comic, noted as 'groundbreaking' by Mac Hall as commented in a previous deletion-discussion, referenced often in many other notiable strips... I don't know if that meets the standards or not for notiability since I'm not sure if other webcomics count (I think they should, there wasn't much else around at the time to judge notiability) but it's not just some author tooting their own horn. 22:53, 14 February 2007</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article has already been nominated for deletion once, and the end result of that attempt was <b>keep</b>. Given that the comic was determined to be notable shortly after the article was written, I think any argument that it is not notable should have more substance than "I did a search at the library and didn't find anything". A Google search of "bad boys of computer science" yields about 600 hits. Even a cursory examination of the results provides additional research leads, namely the web-comics Avalon and Sexy Losers. You may have to actually <b>ask</b> a member of the web-comics community to determine whether this comic was notable, if you are not a part of that community. Do the research to attempt to improve the article. If, despite your <b>best efforts</b>, you cannot find evidence of notability, document your search efforts on the talk page, then start the AFD process. Do not leap to that stage from the perspective that all webcomics suck, this article sucks even more than most webcomic articles, and Wikipedia should purge it as unworthy to be read. Deletion should not be the first option for someone who does not care to provide the effort to improve the article in any way; it should be the option of last resort for a topic that cannot meet standards, even when improved as much as humanly possible. 216.165.132.250 15:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Past performance doesn't guarantee future success. Look at the GNAA. It went through 18 AFD's before it was deleted. The reason I nominated this was because all the sources I found were other Webcomics, which I believe doesn't qualify as a good enough source for another webcomic. The only webcomic's that I believe that should be shown here are the ones that have published books are have had newspaper articles written about it (like Megatokyo). I don't believe all webcomics suck, but if it their are no reliable sources outside of webcomics, then I believe this has to go. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Placebo_Effect_8620.html" title="User:The Placebo Effect">The Placebo Effect</a> 17:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that, as of 2007, print-based sources are better determinants of notability than either web-based sources or first-hand personal interviews. The major reason why Wikipedia is so successful is that there are no "gatekeepers" for information: anyone can add or edit the content. If you require that notability be documented in a restricted medium, you are just moving the gatekeeper around to the back door. Also, I don't think BBoCS is comparable to GNAA in regard to the AfD process. Perhaps you could find a more fair comparison than the article for a trolling organization that has a racial slur in its title. In my opinion, the best sources for determining the notability of a web-comic are the people that are involved in that community, and comic authors are de facto leaders. They network amongst one another as much as print comic authors. Do you recall Blondie and Dagwood's anniversary, wherein most of the comics in your local newspaper paid tribute to the long-running print comic <b>by drawing crossover comics</b>? 216.165.132.250 21:26, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Their are gate keepers on information. That is the reason why their is Speedy Deletion and AFD. And no one used the crossover to cite information in Wikipedia. Plus, that was covered in various newspaper articles, namely "multiple non-trivial sources". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Placebo_Effect_8620.html" title="User:The Placebo Effect">The Placebo Effect</a> 21:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then the bone of contention here is whether other web-comics constitute a non-trivial source in regard to other web-comics. In my opinion, they are non-trivial. The people that read web-comics know which ones they like, and the authors, being drawn from the same pool of people, tend to like the same things. So in lieu of polling hundreds of readers (as may be seen from an archive from some sort of web-comics meta site, like Keen or BigPanda), a handful of webcomics authors may constitute a representative sample. Additionally, if you are too quick to label a newspaper as a non-trivial source, you may not be keeping your subscriptions current, as the presence of paid reporters and editors does not seem to be sufficient to keep pointless tripe and blatant political bias out of my local newspapers. There is good reason why print newspaper circulation is declining in the U.S., and that is because the "gatekeeper" model is no better at providing quality information than the free-for-all of blogs, boards, and wikis. The only advantage the media establishment currently holds over the internet mob is freer access to "newsmaker" people. They can get interviews with presidents and CEOs. But this is not an obstacle here. Many web-comics authors publish their e-mail addresses. If you want to prove non-notability (and in my opinion that burden of proof is on you, as this is an appeal to an earlier determination of notability), then ask some of these people if "Bad Boys of Computer Science" was notable way back in 2002. If you don't know who to ask, then perhaps you shouldn't be making judgements of notability at all. 216.165.132.250 22:09, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, the issue of whether the Blondie anniversary crossovers were used as references in Wikipedia is not relevant. If there were no other information available on Blondie whatsoever, the crossover comics alone would have been sufficient to establish its notability. I consider print-comics authors to have great credibility in regard to the importance of other print-comics. The same principle holds for web-comics. In contrast, there is no intrinsic measure of credibility in a fluff newspaper article whose author has never heard of a web-comic until his editor told him to write an article about them for the Sunday edition. But that reporter will still actually do enough research on the topic to fill a certain number of column-inches before flapping his jaw about it. 216.165.132.250 22:25, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>We are not here to debate the relevance of Mr. Zarnock’s status in the world of Die Cast cars. His book sales and his standing as an Icon in that realm does that by itself. It’s not just his World Record nor his collection that has brought him fame or for us to post him here, it’s the overall picture of what he is about and what he has brought to the community of 15 million Hot Wheels collectors around the world. A simple Google search will show that. If the article needs to be deleted, then so be it. He will still be the authority that he already is and others may read about him elsewhere.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Meh. The Guiness record by itself is not enough, the specialty market books by themselves and buying a lot of diecast toy cars is not enough. The movie roles are not enough. But together, they tip the scale towards notability. I am really surprised there are not a few newspaper articles to cite which would make the keep vote easier and quicker to arrive at. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 21:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> But surely to have a number of individually unnotable acheivements in unrelated areas should not suddenly make one notable? In my mind notability is about one major/notable accomplishment, and multiple minor ones should not add up to this.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article subject is worthy of an article, and it just needs work; it has potential.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject is worthy. In all the sound and fury of "Islamism" and Right Wing being dominant on all sides of the civilizational conversational right now, there isn't much discussion of this concept.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I became aware of the issue (as regards this AfD) on account of this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bhadani&amp;diff=107967074&amp;oldid=107611318" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bhadani&amp;diff=107967074&amp;oldid=107611318" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>. However, otherwise also the topic interests me. It is certainly not an original research though it may be unreferenced right now. For such pages, deletion is not the correct choice (in my opinion). The correct thing is to try to provide more references and references by way of further reading shall be still better. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 07:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I concur as above, and would particularly agree with Carl.bunderson's comment. This is an important subject, and an ideology which has been promoted by several highly notable figures, as the article indicates. There are actually a couple of decent external references on there, though it does need more accurate referencing for its quotes. The fact that it's a scrappy article means that we should improve it, not delete it. -- <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinaSparkle_3b36.html" title="User:TinaSparkle">TinaSparkle</a> 09:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I noticed that "Islamic Fascism" does not have an article of its own. Shariah law is actually fascist, and by this merit alone, it's quite shocking that we have a topic "Islamic Socialism" but "Islamic Fascism" does not have its own page.

<dd>Thanks for joining, how does your comment contradict the article's definition?

<dd>Not so much a contradiction as an indication of the purpose of the article. When the article has little more than a non-inclusive dictionary definition with an error in it (Old German Weib was not obsolete), it doesn't look like the article was created for the sake of the topic. It was very obvious that it was there purely to make a point, and not very well at that. What point? I'm not sure, but it seems to be part of the battle between advocates of SSM and right wing Christians. I note, though, that the article has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wife&amp;diff=107946689&amp;oldid=107690623" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wife&amp;diff=107946689&amp;oldid=107690623" rel="nofollow">changed</a> quite a bit since it was nominated, and may be salvageable. -trishm-</dd>

<dd>i am neither right wing nor ssm or who else, just interested in history and literature, as you see. Question, though: it never said, "Weib <i>was</i> obsolete" (which doesnt make sense to me right now), "obsolete" meant "not in use today", which is true, "Weib" means "Ehefrau" in both colloquial and legal German. If that is what you meant?

<dd>I guess we were talking at cross purposes, and you've won me over. I didn't mean to categorize you, it just seemed that the article was being used as a weapon in some idealogical war. "Weib" is archaic, for sure, but still survives a weiblich, so I reacted a bit to "obsolete"; and I'm sure your German is far superior to mine. Now I can see the potential in the article. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrishm_3029.html" title="User:Trishm">Trishm</a> 04:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Secondly, the purpose of this article is not length, but what i just said, and have kept saying. It does not repeat the kinds-of-marriage issue from marriage, either. It is also not limited to the time frame suggested ~ten lines above this comment.<a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammingo_0f6f.html" title="User:Flammingo">Flammingo</a><sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlammingo_7d70.html" title="User talk:Flammingo">Parliament</a></sup> 21:47, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I can see that it's not limited to that time frame, that's why I'm suggesting <b>a set of</b> such articles, divided by whatever historical segments are appropriate. There's very little to be gained in having these dicdefs and just filling them with a variety of historical anecdotes. If the coverage is too long for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> (and I'm not convinced that it is) then the way to do it is is by articles on those historical periods, not just dumping grounds for anything and everything from every time period. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 21:57, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've seen the word "indiscriminate" used here and elsewhere as a reason to delete a list. I thought "indiscriminate" meant the list could go on and on and on without a reasonable end because the criteria for being on it was too broad. By this definition, this list can't be indiscriminate. There are a limited number of major-party presidential candidates. Maybe I'm wrong; if so, someone please point me to the Wikipedia guideline on indiscriminate lists. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 19:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, and just to clarify: This is a list of major-party <b>nominees</b> not just any candidate. That narrows the list considerably. We've had less than 100 major-party nominees in all of U.S. history and fewer than 60 who lost (some later won) and the list will only grow by a maximum of one every four years.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 19:46, 14 February 2007 (UTC) (edited to correct a couple of errors)</dd>
<dd>I believe you are right as to what "indiscriminate" refers to in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (which I'm guessing is why the nom didn't use that word). Certainly the list has an end and is maintainable. I just think that the criteria are kind of arbitrary and that the info here is better left in the articles about the candidates. If you have this, why not have List of successful major-party United States presidential candidates' military service? And it's only a short notability jump to List of unsuccessful third-party United States presidential candidates' military service or my Tajikistan example above. This information belongs in Wikipedia, but if you start including it in every format imaginable, it starts to become a database and not an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 20:09, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the response. I think we can use our judgment as to what topics are serious and important enough -- no rules will ever be enough to cover all contingencies anyway. I'd give a lot of leeway to lists of presidents or major-party candidates because scholars and voters have a serious interest in past precedents and behavior. I think it's a very big jump to third-party candidates because it's easier to be a third-party candidate and so we have so many more of them, and their impact on politics is so much less, so I don't see a slippery slope there. I'm not bothered by lists of presidents from other countries because this isn't your father's paper encyclopedia. If there's no TajikiWiki to handle the Tajiki list, then I'd accept one on the English Wikipedia. Incidentally, you say the information should be included on individual pages, but anyone interested in the <b>topic</b> is going to have a much easier time with it on one page with links to those pages for details. I think that's the only practical way to cover the subject for scholars and voters interested in it, and it's a serious subject.</dd>
<dd>Let me take about three steps back: We all know this electronic encyclopedia can cover far more topics than paper ever could. When we're thinking about how far that should go, it seems to me serious topics such as U.S. presidents need to be a priority, where we should be especially inclusive. In a big, powerful democracy like the U.S. or U.K., information on candidates and political history has enormous value to enormous numbers of people (inside and outside those nations) and anything that can (reasonably) help voters should be included. So topics that commonly come up in campaigns are valubable. For the same reason, I'd be inclusive about similar topics in other nations -- because it's important in those nations and, especially if they're poorer, Wikipedia can be an important resource to them. Perhaps, the standard should be a little harder (but not much) to meet for smaller nations and harder still for non-English-speaking nations with Wikipedias that serve them in their own languages. But a Wikipedia that limits itself this much on such a serious topic while a tsunami of trivial books, movies, television characters and video games flood the place becomes just the trivial hodgepodge you're arguing against. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:17, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The criteria seem arbitrary. It only looks at the U.S. presidential election, only major-party nominees, and only those nominees who were never (before or after) president. That seems like an odd restriction. It would be less arbitrary to list all the major-party nominees, and I might not have thought twice about it. But then, why look at military service in particular? Why not their former political service? Or their non-political career? Or any other facet that can be listed? This led me to wonder: Has any external reliable source produced a similar list specifically about the former military service of presidential nominees? If not, then there would need to be a good reason to compile such a list on WP <i>first</i>. Someone could make a list of the presidential nominees and the hair color of their spouses, but if nobody else has published such a list, then I would argue that shows such an intersection of information is not notable -- even if every individual entry could be cited to a reliable source. On the other hand, if a list of nominees and former military service <i>has</i> been published elsewhere, then it is probably a notable intersection of information worth a spot in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 21:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the <i>film</i> is a topic worthy of an encyclopedia entry, then we can have an article on the <i>film</i>. However, just because a movie has the same title as a word in the dictionary doesn't make that word worthy of an encyclopedia article. Looking at the IMDB entry for this movie, there is no indication of what it is about, how the term is used, or the context in which the title applies. If the "Straphangers Campaign" is encyclopedic, we can have an article on the "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Straphangers_Campaign_bfe4.html" title="Straphangers Campaign">Straphangers Campaign</a>" (and we do). There are movies, companies, charities, etc., with the word "united" in their title, but we don't have or need an article on the dicdef "united" ("<a href="../../../u/n/i/United.html" title="United">united</a>", by the way, is simply a disambig page, no article or definition). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:49, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, once again Otto4711 has come up with a good idea. Merging together would be a good idea, because they are famous as a couple and thus having two articles would mean a lot of duplicated information (though I'm fine with two, just a single article seems like a better idea). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 17:08, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. The article on the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_and_Mary_Conley_cc24.html" title="David and Mary Conley">two of them together</a> was already made 3 months ago, I prod'd it, and another editor made it a simple redirect to the TAR10 article, which it's sat at, uncontested for the 3 months since then. The fact that now, 3 months later, the individual articles on these two contain no information that wasn't already in the tiny stub article on them as a couple (aside from the line "will appear in TAR All-stars") tells me that these are definitely non-notable people right now, and don't need their own article. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 17:18, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>True, but I was referring more to the fact that even three months later there's almost nothing for you to add to the article to bring it "up to date". It's still a tiny stub with little chance of growing. By the end of TAR All-Star, it'll have one more line of "David and Mary finished in nth place". If they win, then they might become notable and the article worthy of recreation. But until we see the result of the new season (which hasn't even started yet), I don't think there's enough notability here to justify the article. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 17:46, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This actually touches on a problem inherent in these articles. The information generally starts out in the parent article then gets offloaded to a separate "...in popular culture" article. Then if the pop-cult article gets AfDed the outcome is often merge. Which uts the information back into the main article until it bloats enough so that someone separates it again, and around and around. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:41, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete as unreferenced</b> Let me start by saying that WP:NOT#IINFO does <i>not</i> cover trivia and "in pop-culture" articles; that section of policy is very specific on what it covers. However, that being said, this article appears to be virtually unreferenced. Unless references are provided for verifiability and notability purposes, the article should be deleted (note that unreferenced material should not be remerged with the main article but should simply be deleted and only recreated when references are added.)<a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:38, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I agree with your conclusion, I must still disagree with your assertion that WP:NOT#IINFO can't be cited. Consensus may not have been reached on the issue but that does not mean that the items for which consensus has been reached are exhaustive. There is some discussion on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> talk page which I encourage any interested parties to view. However, even absent WP:NOT#IINFO, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> forbids "Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics." I would assert that a collection of one-liners from a couple of dozen sources would qualify for deletion under WP:NOT#DIR as well. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:25, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I'm more willing to buy an argument using WP:NOT#DIR for a list of loosely associated trivial facts. Just as a general aside, though, there has been a tendency to misuse the WP:NOT#IINFO section as a sort of catch-all "I don't like it" reference in these afd debates. Some editors seem to refer to it whenever an article deals with something they feel is "trivial" or "unimportant", for example. Anyway, as both Otto and I mentioned, there's a broader discussion about this on the WP:NOT talk page, so I won't go into it here other than to advise that unless an article actually falls under one of the specific consensus sections of WP:NOT#IINFO you probably should not refer to it as it somewhat invalidates that portion of your argument. Find a more appropriate section of policy that directly talks about what you are dealing with (such as maybe using WP:NOT#DIR for lists of "random" facts). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 00:00, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and improve</b>. The article and its discussion page are indeed rife with special pleading, but it isn't intrinsically worthless. Controversial additions such as "Islamophobia," "India Basher," and "Anti-Semite" need to be well-sourced, of course, and at least one of the three now is. Consensus should be possible with good-faith editing and – if need be – mediation. For the rest, the main problem isn't POV-pushing but non-notable trivia and pop curiosities.

<li><b>Delete</b> I've been watching the recent controversy over including "anti-semite" as a political epithet from a distance and I kept thinking that this is really listcruft. There's no notability criteria, so this could, and in some ways already has, devolve into a list of all the mean things people have said about other people's politics. This is unmaintainable and, as the article itself says, never going to be comprehensive. People have been both extraordinarily clever and mindbogglingly obnoxious in inventing terms for their political enemies over the millenia, but there is no question that the human race has been exuberant in this area. To demonstrate, before reading the next sentence, stop to see how many different ways you can call someone a Nazi in 60 seconds. Here's what I came up with: Nazi, facist, gestapo tactics, stormtrooper, hitlerian, hitlerist, hitlerism, national socialist, brown shirt. Ten epithets on one topic in 60 seconds, I timed myself. I'm sure wikipedians could come up with 50 more, just in English. And none of those 50 will be any less notable than some of the gems. The whole list is useless because you have to wade through a zillion insignificant neologisms ("Bushit, DUmmy,etc.) to find something thats of any encyclopedic value. Not to mention that some of these are really not political at all. "Newsbabe". If someone wants to do a list of historically significant political epithets (say, political epithets that have entered the general lexicon, "carpetbagger" or "quisling" for example) that's encyclopedic, but the current list is just drek.<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 22:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - most of the terms in the article are well-sourced. Just because there is continuing controversy about some is no reason to get rid of the whole thing. <i>The principle of the nomination is based on a misunderstanding.</i> Calling something an epithet is not the same as calling it a fact: an epithet is, among other things, "A term used to characterize a person or thing" and "An abusive or contemptuous word or phrase." (from Wiktionary). Moreover, just because something is a target for POV-pushers and vandalism is no reason to delete it.

It seems with the nomination of the template 'notable members of the seduction community' and deletion of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Social_Dynamics_8175.html" title="Real Social Dynamics">Real Social Dynamics</a> and Badboy Lifestyle that this is the next step.

<li><b>Keep</b> - meets the special cases criteria for notability as, "Major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage. Just being an elected local official does not guarantee notability." Google search shows lots of local media coverage, especially in relation to accusations of corruption. - <a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMocko13_549e.html" title="User:Mocko13">Mocko13</a> 04:13, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- It's obviously a stub, so the full notability of this guy isn't in the article. But the top cop for a city that size is easily notable. I did a google search too, of "Kevin Beary"+"Orange County" and came up with 10,800 hits. Turns out he's quite controversial in them parts: Sheriff of the year, ethical allegations against him, questions over homeland security spending through his department, taser issues, etc., etc. Sites seem to range from CNN to angry blogs. Even if he wasn't controversial, he holds an office that has a profound influence in a large community and I'm sure whoever his predecessor was got plenty of media attention as well. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 05:14, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> He is the Sheriff of Orange County, FL, which includes much of the Orlando metropolitan area. The subject is notable enough for an article, altough it should probably be expanded. Even without all of the stuff that Bobanny mentions, I think that being the sheriff of such a large and important county is notable in and of itself. <a href="../../../m/4/1/User%7EM412k_8ee1.html" title="User:M412k">M412k</a> 05:42, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It can be hard to find articles about the school itself, and not the awards given out, but I think that's partly because they give out so many awards. The fact that the awards seem to be taken seriously and the fact that they get a decent deal of press coverage from sponsoring the directors cup standings pushes them toward notability. US News probably does not have information on them because it is such a non-traditional program that they don't rate the school. The school claims a handful of notable alumni.</dd>
<dd><b>Weak Keep / Merge</b> on the other awards articles, though if kept, most of them need massive cleanup and sources that do not originate from the school or the awardee.</dd>

<ul>
<li>As I noted, there's no evidence that the "recipients" of these honorary degrees actually accepted them. The fact that an institution may announce that it was conferring honorary degrees doesn't mean that the institution itself is notable. It should further be noted that the editor who appeared to be working on behalf of publicizing the institution misleadingly inserted these "honorary degree" references into the education background parts of articles with misleading edit summaries. For an example, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kofi_Annan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107849829" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kofi_Annan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107849829" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 21:02, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

You have a point about conferral vs. acceptance. I have incorporated into the article a source that confirms that at least one notable person has accepted--the President of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Timor_c0fb.html" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>. I think this should satisfy concerns that the institution's honorary degrees are ignored--I <i>will</i> try to find more sources for other conferrals. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:23, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Although that is strange, I think the fact that Leach's biography does mention the school is more relevant toward establishing that it's an actual school. Perhaps the reason it's not mentioned in McDermott's page is because it is less detailed. If you have reason to suspect that McDermott is a USSA graduate, please remove any reference to him from the article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue is not whether it exists -- it certainly does. The question is whether it is sufficiently notable. I am considering removing McDermott from the article, but that doesn't affect the issue.

<p>ADDITIONAL COMMENT</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The United States Sports Academy is certainly a real university. It has been accredited by NASPE and NASM, and has bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degress in sport specific studies. In fact, it is the only sport specific institution in the nation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We recently had a mention in U.S. News and World Reports (<a href="http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/8575.html" class="external free" title="http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/8575.html" rel="nofollow">http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/8575.html</a>) citing our Directors Cup.</p>
<p>Also, if you are checking the validity of our honorees, please look up the Abbot Shi Yongxin, the leader of Chinese Chan Bhuddism. His presence was noted at our Academy by both the Mobile Register and the New York Times.</p>
<p>We have also worked with Soprt for Peace to create positive international relations through sport.</p>
<p>Please let me know how I can help to verify any additional data that you may need.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If you are affiliated with the institution, it is a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> for you to be promoting the institution on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 05:24, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>True, but there is really no promotion in the article and, furthermore, I see nothing wrong with offering to provide independent, reliable sources about which one is knowledgeable. <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> discourages editing of articles by those who may have a conflict of interest, but not contributing/assisting others to edit. Finally, WP:COI should be used within reasonable bounds.

<li>I disagree that Lucidagtha had no conflict of interest and was not promoting the institution. Take a look at her edit history -- particularly the edit summaries. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 08:22, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, she only created articles about awards and persons related to the USSA. That is not necessarily promotion. Other may create a series of articles about economics books--that doesn't mean they get royalties from the sale of these books. People create articles about topics with which they are familiar or interested. In any case, the content created is more important than the identity of its creator. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>COMMENT I added data about the persons and awards that I was talking about that was true. I never said anything subjective, I merely mentioned that such awards, educational institutions, etc. existed. I feel that, in a list of honors and awards that an artist like Leroy Neiman has received, for example, it is important to update his entry to include his most recent, the 2007 Sport Artist of the year, for completeness and to keep his article current.</p>
<p>I did not add additional data because that would have been stepping outside of what I know.</p>
<p>I have added a quantity of information recently, this is true, because I only recently found out that there was no information on this subject on Wikipedia, and, as this institution has been in place for decades, I thought to remedy this gap.</p>
<p>As I said, please let me know if there is any way that I can help you to verify the data. I apologize for this inconvenience.</p>

<li>Thank you for your offer. I think the concern raised by <a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">User:Nlu</a> is the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notability</a> of the institution and the awards. I think that of the institution has been sufficiently established (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a>, please correct me here if you disagree), but that of the awards is still up for grabs. The primary criterion for notability is being "<i>the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself</i>." Do you perhaps know of sources (independent of the USSA) that note the awards included in this AfD? Otherwise, I think most qualify for deletion or merging.

<li><b>keep</b> for the institution. The others should be relisted in homogenous groups, unless they are merged instead. Trying to delete an article for a real institution and all of the related articles at the same time indicates an overhasty procedure. I wouldn't mind considering all the awards together--I would probably say to delete them all. But the other miscellaneous articles should be proposed for deletion one at a time. Trying to do it this way risks unfairness. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:49, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>THE AWARDS I do not think that they should be deleted outright, as they are historically of importance, as they have been given to Olympic heroes, political leaders, etc. Also, they are mentioned in places outside of the institution, such as:</p>

<p>Hoax. This person (if he exists) is not a courtesy Viscount, nor does the Earldom he is supposedly the heir to still exist. Similar things have been done involving this name in the past (see the history of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Jersey_bdba.html" title="Earl of Jersey">Earl of Jersey</a>, for instance), so clearly someone with some kind of strange obsession. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 17:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Has been translated into six other languages already, has a lot of Russian links (and featured in a magazine there I believe, see the external links) and also isn't supposed to have any speakers.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Appears to lack multiple independent coverages in independent and reliable sources. Gets a few thousand Google hits, but I would like to see several articles in refereed scientific or more speficically linguistic journals. Are "conlangers" hobbyists or linguistic scholars? Not intrinsically opposed to an article about a made up language with too many phonemes to be speakable, but the article has to have reliable sources to show it is notable and goes beyond things made up inside or outside school one day. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 21:14, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>merge with erotic sexual denial</b> this group of articles are a mess; the terms mean a whole range of things, and the articles are apparently written by the use of guesswork and partial personal knowledge. (But Chastity belt is a real article on its own, and is a rather large topic if everything available was included, since it has a substantial historical literature.) I would not really object to putting this into erotic sexual denial, and rewriting it.

<p>This article is not about English but about Spanish names and therefore should not be here on the English wikipedia. Ity is also very POV.

<li><b>Keep</b> Perfectly encyclopedical: Cross reference to Spanish names for better understanding articles from different sources. This articles are not about a language but about the denominations of certain things. I would also add the French denominations whenever possible. There are several articles about things in other languages, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Spanish_words_of_Germanic_origin_1441.html" title="List of Spanish words of Germanic origin">List of Spanish words of Germanic origin</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a><small>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarianocecowski_943c.html" title="User talk:Marianocecowski">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marianocecowski_7d10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marianocecowski">c</a>)</small> 20:32, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - your unequivocal statement that "The Falklands are a British terrirtory with British names" is itself partly POV. The Falklands are regarded by many as disputed territory.

<li>No that is not a threat. I am not Argentinean and do not particularly care about the Falkland (or Malvinian) Islands one way or another. My comment was intended to convey the fact that the statement "The Falklands are a British terrirtory" is disputed by many Argentineans (and some others), and the nom's justification for deleting this article based on POV may itself constitute POV. It was essentially a spin (and apparently an unsuccessful one) on the phrase: "that and $3 will get you a cup of coffee". However, as my meaning apparently did not go through, I have changed the text so it is clearer. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:49, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - obviously, I created it. The main reason for my creating this article is that most Spanish names are NOT translated from the English or vice versa. In fact, some of them are confusing, particularly 'Gran Malvina' which is used for the second biggest island.</li>

<dd>Yes, I am aware that the English have controlled the islands for a long while, but not without controversy, and some maps include both English and Spanish nomenclature, notably those in China (rendered into Chinese of course!)--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 15:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - these are not all 'Argentine' names, in fact some are used in Chile, and beyond. They are also used in English occasionally by those who support Argentina's claim. There's also some Spanish names used in English, e.g. Dos Lomos, Rincon Grande etc. It is very common to see the name 'Falkland-Malvinas' used in English. I also include a disclaimer at the top. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 15:53, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Come on, guys, the Falkland Islands weren't worth fighting about 25 years ago, and they're not now. I like the article, but I really think the article could have a PoV issue.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The fact that a couple of FORMER film students started the company in 2004 is irrelevant. What's relevant is, that as of 2007, the Company is, and has done notable work. A.P.E. also shows (by my count) 10 music videos at their official company website (www.apefilms.com) &amp; 16 videos and a DVD trailer at their official company myspace website(www.myspace.com/apefilms). It is the face of two up and coming directors crediting themselves as "APE FILMS". The Company is credited on two just released DVD's (Coco's 2007 Erotics Calendar DVD &amp; Coco's 2007 Black Men Magazine DVD) and a music video (Grandmaster Mele Mel - "M3 - The New Message"). Grandmaster Mele Mel (also spelled Melle Mel) becomes the first rapper (as leader of The Furious Five) to ever be inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame on March 12, 2007. A.P.E.'s "M3 - The New Message" music video is notable because it is being used to promote the first ever solo album by Mele Mel. It is also a sequel to the original Grand Master Flash &amp; Furious Five song &amp; music video "The Message" (one of most important songs in Hip Hop history) "The Message" was also written &amp; performed by Melle Mel. Grandmaster Mele Mel is featuring the A.P.E. "M3 - The New Message" music video at his official website (www.melemel.net). Company is clearly credited at end of video. Grandmaster Mele Mel also has 2 more A.P.E. Company videos ("Portal In The Park" &amp; "M3 - Making The Video") showing at his official Myspace website (use link from www.melemel.net). Company is clearly on end credits of those videos as well. A.P.E. is also credited on the Grandmaster Mele Mel's "Muscles" CD, world release January 2007. Company is listed in credits of MTV2 Fight Klub (this show airs in North America, Europe &amp; Asia). Company is listed as #1 friend at MTV2 Fight Klub Host International P official myspace site (www.myspace.com/ipfk). There is much aditional evidence to be found at the two official Company websites.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - a list of credits can verify information, but doesn't really fit the bill for reliable sources for establishing notability. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 14:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - true, but TV News reports, Magazine articles &amp; the distribution &amp; airing of the Company's works to a multi-national audience does. It's not the credits that are notible, but the company &amp; the works themselves that they create. For instance, they created a video that was used as part of a U.S. national Fire Prevention Campaign &amp; another that was used as a sequel to a very historic video by a equally historic Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame inductee (Grandmaster Mele Mel - "M3 - The New Message").

<li>Some info on company found by Googling "A.P.E.

I crossed referenced this with both company websites, &amp; found much additional evidence showing that this company did in fact produce this &amp; other nationally/internationally released works. Other company videos were found with Google video by Googling the titles of each work.

<li><b>Comment</b> - as far as I can see the focus of the material is on CS Vernon rather than APE.

<li><b>Comment</b> - there is more verifiable info credited to her, but the videos they do are produced by both under the company name "A.P.E.". Jimmy Lee individualy is credited as director (along with A.P.E.) on the Mele Mel "M3 - The New Message" music video. The two individuals &amp; the company are credited on the two Coco DVD's. C.S. Vernon &amp; Jimmy Lee share director credit on the national "Take It Outside" music video. The company has a production credit. They also share director credit on the "Broke Celebrity" TV pilot produced for celebrity stylist/fashion designer Indashio (Indashio.com &amp; myspace.com/indashio).

User:Bh1967 is the creator of the article in question, and both User:Bh1967, and User:Playserious appear to be <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accounts</a> with edits realted only to this article. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 20:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - APE Films' association with a handful of notable people does not adequately establish its own notablity. This AfD seems analogous to the AfDs I've seen for indie music journalists who interview every notable indie rock band as they come into town; sure, they can name-drop impressively, but that doesn't say anything about their own importance. There also appear to be serious problems here with <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. The bottom line is that this is not an article which will attract a group of knowledgeable, disinterested editors - which is the real purpose of having notability standards. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 21:25, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The fact that I created the article should not be used as an excuse to dismiss the facts I have stated &amp; the sources I have listed. It is not the company's association with notible people that makes the company notible (although that too can be a factor in making something notible), but rather the work the company is doing that makes them notible. The Company performs video &amp; editing work for MTV2 Fight Klub (the industry's #1 source of producing this generations top MC's with dozens that have signed to Major Record Labels), and the fact that company is also producing video for Legendary Grandmaster Mele Mel, Hip Hop's 1st ever "MC" is notible. They are not interviewing notible artists "when they come into town" about the artists work. The company is gaining respect as an emerging company BASED ON THE COMPANY'S WORK. The company IS the artist. They are being hired by notible people &amp; companies to create new, original works. There is a BIG difference. This article is a work that will attract a group of knowledgeable, disinterested editors as the company continues to produce work in the public eye and more people become familiar with it.

(I also disagree that searching for his real name is ineffective, since a reliable source would at least mention his name once.) On the other hand, there does not appear to be any concrete evidence of Vulliez's notability outside of his "Ultimate Showdown" flash, which itself is only really notable due to the associated song, not by him, charting on Dr. Demento's countdown. And his anti-eBaum's World flash doesn't appear to be notable outside of the Something Awful community. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 02:56, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not a musical genre, and even if it is, it is not notable since apparently only Rhapsody of Fire is generally considered <i>film score metal</i>.</p>
<p>Yes, the term exists, as it gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=+%22film+score+metal%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=+%22film+score+metal%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">10900 GHits</a>. However, if you were to do a search that excludes "<i>rhapsody</i>", you would only get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=+%22film+score+metal%22+-rhapsody&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=+%22film+score+metal%22+-rhapsody&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">288 GHits</a>.</p>
<p>If each band in the world was to invent their own metal subgenre and we were to do an article per subgenre, we are going to have a lot of trouble listing all of those! A musical genre is not a genre if it only includes two or three bands!</p>

I agree with the nominator, as said genre isn't a genre. I think of the term as in "metal, used in a film score" not "metal that sounds like a film score". As the examples given on the page, it makes the word genre entirely useless, as there is hardly any cohesion between examples listed, other than they <i>seem</i> like they are. --<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDayn_6af1.html" title="User:Dayn">Dane</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDayn_e931.html" title="User talk:Dayn">~nya</a></sup> 02:23, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Also the sources are 1. an essay; 2. a (respected) genre-specific encyclopaedia which merely says "The genre description says “Film Score Metal” <i>and why not</i>?" [emphasis added], intimating that, in fact, it is not a recognised sub-genre. Other sources cited are LastFM, where anyone can tag anything as any genre they feel fit, whether it's right or not. And all references do, indeed, trail back to the one band.

<li>Listen, I know that you want this included, but it just doesn't meet the standards. Right now, the subject is a little under the threshold of notability required by Wikipedia. But I'm sure that given a few years, Faye will become more and more well known and notable in his achievements, and when that day comes, it will be appropriate for him to have an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> The information in the article is true, and is of value to anyone that has an interest in college basketball, Georgia Tech especially. Also, there have been numerous online gathering points where the "legend" of Faye was extolled, brought on by a LACK of information about this basketball player from Senegal. Removing information about him, will no doubt again lead to the interested looking for information, and then having to make it up as it will not be widely available. I see no reason why the article should be deleted, except that some have "dug in" to their positions. Is is also, IMO, weak on the part of the editor to infer that the article was written by the subject, as this is an allegation that should have at least the aspect of merit, rather than accusing someone of doing this without any cause. Just because the editor is wrong, he should be willing to leave the page alone to atone for his mistake.</li>

<p><strike><b>Keep.</b></strike>*I would argue that it is written from a neutral viewpoint, and therefore not a conflict of interest. Also, the discography remains incomplete, as an album was released in 2005 (One Way Ticket). There are articles from the BBC, Radio Cornwall, and independent websites cited already, and the state of the artist is a large influence in the local area and culture, as can be seen from the wikipedia articles that already link to the page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2645.html" title="User talk:The Red Army Band">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Red_Army_Band_5e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Red Army Band">contribs</a>) 21:57, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small>--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 21:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The main point I believe them not to have failed WP: Music is "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city". They are the most prominant and wellknown anti-folk band in Cornwall, and lead the movement with bands on the local scene. They also have toured in England "at least a medium sized country", and therefore I argue do not fail this criteria. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2645.html" title="User talk:The Red Army Band">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Red_Army_Band_5e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Red Army Band">contribs</a>) 22:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small>--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 22:34, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - This article was nominated not too long ago under the name "List of Disney Channel Stars" and was moved to this name as the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Disney_Channel_Stars_f09b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Disney Channel Stars">outcome</a>. I would not normally re-nominate an article this quickly after an AFD but in this instance I don't believe that an important issue was given due consideration. Much of the AFD focused on the utility of categories vs lists. I feel like overlooked in that was the discussion on whether listing actors by the network where their program aired is a good idea. I don't think that it is. There is some measure of precedent for deletion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Nickelodeon_actors_0298.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Nickelodeon actors">here</a>. There are also a number of categories up for deletion of a similar theme and while the CFDs are still open sentiment is running in favor of deleting <i>performer by network</i> as a category scheme. It's no more proper as a listing scheme. Credits for an actor should be listed in the actor's article, and cast lists should be present and linked in the article for the shows themselves. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:42, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> In reply to Otto above, I just wanted to post a reminder that categories and lists do not have identical guidelines and policies for Wikipedia inclusion. In general categories have stricter guidelines than lists for what is or isn't acceptable on Wikipedia. That's because an inappropriate list pretty much only affects that list itself, but the effects of a bad <i>category</i> can be broader based and harder to deal with or correct. So there are times when something is inappropriate as a category, but can be acceptable as a list. In particular, while there is good consensus against performer-by-studio categories, I'm not off-hand sure whether or not there is like consensus one way or another for lists by studio. Personally, I'm going to defer judgement on this list for now, but I will say that I wouldn't be comfortable deleting a <i>list</i> simply because a similar <i>category</i> was deleted. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:01, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Categories vs lists" is not under discussion here. The <i>first</i> AFD nom was about the categories vs lists issue. As I said, overlooked in that discussion was the question as to whether lists of actors by the network they happen to have a show on is appropriate. This nomination is regarding that question. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:01, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Before I state a position, I'd like some clarification on exactly what makes the list not a "good idea." I see the precedent cited by the nominator, and it seemed to be a unanimous consensus to delete that one. I could go either way here, but would like a more clear reason for deletion. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 21:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate list and directory</a>, bringing together people who may have nothing else in common than they happened to have a show on a particular network that someone else did. It would be like listing <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desi_Arnaz_15b5.html" title="Desi Arnaz">Desi Arnaz</a> with <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Patrick_Harris_472b.html" title="Neil Patrick Harris">Neil Patrick Harris</a> as "CBS actors" despite their having nothing else in common and their shows appearing on CBS almost 50 years apart. There is no substantive connection. Even disregarding that, it's a poor organizational choice for an encyclopedia. A list of Disney Channel shows with links to the show, with cast lists in each show with links to the actors' articles, is the superior organizational scheme. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:13, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete as too large to properly maintain</b> In reviewing the afd Otto mentions as "precedent", it appears there is only one valid reason posited for deletion, namely that maintaining an entire channel's list of actors is likely to be unmaintainable due to its overwhelming size. The other comments consisted of "delete per nom" (which doesn't really say anything) and "listcruft" (any phrase using "cruft" is never a valid term or reason for deletion).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So I'm recommending deletion based on the likelihood this would be virtually impossible to properly handle. However, I do want to point out that I don't consider the List of Nickelodeon actors a very strong case for afd precedent, since it had very limited discussion and was mainly a handful of editors saying "I agree with the nom". Depending on the outcome of this Disney Channel afd, I think this afd will make a better case to check for future similar discussions. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:44, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article can not be deleted under Wikipedian Common Law. Arguments regarding the use of Google as a mean of determining how well known an article is should never be the only criteria for deletion. The information found in this article about the band Sex Ant Toys speaks the truth under good faith and can be verified through reliable published sources including, but not limted to Apple iTunes Music Store, Recording Industry Association of America, Magazines/Publications, Miss Mabry (a sublabel of Vuela Music with registered trademark in the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office) and the official website of Sex Ant Toys. This article contains useful and resouceful information in regards to Sex Ant Toys as the market approaches the release date of their first upcoming album through major digital download stores like iTunes, Naptser, Sony Connect, Rhapsody, Zune, and Musicnet among others across the world. Sex Ant Toys is a new act signed by a major music download distribution channel under the label of Miss Mabry. I urge Wikipedia to take action in regards to this matter on behalf of the new music community that promotes the use of new mediums of communication and the new music revolution. This article for deletion should debated under all given circumstances before it is deleted. We are now taking full responsability regarding this matter: editing the information and sourcing its content with reliable references. Thanks Void Sat News 08:33, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

An anonymous IP vandalised David Fuchs' userpage by adding the appropriate templates (the same anonymous IP did the same to Jimbo Wales' page minutes later<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105112800" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105112800" rel="nofollow">[87]</a>). Any editor can use the templates, but their use doesn't automatically mean the targeted user is guilty of any wrongdoing. And please don't resort to <i>ad hominem</i> attacks to try and make your point. An article should be kept or deleted on its strength, relevance, notability, verifiability and so on, not on who has contributed to or commented about it. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 10:42, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>For the record</b>: Yes, my page was vandalized, and yes, I've also been blocked twice, I think, due to IP vandalism (when I'm editing on school comps or my little bro is annoying). You're right, google hits shouldn't be the method for requiring stuff, but they are often telling: for instance if all the links are to the bands myspace page, <i>lack of third-party</i> etc. is apparently a concern. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid Fuchs</b></a> <sup>(<small><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a></small> / <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">frog blast the vent core!</a></small>)</sup> 17:05, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As the creator of the article, I think Wikipedia should have one on the the RC Quarterly. Just because there aren't enough links on the web doesn't make it right to delete an article. RC Quarterly is cited on mainstream media (in Turkey) as I have seen a lot of times. It is a new magazine and that is why there isn't much information online, but shouldn't Wikipedia be a source of information itself? Doesn't the fact that there isn't much information online about this publication make it vital to be included in the encyclopedia, where people could learn more about it? It is true that <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_College_66a1.html" title="Robert College">Robert College</a> article provides the same information on RC Quarterly; however, if you have noticed that, you should have also noticed that this article is a stub. I think, this article should be kept and improved. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestroka_29f0.html" title="User:Maestroka">Maestro</a> 18:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I honestly still don't understand your argument here.

<ul>
<li>Trivia sections have <i>no one</i> topic. They're just random collections of things someone finds interesting. I've seen them include, all at once, movie casting info, hidden jokes and comparisons of the growl of a villain in one movie with a villain in another (that was my all-time favourite- blatant OR). That's why they say trivia sections can be partially integrated into the main text- you may get enough info for a whole casting section, or a video game section, or a cultural impact section (or in this case, daughter article)- but again, I'd shed no tears if it were simply redirected, whatever editors see fit. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 03:41, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> anything notable with the main article. I disagree with the statement made by the nominator regarding "in popular culture" articles as there are topics that are viable under this format. This shouldn't be used as criteria for deletion unless Wikipedia institutes a "No 'In Popular Culture' Articles" policy. The nominator is welcome to propose such a ban through the proper channels, of course. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:40, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> per 23skidoo. Jeopardy is such a big and popular game show that some mentionings of its influence in other programs and literature is warranted although maybe not to the extent we have here. It is better to preserve the history beneath a redirect so that people can work on it, than to delete everything. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:45, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Whatever the result, it should absolutely NOT be <b>merge.</b> First of all, no one has volunteered to work on a merge, and the amount of work involved is enormous: far too much <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_Slave_60f5.html" title="User:Mangojuice/Slave">for the closing admin</a>. No one has even given guidelines as to what should be merged vs. thrown out. Second, trivia detracts from serious articles. It's important to recognize that, because the merge will likely leave the main article worse, and that article is more important to preserve than the trivia. Third, the Jeopardy article already has an abbreviated "in popular culture" section which is selective, including only three items; in a sense, the important stuff has already been merged. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 14:51, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Obviously cannot be merged, perhaps cut down a bit. Above is an essay, not a policy. Pop culture articles can be useful to some, but appearantly not you. Have you been nominating other pop culture articles for AFD, too? If it is to be deleted, then I may make a 'subpage article,' which I believe are allowed. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReywas92_4c7c.html" title="User:Reywas92"><font style="background:#7FFF00"><b>Reywas92</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../r/e/y/User_talk%7EReywas92_aaca.html" title="User talk:Reywas92"><font style="background:#00ff7f"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sup> 15:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If by a subpage, you mean something like Jeopardy!/Trivia, then, no, that kind of page is no longer used. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 16:16, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, like User:Xyz/Jeopardy Pop culture. I have seen other users have subpages not relating to the user, but more article-like. This may not be liked, but legal.

<li>Ah. Yes, <i>user</i> subpages are okay, but article subpages aren't.

<li><b>Keep.</b> <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> and article length policy contradict each other. The material collected in this article is relevant to demonstrating the cultural impact of <i>Jeopardy!</i>, but was split off of the <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a></i> article because that article would have been overwhelmed by it. Additionally, some of the material on the page is not trivia in the sense that it is not just interesting but is also notable. If this article is deleted, all the material would eventually return, but in the <i>Jeopardy!</i> article, added by new users who never saw the spun-off article. I don't understand why we want to revert to that state of affairs again. I would also point out that the <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21_set_evolution.html" title="Jeopardy! set evolution">Jeopardy! set evolution</a> article has survived a deletion debate that was proposed under similar circumstances and for identical reasons. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 17:45, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please don't use the argument that the "set evolution" page is a reason to keep the article. I looked at the AFD for that, and it should have been a no consensus, not keep, and it should be removed too anyway. Half the votes were "this is interesting" keep votes, while the other half were valid delete/merge votes. As with that article, this should go too, pure garbage of interest to no one. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 23:58, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response.</b> The article's interest to more people than "no one" is its <i>raison d'être</i>. It's easy to call something "fancruft" or "an indiscriminate collection of information" and toss it away, but such responses ignore the reality of the contributions made to the article and its history. Dozens of different users contributed to the article before it was forked, and dozens more contributed later. While I cannot endorse the article on other merits (it is poorly sourced, not many other pages link to it, <i>etc.</i>), articles like this are what make Wikipedia so useful and interesting, and set Wikipedia apart from drier encyclopedias. These sorts of lists are the neurons that send out dendrite feelers to so many other neurons. In the future, we're going to appreciate articles that collect information such as this, not indiscriminately, but discriminately, and most interestingly. <b>Consider the following cycle.</b> A future user sees a photograph somewhere of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicki_Lawrence_a08f.html" title="Vicki Lawrence">Vicki Lawrence</a> in a white wig on the <i>Jeopardy!</i> set and wonders, "Were characters from <i><a href="../../../m/a/m/Mama%27s_Family_ef25.html" title="Mama's Family">Mama's Family</a></i> ever on <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a></i>?" The user goes to Wikipedia for the answer, but it is not there. Having done research to determine that such a thing did indeed happen, the user adds the information to the <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a></i> article. Other users do the same, and the article bloats with useful and valid information. A split is proposed and executed. The split article is deemed in violation of Wikipedia policy and deleted. A future user sees a photograph somewhere of <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosie_Perez_96d0.html" title="Rosie Perez">Rosie Perez</a> in street getup on the <i>Jeopardy!</i> set and wonders... <b>What is the appropriate response on Wikipedia to end such vicious circles?</b> IMHO, it is to let such lists exist when they are appropriate and link to many other valid articles. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 04:59, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The appropriate response is to remove that kind of irrelevant information. Yes, the information may pop up again and again, but it should be removed, again and again. Giving it a safe haven like this article may have been a necessary if problematic step when Wikipedia was smaller; now, there are enough dedicated editors to keep this kind of stuff out of articles. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:05, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Speaking as an editor who does far more deleting of fluff than adding of new information, especially to the <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a></i> article, I assert that you are incorrect on this point. Despite an HTML comment warning in the <i>Jeopardy!</i> article not to contribute additional references (which <i>are</i> encyclopedic inasmuch as they testify to the show's cultural pervasiveness)--a comment which I added--editors are constantly tempted to contribute (valid) cultural references to the article, bloating it. I don't want to think about how much worse this problem will become when there is no forked article and no warning comment on the main page. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 17:17, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep, but clean up</b> because in my opinion, it was a necessary article fork to prevent the <b>Jeopardy</b> article from becoming too too unwieldy. Yes, it does require some paring of the completely indiscriminate information, but were we not always instructed here on Wikipedia to create subpages of articles that were getting too big? <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 13:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, the point I was making was that the topic <b>is</b> encyclopedic based on being spun off of the main <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a> article, but that there is excess fluff that should be removed from the article. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 16:35, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Completely unsourced. It reads as a how-to guide to smoke marijuana, including ways to make your hit better and to save money on it. Google comes up with 45,000 hits for knifers, but the vast majority of those refer to using a combat knife in games like Battlefield 2 or Counterstrike, or an abbreviation of the town of Yellowknife to Y'knifers. The entire article reads like a bunch of stoners started putting together nicknames for various types of "knifer" hits, and stuff, but I find no reliable sourcing to indicate the term is anything in general use. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 22:31, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have tidied it up and added references for verifiability to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. There is no requirement for 'notability' (though, in fact, its educational standards are notable) only for the article to meet WP policies which it does. I'm all for being strict on vanity articles or those pages made as commercial adverts. However, when you have a high school that will be significant in its local community, and about which readers may come here to find out about, then reasonable articles should be kept. Yes, it needs expansion, but that is what stubs are all about - providing a framework for growth. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 00:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps you have modified the article to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, though the point could still be argued. However, you have done nothing to either assert or prove notability. Your assertion that there is no notability requirement is fundamentally flawed: <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a WP policy. It's general notability criteria is that a topic have been the subject of "multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other." Two of your references are directly linked the school (its own website and a city website) and the other two fail <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd>I think you're missing a very important fact: The words "policy" and "guideline" are used interchangeably. See <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a>. In addition, ABC wouldn't count the number of non-Hispanic students at a middle school because that information is not notable. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.

<p>Beneath all the school in-jokes, all the article effectively says is "this person is a school teacher". However good he is, and however much his students (dis)like him, that is not enough - see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I cannot find any external references to the "numerous historical works" he is said to have published. Google entries that refer to him are, on the whole, copies of this article. (There are a couple of quotations in newspaper articles, but not enough to justify his inclusion as an educational commentator). The one book mentioned in the article ("A Berger: Memoirs" - Adrian Berger, Defton Press 2006 ISBN 0-441-59445) is not to be found through Google or Amazon and may well be a hoax. If it were simply that the article is poorly written and contains lots of material that is unashamedly said to be "unlikely to be true, and ... difficult to verify", I would have a go at cleaning up the article. But there would be nothing worth saving afterwards - hence my AfD nomination. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBencherlite_72d5.html" title="User:Bencherlite">Bencherlite</a> 22:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep some of it, delete the rest</b> Adrian Berger is someone I know reasonably well. I have to disagree with some of these points that you all have stated. Yes, there seems to be some very unbelievable "facts," which he himself has informed me of, but let me just explain that there are some things that are 100% true in this article, and it would be a shame to delete them:</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Adrian Berger has told me that he does have a FIFTY-FIRST STATE CAMPAIGN. He is planning to make England a fifty-first state of America. His slogans are - "You can go further with Berger," and "You'll have no beef with Berger," just as the article states. 2) Adrian Berger is planning to write a book, called "Hays for Defence," which he says will take him several years to write. It will be a sort of biography on Arthur Garfield Hays, a well-known lawyer in the 20th Century. 3) He does have an eccentric teaching style, integrating into his lessons "Berger" minutes, an improvised time length, and incorporating signs into the sessions, such as the DOUBLE V, a typical American victory symbol, something that he explained personally to me.</p>
<p>Do not delete all of this article. There is some truth in it, but not all of it is correct. Keep in the elements of the text that I have confirmed as factual information, please, because Adrian Berger is the most enthuastic and knowledgable historian that I have ever met, with a most interesting background, directly linked to WWII. Do you not think that his life deserves to be recorded?

<dd><b>Reply</b> Oliver, the fact is that this encyclopaedia is <b>not</b> a free-for-all. There are rules and regulations about what goes on here. And, no matter how fantastic Mr Berger is (and I concur heartily, having engaged in many a witty repartée with him in my day), if he fails the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability criteria</a>, then little else matters. I know you may respect Mr Berger very highly, enjoy his lessons thoroughly, and admire him greatly for being such an eccentric figure, but he doesn't belong here. Besides, are not Messrs Worrall, Burcher, Bryant, Johnson, Tillett, Perrott, Bish etc etc not just as worthy? Would you also create encyclopaedic entries on <i>all</i> of these great men? If you <i>really</i> want to document KEGS teachers, then a KEGS wiki would be a place to do that (let me know if you are hell-bent on doing so - I could lend an expert hand!)

<p><b>Comment</b> - Hi I am the author of the book and the article. One of my goal is to bring this research to wikipedia which I have tremondous respect for. I have done 18 years research on this article and want to keep building this information. I work as a Medical Doctor and these meridian theories helps me understand the disease process better. The original scripture for this book is Keiraku which is the ancient text on Meridian Medicine. Master Jiro Murai in Japan studied this art for almost all his lifetime and passed this again as oral teaching to Mary Burmeister who started Jin Shin Jyutsu in USA. Mary wrote her book which took her 22 years to put together. My backgrond in Medicine, Acupuncture, Acupressure makes this easier for me plus being trained in both western and eastern Medicine makes this effortless for me. If you still want to delete this article I respect your opinion. I can tell you a story "I had a patient with Ovarian cancer. She was only 39 yrs old and had a 3 yr old son. Just one week before she died she had terrible pain in her gums and died unable to speak. I learnt through Meridian medicine - that her ovarian cancer caused obstruction of large intestinal meridian which flows and ends at the gums. I learnt to respect this medicine which explains the location of pain in the body."</p>

<li>Dr. Brown: Instead of pasting a wall of text from your book on wikipedia, why don't you try writing about the topic in encyclopedic form? There are many references available to you for guidance, but for starters you can see the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Wikipedia%7EYour_first_article_be65.html" title="Wikipedia:Your first article">Your first article</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_style_f2a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of style">Manual of style</a> pages. Be careful not to include <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> in your article, as that is against WP policy. --<a href="../../../j/m/o/User%7EJMorgan_543f.html" title="User:JMorgan"><font color="#005560"><b>J</b></font> <font color="white" style="background:#007E8F">Morgan</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/m/o/User_talk%7EJmorgan_3334.html" title="User talk:Jmorgan">(talk)</a></sup> 17:09, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Morgan Thanks for your suggestion. I will do this for the future. It is little bit of a learning curve and since I did not have lots of time I wanted a quick update on what Meridian Medicine is about. I guess if this page does get deleted I will be doing the topic as you suggested in future. Cheers Vasu Brown</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Some content could be merged into <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian_%28Chinese_medicine%29_c562.html" title="Meridian (Chinese medicine)">Meridian (Chinese medicine)</a> or <a href="../../../a/c/u/Acupuncture.html" title="Acupuncture">Acupuncture</a>. Much of what is written here is also in those two articles and there is no need to duplicate. Some terms in the article Keiraku, Ki-Eki, Tai-Eki don't seam to have coverage under those names here, but they do seem to exist in google, they might be translations of articles for which we do have articles, possible <a href="../../../q/i/_/Qi.html" title="Qi">Qi</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/_/Ki.html" title="Ki">Ki</a>. If any content is merged it does need good referencing, unfortunatly the lulu book does not count being a self-published source. Jin Shin Jyutsu may well deserve an article as it seems to have practioners worldwide. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 10:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
