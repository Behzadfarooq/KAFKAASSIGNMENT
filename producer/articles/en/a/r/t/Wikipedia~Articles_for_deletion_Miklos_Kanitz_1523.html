<li><b>Strong Keep</b> A well referenced article if a little bit heated with visceral descriptions.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Well documented. Remember notability is not subjective, if others have written about him, he is notable.

I don't see any notable reason why to keep him just because he suffered and that he now, after fifty years of internalizing, is talking about it. At that level, we'd have everyone who ever did time in prison and then became a "motivational speaker" with an article on Wikipedia. Suffering is not and should not be part of the inclusivity criteria. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 19:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: ... and this&#160;!vote I found,somehow, slightly sad. We are writing an encyclopedia, but after all, within the vague and general bounds of appropriate coverage, why would we not keep a "great [factual] story" about a "notable" person where one "like[s] the article" when one is "sorry" and (per edit summary) "regretful" about losing it? Notability and our guidelines about it are important, but their purpose is to improve the encyclopedia. Are we really a better encyclopedia without this article than with it? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 04:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree. The danger is simple: precedent. There are hundreds of millions of elderly people in the world, many of whom have interesting life stories, and many of whom have relatives who would be glad to put up a well-written article about their uncle who served in the war, their grandmother the college professor, etc. How many of these are truly notable?

<li><b>Keep</b> There are some legitimate questions of notability, but there are a few other sources that have written about him. He's a more-documented-example-than-most of a very notable group of people (Holocaust survivors, that is), and I think it's beneficial to have a specific example like this. I don't agree with <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">User:Anthony.bradbury</a> that all survivors are notable, or <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J. Leivick">User:Daniel J. Leivick</a> that all factual biographical articles should be kept, but Kanitz's experiences are rare enough that I don't think that it sets too much of a dangerous precedent. At best, it's a strong keep like some people have suggested.

<li><b>Keep</b> It is a notable <i>example</i> if not a very notable individual. We are on thin ice and lose valuable information if we block all examples. They have a place.

<dd>Of the three references given, he is possibly the primary subject of the newspaper article (it isn't online, I haven't read it, so I assume it is about him). The Anne Franke Exhibition book has a page on him, out of a 24 page booklet on the exhibition (and I think it is obvious he did NOT open the exhibition in other locations; the exhibition is customized for each location, and probably in each location they find an appropriate opening speaker). The other article mentions him briefly in a list of award recipients.

He was also the subject of a short profile as part of a press packet distributed upon the opening of a museum; I am not sure this is a notable source, and in any case that profile itself might be culled from the original article in question. The third source merely confirms that he won a probably non-notable community award. I maintain, then, that his notability is arguable, and that is in fact what this AfD is for.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 20:39, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability is not subjective</a>. Remember that the article may have been in worse shape than it is now when some editors argued for deletion. Or editors may have wrongly concluded that he's non-notable due to insufficient evaluation of the article. He meets the established guidelines and policies for notability - i.e. <b>He is notable</b>. If you disagree, the correct action is to review the relevent guidelines and policies - because he is notable, and this is an established fact of this debate. The <i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person</i> criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is met - I cannot understand why we're even having this debate - the correct decision is obvious and guided by policy without the need for much work at all - if we all work to discover the truth earnestly and diligently, the outcome is as clear as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jim_Flaherty_28fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jim Flaherty">this AfD</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With all due respect, I just specifically provided my reasoning for why I don't think he meets the criteria. You have just repeated your argument that he is notable and linked for the fifth time to the same policy page. Also, unfortunately, the use of terms like "non-trivial" and "primary subject" mean that there will <i>always</i> be people who dispute whether a given article meets the standard, so despite the policy's insistence that notability is not subjective, in several ways it still is. Appealing to the policy multiple times does not automaically make this guy's notability an "established fact." Also, if notability's non-subjective nature were as cut and dry as you argue, there would be a LOT less activity on the AFD boards.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 20:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>People ignore policy and concensus to argue from the gut all the time. I'm not too concerned. AfD is a discussion, not a vote, and any halfway competent Admin will see that the arguments for delete are inconsistant with the facts. Your arguement even admits he meets WP:BIo in the premise, but then tries to explain it away with arugments that go against the policies (like "notability of sources", which is bunk). It's not a big deal. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:57, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>My arguments above are not "from the gut", and you should also realize that a LOT of discussion goes on about how notable a given source (for example, a press packet) is. I also do not appreciate claim anyone who is halfway competent must agree with you. But on the whole I think we are on the same page that, in the grand scheme of things, this is not a big deal.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 21:00, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Agree with Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) above - _if_ 1000 more survivors shows up with likewise well referenced stories, maybe we should convert them to a rich list (separate expansion of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Holocaust_survivors_0dc1.html" title="List of Holocaust survivors">List of Holocaust survivors</a>?) but keep for now. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighlunder_06a3.html" title="User:Highlunder">highlunder</a> 22:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, at least I have provoked a bit of a discussion! I would put this article in the same class with one I afd'ed a while ago, on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Leutnant_Helmut_Frohberg_0ccc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Leutnant Helmut Frohberg">Leutnant Helmut Frohberg</a>, a German WWII officer - someone who lived through an interesting and notable time or event in history, but who did not play a notable part and has not written or spoken such to shape our ideas about that time. He was <i>just there</i>. And remember that keeping non-notable Holocaust survivors leads to also keeping articles on non-notable D-Day soldiers, Iwo Jima soldiers, civil rights movement footsoldiers, anti-apartheid activists... People <i>do</i> bring these things up in AFD discussions - "Why can't we keep this article? This other person is just as non-notable, and they have an article!" <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 22:39, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The discussion above, though, does highlight that any person who comes up on AfD must be discussed on s/his merits. Perhaps "he was there" is not a reason to keep, but "he was there and has since been written about substantially in multiple non-trivial independant sources" probably is.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 22:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
