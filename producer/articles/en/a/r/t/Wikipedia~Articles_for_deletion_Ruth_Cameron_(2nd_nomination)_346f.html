This before one considers that Cameron is the Scottish head of one of the UK's largest NGO coalitions, and, as noted above, a politician with a high likelihood of winning in a national election in less than a year's time.

<dd>Being a member of the Scotish parliment does not make one notable. Only a limited number of it's members have articles.

<p>Hi. When I created this article, I had no idea that one had existed before. However, I do think that Cameron is worthy of inclusion given, as Alec Davison points out, that she is the head of a national NGO coalition. She is a well-known and increasingly important figure in Scottish civic society. As regards her public notability, she was the subject of a full-page profile article in the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Herald_b3ef.html" title="Sunday Herald">Sunday Herald</a> Magazine of 13th August this year (sadly not online). I like to think that Wikipedia provides access to wider information than national newspapers; it certainly should not be providing less than them. MichaelMcNab 12:13, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - you can add the Sunday Herald article as a reference if you've read it, there's no policy that demands all sources must be available online. I'm open to persuasion and I'll change my opinion if there is some evidence of her notability. <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_Climate_Chaos_Scotland_5bf6.html" title="Stop Climate Chaos Scotland">Stop Climate Chaos Scotland</a> doesn't seem to get much press as far as I can see, and the "Climate Change Ambassador" role doesn't even mention the name of the project, making it hard to check her notability. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:38, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I've specified the Climate Change College project by name (an oversight on my part; apologies), and added the external link. I'd be grateful if others could help me with citing sources, as I haven't quite got my head around the style and code. The profile piece is 'I recycle, I use energy-efficient light bulbs and my last gas bill was £1.17' by Vicky Allan, page 7, Sunday Herald Magazine, 13th August 2006. The source for her selection on the 2007 election list is <a href="http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1311042006" class="external text" title="http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1311042006" rel="nofollow">today's Edinburgh Evening News</a>.

<li>I'd say <b>don't delete</b>. As has been mentioned, She is the head of a major coalition of NGOs in Scotland, a recent high profile student politician, and likely MSP. Adam Ramsay</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - Wikipedia has lots of 'ex-'politicians of one sort or another, so being an ex-student leader shouldn't be decisive. Wikipedia also has lots of considerably more minor political figures - including almost the entire central committee of the UK <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a> (not even a parliamentary party) and numerous internal figures from the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Socialist_Party_334a.html" title="Scottish Socialist Party">Scottish Socialist Party</a> who are only of interest to leftish political anoraks. While I agree that third on the Lothians list makes Ruth a player in the upcoming elections, the key thing is her high profile in Scotland through student and NGO activity, to which various people have alluded.

<li><b>Don't delete</b> - What is undeniably notable is that Ms Cameron has in the past couple of years become one of the most well known young politicians in Scotland amongst, in particular, the student politics circles. Her stint as Edinburgh Uni President was very high profile, and her then moving on from that straight into a very high profile NGO post and candidacy for a potentially winnable MSP seat definitely counts as worthy of interest. In short she is 'one to watch' and hence it is fitting that she have a Wiki article. PhylSM 17:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Keep arguments not convincing when based on potential future achievements. "One to watch" for future notability means she is not now and may never be notable enough to meet inclusion criteria. She isn't yet a MSP. Maybe she will be elected next year. Maybe she will then be notable. Including her now couldn't possibly help her name recognition and help her attain that which she seeks?

<p><b>Comment</b> - Although I've included Cameron as a civic society, rather than political, figure, I would argue that there is a substantial public interest in including election candidates on Wikipedia. For many, it will be the only source of information about aperson that you are being asked to vote for that is not a spun party press release or website. Providing this sort of information to voters is an excellent example of the value of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>That argument aside, as I say, Cameron is a Scottish civic society figure of note. She is the head of one of Scotland's most significant NGO coalitions, counting Friends of the Earth Scotland, WWF Scotland and the RSPB (itself one of the country's largest membership organisations) as members. Before taking up this role, she was a student leader of national significance, not just another run-of-the-mill union officer (and, having been to a run-of-the-mill university myself, I'm under no illusions as to the notability of those), as evidenced by the national press coverage of her tenure (search for "ruth cameron" at <a href="http://www.scotsman.com" class="external text" title="http://www.scotsman.com" rel="nofollow">The Scotsman</a>). She is now known by name and reputation to everyone of importance in the Scottish campaigning sector.</p>
<p>I'm a little surprised at the debate over Cameron's likelihood of election; it seems perverse and blinkered to say that a civic society leader becomes notable if and only if he or she is elected to parliament.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I hope to be able to add more detail to this article as well as, if permitted by the Wikipedia community, new articles for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland and other NGOs and key NGO leaders. It is a worrisome comment on Scotland that national figures like Richard Dixon (WWF Scotland), Rosemary Burnett (Amnesty) and Kevin Dunion (Scottish Information Commissioner) are exluded, but members of the Celtic squad that have never, to my knowledge, played a single first-team game (e.g. <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarmuid_O%27Carroll_956f.html" title="Diarmuid O'Carroll">Diarmuid O'Carroll</a>) warrant articles of their own. I hoped to remedy that, starting with an interesting figure about whom I know enough to work up a useful article. I would be very grateful to Wikipedians if they could allow me to do so.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. All of the article seems to meet the policies just fine, it appears to be verifiable, from several reliable sources, and NPOV. As for the concept of notability (which is only a <i>guideline</i> anyway) being the co-ordinater of a national campaign, supported by several large NGOs is signifigant, as is convener of the Young Greens. Also, Cameron has had a number of articles published in the national press, and was prominent in her role of EUSA president, with numerous newspaper mentions. --<a href="../../../v/c/l/User%7EVclaw_af47.html" title="User:Vclaw">Vclaw</a> 15:37, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There's not much doubt about that, it's really fairly blatant. This is simply an attempt at free publicity by the friends/ colleagues of the subject. The article is pretty much a stub anyway, such is the lack of notability of its subject, with barrel-scraping filler along the lines of "She was also awarded an internship at the Observer newspaper". At present this person is no more worthy of note than anybody else (and there are plenty) involved in student/minor politics. If the subject actually gets elected then she would probably be entitled to an article. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPathlessdesert_86ae.html" title="User:Pathlessdesert">Pathlessdesert</a> 15:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Derogatory comments are made on news fora all the time; they do not warrant inclusion in the Guardian unless the target is themselves of interest. MichaelMcNab 10:36, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
