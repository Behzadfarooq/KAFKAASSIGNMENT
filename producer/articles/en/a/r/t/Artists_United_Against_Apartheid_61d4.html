<p>Van Zandt, who had parted with <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Springsteen_4811.html" title="Bruce Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> &amp; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_E_Street_Band_e821.html" title="The E Street Band">The E Street Band</a> at the height of their success to go out on his own, traveled to South Africa to research his next record. He was interested in South Africa because he had read that the apartheid system was actually modeled after America's system of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_reservations.html" title="Indian reservations">Indian reservations</a>, an issue that was his major passion. While in South Africa, he was distressed by a place called <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_City%2C_North_West_7d0e.html" title="Sun City, North West">Sun City</a>, an interracial gambling resort located in a <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantustan.html" title="Bantustan">bantustan</a>, a nominally independent area supposedly ruled by black Africans, in the middle of an impoverished rural homeland.</p>

<p>Van Zandt became interested in writing a song about Sun City to make parallels with the plight of native Americans. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Schechter_8f69.html" title="Danny Schechter">Danny Schechter</a>, a journalist who was then working with <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_News_2f7d.html" title="ABC News">ABC News</a>' <a href="../../../2/0/2F/20_20_9c54.html" title="20/20">20/20</a>, suggested turning the song into a different kind of "<a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Are_the_World_ef64.html" title="We Are the World">We Are the World</a>", or as Schechter explains, "a song about change not charity, freedom not famine."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_.7B.7B.7B1.7D.7D.7D"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Artists_United_Against_Apartheid_61d4.html#endnote_" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Artists_United_Against_Apartheid_61d4.html#endnote_" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>When Van Zandt was finished writing "<a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_City_%28song%29_16a2.html" title="Sun City (song)">Sun City</a>", he and Schechter spent the next several months searching for artists to participate in recording it. Van Zandt initially declined to invite Springsteen, not wanting to take advantage of their friendship, but Schechter had no problem asking himself; Springsteen accepted the invitation. Van Zandt was also shy about calling legendary jazz artist <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Davis_4d69.html" title="Miles Davis">Miles Davis</a>, whom Schechter also contacted; with minimal persuasion, Davis also accepted. Eventually, Van Zandt and Schechter would gather a wide array of artists, including <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbie_Hancock_e7fa.html" title="Herbie Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringo_Starr_ef1f.html" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Reed_999a.html" title="Lou Reed">Lou Reed</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_DMC_44a7.html" title="Run DMC">Run DMC</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Gabriel_f4fc.html" title="Peter Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darlene_Love_2010.html" title="Darlene Love">Darlene Love</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrika_Bambaataa_ec73.html" title="Afrika Bambaataa">Afrika Bambaataa</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurtis_Blow_8b05.html" title="Kurtis Blow">Kurtis Blow</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Browne_9250.html" title="Jackson Browne">Jackson Browne</a>, <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Clinton_%28funk_musician%29_13df.html" title="George Clinton (funk musician)">George Clinton</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Richards_53f8.html" title="Keith Richards">Keith Richards</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Wood_a652.html" title="Ron Wood">Ron Wood</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Raitt_f79a.html" title="Bonnie Raitt">Bonnie Raitt</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_%26_Oates_704b.html" title="Hall &amp; Oates">Hall &amp; Oates</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Cliff_c0f3.html" title="Jimmy Cliff">Jimmy Cliff</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Youth_1d1c.html" title="Big Youth">Big Youth</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandmaster_Melle_Mel_b9e6.html" title="Grandmaster Melle Mel">Grandmaster Melle Mel</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Monroe_626a.html" title="Michael Monroe">Michael Monroe</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Garrett_3c9b.html" title="Peter Garrett">Peter Garrett</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Ramone_a188.html" title="Joey Ramone">Joey Ramone</a>.</p>
<p>These artists also vowed never to perform at Sun City, because to do so would in their minds seem to be an acceptance of apartheid.</p>
<p>Schechter had also taken on the job of documenting the sessions on video and producing a behind-the-scenes documentary. He invited <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> to get involved and asked a friend, Hart Perry, to film the sessions. During the course of the film, Schechter asks the artists to explain their involvement in the project in their own words: "Sun City's become a symbol of a society which is very oppressive and denies basic rights to the majority of its citizens," said Jackson Browne. "In a sense, Sun City is also a symbol of that society's 'right' to entertain itself in any way that it wants to, to basically try to buy us off and to buy off world opinion."</p>
<p>Recalls Schechter, "I was surprised that many of the best-known rock 'n rollers were so publicity shy. Most of them had publicists who staged their media appearances. They weren't used to cameras poking them in the face. Bruce Springsteen at first turned down my request for an interview, but just as I was walking away from him dejected, he ran after me and agreed to say a few words for the documentary.</p>
<p>"When Miles started improvising in the studio...Steven and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Baker_f7f2.html" title="Arthur Baker">Arthur [Baker]</a> insisted I not approach him with a camera. 'It's Miles, man," Baker said. "He's erratic, idiosyncratic, explosive. Wild. Don't mess with him when he's playing...' I barged into the booth while Davis was setting up, introduced myself and asked if we could videotape him. Through the glass I could see Steve and Arthur, heads in hands, convinced that I had blown it. Miles smiled. 'Bring it on,' he ordered, 'bring it on.' And we did, getting priceless footage in the bargain."</p>
<p>In addition to "Sun City," a number of other songs were recorded, making up the album <i><a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_City_%28album%29_1c07.html" title="Sun City (album)">Sun City</a></i>.</p>
<p><a name="The_release" id="The_release"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artists_United_Against_Apartheid_61d4.html" title="Edit section: The release">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The release</span></h2>
<p>For a time, they were making the record without a record company or any outside financial support. Van Zandt financed much of it while producer <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Baker_f7f2.html" title="Arthur Baker">Arthur Baker</a> (notable for his work with <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrika_Bambaataa_ec73.html" title="Afrika Bambaataa">Afrika Bambaataa</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Order_69d3.html" title="New Order">New Order</a>) donated studio time. Manhattan Records, under Bruce Lundvall's direction, came on board, acquiring the record and enabling them to pay some of the bills. A committed record company attorney, the late Rick Dutka, also donated his time, as well as Van Zandt's assistant, Zöe Yanakis.</p>
<p>Schechter's connections with ABC News posed some risks. "I couldn't tell ABC what I was doing on the side," recalls Schechter. "They would not have approved. I knew I couldn't propose a story about Sun City either, because I had stepped over the line and become part of the story. I tried and mostly succeeded in keeping my name out of the papers and my mug out of the video. I was terrified that <a href="../../../2/0/2F/20_20_9c54.html" title="20/20">20/20</a> would dump me if they knew what I was doing, especially if my affiliation with ABC was dragged into it, even though the network had nothing to do with the project. I worked even harder at ABC, producing more stories than many of my colleagues, so I couldn't be accused of slacking off."</p>
<p>The record never achieved the financial success of "<a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Are_the_World_ef64.html" title="We Are the World">We Are the World</a>," although Oliver Tambo and the ANC's school in <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> "was sure happy when we gave them a big check," according to Schechter. "Sun City" was picked as record of the year by many of the most influential music critics.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the song "Sun City" only reached #38 on the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard.html" title="Billboard">Billboard</a> Hot 100 chart in December 1985, the reason for that low chart rank was because only about half of American radio stations played "Sun City," with some objecting to the lyrics' explicit criticism of President <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s policy of "constructive engagement." R&amp;B stations felt it was too rock-oriented, while rock stations considered it too steeped in hip-hop and R&amp;B. Not surprisingly, the song was banned in South Africa.</p>
<p>Van Zandt and Schechter also struggled to get the documentary seen. <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a> refused to air the non-profit film <i>The Making of "Sun City"</i> even though it won the International Documentary Association's top honors in 1986; PBS claimed the featured artists were also involved in making the film, and as a result, by their logic, were "self-promoting." (It's worth noting that PBS chose to broadcast <i>The Making of "<a href="../../../r/a/i/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark_c5d6.html" title="Raiders of the Lost Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>"</i>, which was made as a promotional exercise by the for-profit <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucasfilm.html" title="Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm Ltd.</a>.)</p>
<p>Regardless of these objections, the album and single raised more than a million U.S. dollars for anti-apartheid projects. It premiered at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, thanks to the Special Committee Against Apartheid and UN officers such as Aracelly Santana.</p>
<p>In South Africa, "Sun City" would later inspire musician Johnny Clegg to create a local organization similar to Van Zandt's, and "Sun City" also became the catalyst for the <i>South Africa Now</i> TV series.</p>

<p>With the end of the apartheid regime in 1994 and the reintegration of Sun City and other former nominally-independent regions into the South African state, "Sun City" ceased to be a contemporary protest and became a historical document; any pledge to boycott Sun City or other similar places in South Africa became superfluous.</p>
<p>In 1997, in a somewhat bizarre twist of history, the man who created Sun City, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol_Kerzner_b144.html" title="Sol Kerzner">Sol Kerzner</a>, came to America to build the <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohegan_Sun_3f27.html" title="Mohegan Sun">Mohegan Sun</a>, an Indian gambling casino.</p>
