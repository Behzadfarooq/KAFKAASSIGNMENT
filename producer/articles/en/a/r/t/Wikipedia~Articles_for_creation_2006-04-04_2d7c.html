<p>The Lord Narasimha is Lord of Dharmapuri. A large number of devotees, daily 1,000 on an average, visit the sacred shrine of Lord Narasimha to pay their homage to Him. Hindus believe Lakshmi Narasimha to be a half man, half lion form of Vishnu. The story behind this is that the a local being,named Hiranya kashyapa had obtained from God Bramha immunity from attack from "man or beast". This person then began abusing his powers and began forcing others to worship him, as if he were a God. Among those abused was his own son, Prahlada a staunch worshiper of Vishnu. In order to surmount Bramha's condition, Vishnu assumed a form that was neither man nor beast, but a combination of both, and then went on to finish off this person with his nails.At that time he was very furious and called as UGRA NARASIMHA and subsequently the saints and Gods prayed him to be cool and Narasimha came to Dharmapuri and undergone a deep meditation with yoga mudra and was called Yoga Narasimha.At the same place a shrine was constructed by then king of Dharmapuri, Dharma Verma by whom the town was called as DHARMAPURI.</p>

<p>Contextual Objectivity is a principle with roots in quantum mechanics that was adapted and applied to the explain and describe the operations of news media organizations during times of war. Proposed by Adel Iskandar and Mohammed El-Nawawy in their analysis of Al-Jazeera as a case study, the term expresses the attempt "to reflect all sides of any story while retaining the values, beliefs and sentiments of the target audience." The concept has been applied by some scholars to explain FOX News Channel's news programming in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2004. Other studies used contextual objectivity to describe differences between mainstream media and alternative ethnic media's coverage of post-Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.</p>

<p>The Australian term "heartilage" whilst commonly used locally, is not well documented or known internationally. It is used to describe someone who has given a poor excuse for a poor performance. Often it describes someone who doesn't have the guts to do something or complete something. Eg, "John says he has hurt his knee but I reckon hes just pulled a heartilage".</p>
<p>Also used to describe someone who leaves a party early, or pulls out of an organised event. Eg, "Wheres John? hes pulled a heartilage and gone home", or "John couldn't make it, hes pulled a heartilage".</p>
<p>The origin of the term is unknown, however links to common terms like "a strong heart" and "a heart like Phar Lap" can be assumed. The reverse is a small heart, or no heart, or a pea heart. And when combined with a sporting injury like weak cartilage you get heartilage.</p>

<p>American Labor attorney and noted Communist, born in California 29 March 1911. He was the son of David "Dave" Grossman (1888-1967) and his wife Emma (née Silverstein) Grossman (?-?). Aubrey had an older brother, Joseph Grossman (1907-1973). He attended UCLA, and was a football star for the school's team.</p>
<p>From earfly in his life, Aubrey became involved with numerous social causes, most notably in defending Harry Bridges, the Australian-born labor leader who was investigated by the US government for his ties to Communists.</p>
<p>An obituary written soon after his death noted:</p>
<p>"But Aubrey's influence extended far beyond his family and into the courtrooms of the United States. As a civil rights lawyer, he argued on behalf of Native Americans, war resisters, African Americans, labour leaders and Chinese acupuncturists. For more than 50 years, he put his commitment to his clients and his beliefs before his personal safety or security. He was beaten, jailed for contempt, and threatened with disbarment, but he didn't let these temporary setbacks stand in the way of his values. Aubrey was born in California, attended UCLA, and graduated from the Boalt Hall law school at UC Berkeley, where he met his wife of 61 years, Hazel Grossman, at a student rights rally. He was threatened with expulsion from college for participating in free speech causes, and in 1936 he overcame an attempt by the American Legion to deny him a law license on the basis of his `pernicious radical activity.' But the radicalism didn't end there. He successfully defended San Francisco labor leader Harry Bridges at two deportation hearings. In the 1960s and 1970s, he defended Vietnam War draft resisters and the Pitt River Indian nations in their widely publicized attempts to occupy and win back the ancestral lands they claimed had been taken by the American government. After this trial, Aubrey was jailed for five days for contempt. In the 1950s, Aubrey defended Willie McGee, a black man in Jackson, Mississippi, accused of rape for having a consensual affair with a white woman. Aubrey was beaten by the state police in Jackson after demanding a stay of execution for Mr. McGee, who was ultimately executed."</p>
<p>He died in San Francisco, California, on 8 December 1999.</p>

The effects of the cationic charge density, guar concentration in aqueous solution, and treatment time on bleached European hair were studied. An Instron method developed by M.L. Garcia and J.

<p>Uri Gellar is a famous American psychic born in Tel Aviv, Israel on December 20th 1946. Gellar is most famously known for his ability to bend spoons, though he does not peform this trick anymore. His other psychic abilities are the ability to spin compass needles around and the hands on watches. Though some believe Gellar to be a fraud. Once on the Johnny Carson show, Gellar was surprised with a set of spoons and he was asked to bend them. Gellar refused to do it and later sued Carson for embrassing him. Gellar has appeared on many shows, including The View. Whether or not his abilities are real, many people believe him to be a genuine psychic. Gellar is known to enforce positive thinking and purports that people all have the ability to be psychic and that using positive thinking will help others.</p>

<p>Story Ponta sent mail to friend's Janis on Sunday of the good weather. "I go for play from now." "I am looking forward to your coming." But, there are many bad foxes, and it interrupts Ponta. Will Ponta be able to reach it at last safely until favorite Janis?</p>
<p>How to play Please wait for a while until a screen showed. (If a title screen showed, you may cut a network.) Player is Ponta. It is a stage clearance if it reaches it at last well to the hole of the goal so that it may not be caught by foxes. It is 5 stages.</p>
<p>Controls A game can start when screen will be clicked. Ponta is moved in the direction with the mouse cursor. The position of the cursor Movement The left than Ponta Ponta moves to the left. The right than Ponta Ponta moves to the right. The top than Ponta Jump. Falls slowly. The bottom than Ponta Ponta falls fast.</p>
<p>Ponta can change to Jizo when a mouse button is pushed. He becomes Invincibility except for the geographical features, and foxes can be pushed down, too. He is returned to the cause when it is pushed one more time. A game can start even if the space or a Z key is pushed on the title screen. The operation of Ponta is keyboard in that case. Key Movement Left or 4 Ponta moves to the left. Right or 6 Ponta moves to the right. Up or 8 Jump. Falls slowly. Space bar or Z Ponta falls fast.</p>
<p>Switching of the keyboard and the mouse can be done even in the game. Before switching Operation After switching Mouse Space bar or Z Keyboard Keyboard Clicking Mouse</p>
<p>Other operation It is pose when a P key is pushed. It is canceled when it is pushed one more time. It is returned to the title screen when an E key is pushed during the pose. On and off of the effect sound can be changed with the S key. Click at the inside of screen when key isn't effective.</p>
<p>Character introduction Ponta He is player. He changes to the Jizo, and he rides in mud ship. Janis She is a dog. She is a girl friend of Ponta. Fox He is the bad fox which always bullies Ponta. Let's be careful because He sometimes changes to the wall once in a while. Fireball Let's try not to touch it because it is hot and it gets burned. Monkey He throws the star weapon. Shark fin It is in the surface of the water. It is dangerous because it is sharply sharp. Leaf Scores increase if it is taken. Wall A fox changes to it in a while. Goal It is a stage clearance if Ponta goes into this hole. Thorn It is painful when Ponta touches it. Water When Ponta falls, he rides in ship. However, let's be careful because it goes down soon and he is drowned.</p>
<p>About the score It is stuck to 1 sheet of leaf, and 50 points come in. It is 10000 points if all the leaves are taken in every stage. But, it is not when a mistake is made in that stage even once. When a stage clears it early, a bonus comes in corresponding to the time.</p>

<p>This PlayStation game functions like a carnival shooting galery, focusing on different themes and goals, such as an egyptian pyramid, where you must protect an explorer from ghosts and skeletons for a specified amount of time, to a circus, which emphasizes aim or recognition skills. This is the sequel to the PlayStation game, Point Blank, and is characterized by cartoon-like graphics for younger children and two excentric characters, who bear an uncanny resemblance to Sesame Street's Bert and Ernie.</p>

<p>The ZUNI missile was an American aircraft missile, which achieved infamy due to a few accidents including the incident on the USS Forestall and the USS Enterprise. the sad part is that the missile itself in no way contributed to these regretable accidents, but recieved a lot of bad press because of human error.</p>

<p>The Field School is a private school in Washington DC, located in the old Cafritz mansion on Foxhall Rd. The school teaches 7th-12th grade, with about 310 students attending. The school is graduating 53 seniors this year, its largest class yet.</p>
<p>The Field School was founded in 1972 by Elizabeth Ely in Northwest DC, with the original school located above a landromat. The school increased in size and moved to Wyoming Avenue, where it stayed till 2002, when they moved to the Cafritz mansion.</p>
<p>The school was founded on princples of "mutual respect", close relationships with teachers and independent thinking and learning. A Field student or 'Fieldie' has been defined as many things, which is part of the general idea.</p>
<p>Field is archrivals with the Edmund Burke School, for reasons which are shrouded in mystery. Most of the conjecture about this rivary has centered on the founder of Field, Mrs. Ely, and her involvement in the founding and early years of Burke, although the true facts of the situation has never been really revealed. The tension has risen in recent years, culminating in a full out fight in the Burke-Field soccer game in 2004 and a near fight in 2005, along with foul issues in PVAC basketball games.</p>

<p>www.TunesBD.com though started as just a website, today it has gone beyond the dreams of the developers and has finally given a whole new meaning to the word "community" where TunesBD itself helps create the best and first underground music community of Bangladesh. In a third world country like that of Bangladesh, realising such dreams are tougher than most of the countries and <a href="http://www.tunesbd.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tunesbd.com" rel="nofollow">TUNESBD</a> has realised theirs way back.</p>
<p>The persons behind this site would be basically three persons <a href="http://chords.phpwebhosting.com" class="external text" title="http://chords.phpwebhosting.com" rel="nofollow">abm kamran</a>, Shaon, and Imran with the nicks ChordsNstringS, Shaon and |mran in the site respectively.It all started with one mans vision of doing something unique. Of helping the underground scene in bd get more popular. And so, in June 2004, <a href="http://www.tunesbd.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tunesbd.com" rel="nofollow">TUNESBD</a> started its journey under the supervision of Shaon, and never had to look back again.</p>
<p>What is so special about <a href="http://www.tunesbd.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tunesbd.com" rel="nofollow">TUNESBD</a>? Why does it stand out from all the other forums in Bangladesh? What is it that makes TunesBD so unique from the other sites? Well, to start off, it gives the members something that no other forums deliver and that is a sense of being a part of a family… one big happy family. No matter where, how or what race you are <a href="http://www.tunesbd.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tunesbd.com" rel="nofollow">TUNESBD</a> accepts you as its own. Guess that’s why there are members both from bd and out of bd in the forum. For those in bd, TunesBD gives them a place to hang out and express their thoughts in the related topics. For those music lovers out side bd, TunesBD gives them a chance to get in touch with the BD music.</p>
<p>Recently TunesBD organized three successful concerts where the leading underground bands performed including ARTCELL, BLACK CRYPTIC FATE WATSON BROTHERS REBORN KRAL 666 to only name a few. All the concerts were sold out and enjoyed by music lovers all around the underground scene. And one of the main reasons why the concerts were a smash hit was because of the fact that there are few members in the forum who happens to be few of the best underground artists.</p>
<p>And just because its an online forum doesn’t mean the members wont get to hang out and have fun together. The Staffs organizes ‘TBD get-togethers’ for all the members where they can get to meet the other tuners and enjoy a fun filled evening.</p>
<p>TunesBD is not just all about a place to chill out for all the music lovers, its also about Social Service. With some generous help from the Tuners and Members, the Staffs at TBD organized Fund collection and relief works for the flood victims and also during the severe Cold Strike during winter.</p>
<p>Future activities of TunesBD includes a Poetry Competition, which is aiming in appreciating the talents in the Members. A football competition is also being organised, as a part of recreation for all the members. And to top up the list, a Fashion Show, showcasing the latest in fashion wear, is also on its way.</p>
<p>To sum up, TunesBD is not just an online forum. Its more of like an Online Hang Out place for the Tuners…a place that gives them the freedom to express their music thoughts…a forum that is dedicated to the BD music…a – unanimity that serves the society…a community that gives the Tuners a sensation of being a part of a big happy family. The <a href="http://www.tunesbd.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tunesbd.com" rel="nofollow">TUNESBD</a> family.</p>

<p>The Beast Toast campaign can be explained as an experiment in Phenomenology. The first aim of Phenomenology is to reawaken a sense of wonder about one's environment. The Beast Toast campaign attempts to stimulate curiousity and bring people to question both the campaign and their relationship with their surroundings. Because people are not used to seeing advertisements or propaganda for which the motive is not obvious, frquent and novel encounters with Beast Toast propaganda provoke thought and possible frustration, nevertheless revitalizing the viewer's perception and attention to detail.</p>
<p>Some Comments left of the Beast Toast Myspace: "i'm so confused .. what the heck is beast toast" "I do not understand Beast Toast, but I can say this...It is responsible for the moral degenerency in this country." "c'mon now...the gig is up...who the hell is this" "what the hell is this shit?" "this is pissing me off. WHAT THE HELL IS BEAST TOAST?!!??"

<p>In <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Pratchett_8474.html" title="Terry Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discworld.html" title="Discworld">Discworld</a> books, specifically those books featuring <a href="../../../t/i/f/Tiffany_Aching_3983.html" title="Tiffany Aching">Tiffany Aching</a>, the Chalk is a region of the Discworld known for its fields and sheep-based agriculture. The general climate seems to parallel that of Wales and the British Midlans.(1)</p>
<p>The name of this area is derived from the chalk that is the most common mineral, the only other rock being mentioned as found in the Chalk is flint. This is observed by <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granny_Weatherwax_11b3.html" title="Granny Weatherwax">Granny Weatherwax</a>, who believes (or claimed to believe) that magic prowess is in some way linked to the hardness of the adjacent bedrock, as evident by the large number of magic user native to the Ramtop Mountains.(1)</p>
<p>It seems likely, based on geography presented in other Discworld books, that the Chalk is either a common or poetic name for the Sto Plains, or else a subset of that blanket term. This is because the Sto Plains are described as the geographically uninteresting area that is the continental mass between the Ramtops and the Port cities of <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quirm.html" title="Quirm">Quirm</a>, Psuedopolis, and <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankh-Morpork_dbb5.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a>.(2) This is also the area where the Chalk is described as being, and shares the lack of immediately interesting features or urban development.(1) This is further shown by the fact that the residents of the Chalk, as is the standard throughout the Sto plains, the Ramtops, and other areas, speak the modern Morporkian language.(1) The largest apparent reason to doubt that the terms are interchangeable is the lack of large-scale cabbage growing, which is identified throughout the Discworld series as the defining characteristic of the Sto Plains.(3)</p>

<p>DuckU is a weekly, thirty-minute television variety-program produced entirely by students at the University of Oregon. Most of the students involved are from the School of Journalism and Communication, but students from other majors also participate. Students take DuckU for variable upper-division journalism credit, which can be repeated.</p>
<p>Producers arrange shooting schedules, locations and turn in their three-minute segment on a mini DV tape by a Sunday night deadline. The segments are then edited together, printed to a master mini DV tape and delivered to the local cable television provider.</p>
<p>The show is supervised by faculty adviser and adjunct professor Rebecca Force, and executive produed by students Daniel Epstein, Eric Marley and Matt Rose. DuckU airs Wednesdays at 10:00p.m. on channel 23 (Oregon Public Broadcasting) and again in the University of Oregon dorms on Thursdays at 9:00p.m. on channel 14.</p>
