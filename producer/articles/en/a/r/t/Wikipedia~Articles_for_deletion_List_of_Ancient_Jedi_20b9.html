<p>I <b>am sure George Lucas didnt have this in mind when he started it all off</b>! He did it to have some fun and make some money. This is going to far! Who on earth cares?! A bunch of made up ugly as hell characters, that have no meaning to life, as we know it. I am sure everyone that has contributed to the probably saddest thing I have ever witnessed in my life, could do something more productive then this! Go do something with your life, ANYTHING! But is this really your donation to society? No wonder all is screwed up in Virginia! And if you believe in a creator, do you honestly think this is what he had in mind when he gave you life? And if you dont believe in a creator, do you think your parents thought of this when they gave you life? You might die any day, so dont waste your life. 18:18, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC) Scipio Aemilianus</p>

<li><b>Keep it</b> It is Star Wars Histroy collected though books and games. It should be here so Star Wars Fans can look up info if they need to. Also EU authors could use this when writing Star Wars books, it is very useful information for a Star Wars Fan.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant_Fletcher_ac8b.html" title="User:Grant Fletcher">Grant</a> disliked the fact that I voted to delete an article he created and in a really halfass attempt to spite me, VFD'd this article. He messed up though and didn't follow the deletion process, so I removed the notice (after considering who he was and why he did it), but I've deleted for kicks and so he can't claim I removed the notice without cause, I decided to complete the steps he didn't. Anyways, most of the entries on the list had their own pages, but I felt they should be condensed into a list (some of the entries range from 1-2 sentences to barely a paragraph). --<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKross_94e2.html" title="User:Kross">Kross</a> 18:54, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> My own opinion is that the various SW lists need to be rationalized (does it really make sense to have separate lists for ancient, and minor, Jedis? and etc.), but simply deleting them is emphatically <i>not</i> the way to go. This whole VfD seems pretty lame- see also the VfD for the Wookies. The fact that the starter, and only other hostile user, are claimed to be the same person casts considerable doubt on the validity of this deletion request. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> 19:18, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>; I haven't looked into it thoroughly, but this VfD nom shows every indication of being a revenge nomination. The list is encyclopaedic, looks clean and well-formatted, and - though Mr. Fletcher may not think so - is within the Star Wars canon. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 19:22, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>To all of the SW fans</b> I am sorry i offended you by calling this list of ancient jedi a waste of space. Though I still belive this file to be too big (and what is up with the "It should be here so Star Wars Fans can look up info if they need to", need it?). And I would like it if people stop calling me spitefull just because I VDF'ed an entry by a person who VDF'ed an entry of mine, it is not spite I just check his user profile thingy and saw that his two articles seem to be a bit less usefull than, lets say, a certain genetic Wuz article that I entered. Oh yeah, sorry if the VDF was a bit incompleete (thanks for correcting it) this is my first.--<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant_Fletcher_ac8b.html" title="User:Grant Fletcher">Granted</a> 19:34, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Check <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_Jedi_characters_daff.html" title="List of minor Star Wars Jedi characters">List of minor Star Wars Jedi characters</a>. Its 45kb. It used to be over 54kb in size. This list is far from oversized.--<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKross_94e2.html" title="User:Kross">Kross</a> 19:47, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It's "VfD," not "VDF". Secondly, Wikipedia Is Not Paper. Thirdly, "spiteful" is spelled like that.

<p><b>Listen up mate</b>, you obviously knew what i meant so why did you have to try and use my spelling against me. Hvis du vil have at jeg skal skrive dansk så kan jeg også bare gøre det ikke også. I don't see what anyone acheives by pointing out spelling mistakes to anyone (let alone someone who doesn't have english as there first language). and by the way; no one said wiki was paper boys. And thank you for pointing out that the SW universe inside of Wiki is shrinking. I can still not see how this SW entry can be usefull but if you guys use it alot then so be it let it stay.

<dd>It's not a bad idea- it is a natural categorization, since just about every known Jedi either originates from the movies and subsequent novels; or from the Dark Horse comic books; those two time periods are narrowly circumscribed with minimal overlap (yes, there are odd-balls like Ood B'Nar, but still...) --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> 22:30, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
