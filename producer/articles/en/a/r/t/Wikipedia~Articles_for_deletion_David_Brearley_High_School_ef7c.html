<li>True, it's only a proposed guideline and not the real McCoy yet. That said, it's the nearest thing to an empirical determination of notability of schools that we have. Additionally, per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, we need more than just proof of existence for the school to be notable even if we overlook <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 02:32, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You know what's amazing? Anytime a school meets some stupid criterion of WP:SCHOOL, school inclusionists say "keep because it passes WP:SCHOOL," but anytime a school manages to <i>not</i> meet the loosest of criteria, school inclusionists bring up how WP:SCHOOL can't be used because it isn't policy (even though they want it to be policy because it would allow 99.9% of schools to be kept). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 04:06, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Actually, no it isn't. It's an example of how not to use search engines to assert notability. It's just an argument from counting search engine hits again, but simply using a different search engine to the usual one. In contrast <a href="../../../k/a/v/User%7EKavadi_carrier_b65d.html" title="User:Kavadi carrier">Kavadi carrier</a>, above, has actually read what xyr chosen search engine turned up. If <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewkai_5a1b.html" title="User:Newkai">Newkai</a> does the same, <i>then</i> xe will have made a proper case. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:08, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>How many of those articles are mere <i>mentions</i>, that don't actually give any in-depth information about the school? And how many are in-depth articles about the school? Please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite them</a>. If you can cite multiple in-depth articles that don't just <i>mention</i> the school but actually are detailed articles <i>about</i> the school, you can demonstrate that the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria are satisfied (and, at the same time, provide a proper basis for writing an article). You haven't actually made that case yet. All that you have done so far is count search engine hits. Counting search engine hits isn't research. Actually reading the articles that the search engine turns up is research. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't consider actual newspaper articles "search engine hits". While it's true that just about all, if not completely all of the articles mention the school in passing, it indicates that it's an important location in New Jersey. If someone is reading a newspaper article and the school's name comes up, where are they going to go for more information?

<li><b>Delete</b> No assertion of notability. Also, I do not buy that BS that all high schools are inherently notable, they have to PROOVE why they are notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Largely per precedent. As a general rule, to simply say delete because you disagree with an <i><b>Overwhelming Precedent</b></i> is bad form. As has been said, we're not made of paper. We have the capacity to handle such articles, and it's somewhat akin to trolling to nominate all such articles for deletion disregarding precedent. Precedent, while not explicitly, is a very good guide.<a href="../../../x/e/i/User%7EXeinart_b3eb.html" title="User:Xeinart">Xeinart</a> 05:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Actually, that's exactly backwards. It's the invocation of precedent, which is simply the fallacious "If article X then article Y." argument once again, which is bad form. Every subject should be considered on its own merits. I suggest that you discard the idea of precedent and instead follow the example of <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewkai_5a1b.html" title="User:Newkai">Newkai</a> above, who actually has the right idea but simply hasn't followed it through and made a proper case yet. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry it took so long to respond to this, I only just read it. Firstly, at the risk of coming off as way too pretentious for my own good, I ask you to use terms properly. What you described is not fallacious at all. Having said that, the gist of precedent is not "If article X then article Y", it's "If the <i>merits</i> of article X are the same as the <i>merits</i> of article Y, article X was kept, and <i>merits</i> are the determining factor in a keep or do not situation, then article Y should be kept." I hope that helps to clarify.<a href="../../../x/e/i/User%7EXeinart_b3eb.html" title="User:Xeinart">Xeinart</a> 23:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh, how I hate these school articles... But I know when I'm beaten. Wikipedia has become infested with non-notable school articles, and this is another one. But there's a claque that votes to keep any article with the word "school" in the title, and they seem to outweigh the ( slightly less organised ) bunch of anti-"school" people, so the cruft accumulates. The entire issue has become a holy war for some people, so the best thing to do is just to let them have their way. In twenty or thirty years the issue will have died down, and the next generation can work out what to do. I reckon there are about 40-50 dedicated "any school is notable" people, and they can't possibly keep all the school articles updated reliably and efficiently, so in a couple of decades someone will suggest hiving off all the school articles to a separate directory, and the facts on the ground at that time will drive the case. In the meantime, let them have their victory: it's a poisoned chalice. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:13, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I am not going to 'vote' either way here, as I've gotten tired of these AfD's for high schools (and I typically support the AfD's and strongly feel that all high schools are NOT inherently notable), I did just want to make the comment that newspaper articles, especially local ones, are not good sources for proving notability for the simple reason that virtually all schools, including middle schools and elementary schools, are going to have numerous articles about them specifically in their local papers. All schools are important enough to the locals to get discussed regularly in the local papers; then again, so are all hospitals and pretty much all restaurants too, and we don't have articles on them... --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - In addition to the reasons posted above, I'd also point out that the article is young and will likely grow as more people come across it on this debate.

However, even if it were the WP Policy: I think that notable alumni is being too strictly adhered to, notable does not mean that the person has the merest notability for WP, but to be really notable. Otherwise, each WP BIO article creates instant notability for each of that person's schools, which may please the school-keepers, but in the event that the BIO is deleted, the schools go too unless there's some other notable in the alumni list, and school-keepers would not let that happen. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 23:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

I can't even figure out what criteria 5 even intends to mean: "The school has multiple alumni or staff members that, because of their activity in direct relation to the school, are notable enough to meet a biographical inclusion guideline such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>."

<ul>
<li>I didn't assert that it didn't follow that proposed guideline (note that I expressed a keep opinion above)- as to the others you need to reread criteria 1 in that proposal which specifically rules out routine local coverage. As for it being in direct relation to the school- this seems to be being hashed out on the page. Furthermore, the proposal is not a "consensus of one person" but has a fair bit of support on the talk page right now. If you don't like the proposal you should go to the talk page and say so (as I invited people to do on the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> talk page). In any event, this is all irrelevant because again as I observed many poeple have personal standards (That said, I do agree that it would be helpful if he would give more explanation of what he was thinking) <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:31, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that individuals should provide greater justification, keep or delete, referring to specific relevant Wikipedia standards and guidelines. I find your dismissal of this article's ability to satisfy <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> standard 1 on multiple, non-trivial coverage to be a significant demonstration of the non-viability of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> as an objective standard for determination of the viability of school articles. As the two articles cover respectively an anti-prejudice initiative exhibited at a local university and the details of the school's participation in a statewide inter-district initiative, it boggles my mind that these articles would be deemed "trivial" or "puff pieces" based on this proposed guideline. The "exclusion" of so-called "routine local coverage" -- which I would interpret to mean a sports result or a school play, but you seem to mean anything other than a multi-page in-depth article in a major national publication -- seems to be far too arbitrary to be a basis of judgment. If this is what criteria 1 in <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> means, than it seems to be way too narrowly drawn to be useful or meaningful to weigh notability of schools. To put it succinctly, do the articles included in this article satisfy criterion 1, and if not, what would?<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:18, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>And that means what precisely? For one, I didn't AfD this article. Are you saying that my arguing strongly for the removal of non-notable schools is so serious that you feel a need to speak up to counter me? Or are you saying that without my stubborness no school AfDs would be happening and I am the tipping point to make them keep happening? Either of those is flattering but I doubt that is what you meant so explaining might be helpful. As for the notion that I am treating this as a war, I think my record on school AfDs almost speaks for itself. I'm many of them I have been persuaded to change my opinion on those specific schools. Even as I argue for deletion I help clean up schools and add sources (see for example Brickey Elementary. Indeed, even in this discussion, I had a productive discussion with Alansohn above which has forced me to reevaluate certain issues.
