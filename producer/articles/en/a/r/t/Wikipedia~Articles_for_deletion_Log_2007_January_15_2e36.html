It makes statements like "angles on a regular decemyriagon measure almost exactly 180°" which is inexact, and is also listed in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">Polygon</a> (via a simple formula to compute the angle). It gives an etymology which isn't even right (it lists "polloi," which isn't a part of this word), and finally it says that it is possible, but complicated, to produce one with a compass and straightedge, which <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructible_polygon.html" title="Constructible polygon">Constructible polygon</a> leads me to doubt most severely. So, all of the info that this provides that isn't in the main <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">Polygon</a> article is dubious at best. We ought to delete this one.

So we have a dictionary definition of a neologism containing only information about something that's not the subject of the article.

<p>From the first sentence of the article: "This is a listing of the 2004 Summer Olympics medal counts if the countries of various International organizations pooled their medals." However, medals are not pooled according to international organisations. I have no objection to such a listing in someone's userspace, but it does not belong in the article namespace.

<li>Oh, but some people do group them this way.

Asean medal wins have been analyzed in the Journal of Sports Economics <a href="http://jse.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/5/3/262" class="external autonumber" title="http://jse.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/5/3/262" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Etc. To put this in perspective for you, people do care about grouping olympic medal wins. They then go onto to publish the results. That allows us to do these types of lists, which are no different really than lists such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita_per_hour_97b1.html" title="List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita per hour">List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita per hour</a>.

Until I see a reliable source that pits the UN against the G8, I'm going to maintain that this table and others like it are original research.

<p>There has been no attempt to merge the content into <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Destination_3_d327.html" title="Final Destination 3">Final Destination 3</a>, which was the decision of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Final_Destination_3_DVD_cbaa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Final Destination 3 DVD">first AFD</a> over two months ago. Per the tag, "If the merger is not completed promptly, this article might be re-nominated for deletion."

<p>I believe this article should be deleted, simply because there is another page with the exact same content. See <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Ten_7cd2.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a>, and with the official name. See it's official website, <a href="http://www.ten.com.au" class="external text" title="http://www.ten.com.au" rel="nofollow">"Official Network Ten Website"</a>. I believe that if this article is deleted, the information from it should be merged on to <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Ten_7cd2.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a>. It is clearly very obvious how these relate to each other, Channel Ten and Network Ten are very similar, Network Ten is like the mother of Channel Ten. The both have the same shows, logos and slogans, why not just delete one and merge the extra information from Channel Ten onto Network Ten? Surely you don't think that a primary channel needs a page of it own, that can be properly described on <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Ten_7cd2.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a>.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaggy9872004_351f.html" title="User:Shaggy9872004">Shaggy9872004</a> 00:52, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Possibilities might range from year-in-review or month-in-review style articles to articles focussing on multi-week storylines (like this one). The hope is to find a way to provide episodic information for wrestling shows similar to episodic information for other television series, but without getting into match-by-match or show-by-show details. Whether or not this article is kept in the short term, in the long term I think it would be prudent to find some consensus on how to handle this sort of information to bring wrestling show plotlines and other television show plot lines closer together in how they are presented. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:44, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, one more thing. The reason to possibly keep would be because it is essentially a multi-episode synopsis of a notable television series. Since individual episode articles about notable television series appear to be generally accepted, you can reasonably argue that wrestling shows are essentially the same thing (only with more episodes per year). The flip side is that you might also argue that many of the episode articles for <i>other</i> types of television series should be deleted too. Either way, the main issue is one of being somewhat consistent in approaching how and what information about a television series to include in Wikipedia, and for wrestling shows what might eb a good, maintainable way to provide some of this sort of information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This was undoubtably talked about TNA angles done. You could also consider to the point of TNA's internet phenominom, as I'm sure if you look through Youtube files they are the most watched TNA segments. These skits will be talked about for years to come. Whenever Kevin Nash is brought up, people will remember his rise when he signed with WCW but his huge fall when he returned to WWE. However, Nash actually winning the fans back so late in his career will always be thought of. The PCS challenge specifically. And that is far, far more important that many tournaments listed. Besides, it's just plain fun! Why do you have to ruin it for others?Crispen Raw 06:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. As per the deletion of Smackdown Sprint, the PCS isn't that notable. Just because wrestling fans like it, doesn't mean it's notable enough for wiki.

<li>I agree, although I'll point out, Aaru, that your own recommendation at the top was "Delete per nom".

<li><b>Comment</b> The majority of the votes to keep have been ridiculous, unfounded, and based solely in opinion. Whether or not one enjoys TNA has absolutely no basis on whether or not this article should be deleted. Further, precedent (i.e., Smackdown! Sprint) clearly indicates that this and similar articles should be removed. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 00:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To quote one of the policies, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_can_change_4d99.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus can change">Consensus can change</a>. While precedent is useful, there is a larger open question of handling articles regarding episodes and stories in television shows of <i>all</i> types. Some editors favor greatly reducing the amount of episodic information for all shows, while others apparently want additional storyline information available for certain types of shows such as wrestling shows, soap operas and reality shows. It's possible (or at least hopeful) that in the long term a reasonable consensus can be reached on handling information for all TV series across the board, and that the consensus will be to allow some (but not all) articles about plot lines or linked-episodes for regular weekly serials.</dd>
<dd>So personally I see this afd as a short term debate. Regardless of whether or not this article is kept, in the long term we'll probably need some more thorough guidelines for handling episodes, etc. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> This is nothing like the Smackdown Spirit. This is the talk of the Internet wrestling community!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Strong Keep</b>: The reasoning for deletion is invalid. The "Smackdown Sprint" was just a series of matches to determine a number one contender. This was more of a tournament, albeit a very unusual one (which might warrant its presence alone). It was obviously more than just a storyline (like other tournaments), involved multiple pop culture and professional wrestling references, and will likely return in future years due to the positive response it has received. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContagiousTruth_ff41.html" title="User:ContagiousTruth">Clint</a> 23:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: While a lot of the keep responses seem to be "I like it", some make logical cases. Likewise, several of the delete responses are either "per nom" (for a description that includes a terrible comparison, imo), as well as an argument of non-notability. Notability here seems to be very subjective, as in the majority opinion it is notable, but there are a significant number of people arguing the contrary, with no real evidence either way. I think a bigger problem is establishing what qualifies as notable and why.... <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContagiousTruth_ff41.html" title="User:ContagiousTruth">Clint</a> 23:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Strong Keep: Keep it. It was a fun touranment and was very enjoyable to watch. It wasn't just wrestling. It was part comedy too and most wrestling fans enjoyed it, so that's all that matters right?</p>

<p>Jbgohlke 01:34, 15 January 2007 (UTC)"Vanity nothing" is correct, as there is nothing vain about the article in question. This article is not about vanity, and this card game is very popular today. Just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean anything. I've removed the credits to the authors, but I fail to see the point of that as one's creations deserve to be credited.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Rlaemmler, this process is a mixture of a show of hands and a long winded debate, and you do not need to proceed your comments with "Keep" -- the admin who closes this review is already able to clearly see that you believe the article should be kept. If you think that "Xcellery" is worthy of an article on Wikipedia, I strongly recommend you stop trying to justify its existance here. Instead, go read the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guidelines --- and then focus on improving the article. In regards to your comment that SalesForce is a reputable source: normally it would be, however SalesForce is in the business of selling Xcellery to its users, so using them as a source on this article is only desirable to verify that they are business partners (which is how it is being used currently) -- all other statements from SalesForce are tainted by the sweet smell of crisp <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/greenback" class="extiw" title="wikt:greenback">greenbacks</a>.</dd>
<dd>So, the problem is that at the moment this article has a "References" section full of blog posts, which is unacceptable. The only one that looks reasonable is <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Online-Spreadsheets-vs.-Microsoft-Excel-and-How-a-Combination-of-Both-Works&amp;id=234512" class="external text" title="http://ezinearticles.com/?Online-Spreadsheets-vs.-Microsoft-Excel-and-How-a-Combination-of-Both-Works&amp;id=234512" rel="nofollow">ezinearticles.com</a>, _however_ the author is Reto Laemmler, Founder and CEO of Collaborall, maker of Xcellery <a href="http://www.xcellery.com/Collaborall.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xcellery.com/Collaborall.aspx" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and to make matters worse is he has only posted one story in the magazine <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Reto_Laemmler" class="external autonumber" title="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Reto_Laemmler" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which demonstrates that he was not wearing another more impartial hat when he wrote the article. I dont mind if this references stays as a way to quote the CEO's opinion, but it definitely needs to state that the author is the CEO.</dd>
<dd>What we need are independent articles in tech <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine.html" title="Magazine">magazines</a>; i.e. reviews by people unaffiliated with Collaborall and Xcellery, whose sole objective is to inform their readers. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 00:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> John, thanks for the information. I'm new to publishing an article on Wikipedia and I try my best to fullfill the required quality standards. I already rewrote the entire article twice trying to remove any smell of spam or advertisement. SalesForce is not selling Xcellery for Collaborall. SalesForce offers a platform called AppExchange which allows 3rd parties to publish applications integrating into SalesForce. In order to be published a quite intense app review must be passed. SalesForce doesn't earn anything and is a partner not a reseller. --Rlaemmler 02:07, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Rlaemmler, am I correct in assuming you are Reto Laemmler, CEO of Collaborall? If so, you really need to go read <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> before doing anything else on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Back on track, can you see that SalesForce is in the business of selling a service; they have included Xcellery as part of that service, which is a small claim to notability. However as their business profits from the software, any statements from SalesForce about the product need to be taken with a grain or two of salt when used for verifiability. So, we need more credible sources that verify the facts on the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 05:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Yes I'm Reto Laemmler, Founder and CEO of Collaborall. I just took a look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a>. Very interesting and I will stop commenting from now on forward. I do respect all your feedback and will simply try to improve the article rather then justify it. --Rlaemmler 06:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Thanks for pointing that out, I was merely going on first impression after glancing at each referenced page. The Wikipedia article for <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifehacker.com.html" title="Lifehacker.com">Lifehacker.com</a> indicates that the site is leaning towards being an advertising medium, but the fact isnt backed up with a source (I've edited the article to request citations). On further inspection of the lifehacker article, Im convinced that this isnt suitable, as it states "According to the [XCellery] site ...", which indicates that the author has not actually used the software. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 05:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Article about a report from the FBI that targets religious groups. The FBI produces hundreds of reports like this every year, and this specific one doens't appear to be notable.

Anyone with access to Lexis/Nexis could find dozens more sources. The nomination's claims of the FBI producing hundreds of 'reports like this every year' is unfounded speculation. I'd like to see some documentation of just how many reports 'like this' the FBI 'produces every year' to back up these speculative claims. It is my understanding that this report caused significant backlash against the agency, and that they were more circumspect after their noses got bloodied by maligning a group with considerable clout. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness And Accuracy For All</a> 04:47, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>That is simply <i>not true</i>. You may have misread the US Dept of Ed page which (rather poorly) lists a group of programs; however, the organization at hand was listed as one of two ever cited by the federal education agency, which oversees 1000s of schools, as exemplary. The other citations are each articles from known and respected publications. I have included a new citation to a publication ED wrote specifically about GenYES to reinforce the significance of their acknowledgement. Being recognized by the US Dept of Ed as exemplary is about the highest form of acknowledgement any education company in the US can recieve. -<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 13:04, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am also shocked that JzG reviewed the cited sources and found nothing indicating verifiability and/or notability -- they were clearly journal articles and government publications, albeit missing {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}} formatting. In any case, most of these sources have now been clarified.

<li><b>Comment</b> Seeing as how <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> and Nareklm have been the primary contributors to the article and are in favor of deletion, I have a question. Is there a chance that the articles for the battles can be expanded further? Are there casualty figures? Can maps be drawn up? What military units were involved? If these questions can't be answered and the article cannot be expanded much further, then forks are unnecessary and I'd support deletion. But if we can expand upon the articles enough so that they can stand alone, then I favor keeping them for the time being. Nareklm &amp; Clevelander, any comments? Thanks, <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 03:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well there isn't much information and the only references are in Russian basically only, I tried searching about this in books no results came up. Nareklm 03:16, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately, there is very little information on the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish-Armenian_War_f3c5.html" title="Turkish-Armenian War">Turkish-Armenian War</a>. The exact number of casualties (both Armenian and Turkish alike) for the entire conflict has never really been ascertained. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 03:17, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> These battles do exist. I have questions regarding the credibility of the argument that there is no information. There are many shorter articles on wikipedia?

<li><b>Comment</b> Well these articles have no references or any official credible or English sources, the topic seems important but theres no information on it or in books some references would help. <font color="#0099FF">Nareklm</font> 04:08, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> One explanation for <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a>'s position is that Armenian sources may have a bias for this period, as they lost the war. I 'm not an expert in this period, but it bothers me to delete any item (especially if they <b>do not</b> contain misinformation). It also puzzes me, why someone asks for deletion at the end this is an electronic medium, it will not cover space on someones desk&#160;:-). I strongly believe; it is not a good policy to act on deletion request. People can search for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Oltu_77f3.html" title="Battle of Oltu">Battle of Oltu</a> and they can find this page, get basic information (dates, sides, result) and if they want it will link them to main campaign page. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttomanReference_bb23.html" title="User:OttomanReference">OttomanReference</a> 04:22, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>term apparently coined by a couple of editors for use in Wikipedia, the definition of a neologism. A Google search of "unused highway" reveals official sources using different meanings than the implied, unsourced, one in the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> Who really needs a definition of "unused highway", or a banal discussion of the various obvious reasons why one might close a highway? This isn't a phrase that needs definition - put "unused" and "highway" together, and they mean exactly what one might expect. I can perhaps see a list of notable unused highways - considerable stretchs of major highway that have been closed, are unused, etc. - but why define or discuss such a commonplace phrase? What's next - "broken sidewalk"? "Muddy path?" --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:38, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>So... you are in agreement that the definition is a <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology.html" title="Tautology">tautology</a>.

<li>I don't see how this is in any way a tautology. I am saying this is like having an article on "blue bathrobes" - which is to say, <i>bathrobes</i> which are <i>blue</i>. This combination of words has no special meaning, and neither does it define a subject which needs an article to explain it. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>First of all, as Brian has already mentioned, this term is <i>not</i> a tautology. Secondly, even if it were that would in no way imply that the article should be kept; there is no policy that says tautologies are inherently notable, the very idea that something's being a tautology somehow makes it encyclopedic is ridiculous. Also, as Brian argues, there is no reason why 'unused highway' is any more important, encyclopedic and notable than 'red cars,' 'unused airport runways' or 'broken sidewalks.' The term is probably even unsuitable for Wiktionary. If there are notable unused highways then feel free to rename this to 'List of Notable Unused Highways,' that is if you can establish clear and objective criter for determining the notability of such highways and the topic (eg. find sources that state that this particular unused highway is important because...) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:26, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>(Edit conflict) Per the last two AFDs and extensive discussions, the choosing of the word is the most appropriate terminology as it is the most _direct_ and _simple_. It's unfortunate that you were not a main participant in those prior discussions (per standard search, please correct if I am mistaken), because those discussions led to the renaming of the article. Renaming it again, or moving it to satisfy your definition or idea is simply spinning the wheel, and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Renominationswasting_everyones_time_and_resources" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Renominationswasting everyones time and resources</a> --</li>

<li>I think that some of this could be merged to <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html" title="Highway">highway</a> or some other similar place, as a description of what one can do with unwanted highways. I don't think much of this is useful for helping define what a notable unused highway is. One could of course use it to categorize the unused highways, but I'm not sure how useful that would be - how many highways have notably been turned into gardens? I think that would be up to the editors of the list, as to whether that would be a useful scheme of organization. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:34, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment, no "vote".</b> Obviously this is just another in a long line of highway-related nominations (both the first two "ghost ramp" nominations and a number of others) that's going to end in no consensus. Obviously, it is a neologism coined by NE2 (I've never heard these referred to as "unused highways" before), but the term makes sense, and was done as a compromise for people who thought "ghost ramp" and "stub ramp" were neologisms.

<li><b>comment</b>: <b>Closed Highway</b> appears to be a more poppular term which is even used, most recently with our Big North Eastern Winter Storm of January 2007 that we are currently experiencing, on the weather network. Again, as per my above vote to keep, I would merge to "Closed highway"... a term as I demonstrated within the precedence that is used by Police during chases. It is also a term that is used during "accidents" involving deaths, or serious truck spills, or many other incidents where Police decided to "close" a highway. This term has many legal implications as well... if you where riding/driving on a "closed highway" vs. a "highway". Smarten up! By taking a look at the nominator's user page, it is obvious he has a general grudge for compound worded articles.

<p>Use of this term was apparently coined by a couple of editors for the purpose of use in Wikipedia, the definition of a neologism. This article was originally kept (as <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_ramp.html" title="Ghost ramp">Ghost ramp</a>) in an AfD; a second AfD was improperly closed by a non-admin who proposed its deletion when he moved it to the current name. A move back to "ghost ramp" would not be appropriate since the list has expanded well past its original meaning and contains abandoned road structures (and some road structures never built) that are not ghost/stub ramps. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 03:55, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very strong Delete</b> (Ignore the tangent I'm about to go on and skip straight to the encyclopedic reasoning: Good grief!!! Are you SERIOUSLY suggesting that every unfinished ramp of every highway in the world is that important that they have to be assembled into a list?) The question here is <b>notability</b>. While in general major highways <i>that actually exist</i> are considered inherently notable, unused/unfinished ramps/portions of said highways are not notable <i>in and of themselves</i> (they do not automatically inherit notability from the parent highway), nor are unfinished highways notable. There is no demonstration of "multiple third-party reliable sources" documenting these phantom highways, thus no evidence of notability has been shown. Another question is that of "level of detail". The content of this article/list goes to an extremely high level of detail, IMHO to a level that an encyclopedia (even a non-paper one) should not cover. Let the encyclopedia give an encyclopedic "arm's length overview" and keep the minutae out of the 'pedia proper. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 15:03, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

Current article looks like some kid made it up. The historically significant origins are in heroin addiction, not the loose use of the term in other ways today. If we knew more about its origins (Merriam-Webster doesn't),there might be more for an article rather than a dicdef. The actual withdrawal/addiction symptoms are better treated under separate articles with proper naming especially as the withdrawal symptoms referenced are for more than one kind of drug (and different). There's a Chinese expression "to eat opium" which is widely used to as a common expression "to really enjoy oneself", but if we were to write an Wikidictionary article on that, we wouldn't focus on going to the amusement park etc. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 08:24, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is described as a pilot for a show but there are no sources to back it up. The IMDB profile <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0759582/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0759582/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> for this is very scarce and just lists characters.

<li><b>Delete</b> but on the basis of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. I've heard of this guy, and I'm not deeply involved in his subculture. He's written a couple of books of some note.

<li><b>delete</b> His claim to be the only person is not supported by the evidence. According to Dissertation Abstracts, there are at least 44 other people with theses on this subject. (searched under parapsychology as a word in the citation or abstract) Not all of them are PhDs, not all are US universities, but the majority are. He is not even the first: there was one at the University of Oklahoma, 1977, 7815383AAT . (As for the reputation of the schools, many of the theses are anthropological, some are slightly disguised , and a few seem to be by believers.) I have adjusted the article for accuracy in this respect, but this lends a certain amount of doubt to the rest of it. The Psychology Today article is RS, but not enough for notability. The strongest claim to notability is the television program. I can find that the show exists, and that tapes of individual programs are cataloged by a few libraries. Everything else about the show seems to derive either from sources linked to the subject, or blogs. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Any dubious material should be removed if can't be confirmed. But the inclusion of unsourced material is not grounds for deletion of the article--you've satisfied yourself that his TV show exists, his books are real (I have seen "Roots of Consciousness," which is a sort of encyclopedia of the paranormal--several titles by him are listed at Amazon.com) and he lectures around the country (I frequently see his name posted as a featured speaker when driving past the Philosophical Research Society building, here in Los Angeles). I think he's clearly notable enough to merit an article. Also, though I'm not up to doing the research to get to the bottom of it, it may be that his claim about the PhD is that he actually received a degree in parapsychology, as opposed to writing a thesis about the parapsychology to earn a PhD in a discipline like anthropology or sociology. If that's the case, then his original claim may well be true. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 02:06, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well that really would make him notable, because UC Berkeley does not have such a department. Only US university that does is Duke. He must have materialized the department temporarily. Diss Abs specifies the field as "Psychology", but they use whatever subject term the author of the thesis used. So he didn't claim parapsychology at the time. They have many theses on line, but his is too early. Now that I think of it, the courses which use his textbook are probably his own, because that's what he teaches in his university. Having a TV show and publishing books makes one notable only if the show or the books are notable, and there is no independent sourced evidence for that, about either of them. His name as a featured speaker on the building of his society/university is not exactly 3rd party evidence. The evidence about his notable list of speakers is on the site for his show. He also has a long list of stations that have his show, and he himself has said it, but nobody else. So what is he notable for, exactly?<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:10, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He is notable as an author and media pundit on parapsychology and related topics. He is a long-established and fairly widely published figure in that field (while it may be dubious to consider parapsychology as a "field," there are organizations, journals, etc., devoted to it, so I think we need to give it the benefit of the doubt as far as inclusion in Wikipedia goes). The Wikipedia threshold for notability is low, compared to a conventional encyclopedia. One doesn't need to be an historic figure to make the cut. We need to guard against his self-edits being used for deceptive or self-promotional purposes, but that doesn't mean deleting the article. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 08:38, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Withdraw nomination for deletion</b> for the following reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(1) A week before I nominated this article for deletion, I stated on the article's <a href="../../../i/n/c/Talk%7EInclusive_Democracy_9897.html" title="Talk:Inclusive Democracy">talk page</a> that I would refrain from nominating the article for deletion if it were developed with more content. Since then, <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarap43_5b27.html" title="User:Narap43">narap43</a> has written a proper article. Technically it's a little late, but in keeping with the spirit of my promise I am withdrawing my nomination for deletion.</dd>
<dd>(2) The links at the bottom of the new article may make out a case for notability. It is a very weak case, but I prefer inclusion in borderline cases. The following two sources qualify as sources of notability under Wikipedia guidelines in my opinion:
<dl>
<dd>(a) David Freeman, Thesis Eleven, no. 69, Sage Publications, May 2002, pp. 103-106</dd>
<dd>(b) “Inclusive Democracy” entry in “Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy:” pp. 732-733, ed. by R.J. Barry Jones, 2001</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The following two sources are borderline, but might be considered to qualify:
<dl>
<dd>(a) <a href="http://www.agorainternational.org/dnweb1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.agorainternational.org/dnweb1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.agorainternational.org/dnweb1.html</a>;</dd>
<dd>(b) <a href="http://susanohanian.org/show_nclb_outrages.html?id=2531" class="external free" title="http://susanohanian.org/show_nclb_outrages.html?id=2531" rel="nofollow">http://susanohanian.org/show_nclb_outrages.html?id=2531</a> (this one is from TouristPhilosopher)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Given these two (or four) sources there is a minimal case for satisfaction of the notability criteria. That said, I want to respond to some of the comments below.
<ul>
<li>TouristPhilosopher asks me to prove that he is associated with the ID Project. My answer is that there is obviously some connection. You registered a user account specifically to oppose the deletion of the Inclusive Democracy article. As of this writing you have not participated on Wikipedia in any other capacity. Your comments on the question of whether ID is notable are not dispassionate, and betray an obvious emotional investment in whether the article is deleted or not. Like many of the people at the center of the ID Project, you are not a native English speaker, even though most of the participants in the English Wikipedia are. I suppose it is possible that you are not one of the people at the center of ID, but rather a very enthusiastic supporter. But I really doubt it.</li>
<li>In answer to <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarap43_5b27.html" title="User:Narap43">narap43</a>, several points. First, I never said that ID is not notable. I stated that the article failed to make out a case for notability and that its notability was therefore suspect. There is a difference. It does not fall upon me to prove the negative proposition that ID is not notable. Second, your accusations regarding my role on Wikipedia are easy to disprove by simply looking at my <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Drake_Dun_a769.html" title="Special:Contributions/Drake Dun">contributions list</a>. Your claim that I only registered a few weeks ago is false. My first edit was in November of 2006. Your claim that one of my first acts as a registered user was to identify bias in the ID article is also false. Long before becoming involved in any fashion with the ID article, I contributed to several other, totally unrelated articles, including <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physicalism.html" title="Physicalism">Physicalism</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curry.html" title="Curry">Curry</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/k/Soka_Gakkai_274a.html" title="Soka Gakkai">Soka Gakkai</a>, etc. Your claim that I have declared a sole ambition to identify bias in Wikipedia articles is also false. I have no idea where you got this notion. In short, all of your accusations are either grievous mistakes or barefaced lies. And by the way, I have not identified any biases in the ID article. I challenged it on the basis of notability and conflict of interest. There is a difference. Regarding conflicts of interest, I do not feel a need to defend Wikipedia's policies, except by saying that I have nothing to do with them and they are what they are regardless of my opinions on them.</li>

<dd>I remain unconvinced. I looked at all the links you posted and found a couple which were close to qualifying as sources, but none which made the cut. "References" do not count. Please actually read the notability policies. "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other." That means that people talking about it in an Internet forum, brief references, stuff that comes one way or another from ID people themselves, and stuff which talks about Fotopoulos but not ID do not count. Also, nobody has addressed the COI issue. The article was written by Inclusive Democracy people. The only two people who have objected to its deletion here are also Inclusive Democracy people. Clearly there is a problem. Wikipedia is not free advertising space. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Dun_64ea.html" title="User:Drake Dun">Drake Dun</a> 04:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I added a lot of new material, first, to give more info on the aspects of the Inclusive Democracy project and, second, to establish the notability of the article, as suggested by user <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Dun_64ea.html" title="User:Drake Dun">Drake Dun</a>. Also, many links to online and printed resources are given.</li>

<li>I agree that the Inclusive Democracy entry needed a lot of expansion from its previous “stub” form and I think that in its present form it is a satisfactory presentation of the topic. But for <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Dun_64ea.html" title="User:Drake Dun">Drake Dun</a> to declare that a project, which as far as I know is widely discussed within the radical Left, is not notable betrays only his ignorance on the subject. Furthermore, to argue that there is a COI issue because “The article was written by Inclusive Democracy people” shows that he is far from being unbiased on the matter (despite his declared sole ambition “to identify bias” in wikipedia when he registered as a user, just a couple of weeks ago, and one of his first acts was to identify bias in this particular entry!). It is well known that this is a general practice in Wikipedia which, unlike the “ordinary” encyclopedias, do not engage established bodies of experts to write the entries. This is particularly true of wikipedia entries on new political projects, journals etc. which are bound to be written by people involved in them (has he examined for instance the Parecon entries?). This is not bad by itself, as long as the entries are not just eulogies but aim to give a fair description of the topic. Who else is expected to have a fairly comprehensive view of a new political project like Inclusive Democracy or Parecon but people involved in them who are best qualified to write the relevant entries and then to leave it to unbiased qualified users—an extremely difficult operation anyway as far as controversial topics like politics is concerned—to suggest additions/amendments etc?</li>

<li><a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Dun_64ea.html" title="User:Drake Dun">Drake Dun</a>, i'm not an ID man. In case you still «BELIEVE» that I’m, you MUST to prove it RIGHT NOW. Unless your comment aimed to make anybody wishing to make a comment for non-deletion think twice before doing so, unless he wants to be labelled an ID sympathiser by you.</li>

<li>«Mr» <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Dun_64ea.html" title="User:Drake Dun">Drake Dun</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; First you write: «The only two people who have objected to its deletion here are also Inclusive Democracy people».</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; my answer: the meaning of YOUR words here is that you ARE SURE.</p>
<p>When I said that I’m not an ID man and asked you to prove what you said:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; you write: «there is obviously some connection»</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; my answer: I didn’t ask you to tell us if there is any connection or better if YOU SEE or IMAGINE any connection. I ask you to PROVE WHAT YOU SAID TO YOUR PREVIOUS POST — and you said that I’Μ ΑΝ ID MAN. But you CAN’T prove anything. FIRST you see an ID man, now –a day later- you see SOME CONNECTION. Tomorrow you could SEE a loose connection and after a week or month nothing. Its better to «fix» yourself with the reality and stop BELIEVING what you like.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; you write: «I suppose it is possible that you are not one of the people at the center of ID, but rather a very enthusiastic supporter. But I really doubt it.»</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; my answer: so shut up till you are sure&#160;!!!</p>
<p><br />
PS1. I expect a «sorry» because you called me ID man. PS2. Your comments are not dispassionate, and betray an obvious emotional investment AGAINST ID. You registered a user account 2 months ago and except some minor comments this one is your first attempt to delete A WHOLE article. Like many of the people outside the center of the ID Project, you are a native English speaker or at least speak fluent English. I suppose it is possible that you are not one of the people who tried in the past to delete the ID article of wiki, but rather a very enthusiastic supporter AGAINST ID. But I really doubt it.</p>

<dd>Additional factual corrections: (1) I registered my user account three months ago. (2) This is not my first AfD nomination. My first AfD nomination was for Deception in the Unification Church. (3) I have no bias for or against ID, and have never previously nominated any ID related articles for deletion. A look at my history of contributions will quickly dispel any such notions. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Dun_64ea.html" title="User:Drake Dun">Drake Dun</a> 16:23, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

We are much faster at processing things now, so I chose to be conservative by estimating only one week just to try to make everyone happy.&#160;:-) Either way, deleting is definitely <i>not</i> the right answer (unless it turns out to be a hoax), because if any part of the article is kept (which is very likely, even if only transwikied to <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending" class="extiw" title="b:Bartending">b:Bartending</a>, we have to keep the edit history for <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL</a> licensing and attribution requirements.

<p>I added this cocktail to fit in with a new category involving absinthe-based cocktails or cocktails with absinthe in their makeup that I am working on. You may delete it, although it is an unusual recipe that is not commonly found in guides, the main reason I included it. I see no reason why it should be deleted, as it is a feasible recipe that is not life-threatening that would expand the list of cocktails recorded in Wikipedia. I think that the Cocktail project needs more input on these new designs and I can't see why it can't be included.<a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotspur23_6190.html" title="User:Hotspur23">Hotspur23</a> 05:21, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment - Part of the problem is that Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> a collection of recipes (for cocktails or otherwise). To be included in Wikipedia, the topic of an article needs to have more depth. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notability</a> and importance of the drink must be demonstrated as shown by <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing</a> several <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. I definitely appreciate what you are trying to do here. If this is part of a series of articles you are developing, we might be able to develop a single article that discusses these cocktails in a broad sense, and explore some specific examples. Then, if and when the article grows large enough, with plenty of good information, start splitting sections of that article into smaller, more fully developed articles. It is certainly something that would be worth discussing at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mixed_Drinks_de0c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mixed Drinks">WikiProject Mixed Drinks</a> (we just changed the name of the project to be more inclusive; sorry for any confusion). --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt"><font color="#C71585" face="Tahoma"><b>Willscrlt</b></font></a>&#160;<small>(<font color="#4169E1" face="Tahoma"><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillscrlt_ad5a.html" title="User talk:Willscrlt"><b>T</b>alk</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willscrlt_ad85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willscrlt"><b>C</b>ntrb</a></font>)</small> 06:43, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then it should be moved to Wiki Project Mixed Drinks and not deleted. It seems silly to delete it when there is a program to do the very thing you want to delete it for in Wikipedia. Plus it can be argued that cocktail recipes are information that can be stored in wikipedia, since they are already on record. They don't have to be famous or noteworthy (though there are recipes that are recorded in it that are); they just have to be useful. This just seems a bit trollish to bounce the article. 24.34.207.250 10:08, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks 24.34.207.250, though I wouldn't classify it as trollish.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> has very valid points for articles in general at Wikipedia. The articles concerning mixed drinks in general do seem to defy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, because a mixed drink, at its heart, is essentially a recipe. It's much like a chemical compound, in that the parts that make up the whole help to define the substance itself. However, with some (or sometimes a lot of) creative researching, it is possible to create a meaningful, encyclopedic article even when all you have is a recipe with which to start. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bronx_%28cocktail%29&amp;diff=101704477&amp;oldid=97872919" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bronx_%28cocktail%29&amp;diff=101704477&amp;oldid=97872919" rel="nofollow">Bronx (cocktail)</a> for a perfect example updated yesterday.) It is success stories like the Bronx that illustrate how weak articles can, and should, be improved. This AFD process is an important part of making sure that Wikipedia remains relevant.</li>
<li>All that being said, I did complete my initial research into this particular drink. I was able to locate the recipe in several places, but no real information about its notability or history. Since it does seem to be popular, I changed my vote to transwiki it to the Bartending manual at Wikibooks (with which I am also an editor), and then convert the page under discussion to a redirect. Again, I stress that it is important to <b>not delete</b> the actual page, since even when transwikiing, it is important to keep the edit history for <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL</a> compliance.</li>
<li>I have also added a section under the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mixed_Drinks_Work_Area_7188.html#List_of_incubating_articles" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mixed Drinks/Work Area">Wikipedia:WikiProject Mixed Drinks/Work Area#List of incubating articles</a> section for <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotspur23_6190.html" title="User:Hotspur23">Hotspur23</a> and anyone else interested, to start developing an article that will serve the needs of Absinthe aficionados, while also meeting Wikipedia's editorial guidelines. I feel the new article is necessary since the topic is largely ignored in the <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absinthe.html" title="Absinthe">Absinthe</a> article, and yet it is a large part of the Absinthe culture. If possible, I would also request that other Absinthe related articles not be deleted at least through the end of February so we can easily refer to them and merge them as necessary into the developing article or Wikibooks.

<p>I go to the University of Maryland, and if a friend of mine wasn't considering editing for this thing, I'm sure that I'd be in the vast majority of people who have no idea what the Terrapist is. Besides, in an earlier AfD, the campus' daily student paper (The Diamondback) was deemed to be non-notable. If it's not notable, when it also serves the surrounding College Park community and has a much higher circulation, there's no way The Terrapist is. --<a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzy510_a9be.html" title="User:Fuzzy510">fuzzy510</a> 08:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>: I am proposing <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basin_Groups_dc13.html" title="Basin Groups">Basin Groups</a> for deletion because it is not a geologic era of the Moon that is recognized by experts who work in this field. The geological timescale that is currently in use is discussed at <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_geologic_timescale.html" title="Lunar geologic timescale">lunar geologic timescale</a>, where there is no refernce to a "Basin Groups". The two external links for <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_geologic_timescale.html" title="Lunar geologic timescale">lunar geologic timescale</a> do not have any reference to this era either. Wilhelms' book (which is considered a major repsected work by the lunar community) does not discuss this era (it is not in the index terms), nor does the popular article (written by a lunar scientist) of Linda Martel. On the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basin_Groups_dc13.html" title="Basin Groups">Basin Groups</a> article, there are two external links that have been used to support the case for such a group, but neither are reputable nor verifiable. One page says that information will be uploaded later, whereas the other is a wiki, and I have removed the offending material! As someone who works with the Moon on a daily basis, I could add a number of primary and secondary references supporting my assertions here, though I think that the Wilhelms and Martel articles should suffice. I would be happy to add additional refernces if asked. It is quite possible that Basin Groups was at one time used as an informal term (though I have never encountered it), and if this were the case, we could discuss this at <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_geologic_timescale.html" title="Lunar geologic timescale">lunar geologic timescale</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 10:28, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Concerning the Harland book, I will look this up in my library asap, as the online version of the book is only partial, and says nothing about the rationale for using these eras. In any case, none of my geology or planetary geology textbooks use these eras, and I can not find reference to this in my file cabinet of scientific articles or pdfs either. As an active scientist in this domain, I can honestly say that these eras are not used by even a minority of the terrestrial and planetary communities. (Again, if you want a list of books and reveiw articles, tell me.) I also point out that it is scientifically unsound to "paste" geologic eras from the Moon (or any other celestial body) into the Earth's geologic history. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 11:02, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

If it's not a selenochron it should not be used in selenochron templates, but the article can be kept. It's a very very <b>odd</b> conclusion, that since it's not an official part of this-or-that time sequence, it can be removed - it can most definitely <b>not</b> be removed, whether we like to use it or not. It would be a <b>very bad thing</b> if it be removed. The term is used, and therefore it should be kept.

<p><b>Amendment to AfD nomination: Figure of Harland et al. is inconsistent with their discussion in text.</b> I have just read the Harland et al. book and have discovered the following: In the text, they advocate using the lunar geologic time scale for the Hadean which includes the Imbrian, Nectarian, and Pre-Nectarian. Then they cite Wilhemls (1987) to subdivide the Pre-Nectarian into Cryptic, Basin Group 1, and Basin Groups 2-9. However, in their figure, they do not include the Pre-Nectarian epoch, but instead only include the subdivisions. Based on their text, I can only conclude that this is a <b>typo</b> in their manuscript. Anyone who has cited their typo (fortunately, there are very few!) have simply propogated a typographical error.</p>
<p>Concerning the subdividing the Pre-Nectarian into "Basin Groups", it appears that Wilhelms did indeed suggest this. However, this is only informal, and none of the USGS geologic maps of the Moon use this notation. Indeed, from Wilhelms (1987,p. 145) he states: "This volume divides 30 pre-Necarian basins into 9 age groups (table 8.2). Each group is headed by one basin whose relative age seems to be well established by crater densities or superpositional relations. Additional basins are tentatively placed in the groups on weaker grounds."</p>
<p>I continue to support the nomination for deletion on the grouds that "Basin Groups 1-9 and Cryptic" should be replaced by "Pre-Necarian" based on the Harland et al.'s own words. The fact that these subdivisions were used instead of Pre-Nectarian appears to be a typo. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 17:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Withdrawl of AfD nomination:</b> After talking to a few terrestrial geologists offline, I am going to withdraw my nomination for deleting "Basin Groups" for the following reasons: First, it appears that the Harland et al. book is so respected, that even if they did make a typo in their summary plot, or even if they did not understand the lunar geologic time scale and made an serious error in representing it, it doesn't matter, and its too late. Second, I consider the inclusion of this period in the terrestrial geologic time scale to be a case of bad science, and wikipedia can play a role in correcting this by presenting the mainstream view among terrestrial and planetary scientists for why this period should be abandonned. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 15:23, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, "Attack" does not seem to be a major publisher, and attack is an anarchist publisher. Due to their search-unfriendly name, I have found only one other publication by them. I have found one link to their homepage, but that gave a 404 (bad link or inactive homepage, I don't know). If you could point me to more info about the publisher to show that it is indeed a major publisher, be my guest.

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b> With the greatest of respect this prod and and AFD are a clear demonstration of the way that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is poisoning wikipedia, providing a figleaf for removal of content that is not removable by any other means. I have a genuinely hard time believing this publication would not have been covered in critical publications or have received reviews in same. What makes it vulnerable is purely the relative obscurity of the subject, not the verifiability of it. In short no matter how good the sophistry used to argue for the deletion of this article, I would like to read evaluations of it's worth by those who have read the actual comic book. If people who have read the comic book say it is not worth a wikipedia entry, I will gladly vote for deletion. I can not in good conscience do so without such assurances. The rule should be, if in doubt, keep. -- <a href="../../../c/i/m/User%7ECimon_Avaro_6721.html" title="User:Cimon Avaro">Cimon Avaro; on a pogostick.</a> 11:23, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sophistry? Anyway, it is irrelevant if people who have read a comic want to keep or delete it. <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> is an invalid keep reason. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is hardly poisoning Wikipedia, it is a (perhaps <i>the</i>) core policy. If good <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources can be found, I have no problem keeping it. In fact, I have argued for keeping obscure comics I haven't read in the past (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Meng_and_Ecker_4359.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Meng and Ecker">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Meng_and_Ecker</a>. I have looked for good sources for this one with the means available to me. I haven't found any. This does not mean that there aren't any, of course, but then providing those is up to those wanting to keep the article (they have had a year to do so since the creation of the article, and they have five more days to do so now).

<li><b>Delete</b> due to lack of verified notability. I've taken a look at the comic online<a href="http://tintinrevolution.free.fr/" class="external autonumber" title="http://tintinrevolution.free.fr/" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. It's a real stretch of the truth to describe it as a parody of Tintin. The two main characters visually look like Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock (no doubt mostly traced directly from actual Tintin books - other scenes are directly traced from Tintin books but are otherwise in a totally different context). Otherwise, they have no resemblance - they talk differently, they act differently, they have different jobs and motivations and social context. The producers of this book could have chosen to "borrow" the imagery of Homer and Bart Simpson and the Simpsons and used exactly the same script of English anarchist characters with no significant effect from the change. At least in the Tintin in Thailand parody (which I've also read but won't link to due to legal issues) there is more than a visual resemblance for the characters. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 15:42, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weak <b>keep</b>. I'm sort of amazed it sells on amazon, but it's widely available, has ISBN-13, is in libraries. Is it notable because it's a copyright violation? It's unappealing work and the article gives no hint of anyone ever taking notice, but there could be truth to the stated press reaction at the time. It already gets a much too long description in the Tintin article, so maybe it would it be best if that text ends up in a <i>Tintin pastiches and imitations</i> article for this to merge into..? <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 02:35, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is what makes wikipedia a serious dictionary, acceptable in scholarly circles in ways that other, non-verified sources like urbandictionary are not. The requirement for verifibility, paired with that of notability, is our last line of protection from hoaxes, mass spam and eventual uselessness. It is not 'poisioning' wikipedia, in fact in my opinion the twin core policies of WP:N and WP:V are the very heart of the project, most of the rest is just quality assurance and process.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Murgh, I dont really understand your reasoning. While there <i>could</i> be truth in the stated press reaction, there is no verifiable evidence of such.

<ul>
<li>I mean that the notion of "no verifiable evidence of such" is harsh. The claimed coverage from Channel4, The Face, Daily Star whatever in 1989 isn't as accessible as 10 years later. It may still be very verifiable, but falls outside "easy online verification". And the more I check around (though no microfilms at the public library) there seems to me to exist wikipedia precedence of a more generous threshold of notability. -<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 14:53, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>These are from the back cover of the comic. If they don't have qualms about copyright infringements by using Tintin for their political goals, I don't think they will have qualms about fabricating quotes to make it seem more anarchistic and anti-government (it's not unusual to make up blurb quotes anyway, for humoristic purposes, even Gerrit De Jager has done it). These are very very far from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources, and especially the Thatcher one makes me doubt the veracity of all of them. 20:22, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well if the press quotes are just hoax, I care even less if someone doesn't appear and passionately champion this book.

<li>To be fair, it's just my gut feeling that they are fake, not a certainty. You are correct that if e.g. the Thatcher quote is real, then it is a strong point in favor of the book of course.

Too bad, I'll have to change my opinion to a reluctant <s><b>Keep</b></s> now (reluctant because I utterly dislike these rip-offs which seem only to use the name of more famous books or characters to get the attention: but "I don't like it" is not a valid delete reason, luckily). I'll <i>not</i> withdraw my nomination though, since I want to give the other&#160;!voters an the closing admin the chance to give their own opinion (again). I don't think it will be deleted after your work, but it can do no harm to let the AfD run its course.

<blockquote>
<p>Equally nostalgic, but hankering after an entirely different epoch, is J Daniel's The Adventures of Tintin: Breaking Free (Attack International pounds 3.95). Dedicated to "all those fighting capitalism" this "graphic novel of Tintin and Friends in a Revolutionary Situation" generously allows any part of the book to be "freely reproduced by any revolutionary group" (including, I suppose, the urban guerrillas administering the Herge Estate). This cavalier attitude to copyright is just another acute observation in what I take to be a brilliant post-modern parody of a situationist canard produced during a sit-in at Hornsey School of Art circa 1972. I hope. Otherwise the crusty cadres of Class War (of which this is a by-product) might as well pack up and go home. Placing obscene epiphets and revolutionary nostrums into the mouths of the icons of child-ren's fiction was beginning to look stale even before the Oz Trial, and nowadays VIZ (VIZ: The Pan Handle: The Most Outstanding Parts of Issues 53 to 57, John Brown Publishing pounds 6.99) does this kind of thing much better, and probably to more subversive effect. The only cliche that Breaking Free doesn't salvage is the hoary old line "Steal This Book!!!" on the back cover. But if the idea of this sad little publication appeals to you, don't hesitate to do just that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>REVOLUTIONARY comic book, first published in 1988, in which Tintin and Haddock are reincarnated as militant activists who organise a strike, and a mass demonstration, after a friend is killed on a building site. The interesting things about it are the way each frame is adapted from Herge's originals, and the touching belief in the possibility of an upsurge in grassroots socialist radicalism. One suspects that Tony Blair is not the saviour Daniels had in mind</p>

<li>I certainly don't mean to represent the sources. Yes, they are from brief book reviews. I see that others have posted two of the three here. The third, from The Times reads, "Thunderin' Typhoons! Tintin, the raisin-eyed, be-quiffed journalist hero of a thousand adventures against bolsheviks, terrorists and Johnny Arab, has changed sides drastically. He goes beserk at the social security office, gets nicked for shoplifting, works on a building site with Cap'n Haddock (who now lives in a tower block), hangs around with militants, becomes a class warrior and strike co-ordinator, and finally helps usher in a socialist revolution. This startling volte-face appears, presumably without the imprimatur of the Herge estate, in Breaking Free, a naive and brutish strip-cartoon book for junior Dave Sparts, published by something called Attack International, whose affiliated organisations are the Anarchist-Communist Federation, Black Flag and World Revolution. I presume Harry Thompson, will be reflecting this unusual side of his subject in Tintin: A Biography, which comes out from Hodder in July." -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 16:44, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From memory, Harry Thompson didn't. I read the book recently in order to work on the Tintin articles. I won't swear it wasn't in there, but I'm 99% positive if it was I would've used it as a source for the mention at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Tintin_3fe1.html" title="The Adventures of Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 17:35, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>And to be honest, the press coverage we have here is in relation to the work's status as a Tintin parody rather than as a work in its own right. I think then that the mention in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Tintin_3fe1.html" title="The Adventures of Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a> article is enough, but other people may beg to differ. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 17:38, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I <b>do know</b> that it is in the wrong namespace. Don't say things I have not said!</dd>
<dd>But a minimal reference is still needed anyway, because it is referenced <b>directly</b> from the Telugu wikipedia (see <a href="../../../../te/index.html" class="extiw" title="te:">te:</a>), at the top of <b>all</b> its pages, in a non-editable area (it's not part of any of the Telugu wiki pages!)</dd>
<dd>So, until the Telugu wikipedia is corrected, we need it, and we should include further assistance links in this minimal page for Telugu users. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerdy_P_b746.html" title="User:Verdy P">verdy_p</a> 11:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And I don't like the fact that you use immediate delete immediately after a move; especially when this clearly breaks the intent fdr which it was intended (with the immediate delete, the Telugu Wikipedia stills to points nowhere!). I did not want to create a full help page to solve this issue.</dd>
<dd>So keep it, and ask to Telugu Wikipedia admins to correct their site (at least change the link it currently displays and which is <b>hardcoded</b> somewhere to point directly to en:Setting up your browser for Indic scripts on the English Wikipedia. i don't know exactly where it is hardcoded, may be it is within the MediaWiki software installed in this wiki!

<dd>Also, i don't like that you lie when you say that I did not reference the backward link. You have simply not read anything! Instead, you have just read the title and immediately deleted the article, without wondering why it was there. This is not the Wikiepdia policy to perform such immediate deletion, where there is no evidence that the article was created with the intent to introduce garbage or spam. This is not spam, and even if you delete it, anyone on the Telugu wikiepdia could recreate it immediately by just following the link it provides everywhere! <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerdy_P_b746.html" title="User:Verdy P">verdy_p</a> 11:10, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Hmmmmm.... Regardless of Uncle G's suggestion (and I would ADD to it that the redlinked movies be removed as well; if a movie is not notable enough for Wikipedia <i>as a whole</i>, then it is not notable enough <i>in part</i> either), the question remains whether such a list is encyclopedic. I sometimes get the impression that editors that love pop culture have run out of articles to write and have now moved on to creating IMHO arbitrary lists to categorise information in a myriad of ways. So, while the <i>subject</i> of "unsimulated sex in film" is possibly notable, a <i>list</i> of all verifiable and notable movies that have such scenes goes to a level of detail beyond which an encyclopedia (even a non-paper one) should not cover. There are some things that just don't belong in an encyclopedia, which is why we direct readers to the sources and external links for further reading. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 14:16, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm with Zunaid; even if everything was cited and redlinks were removed, etc., etc., this would still be unencyclopedic listcruft. As Zunaid said, it is probable that the concept of (unsimulated) sex in film is notable, but a mere mention of films that contain sex is not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> per Uncle G. Since there have been only a small handful of non-porn films in this category, I don't think it's even close to listcruft. It seems to me more like documentation of a shift in cultural and industry norms. Maybe in twenty years it will have grown to a nonmanagable size, but we can worry about that then. Certainly needs to be sourced and dramatically cropped, however -- I would argue that it should stick to its title ("mainstream" and "films") and lose all the cable tv / internet stuff. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 17:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not trying to be dense (it comes natural!), but I don't see how this is a reason for deletion. In fact, just the opposite: because unsimulated sex in a mainstream movies is a rare thing, it is worth having a list of those rarities. Surely a List of mainstream movies with simulated sex would be listcruft, but this is a list of exceptions to a rule that has very few exceptions. In this way, it's like having a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_left-handed_people.html#Baseball" title="List of famous left-handed people">list of left-handed baseball players</a> -- that is, they are all important exceptions.

<dd>No, that's a very fair point. I think an article <i>about</i> this topic could be made if done right and the sources where there for the reason you stated. This article is not about the subject, it's just a <i>listing</i> of movies in which it occurs, not encyclopedic to begin with and then it's losses the rest of it's reason for existence (in my mind) when only one or two of those movies scenes can be verified by reliable sources. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 21:29, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I can see where the "keepers" are coming from in the responses above, and would not object to this list being partly merged back into an "unsimulated sex in film" article <i>as examples of the concept</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Unencyclopedic. The list is entertaining, I'll grant you, but not a topic for an encyclopedia article. Maybe there should be a separate "Listopedia" or something to capture this list-making impulse. But really, if you grant this for Wikipedia, what's next? "List of films in which simulated fellatio occurs"? "List of non-mainstream films with scenes of dogs drinking water"?

<li><b>Delete</b> If this were a proper <i>article</i> I might feel otherwise, but we have more than enough of these silly pop culture lists already.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see any compelling reason to remove the article. Clean up any libelous content, sure, though I saw nothing that was libelous -- i.e., that demonstrated a malicious intent. Seems like a fairly honest and straightforward list. Could someone point out content that they though was libelous? Otherwise, the only basis for objection is the sexual content, and really, if you're going to let the prudes run the show, might as well give up and do a dead trees edition with all objectionable content removed, because it won't be the Wikipedia and it will not be a democratically-created product.</li>

<p>Although I am the article "creator" (albeit after splitting it off) and also the nominator, please do not use this as a reason to consider speedy deletion. I feel the article should have a full chance to have a consensus formed. The list is a valid list, but I feel it does not pass any of the criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia. I split it from the original article, a genuinely notable list, because it diluted that article with ephemera, and did so after flagging a possible split on that talk page (no responses after 8 days).

<dd>When asked for references to back up an article, especially one dealing with a conflict between two nations who had a war 10 years ago inspired with nationalistic hatred, its not very "neutral" (to satisfy the NPOV requirement) to cite sources from one side which participated in this war (and the surrounding infoamations campaign, and so on). The first, jasenovac-info.com is, i cite, "the holy assembly of bishops of the serbian orthodox church", which I wouldnt call a neutral source.

<dd>Serbs being victims by the Ustasa regime in the WW2 era Croatia isnt disputed here at all. But trying to google it, I have not been able to find any other references that prove the existance of this figure than Serbian sites only and sites that copied the text from the Wikipedia article here. I certainly do not think that for an Wikipedia article about a mass murderer and war criminal it is enough to find a citation on some Serbian site and nowhere else? -- <a href="../../../r/h/u/User%7ERhun_3352.html" title="User:Rhun">Rhun</a> 23:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You really dont care that for something to be included in the wikipedia and then spread to international users as a _proven_ fact to other sites there do not exist any neutral references at all? Even if you know that under the circumstances of the Serbo-Croatian nationalism of the previous 60 years and especially after the recent war there were _insane_ amounts of propaganda material floating around on both sides? Would you still take an unprovable information about a mass murderer who killed 1500 (!) people in a day in a butchering contest(!), whose name only by chance was "Petar Brzica" (Speedy Peter), if this information is provided from only one of the sides in the conflict, and not proven by any international source at all? Well, I would have a problem doing that and then proxying this information through the Wikipedia to other sites on the net as a proven "fact" when it isnt one. -- <a href="../../../r/h/u/User%7ERhun_3352.html" title="User:Rhun">Rhun</a> 23:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I am _NOT_ saying you provided no sources, but I think the ones you provided aer worthless when trying to proove a war crime and an mass murder. This ISNT enough.

<dd>As a final comment, I am somewhat troubled that editors should say that because a source is of a certain nationality, it is <i>per se</i> unreliable. Propaganda is a weapon used by both sides in war. That a source is Serbian does not make it a lie; that a source is Croatian doesn't make it truthful. It's been said that winners write history; perhaps so, but I would hope WP takes a broader perspective. The fact that the Allies won World War I didn't mean that the anti-German propaganda they put out (raped nuns and so forth) became truthful. We should take a neutral tone, laying out evidence and opposing evidence.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 12:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Without third party confirmation you do not have a proof that it _is_ relaiable. I know first hand what amount of propaganda and especially false, totally made up stories have been brought up between the Serbs and the Croats in their mutual desinformation and demonisation campaigns (which is, on a large level still going on, 10 years after their wars), and at the same time, how many war crimes have been tried to get hushed up.

<p>Would this person meet notability if he were a member of the state legislature, rather than a small-town mayor? Where is the 20,000 population criteria determined? Would a mayor of Plains, Georgia, for example, be eligible because that town obtained attention through Jimmy Carter. What about a mayor of Crawford, Texas? I read somewhere on the board that notability is notability in the local area, not statewide.</p>

<p>I give props to the author of this page; it is very well-typed and it looks neat. The main problem is that it is about a local football team, and gives no third-party references. If the article is kept, it needs a bit more wikification as well as "references" and "external links" (making sure there is a difference) sections. <a href="../../../v/-/m/User%7EV-Man737_9c52.html" title="User:V-Man737">V-Man737</a> 11:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I put this page to AfD for second nomination because of its biased intonation, also its controversial features. This article totally bases on a single view from a book "The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln" by the late researcher C.A.Tripp. The book itself is among controversy and a lot of other biographists and researchers on AL's life have made counter-arguments against this theory. Up til now no one can bear out the tangibility of the thesis. As I've said above, this article bases on almost every proofs that Mr Tripp used to convince his idea, which leads to the complexion of the article looks like a script of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. In other word, the article can be seen as a brief material of the book. Moreover, if this article exists, we <b>must</b> create another article called "Counter-arguments for <i>SoAL</i> thesis". Wikipedia is not a source which only reflects one-sided viewpoints. <font face="Kozuka Gothic Pro H"><sub>Abelin</sub></font><font face="Kozuka Gothic Pro H"><b><a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECausesobad_a54e.html" title="User:Causesobad"><span style="color:#0022b6">C</span></a><a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln"><span style="color:#5170f7">A</span></a><a href="../../../c/a/u/User_talk%7ECausesobad_b57d.html" title="User talk:Causesobad"><span style="color:#69a5ff">usesobad</span></a></b></font> 14:08, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Response</b>Tripp is the most prominent exponent of the theory. But he is not the only one. Personally I think it is garbage.

<dd><b>Response to response</b>: Of course I know Tripp is not the only one who agree to this theory, but you should remember that the number of researchers who disagree to it is much considerable, most notable is Havard Professor <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Herbert_Donald_653d.html" title="David Herbert Donald">David Herbert Donald</a> who has been studying Lincoln and the Civil War his whole life and has published his own book "We Are Lincoln Men" in 2003 and says there is no definitive proof of Lincoln having affairs with any men. This theory is <i>still controversial</i> and can't find any reconcilement among the reasearchers. This article is a brief version of Tripp's book, so should we add another one which is a brief version of Donald's book? NO. Wiki is NOT a place to contain every research around a person. Theories around Lincoln are many, including "Was Lincoln a racist?" Should we need another article on this, too? NO.

<dd><b>Response</b>: "You keep trying to play off comments as worthless, which I simply find annoying and a childish tactic." First, yous should differentiate between the assessment about "a comment" and the thing that you call "a childish tactic". I use no tactic here, also I don't need to use it because my judgement is staunch enough to provoke your idea. I feel in vice-versa that it's you who play off the "<i>childish tactic</i>", in which you constantly mention my favor on Lincoln to scatter the prejudice on other commentors that I propose the idea just because I like him, instead of giving out "clear explanation, reliable citation and tight-fisted ratiocination" (as I mention above) to the dicussion. <font face="Kozuka Gothic Pro H"><sub>Abelin</sub></font><font face="Kozuka Gothic Pro H"><b><a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECausesobad_a54e.html" title="User:Causesobad"><span style="color:#0022b6">C</span></a><a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln"><span style="color:#5170f7">A</span></a><a href="../../../c/a/u/User_talk%7ECausesobad_b57d.html" title="User talk:Causesobad"><span style="color:#69a5ff">usesobad</span></a></b></font> 06:37, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Rename or Keep</b> Rename, according to the argument proposed by Argyriou and Keep if his assumption, that the article is based almost solely on the book, is false. The article is badly written, the writer of an important source seems biased (he's a gay activist) and I think that Lincoln' sexuality is not important enough for us to have an article on it -- I don't care if he liked men, women, both or even goats as long as he did not act unethically&#160;; yet I vote for a keep because it seems to be a topic that is being discussed. --<a href="../../../a/_/s/User%7EA_Sunshade_Lust_fec1.html" title="User:A Sunshade Lust">A Sunshade Lust</a> 21:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but the article does need attention. The argument predates the 2003 book so it isn't really possible to rename it to be a summary of the book. It should be made clear that many of the instances discussed as evidence are "as argued by Tripp", rather than stuffing him into an afterword. Nobile's counterarguments should be more thoroughly aired. But this is a content dispute. The topic is unquestionably notable, and I don't think the existence of the article <i>per se</i> is POV as the nominator argues, and we absolutely should not have a separate article from the opposite POV as that represents a fork. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:50, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is certainly not a reason to delete. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 22:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep/Merge</b> I think that it's interesting, informative and VERY well written. If it cribs too much from one book then we should have other sources used more prominently in the article. If not, I back slimming down the articl eand including substantial info from it in the AL page. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElefuntboy_7b7e.html" title="User:Elefuntboy">Elefuntboy</a> 06:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not certain, as I stopped watching <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> many moons ago, but I believe this article actually arose out of that article's regular editors' determination that the content not be mentioned there. A merge would probably not be tactically possible. And there are plenty of separate sources for the content, so it shouldn't be a problem to expand further from those other sources. As I suggested above, if <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Herbert_Donald_653d.html" title="David Herbert Donald">David Herbert Donald</a> has disagreed with hypotheses on Lincoln's sexuality, then somebody should source from his writings on the subject as well. There's plenty of room for NPOV balancing, and plenty of sources to use, so if it's not currently at that stage, it really should be expanded rather than merged. A merge would eventually lead to the recreation of this article if/when more sources are utilized, per <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 06:19, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Changing my position to Keep</b> - I wasn't trying to say that this topic didn't deserve coverage. Initially I didn't see why it couldn't be integrated into <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, but looking at that article, it's very long and easy to get lost in. So I'd suggest creating a brief section in the main Lincoln article marked "controversy over sexuality" with a link to this page, just to make it more accessible to casual readers. Definitely keep the article. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Having been a part of the great-and-glorious-edit-war of 2006 I can tell you why. There are some editors on the AL page who will simply not have it on that page. This page was most likely created as a way to mollify the battle. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 18:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> - It's not their choice whether or not to "have it on that page"; if it cites published sources (i.e. Tripp's book) then they would be unjustified in removing it. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability, not truth, is the threshold for inclusion.</a> <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:46, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Aye, but such inclusion has been a tactical failure, and it never seems to stick around. To get it put there and for good will probably require <a href="../../../m/_/_/WP%7EM_4ddf.html" title="WP:M">WP:M</a> intervention, and nobody has wanted to pursue that yet, as far as I can recall.

<dd>The nomination was originally for the "current Ben" - the British actor/filmmaker. However neither appear notable and both should be deleted, IMO. If anyone feels that the "other Ben" is notable, however, I think a vote of "keep with a revert to the revision noted above" would suffice, no?

<dd>I should have been more detailed in my nomination, especially as the previous AfD has been blanked. Main contributions appear to have been on Zariski surfaces, the importace of which I cannot speak to, but which didn't impress many participants in the last AfD. His web page lists 32 publications between 1980 and 1994; a solid record but hardly outstanding. His political activity is certainly non-notable (one editor pointed out that he was not even in the NY Times' <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/elections2004/2004FL.html|list" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/elections2004/2004FL.html|list" rel="nofollow">of candidates</a>). This article has expunged most of the name-dropping and dubious claims of the previous article, although a section on work with Solidarity has been marked as "citation needed".

<li><b>Week keep</b> I think Blass is notable for the Zariski surface, although less so for the political candidacy (there are very many write in candidates in all sort of elections, no mainstream coverage other than basic candidate statements). However there is a lot of negative coverage, just google to find it. The article has problems with <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> being written almost entirely by the subject, the previous version deleted had a lot positive spin and name dropping. Currently the article is reasonable OK but there are sign of the same material creeping in again. I'd be happier if the article stayed very brief which would be inline with other mathematical bios of similar stature.

<p>Thank you Salix Alba for your objectivity! As for mainstream coverage there are two articles in our Palm Beach Post both available on line and also a couple of positive comments in the Sun Sentinel dealing with the 2006 governor election. Getting mainstream media coverage in Florida is quite difficult as you may know as as evidenced by the Sun Sentinel article. I am in the process of getting letters from the Michnik people about my role in the democratic opposition in Poland in the period 1961-1989 and shall make them available to the wikipedia community. Thank you for reckognizing the role of the Ulam stuff and collaboration with Grothendieck. Also several of my students are already in Wikipedia.

<li>Mhym said there were four hits for "Zariski surface", <i>not</i> "Piotr Blass". When I did a Google Scholar search for "Piotr Blass", I got 23 hits. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Piotr+Blass%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Piotr+Blass%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> However, you need to look at the quality of the hits. Some are duplicates of each other and others are completely irrelevant and inconsequential. For example, one of the Google Scholar hits is a letter sent to the editor of AMS requesting that people send Dr Blass notes so he can compile them into a book for an ill colleague. The 91 hits you claim are for a search of the name without quotation marks. The problem with that is it brings up hits for completely different people, such as many for Andreas Blass, Piotr Sztompka and Piotr Pieranski. That is completely misleading. Heck, my name searched your way brings up 629 Google Scholar hits! <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Sarah+Ewart&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Sarah+Ewart&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> <b>Sarah</b> 13:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>If you google piotr blass you will find over 20 000 hits with at least several thousand totally relevent.Since you are not a mathematician I apologize that my work is a little hard to appreciate as it deals with quite esoteric algebraic geometry.

I am the founder of this theory.All the best Dr Piotr Blass</p>

<dd>And as I said before, googling someone's name without quotation marks is extremely misleading.

<p>Dear Wikipedia friends,</p>
<p>One more remark:The main proponents of delete and those who question notability have chosen to remain anonymous.We do not know their names. On the other hand those who support my entry are out in the open we know their names and their qualifications. I may be from the old school but let me say that I never paid much attention to anonymous letters and attacks against my qualifications. I hope that Jim Wales and the senior editors of Wikipedia will see to it that my entry is judged fairly. With <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zariski_surfaces.html" title="Zariski surfaces">zariski surfaces</a> and ega 5 work firmly recognized by wikipedia and with my students such as <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Lang_d67f.html" title="Jeffrey Lang">Jeffrey Lang</a> having their own pages it makes very little sense to deny notability of my work and political activity. Thank you Dr Piotr Blass www.pblass.com www.piotrblass.com</p>
<p>ps:I just looked at some of the talk pages of critics and proponents of deletion I found sarcasm and hi fives and taking turns to criticise and delete. I am asking Jim Wales to look into this situation. I am sure that the truth will prevail. Best wishes to all Dr Piotr Blass</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's not nonsense, it appears in journal papers, so the cause of this AfD is simply wrong. Also, note that the entry is days old, and really not yet complete enough to be judged by the standards of typical WP entries. Should I have added a stub tag? I wrote the article as a separate entry because it is similar to both the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_spike.html" title="Ice spike">ice spike</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemon_battery.html" title="Lemon battery">lemon battery</a> articles: a household science mystery as well as a known physics lecture demonstration. Also, I've seen another Lasagna Battery paper in Journal of Chemical Education in late 1980s, but I don't have a copy myself. After a related topic came up on <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_Archives_Science_2007_January_2_197a.html#Metallic_taste" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk/Archives/Science/2007 January 2">WP:RD/SCI</a>, I found that WP had no existing info, Google shows no info on www, yet it's discussed on educator list servers and articles are available in paper journals. <b>Merge and redirect</b>, as an example of electrolytic corrosion in the kitchen, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvanic_cell.html" title="Galvanic cell">galvanic cell</a> isn't the best, nor is <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemon_battery.html" title="Lemon battery">lemon battery</a>, so possibly put it under <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathodic_protection.html" title="Cathodic protection">cathodic protection</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrificial_anode.html" title="Sacrificial anode">sacrificial anode</a>, or even group it with <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_spike.html" title="Ice spike">ice spike</a> under a larger entry on kitchen science mysteries. More important issue: this article is new. Perhaps I don't understand WP policies about stub-like articles, but aren't such articles usually given a chance to grow? Keep in mind that an article that's one minute old and one sentence long will certainly fail AfD if it's judged by the standards of typical articles. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 23:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I have to say, that I am not at all familiar with the term myself, and as I am a science teacher I am familar with many such cells. As User:Edison suggest there must be many terms for essentially the same phenomenon so <s>merging</s> may well be a better option althogh I'll offer no opnion as to which article it should be merged with.

<li>Perhaps the title is misleading. Both Theresa and Edison seem to think the article is about a cell. It's actually about the explanation of a household mystery; an "interesting everyday phenomenon." But this phenomenon already goes by the name "lasagna cell or battery," and it would be OP for me to coin a less misleading version such as "lasagna foil electrolysis" or something. There of course are hundreds of combinations such as "potato battery" which form electrolytic cells. But this entirely misses the point, because there are not hundreds of different explanations for why the aluminum foil cover on a pan of lasagna mysteriously becomes perforated. (There is one widespread incorrect explanation though. Some articles wrongly state that acids in tomato sauce are the source of the corrosion.) --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 21:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>keep</b> though I believe that maybe the proposer happened to see the article deleted by mistake. The majority of the region, North region of Brazil, where this airline is operating the airplane, is where the road is not maintained good in Brazil.

I think that the article on such a small/local airline is important for knowing things Airlines of Brazil, though, if talks about things of Japan, for instance, talks only about big airlines such as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_Airlines_e1cf.html" title="Japan Airlines">JAL</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Nippon_Airways_a11e.html" title="All Nippon Airways">ANA</a> might be almost enough...--<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorio_004e.html" title="User:Morio">Morio</a> 12:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It looks like I was mistaken in nominating this article for deletion. I've seen so many articles for bogus/insignificant businesses, I tend to be skeptical when I see an article that is only one sentence long. I would recommend putting a message on the talk page saying that this article is part of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Airlines_7d52.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Airlines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Airlines</a>.

<p>This article is unsourced and simply a list. On top of that, it assumes that 'atheism' is some form of systematic organized religion. Perhaps the author had intended the page to be about persecution by totalitarian governments? or by communist governments? or something along those lines? But in addition to the title problems, just look at the article for yourself and judge whether it is encyclopedic or not. The poor name choice, lack of citations, and lack of content/list format is enough for me to propose this deleition. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 17:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Sorry I did not mean to offend anyone I just thought that persecution was persecution. Atheism is a group like any other, that can be criticized.

<li>It's just that atheism itself is just a part of Communism. Atheism is also less specific than what we do in these cases. We don't do Historical persecution by agnosticism, Historical persecution by deism, etc. (I'm Catholic myself) Lastly the way you did it sounds grammatically wrong somehow. We have <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Christians_a939.html" title="Historical persecution by Christians">Historical persecution by Christians</a>, although it's in dispute, but we do not have Historical persecution by Christianity.

<li>I disagree one, some of the persecution done to the spectrum of religions under atheistic regimes was explicitly done because the state stated it was athiestic. Read some of the links like Russia for example. As for wording-Ok then lets reword the article to Historical persecution by athiests instead of deleting it. Why delete the article rather then collaborate to "fix" it. Also if you have examples of Historical persecution by agnosticism, Historical persecution by deism, etc please make articles with the sources and examples I support you if you have data.<a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 07:52, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>(1) "Atheism" is not a "group"; it is a philosophy, belief, etc. Beliefs do not engage in activities of any sort. <i>Atheists</i> or <i>atheist organizations</i> or <i>atheist states</i> can persecute. (2) However, I'm not sure that the intersection of atheism &amp; persecution is anything other than a trivial intersection; in other words, is it causal? or even correlated? If no evidence for either of those, then is the relation between establishment of religion (or non-religion) of interest enough that persecution by organizations / individuals is notably organized by religious belief?

<li>Lquilter, you should be aware that most atheists would claim that atheism is not a philosophy or belief either. It's simply the absence of theism. It's no more a philosophy than being "non-Christian" is a philosophy, or than "not believing in the soul" is a philosophy. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 18:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right Silence -- although I won't get into it here, I agree with you in terms of a formal definition of philosophy or belief. But from a practical day-to-day perspective, atheism operates as a belief <i>about</i> religion ... But again, not the place to get into it. The point is that, as others have pointed out, "Atheism" cannot persecute anybody. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 20:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I am equally unopposed. If you or anyone wants to do an article on oppressive theistic regimes in general, rather than specifying to one theistic religion, than that'd be fine. The only difficulty with both is that they'll be debate on what constitutes an "atheistic" or "theistic" regime, but if you can do it I'd have no objection.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>I agree with you, Silence, and Scjessey. This idea behind this article is to say that a lack of belief in deities resulted in religious persecution. It is saying that the primary reason of say Communist China's persecution of Tibetain Buddhist is because China doesn't believe in deities. We would need specific citations making this association instead of a vague list. I think it is very important to have article about religious persecution. Very important. But I do not believe 'persecution by atheism' is the best way to approach this. Even Allegations of presecution by atheism seems a bit much. It would make much more sense to identify the primary organizational affiliation doing the presecution (fascism, communism, etc).-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 18:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I was asked to look at this, but have not had time to examine the article in detail. But I would certainly say that the title needs to be fixed, and probably more.

<li>comment: "... in the name of ..." is not the best phrase, though, and is not what this article/list is getting at. "In the name of" denotes something done for and because of the thing. The connection in most (maybe all) of the specific list items is indirect at best. I do think it's okay to identify organizations (including governments) by their official doctrines, if balance or causality/correlation are demonstrated. So the Soviet Union can be called an "atheist government" the same way the UK can be called a "Christian government". --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 17:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I don't think the examples are parallel ... I was commenting on the current list ("... by atheism") and noting that "... in the name of ..." is just as problematic. ... As for "historical persecution by persons of X belief/characteristic/whatever", I think these are obviously wastes of time and may need a general look in the writing-about-people category. It should look at how to handle lists / articles that are about some specific characteristic and address issues of causality/correlation in the context of attacks on people by characteristic. ...The larger point is that it's obvious that this list is an attempt to capture the frequent criticism / attack on atheism that Stalin &amp; Hitler were atheists, and expand it as much as possible. To me, since that's an argument that a lot of people keep making, it's worth having it in wikipedia, and ultimately, I hope, annotating the list/article with explanations about why each entry is proferred and/or is inappropriate. I wouldn't therefore say necessarily to "delete" the article but it will need substantial reworking and retitling, and there needs to be comparable content on atrocities committed by institutions/orgs/states with various religious beliefs, in order to avoid POV problems; if that's not done, then it should be deleted. (Note, I'm certainly not saying I agree with the proposition that "atheists" or "atheist states" commit atrocities in a way that is somehow tied to atheism -- it's for the most part utter bunk, both historically and as a matter of semantics &amp; logic, but hopefully in a well-written article/list, these points would get made. In other words -- the article has been clearly started by someone with a POV but that doesn't mean there's not a germ of an important issue to be discussed. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 20:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unacceptably vague topic. As <i>atheism</i>, unlike Communism, is not a specific religion, organization, movement, or philosophy, compiling a list of persecution by atheists (or, in this case, by "atheism") amounts to a propagandic attack article. It would be like compiling a "Historical persecution by people with mustaches" on the grounds that Hitler and Stalin had mustaches; a more NPOV article would deal with persecution by <i>fascists</i> or by <i>communists</i>, not by atheists or people with mustaches, as there is no verifiable causal connection between them and the atrocities. Moreover, having a mustache or not believing in God is not centrally important to any of the people on such lists, suggesting there is an unstated agenda of attacking mustachioed, or atheistic, individuals in general by making such an article. Besides, it's an unacceptably vague and uninformative title; would you consider Historical persecution by theists to be remotely useful or neutral? Or, since <i>atheism</i> is a term defined by its negation with <i>theism</i>, would you consider Historical persecution by non-Christians to be acceptable? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 17:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just seems to me that if there are articles about persecutions done under religion that if it can be shown that persecutions where done under non-religion that would be balance. Of course reworking any article is a farcry from deleting it. As to all of the victims of the Orthodox church and the Buddhists of China and Tibet who where persecuted because the athiestic government made athiestic policies to against them, well you can deny and say that such things don't deserve recognition. It is plainly another to claim such statements are bias or slander or not true when they are a matter of public record and history.</li>

<dd>I honestly don't see the value of such a page. There is no legitimate scholarship that indicates a causation or important correlation between belief in God and historical persecution. (There are many studies that show an inverse correlation between religiosity and religious tolerance, but these are purely in a modern context, not a historical one, and deal with individuals, not regimes.) Endorsing such a correlation is neither neutral nor verifiable, and even gathering the data in such a format is tantamount to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research#Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position</a>.

<p>Is there a rule that mayors on Wikipedia must be from a city of more than 20,000? I had not heard of this 20,000 number until Jan. 15. Isn't any elected official notable in is locality? Is the test for notability in the person's local area, rather than statewide or national? It seems to me that each article has merit on its own and that there should not be some kind of rule about 20,000 population.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown had an unusual life story. He was mayor for only a year. The way his career ended may be as important as his career. This is local history, and there is a place for local history on Wikipedia.</p>

It would be strange if the museum, the alleged site where the weapon was used had no mention of it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 12:47, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Information about this knife could come only from Yugoslavia. Please don’t forget that Croatia was integral part of Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later after the World War Two Peoples Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia was never in war with Yugoslavia since later didn’t existed during occupation by Axis powers. Do we have to presume that the Jasenovac camp museum is only museum in the world that has reliable information about what happened in this concentration camp during World War Two? During war between ex Yugoslav states, Croatia went trough revival of Ustashi ideology which in many ways affected the comprehension of history of NDH and its crimes. I don’t believe that any museum in Croatia could be objective about Jasenovac and its significance. What I don’t understand is why facts presented on United States Holocaust Memorial Museum official website aren’t good enough to be used on Wikipedia. Do we have to presume that this museum couldn’t preserve objectivity or even that is spread false information about Holocaust. Is their criteria lower then the criteria of Wikipedia? I don’t think so. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarko_M_7cf8.html" title="User:Marko M">Marko M</a> 18:37, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The issue isn't whether United States Holocaust Memorial Museum official website is good enough - they would have accepted the information from the communist Yugoslav state in good faith. It's whether the original "Yugoslav" source is untainted.</dd>
<dd>Croatia was in conflict with Yugoslavia 3 times:
<ul>
<li>the first Yugoslavia was littered with ethnic conflict between the Croats &amp; the Yugoslav security structures dominated by Serbs, prompting protests about the Croats plight @ the League of Nations by intellectuals like Albert Eienstein. This continued until the formation of the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banovina_of_Croatia_1e8e.html" title="Banovina of Croatia">Banovina of Croatia</a>;</li>
<li>In WW2, the NDH security structures fought the remnants of the Yugoslav military (Serb <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chetnik.html" title="Chetnik">Chetniks</a>) as well as the communist dominated Partisans - the Partisans went on to form the second Yugoslavia. It was in their interest to portray their military &amp; idealogical enemies in the worst possible light, with the aim of increasing the size war reparations, but also to legitimize the Communist governments' role in saving the peoples of Yugoslavia from the horrors of nationalism. So various myths were invented, such as <a href="http://wap.macedonia.org/myth/eyes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://wap.macedonia.org/myth/eyes.html" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>. Hence the need for a multitude of reliable sources;</li>

<dd>Your choice of words shows your (1) reliance on propaganda and (2) lack of knowledge on the issue. (1) Referring to your reliance on propaganda, the fact that you called the Serbs 'Chetniks' yet failed to refer to the Croat forces as Nazis (which is precisely what they were, do not even attempt to argue against this) is strong proof of your desire to portray the Serbs in a negative light, while leaving out a very negative fact about the Croat forces of the time. Also, using famous people to support your argument shows weakness, and once again, the usage of a propaganda tool. Also, referring to the horrors of 'NAZISM' as the horrors of 'nationalism' is a big no-no. The military of Yugoslavia was trying to save its people from Nazism (torture/death-no this is not propaganda, it is a fact), not nationalism. (2) Secondly, the fact that when referring to the Yugoslav military, you mention the Cetniks as being the dominant part of it, and then say 'as well as the... Partisans', shows your lack of knowledge. My friend, the Cetniks formed the ROYAL Yugoslav army, while the Partisans the Communist Yugoslav army. They were never part of a single 'Yugoslav military' as you have phrased it (and hated each other, as I'm sure you must be aware of). If you were aware of this significant fact, you have proven your lack of attention to detail and the importance of phrasing oneself correctly. Therefore, please cease to include such irrelevant arguments, which make you look bad due to your use of propaganda (wording) and your disregard for detail/correct information.

<li>The Communist leadership was concerned about nationalism - you may want to read some of the marxist literature. The federal nature of second Yugoslavia was to reassure the smaller communities that the Greater Serbia hegemony of the first Yugoslavia would not be repeated, as well as a first step of overcoming <i>the nationalist opiate that had hindered the workers struggle for freedom</i>.

<dd>The term "Srbosjek" is also good known in the croatian realm, although no one really know what it is, but the word itself is know good enough, so I suppose neither the serbs know what this word _exactly_ describes, and if the knife on this picture _is_ really it, and if the knife was used _under this name_ in the concentraation camps, as the article suggests, i.e if the contents this article should be kept under this name. As of now, despite the many "Keeps", the connection between the actual article title, the existing word "Srbosjek" and its content (especially the pictures), has not been verified to put it into a internationally accessible encyclopedia as a verified fact when no one can verify it. -- <a href="../../../r/h/u/User%7ERhun_3352.html" title="User:Rhun">Rhun</a> 15:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Knowing history of USA I could claim with certainty that thousands of people were killed with Bowie knife. Of course, I need reliable source to verify this claim despite the fact that it’s historically correct. Problem with administration on most Wikipedias including this one is that administrators just won’t go further to resolve problem like this. True administrator would already be contacting United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. and starting enquiry about origins of photograph representing Srbosjek. What ever the outcome of this enquiry would be, it would surly benefit Wikipedia by confirming the content of this article or by denying it. The later outcome could lead to correction of information on the official site of US Holocaust Memorial Museum which would raise the reputation of Wikipedia. But who am I to teach you how to do your job.

<dd>Non-Yugoslav sources (that do not in turn reference Yugoslav sources) are needed to corroborate the Yugoslav sources.

<dd>You are voting for "keep" and at the same time acknowledging the lack of sources?? How does that work? Its not that the "Serbs" are a not reliable source, its the fact that we as of now dont have any third party aknowledging the authenticity of this word "Srbosjek" like we have for the genocide in Jasenovac. The Serbs and Croatians were engaged in a war and decades of mutual nationalistic hatred, and there was a _LOT_ of propaganda going on between them, so without third party review of the information (like for example, the books you cited) you just cant take it as a "proven fact" for an international encyclopedia. So how can you vote to "Keep" an article called "Srbosjek" when neither of your two pages mentioned above actually mentiones the word at all? I think its pretty clear what was happening at Jasenovac, and who was <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petar_Brzica_4a44.html" title="Petar Brzica">Petar Brzica</a>, but evidence is also needed for the word and article title itself. When the references only mention that the Jasenovac-knife was named "graviso", why should the article stay as "Srbosjek"? Thats the missing part. Linking more and more sites dealing with the atrocitiese at Jasenovac is useless, when they dont identify the knife as "Srbosjek".

<dd>I didn't say sources don't exist. I said there is a 'lack' of sources, also known as an 'insufficient' amount, aka: NOT ENOUGH, not 'not any at all'. And to add to that, most people believe there is a lack of sources because the sources are 'Yugoslavian' or 'Serbian' and therefore, considered unreliable (you yourself are an example of this, as you claim that two sources -serbian and croat- are unreliable and not sufficient, when we all know if the American gov't issued a statement, it would be accepted as truth almost immediately). The word need not be mentioned, when the picture, which is clearly identified by two entire peoples as the 'srbosjek' is included in the source. In addition, I have come across the term (along with a photo reference) in books, which I unfortunately do not have in my possession any longer so I cannot provide their names or find the page numbers to provide an exact reference, therefore, the references DO exist out there, there is no doubt about it. This is why I vote for <b>keep</b>. Please read more carefully, thanks&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStop_The_Lies_e29a.html" title="User:Stop The Lies">Stop The Lies</a> 20:11, 19 January 2007 (UTC)Stop_The_Lies</dd>

<dd>It is common practice with two war parties accusing each other of wartime atrocities to exaggregate the opponent's crimes and to hush up the own ones. The US itself does this all the time (genie weapons of mass destruction, kuwait babies torn from their incubators, concentration camps in kosovo, and so on), so I would take any of the news issued from the white house regarding someone theyre preparing a war on with a grain of salt. The same way I wouldnt trust any serbian or croatian accusing the opponent of some atrocity without _anybody_ neutral to this conflict verifying this. Example Jasenovac: the estimations on the number of victims go from 50.000 (croatian number) up to 600.000 (serbian number). Its fairly likely that the truth lies there in between, and that both sides try to fake the numbers in their "favor" still today and therefore are not to be trusted. So I acknowledge third party (like the USHMM) pictures of the knife, and a description of its usage as reliable, but wouldnt take the serbian-only sources as facts, when in this 60 years since the WW2 _NOBODY_ not even the jewish holocaust organisations cared to verify those sources. Thankfully, as you see, we have now gathered almost complete information about the knife, its usage, Brzica, but still lack _verification_ of the name. Its not enough having _one_ war party accusing the other side of war crimes, and writing books about it, you also need a third, neutral and unbiased party verifying those. Its a basic scientific principle. Hypothesis leading to third party verification. So it would be nice having someone verify that this glove knife was actually called srbosjek there in Jasenovac, and that it isnt a common croat or serb word made up earlier or later and used for any type of knife, so having "entire two people" claiming they reckognize it from somwhere, but not being able to back it up, is, like you said, not enough.

<dd>Perfect, I am glad all this information has been found, thank you for all of your help. Now the article can be saved. There is no basis for a deletion of an entire article due to a dispute over its name. Many articles have their names disputed, but it would be absurd to delete them entirely for that reason. Therefore, the article can only result in <b>keep</b>. So, it appears there is a dispute regarding the name of the knife, but not its usage. Its usage was clear: to cut Serbs. Therefore, if 'Srbosjek' is a disputed term, perhaps some names for the article might be 'Ustasa Knife', 'WWII Ustasa Knife', 'Knife-formerly-known-as-srbosjek", OR we can simply call it 'The WWII Knife used to Cut Serbs' (referring to its use), in which case, we might as well call it 'Serb-cutter', or better yet, stick with the original, 'Srbosjek'. Anyone have any ideas for names, which I have not mentioned? <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStop_The_Lies_e29a.html" title="User:Stop The Lies">Stop The Lies</a> 08:47, 20 January 2007 (UTC)Stop_The_Lies

<dd>Given the gulf b/w what the sources say &amp; what was written, then deletion of the article seems warranted. Also scrutiny of any purported sources is required since the srbosjek has the hall marks of propaganda, and given the sources to date come from a opposing side in a war. I can't help but notice that most comments on here claim the Srbosjek as a reality by virtue of anecdotal or faith factors, but very few reliable sources have been provided. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 09:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"hall marks of propaganda"??? The only way you can claim that the srbosjek has ONE "hallmark" of propaganda is in its name. Which may or may not be true. We were not there when the Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies were killed at Jasenovac with the tool, so we cannot say if the term was coined AT THE TIME it was used, or later. Other than that, you have no argument. Please contribute to Wikipedia by providing what you think is an appropriate name for the tool, given the sources. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStop_The_Lies_e29a.html" title="User:Stop The Lies">Stop The Lies</a> 10:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)Stop_The_Lies

<dd>You mean Serbs, Jews, Gypsies &amp; <i>Croats</i> who were killed at Jasenovac. There is no evidence of a specific knife designed for killing concentration camp inmates. It's on the propaganda radar b/c it is as ridiculous as if someone was to claim that Srebrenica's Muslim victims were killed by a specially designed gun called something obscure. And you would not doubt be going, but it's a gun. Likewise with this alleged knife - some victims were killed by a bullet, others by a knife, other yet again by a mallet, then others were worked to death or were allowed to starved and others hanged. Incidently, questioning the notion of the Srbosjek doesn't diminish the suffereing or existence the victims in those camps. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 14:38, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS: User:Marinko (also known as 'iruka') I will do my best to refrain from answering your replies, consider this a reply to everything you have just said and will in the future. You almost blamed me for trolling, yet it is you who is trolling. You blamed me for ignoring your arguments in my replies, which I didn't, when it is you who ignores my arguments in your replies (again and again), and goes off on a tangent to argue something very irrelevant to this talk page. And it seems one of your MAIN arguments is that MYTHS WERE CREATED, THEREFORE THIS MUST BE A MYTH AS WELL... Great argument, my friend! Wait no.. not really, you're sounding a lot like Descartes (when he determined the only truth is he thinks therefore he exists). Also, something so simple, where you mentioned that during WWII Yugoslavia fought Croatia, I agreed with you 100%, but since I mentioned that Croatia was at the time a Nazi puppet state, this was obviously not to your liking, so you decided to add that Yugoslavia fought against Croatia at other times, when Croatia was not a Nazi state (which is arguable), when you had ALREADY MADE THAT CLAIM, and I did not argue it there! This shows a personal bias, and that your arguments should be read very cautiously by other users. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStop_The_Lies_e29a.html" title="User:Stop The Lies">Stop The Lies</a> 21:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)Stop_The_Lies</dd>

<dd>No it doesn't. Despite the fact that either:
<dl>
<dd>1) Piff133's only edits to Wikipedia is this AFD</dd>
<dd>2) 63.199.243.254 "forged" a signature (I doubt he tried to forge it, he was probably logged out and commented under his IP)</dd>
<dd>3) Or that Piff1333 and Pogonrudie/63.199.243.254 may be the same user. Either way, I still think the band deserves an article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But I do suggest that we slap a {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}} template on it so that people interested will cleanup an expand what we do have. Some of the comments above make it seem like we are possibly missing information on this band that may be worth noting. If you like, whenever I get the chance, I will try to work on it myself. <i>semper fi</i> — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 12:31, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is wikipedia, not wikiquote.

There was no reason to create this spinout article, and no prior discussion. Furthermore, it is extremely POV. Every quote is a puff piece about Jesus. Is it really representative of the non_Christian view of Jesus? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 18:56, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

It talks about how one group of people views Jesus. You can't have a NPOV article that discusses how people view a topic. The Christian POV (view) of Jesus is very different from the Jewish POV (view) of him.

<li><b>Comment</b> - just because we do not have another article by this title does not mean we do not have this content. The Religious views article covers the Christian and many non-Christian POVs. Then we have the series on Jesus and History which covers the scholarly/historian/secular POV. I believe because of existing content, there is no need for this specific spinout article. Furthermore, look and read the current article. If we transwikified the quotes to wikiquote, what would we be left with? And do the quotes actually represent tha various non-Christian POVs on Jesus? Or just selected quotes of non-Chrsitians saying good things about him? The reason why I am commenting is in reply to your post at <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_56ae.html" title="Talk:Jesus">Talk:Jesus</a>. I wanted to keep all the discussion centralized.

<li>I realize now that I wasn't being clear at all before. There should be an article "Non-Christian views of Jesus." But I do believe what is currently in the article does not belong. My point by bringing up the Christian Views of Jesus was to show that most of the content in that article is covered in other articles as well, but we still have it to organize it into one article. I believe that we can do the same with "Non-Christian views of Jesus." <a href="../../../g/o/a/User%7EGoalie1998_cc91.html" title="User:Goalie1998">Goalie1998</a> 23:39, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Topic is too specialized for inclusion in a general purpose encyclopedia such as Wikipedia. It is a slang term that is easily verifiable as it is widely used in significant parts of the the firearms community in the US, especially among the blogging part of the firearms community, but which hasn't become notable outside this rather narrow use. Topic thus currently fails the general <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> criteria for WP. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 04:29, 18 January 2007 (UTC) <s><b>Strong keep</b>. It is a common term on many gun mailing lists that are not simply of regional interest. Is Wikipedia only a free rendition of a semi-commercial encyclopedia, or should it be more powerful than this, capturing a wider, more pithy range of expressions, argot, and jargon, in addition to capturing more widely spread slang terminologies? If we are only duplicating the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, or wish to censure the content of Wikipedia, then clearly <i>doctor gun</i> doesn't belong in Wikipedia. On the other hand, if we are capturing the admittedly more fringe elements of society, with their rich argot, then there is value in capturing "doctor gun" as well. We have an opportunity to be much more powerful than commercial encyclopedias, if we so choose. Wikipedia is also not supposed to be censured. As for citing a google or yahoo search, as google and yahoo routinely censure many topics dealing with firearms, using such a search is often not an accurate indication of usage of many firearm terms. However, if one does a blog search, one can see there are moderately common usages of the term. Unfortunately, none of them can be cited here because their URLs automagically trigger the blacklisted spam filter and are auto-blocked on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 03:30, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</s></li>

<li>Yaf, I do appreciate the correction in the regional bit, but my&#160;!vote still stands. I encourage you to change our minds, but keep in mind that there must be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> that reaches outside of the focus (firearms, in this case), and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> per the terms on that link.

<p>Not every Civil War soldier is encyclopedic. This article, proffered by an apparent relative, is a doubtful case regarding notability at best. His service is unexceptional; his (I assume) prominent relative doesn't make him notable. The only thing that even brings him close to notability is that he dictated his experiences of the Monitor/Merrimac battle, and that account doesn't seem greatly relied on by historians. I found it on a long list of references about the Monitor. <a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 19:48, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>KEEP</b>. The raw vote totals are 4 Delete, 2 Keep, 6 Merge, with two Keep or Merge. Since I <i>don't</i> want to merge the article (see below), I'll use the discretion granted by the latter two and count those as Keep, giving 4-4-6 as the Delete-Keep-Merge totals. There is clearly no numberical consensus to delete, and the Delete arguments are not made strongly, mostly being variations of "per nom", although the nominator does make a good case.</p>
<p>As to merging: first of all, some of the Merge votes are "merge with something", which hardly really counts; the merge target seemed to eventually focus on <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a>. I don't see this as a good merge target, at all. If this material doesn't deserve its own article, how does it deserve pride of place in an important article such as Windows XP. Merging it into <i>that</i> article would be a significant <i>promotion</i> of the material, and I don't think that all of the Merge commentors thought that through. Further, Windows XP is an important article that potentially contains or could contain a lot of important material, yet has to be kept down to size. Merging in this material would potentially force the removal (or the non-addition) of more important material. The material could perhaps be severely redacted before the merge, but it's not clear to me how to do this, what material could be deleted; it all seems of more or less equal importance. This could be a failure of imagination on my part. Anyway, I don't see Merge as a good result.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don't want to wimp out with a No Consensus. Ten of fourteen commentors thought that the masterial should be retained in some fashion, and that, along with no great weakness of arguments, leads to a Keep result. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep or Merge into... something</b> - While the exact term "FCKGW" was not covered in the media directly (probably for legal reasons) the fact that a copy of Windows XP was pirated more than a month before its official release was. This article would probably work best as a section of an article on Windows piracy, or Microsoft PR nightmares, or something along those lines; while it is a notable event, it is probably not notable enough for its own article. As to the notability of "FCKGW" specifically, Microsoft <i>specifically</i> banned any serial keys containing that string for <i>all</i> their products, even Office. It may be hard to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a>, but the act has promoted "FCKGW" to notable status in many circles. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 23:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I can see obvious reasons FCKGW would be banned as being part of a key having nothing to do with piracy (fill in the missing letter U, as appropriate). But is that really a notable event? Everyone has blacklists and I'm sure Microsoft has other strings that they blacklist from being in their product keys as well. As for the piracy ... in my college days, having a copy of a program before it was released was nothing. Guys on my hall played <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Empires_84ac.html" title="Age of Empires">Age of Empires</a> for a month or so before it came out. (Obviously, now, I have different values and opinions than I did at the time.) I don't know ... maybe it's a minor internet meme or something ... but it just sounds like a warez group wanting to promote itself. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>At the time it was definitely notable, as it affected numerous other pieces of software that (arguably) had not been pirated with that key. As far as being a warez group promoting itself, that would be unnecessary, given that the group received all the attention it could ever want via media coverage of the initial piracy incident. "FCKGW" was just the most memorable part of the key they used. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 01:06, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

All the beta testers - public and private (few hundred thousand), plus every Microsoft employee/contractor/vendor (about 200,000 people), so having a copy of XP before it was "released" was pretty boring.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The problem with that is that those sources (OEIS in particular) aren't discriminating. It'd be like claiming someone was notable based on being in three different phone books. Any academic topic that is anything like notable will have a dozen articles in journals--they've a very low standard for entry, really. It's true that lack of journal articles doesn't automatically disqualify something--but it's a good indicator that the thing isn't notable, in the absence of news stories or books on the subject. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 14:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Although the OEIS does accept a lot these days, notice that the sequence of Smarandache-Wellin numbers has a relatively low A-number, and that the entry has five paper references, five Web links, and Mathematica and PARI programs.
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. It does not have "five paper references". It has three. One additional item is the Pomerance item mentioned above; another is Smarandache's own collected works;. Of the three other references, two are to the "Smarandache Notions Journal", which is published by Smarandache. The last is from Abstracts of the American Mathematical society, which means that the paper was not published, but that the author wished to announce his result. Such abstracts are brief summaries of paper content; some, but not all of the papers were presented at AMS annual or sectional meetings. -- <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominus_070e.html" title="User:Dominus">Dominus</a> 20:55, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's true that not everything that ends up in the OEIS might be encyclopaedic (although I can't say with certainy either way), but I think that these definitely are. They're mentioned in a mathematical textbook, they're listed at Weisstein's site (Mathworld), and they're discussed on other websites; of course they're not as important a concept as, say, Hilbert spaces, but the claim that the concept is "non-notable and mathematically trivial" is simply and obviously wrong. Furthermore, I think we'd do well to keep in mind that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopaedia</a>: we can afford to have entries even on relatively obscure topics, so long as they're important in *some* way, and these certainly are. -- <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchneelocke_ee99.html" title="User:Schneelocke">Schnee</a> (<i><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchneelocke_54a1.html" title="User talk:Schneelocke">cheeks clone</a></i>) 13:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If this was a paper encyclopedia of general knowledge, I'd have to vote delete. But if this was a paper encyclopedia of mathematics, I'd have to vote keep. As it happens, there is a paper encyclopedia of mathematics that has an entry on Smarandache-Wellin numbers, the <i>CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics</i>, the paper forerunner to Mathworld.

<p>Editors have resisted suggestion to add sources. The article reads like OR and is basically a platform for a (admittedly recently coined) neologism.

<p>Fails to establish notability. He was a trainee journalist for The Guardian until he got fired. Big deal. Normally I would suggest merging into <a href="../../../h/i/z/Hizb_ut-Tahrir_ba47.html" title="Hizb ut-Tahrir">Hizb ut-Tahrir</a>, but the page already mentions him and the incident that resulted in his firing.

<li><b>Keep</b>. KazakhPol has nominated this for deletion because he tried and failed to have Category:Terrorism in Britain added to the page. He is on a mission to call people associated with <a href="../../../h/i/z/Hizb_ut-Tahrir_ba47.html" title="Hizb ut-Tahrir">Hizb ut-Tahrir</a>, an Islamist group, "terrorists," although the group has no known links to terrorism. Aslam was fired by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> over his membership of the group because it is regarded as antisemitic, not because it's involved in terrorism. K-Pol has been disrupting Hizb ut-Tahrir for some time, routinely calling editors who disagree with him "liars" and "vandals," and this nom is part of the same pattern of disruption. Aslam's case is a significant one. A major newspaper firing a journalist because of the political party he belongs was an issue that made the news in the UK at the time, and it is still discussed. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1. This nomination has nothing to do with categories. 2. I removed references to HuT as a terrorist organization earlier today. 3. HuT's ties to terrorism are irrelevant to this discussion. 4. If you read The Guardian's statement you will see they said it incited violence against Jews, not just that it was antisemitic. 5. The accusation that I am disrupting HuT is ludicrous. SV needs to distinguish between editing disagreements and disruption. 6.

It seems that Javaid acted as a civil liberties legal observer of a fundamentalist group which may have subsequently exaggerated their relationship with him for their own credibility. Javaid's position in the race relations forum (which he was given in spite of the "scandal") is not especially notable - there are ~28 other members, and it doesnt seem to be a particularly important government body - it meets every few months to offer advice to the Home Secretary and that seems to be it. I would argue that there is no <i>ex officio</i> encyclopedic notability from being Head of Legal at the Commission for Racial Equality - this is not a particularly high bureaucratic position.

<p>Makbool Javaid is a prominent lawyer and an active islamist campaigner, who was a founder of the well known radical islamist group, Al Muhajiroun. He signed a fatwa calling for "the Muslims around the world, including the Muslims in the USA and in Britain, to confront by all means whether verbally, financially, politically or militarily the US and British aggression and to do their Islamic duty in relieving the Iraqi people from the unjust sanctions".</p>
<p>These are matters of public interest, and Makbool Javaid is an important lawyer and islamist political activist. This page should stay.</p>
<p>Al Muhajiroun are admirers of Osama Bin Laden. However, to suggest that he is or was a "supporter" is implicit in his association with that group, and is not of central relevance.</p>
<p>Al Muhajiroun members have been invoved in terrorism. However, Al Muhajiroun is not a terrorist organisation. It is wrong to suggest that a member of Al Muhajiroun is necessarily a supporter of terrorism. What we say about Makbool Javaid's political and religious beliefs should be limited to what is verifiable about him. <i>User:Bukhari please sign your posts</i></p>

<li><u><b>Strong delete</b></u> Bukhari, Please sign your posts. Mr Javaid was not a founder of the group, and was not a member. This article could be considered libel, and as stated before he agreed an <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_of_court_settlement.html" title="Out of court settlement">out of court settlement</a> in his libel case against the british, mainly <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloid</a>, newspapers. He seems to be a victim of <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensationalism.html" title="Sensationalism">sensationalism</a>, and a desire to attack government quango's by proxy, because he was linked to one. A google group chat forum is not a credible reference as to who signed what over 5 years ago, so there currently is not credible referenced claim that he signed that fatwa. It seems that Al-Muhajiroun got a bit over-zealos in exagerating their link to him, possibly even falsifying their link for their own ends. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 12:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, you know, I'm trying to find a nice way to say "this article is a pile of shit" and "trivia" is the best I've come up with. If there is not a specific document here that says "articles in an encyclopedia should be encyclopedic" then perhaps there should be, but to my mind it kinda goes without saying that an encyclopedia article should be encyclopedic and if it's not encyclopedic it has no place here. As for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, I've read it, thanks. "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia" seems like a pretty clear endorsement that things that aren't suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia should be deleted. So to sum up, this article is a pile of shit that doesn't belong in an encyclopedia...in other words, a list of presidents arranged by order of height is unencyclopedic, trivial and indiscriminate. If having the heights of presidents outside of their own articles is by some stretch of the imagination a worthwhile topic, then <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heights_of_United_States_presidential_candidates_fb65.html" title="List of heights of United States presidential candidates">List of heights of United States presidential candidates</a> does it much better by actually including the heights of the presidents and their opponents and sourcing the information and the discussion of the "the taller guy wins" meme. Which not only makes this article useless shit but <i>redundant</i> useless shit. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:03, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Your argument is entirely circular, and without any foundation in policy. According to your argument, the article doesn't belong because it is "unencyclopaedic", but your only definition of "unencyclopaedic" is "I personally think that it's a pile of shit that doesn't belong here.". Wikipedia doesn't employ that as a deletion criterion, for obvious reasons. The correct definition of "unencyclopaedic" is "not in accordance with all of our content policies". You have failed to reference a single one that supports the deletion of this article. (Whereas, in contrast, it can be shown that the content is both verifiable and not original research.) You've quoted one sentence that isn't by itself a reason for deletion, since the very next sentence, which you didn't quote, explains that the actual policy is the list that follows. Once again: Please read what the policy actually says. It is quite specific. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It might be possible to expand the article to include year of birth, and present two lists: one sorted by month/day of the year, and another sorted by birth year/month/day. If you also threw in year of death, you'd have an interesting set of tables that show relative age of each president, puts their births and deaths in historical context to each other, and that might provide some insight into how presidents born in similar years share certain cultural or philosophical traits. So while I agree that the article as is doesn't have much to offer besides a reader saying "Oh look, Harry Truman and my brother have the same birthday!", I think an expansion using birth and death years might offer some possibly useful historical information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:29, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
