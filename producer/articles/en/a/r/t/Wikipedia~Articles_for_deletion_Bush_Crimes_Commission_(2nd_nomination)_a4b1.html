<li><b>Comment</b>. I can't speak for the whole delete side, but I can tell you my own thoughts, which are this: (1) the BCC is an extremely small, partisan off-shoot of another already small partisan group (Not in Our Name), and as such, doesn't get much notice from the press, so there's no way to verify through reliable sources what it is that they say and do; (2) because of this lack of notability, almost anything that's said about them is original research or POV pushing from persons that agree with the political slant of the group; (3) because of (1) and (2), the article doesn't attract enough editors to keep it NPOV. As such, the article will always be dominated by NION and Bush Crimes Commission supporters, endlessly pushing their POV. In my opinion, it's better to delete those kinds of articles because they will never be encyclopedic, and therefore don't belong on WP. I would say the same thing about any highly political article where the ideas presented in the article are non-notable and stridently advanced by a small group. Wikipedia seems to be replete with those kinds of articles. I don't think that WP will truly work as a project until we have found a mechanism for controlling advocacy-planting, and am open to your ideas. As to the keep argument, I can't speak for it. Consider both sides, and the goals of Wikipedia, and vote as you see fit.

<dd><b>comment</b>: Interesting criterion, but the corporate media is complicit in the deceptions and coverups that have defined the modus operandi of the Bush Administration. There is plenty of attention being paid to the Bush Crimes Commission, and that attention has played a noteworthy part in the escalating drumbeat that is finally beginning to pierce the veil of corporate mass media's silence regarding Bush's crimes. These crimes are increasingly viewed as treasonous by many observers, and if the drumroll calling for censure and impeachment continues to escalate, thanks in part to the Bush Crimes Commission, Bush may finally be drummed out of office. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 19:24, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b>: A number of organizations collaborated to put the Bush Crimes Commission together. The high ranking officials and well known activists and organizations which participated evidence both great notability and the broad range of alleged crimes being scrutinized. The Bush Crimes Commission has diligently performed a job which the lobbyist-plagued US legislatures have been unwilling and unable to perform. It is interesting that after congress shirked its responsibility, the efforts to investigate and expose what the Bush Administration has perpetrated (largely through deception) is itself portrayed by Morton devonshire as propaganda. Along the same lines, it is remarkable that this AfD has been proposed on a week when the asleep-at-the-wheel media establishment is finally beginning to report on the widespread propaganda, election fraud and political ploys that have been orchestrated by the Bush Administration (e.g., the intentional 'leak' of classified documents aimed at discrediting <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valerie_Plame_dd1f.html" title="Valerie Plame">Valerie Plame</a>'s husband; the fact that the Administration had just received, claissified and shelved a report dismissing the possibility that two small trailers were actually WMD equipment, yet went ahead days later claiming to have found their justification for 'preemptive war'; and that the top GOP election official for New England has been shown to have communicated frequently with the White House during the vote fraud campaign in 2004 that secured another term in office for Bush, an outcome that was even more clearly the result of full press, across the board, systematic undermining of the voting system, which produced obviously fabricated results in each of the last two presidential election cycles). This AfD is just a matter of gaming the system and an attempt to impose upon the Wiki the same propagandistic mindset that has corrupted mass media in the US. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 21:44, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b> Irrelevant and too obscure to deserve attention in an encyclopaedia. I'm heavily into politics, especially with this being an election year, and I've never heard of this.

We should respect the right of thinkers and writers to discuss. There is grave concern across the globe concerning the conduct of the Bush administration and there is enough evidence to warrent discussion. Enormously more evidence than was used to warrent invasions. These concerns about the legality of Bush policy do exist and are evidenced enough to deserve a place in our wikipedia. Those that say delete, please ask yourselves, 'Do you love freedom, or would you prefer to delete these thoughts?' Most people that would ask these questions are asking them about administration, not America. Discussion about 'administration' help us, who are outside the States yet inside the sphere of direct effect, to seperate from over-generalized and close-minded anti-American sentiment.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> To point out what should be obvious, that simply isn't true. A mock trial held in a law school classroom does not typically try the POTUS. It does not get reported in newspapers or in blogs, or get broadcast on the radio and TV. It does not have notable people involved with it. The BCC is clearly more notable. It is correct that it has not more authority than a classroom trial, but lack of authority is not a reason to delete. The discussion in this AFD would be more valuable if people gave valid reasons for their choices. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 15:58, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>While a mock trial in a law school classroom might not typically try Bush in absentia, as this commission has chosen to do, it certainly could. If this was strange enough to be commented on in a few local papers, or picked up on for brief comment by a few partisan news broadcasters, would it make the mock trial notable? Personally, I'd say no. A small smattering of news coverage does not make notability... if that were all it took, there could be Wikipedia pages for hundreds and hundreds of pets that had vaguely interesting experiences in small towns or on slow news days. As this commission is not sanctioned by anyone, has no power, and really does nothing but voice criticism, an argument could be made for their simple existence being notable, but not so that it would merit its own article, but at most a footnote in some other one. Criticising a President is hardly new, nor does dressing it up with some play-acting make it notable. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 19:58, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And you seem to be missing the point. Arguing that the article should be deleted because it is supposedly 'propaganda' appears to be an example of doublespeak, or what psychologists would call projection of the Bush Administration's faults as faults of the Bush Crimes Commission. As for the Commission's notability, the fact that many top level officials and high profile anti-war and anti-Bush Administration organizations came together to expose the propaganda, lies, deceit and crimes of the Bush Administration is extremely noteworthy, especially given the growing momentum of the Bush censure and impeachment movements, triggered in part by the Commission, and the concurrent plummet in approval ratings for Bush. In fact, the Bush Crimes Commission has obviously played a significant role in the consolidation of the movements, while helping bring focus to the staggering breadth and depth of crimes perpetrated abroad and against Americans at home. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 21:25, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only question AFD is intended to answer is whether the subject matter - the Commission in this case - deserves an article. The criteria is not "what editors think of the subject" or of the Commission, not personal views on Bush and politics, but whether studied dispassionately, it is encyclopedic and notable. Arguments that it is biased, or politically slanted, are arguments to correct an article and write it better. They are not arguments to delete it. The question can be framed relatively simply: Does the subject matter exist (is it <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>)? If so, is it notable and deserving of an article? The fact that it is an informal group, that relatively few people may look at it, are <i>not</i> arguments that it is non-notable, because relatively few people look up many obscure articles. Within its own field - the Bush, crime allegations, impeachment and similar controversies, is the Commission likely to be considered interesting or notable, or otherwise valuable, to the people looking up related issues on Wikipedia? At the risk of restating what should be obvious, <b>that</b> is closer to the issue. Not whether the article is politically this way or the other, or who wrote it, or who thinks what of Bush.</p>

<dd>To echo your point, as Ben said, it's not a vote.

<p>The bottom line is if it was nominated for AFD before and passed it shouldn't be up for a vote again. That's like continuing elections until your candidate wins or you get the outcome you're looking for. I think everyone stated their cases here except for the various votes for delete that had no reason for deletion which I don't understand why a person can't express why it should or shouldn't be deleted. Regardless if it already passed AFD and was renominated then all of this is irrelevant because it has passed before. We can't keep nominating articles until we get the outcome we want. Aeon explained that he didn't ooriginally nominate and wants to withdraw, it is not too late for that. Especially since it has already passed AFD before.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElohimgenius_7400.html" title="User:Elohimgenius">Gnosis</a> 15:14, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia isn't an election, though. As has been pointed out several times, this isn't even an actual democratic voting measure... it's a chance for people to make their case against it or for it. If people can continue to make a case against it, it can continue to be nominated for removal. If it is a strong article and conforms to Wikipedia's guidelines, it should be in no danger. However, if it is a weak article on a non-notable subject, as people argue, then the first AFD was simply in error and this is correcting that error. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 19:49, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
