<li>Nothing was undeleted. The article was properly recreated after I speedily deleted the contentless and unhelpful subsubsubsubsubstub that had been created.

<li>FWIW, if the article was only <i>It's located in Portland, Maine</i> (and indeed it does look like a Maoririder article), then I agree with the speedy delete. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 18:01, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I believe it was undeleted and merged. The history shows no deletions, although FCY Travis' premature speedy is in the log. This premature speedy shows that people <i>must</i> do some research before pressing that button. That a stub may be uninformative in itself is abolutely no excuse at all. Without a stub there is nothing upon which most of us--particularly the vast majority of us who would not be aware of the school's existence without the stub--can base our research and expand the stub. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:51, 6 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There was nothing premature about it. My speedy deletion was based on the fact that it was a very short article with no context - speediable under CSD criteria 1.2.1. The history for <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland_High_School_c958.html" title="Portland High School">Portland High School</a> shows five deleted edits. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:44, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're not the only person to use an extremely questionable interpretation of the "no context" clause. Of course it had context, it stated clearly that Portland High School was in Portland, Maine. With that context the stub was expandable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:53, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would've tagged it for deletion even if it wasn't a one sentence stub. Schools aren't inherently noteworthy. And before anyone even gets started, I know that Wikipedia isn't paper, but it's also not a junkyard.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'll be watching your taggings carefully for a while. There is no CSD for a school article on grounds of non-notability. You were right to bring this to VfD. It would have made more sense to do some research--it's what you're supposed to be here for. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:55, 6 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You appear to have misunderstood. I'm well aware that there's no CSD for non-notability. I tagged the article for speedy deletion, and that request was favorably acted upon, because the original article had no content other than "It's located in Portland, Maine." What I was referring to was the fact that I personally believe that the majority of articles regarding schools do not belong on Wikipedia due to the fact that while education is inherently notable, the buildings where instruction occurs are not. It would've made more sense to actually read my statement before commenting -- it's what admins are supposed to be here for. -<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 22:22, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wrongly speedied articles, particularly schools, are always resurrected (I should know, I usually do it myself). It is wrong to speedy an article on a school solely because it only correcly locates the school--that is all we need to expand it. I'm taking the liberty of moving the school building/homeschooling debate to the talk page of this VfD. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:01, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
