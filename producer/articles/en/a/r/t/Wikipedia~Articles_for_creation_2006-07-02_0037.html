<p>THis article is related to warhammer 40k.</p>
<p>Shas'o Viorla Shovah Kaius Montyr (or Farsight if translated) was thought to be the greatest <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau.html" title="Tau">Tau</a> commander of his time, famous for his fight against the <a href="../../../o/r/k/Orks.html" title="Orks">Orks</a>. He was favored by the great Ethereals, leaders of the Tau, and was trusted to lead their most crucial campaigns.</p>
<p>After years of expanding h their empire, the Tau became enemies of the Imperium of man, resulting in great battles between the two races, among them, the Damocles Gulf Crusade.</p>
<p>O’Shavah was entrusted with leading the force at Damocles Gulf and had done an amazing job, bringing the humans to their knees. Eventually he defeated his opponent, scattering the survivors in terror. He was to be greeted back a T’au as a hero, but he never came.</p>
<p>As soon as the war was over he led his men to the other side of the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau_Empire_63b0.html" title="Tau Empire">Tau Empire</a> and began selling their services as mercenaries. No one is so sure what went through O’Shavah’s mind when he did it. Some say he was possessed by a daemon that turned him to the forces of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos.html" title="Chaos">Chaos</a>. Some say a <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyranid.html" title="Tyranid">Tyranid</a> planted seeds in his body, taking him over, and forcing him to serve the <a href="../../../h/i/v/Hive_Mind_1688.html" title="Hive Mind">Hive Mind</a>. Some say that once it was over, O’Shavah looked out into the battlefield, seeing the terror that his people brought, and thus seceded from the Empire.</p>
<p>Believing he had lost O’Shavah to the darkness, Aun’Va placed the young Commander Shadowsun as leader of the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau.html" title="Tau">Tau</a> army, making her the first female general in the history of the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau_Empire_63b0.html" title="Tau Empire">Tau Empire</a>.</p>
<p>O’Shavah and his soldiers have been sighted all over the galaxy, but always disappearing without a trace, leaving the question to the Ethereals: is he friend or foe?--Daniel Christie</p>

I do not actually have an article about flamboyant trees also called framboyan, I beleive that comes from the creole french. I was on the site looking up the tree, I always thought it was the same as the "Mimosa" tree but I had a disscussion with a Hatian freind and he informed me I was wrong. I would like to know what a framboyan tree is and what it looks like.I have always been told that the VOODOO tribes in Haiti beleive that it carries magical properties, but I have searched the internet and could not confirm this nor could I confirm what exactly the framboyan tree is. I do not know if this is where you would ask such a question but I am trying it. any info you have you can send here dustygrimes@yahoo.com thanks</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Kioko Satou</i> – A 17-year-old immature senior at Mousaki High School in Japan, she can be gluttonous at times but has no trouble dealing with her weight. She likes to read, but prefers shouen-ai manga over everything else. Her boyfriend is <i>Benjiro</i>, and despite her wandering eyes for bishounen she is still loyal to him. Her other friends are <i>Su-Sihn</i>, <i>Jerolin</i>, and <i>Mina</i>. First appears on Page 5 of Chapter 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Benjiro Takahashi</i> – Benjiro, 17, is <i>Kioko’s</i> boyfriend. He sees no problem in the relationship except for the few months’ age difference. He could be jealous at times, especially when <i>Kioko</i> ogles at other guys, but he knows that she is still loyal to him. But he also has a secret (which most people know about anyway), every time he experiences a strong emotion (love, pain, fear, etc) he turns into a catboy! That is all thanks to <i>Meu-Cu</i>, the mischievous cat demon. When Benjiro was 7 and was playing roughly with a cat, Meu-Cu sought to teach him a lesson by putting a spell on him. Unfortunately, <i>Meu-Cu</i> forgot to take the spell off! First appears on Page 5 of Chapter 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Jerolin Nakamura</i> – Jerolin, 18, is the most mysterious of the seniors. He has a natural talent for poetry, philosophy, and history. His mind-set is that of a general but with the attitude of a saint. But what is most interesting about Jerolin is his family history, for he is of human, elf, vampire, and werewolf descent. Thanks to this he is very skilled and agile, making him the best swordsman in the school. But his parentage also comes with a dark side: for once a month he must go into hiding because he turns into a monster. However, <i>Su-Sihn</i> helps him by brewing a potion that prevents the transformations. He spends his free time training to become a <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kensai.html" title="Kensai">Kensai</a>. First appears on Page 9 of Chapter 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Su-Sihn Matsumoto</i> – Su-Sihn, 18, is a senior with a marvelous writing talent. Her genres of choice are fantasy and horror that rarely end happily. She has a very vivid imagination, so much so that she has 35 imaginary friends who are bats (this completely baffles the school psychologist). After school Su-Sihn practices her witch-craft and sorcery in her parents’ basement. Her powers have gotten her out of, and sometimes into, awkward situations. On the side for extra profit she sells potions and brews. First appears on Page 7 of Chapter 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Mina Smith</i> – 15-year-old Mina moved from Ohio, USA to Japan because of her father’s job outsourcing. It wasn’t easy adjusting to a new life. For one she could barely understand Japanese and the fact that she is taller than everyone in her freshman class. When she’s not trying to decipher her schoolwork she enjoys playing video games and writing fanfiction. Although she is friends with <i>Kioko</i>, Mina is often disturbed by her love for shouen-ai manga. The only thing she’s afraid of is spiders. First appears on Page 1 of Chapter 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Meu-Cu</i> – Meu-Cu is an ancient cat-demon who randomly appears to cause mischief. The only people who can actually see him are <i>Benjiro</i> and <i>Mina</i>. Long, long ago Meu-Cu was once a regular pet golden cat of a Japanese Emperor. One day when the Emperor was visited by a <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirin.html" title="Kirin">Kirin</a>, a sacred Japanese unicorn, Meu-Cu jumped on the beast’s back and was carried off to the Immortal Lands. There, Meu-Cu drank from the holy river and was given eternal life, but it also turned him into a leg-less ball-like cat demon. Meu-Cu is also the one responsible for turning <i>Benjiro</i> into a catboy. First appears on Page 5 of Chapter 1 (look at the bottom-right corner of the first panel, he’s the yellow thing in the bushes)</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Kyoshi Kobayashi</i> – Kyoshi is <i>Jerolin’s</i> archrival on the school <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendo.html" title="Kendo">Kendo</a> team. However, they weren’t always adversaries, at one time they were inseparable friends. Until one day, when Kyoshi visited <i>Jerolin</i> when he was out of school, sick. But Kyoshi didn’t know that <i>Jerolin</i> was really out of school because it was time for one of his ‘transformations’. Kyoshi had brought with him a couple of bottles of sake to ‘help ease his pain’. <i>Jerolin</i>, who was in a great deal of pain, downed most of the bottles. Their drunkenness spiraled down into a series of unfortunate events that <i>Jerolin</i> deeply regretted. <i>Jerolin</i> vowed to never trust Kyoshi ever again. Even long after that day, despite teasing Jerolin most of the time, Kyoshi finds himself wanting things to be as they were before. First appears on Page 10 of Chapter 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Haruaki Watanabe</i> – Haruaki is a quiet junior who <i>Mina</i> has a crush on. Haruaki is shy around girls, mostly due to a relationship that ended badly in his freshmen year. However, he feels comfortable around <i>Mina</i> and he takes it as a sign that maybe things will be better for him when it comes to girls. He doesn’t plan to get involved with <i>Mina</i> specifically, but <i>Hanna</i> doesn’t know that. First appears on Page 11 of Chapter 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Hanna Matsushita</i> – Hanna is a freshman and childhood friend of <i>Haruaki</i>. She was the one that helped him out last year when he was ending his relationship with another girl. It’s one of the reasons that she is very (if not overly) protective of <i>Haruaki</i>. Being this way, she has made it her goal to keep the American, <i>Mina</i>, away from him and to make her high school career a living hell. Hanna and <i>Mina</i> are also on the same Tennis team, which causes a lot of tension during practices. But deep down inside Hanna wants <i>Haruaki</i> for herself because she cares about him too much to lose him to another girl. First appears on Page 12 of Chapter 1</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Taniko Matsushita</i> – Taniko is <i>Hanna’s</i> cousin. She looks up to <i>Hanna</i> like a big sister, but Taniko often ends up doing her cousin’s bidding. Taniko is terrified of <i>Hanna’s</i> explosive temper. First appears on Page 12 of Chapter 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Aykia Sasaki – sensei</i> – Aykia is the newest and youngest of the teachers (he’s 28 and the rest of them are late 30’s+) at Moussaki High School. He is often teased by the older teachers who like to call him “Aki-chan”. As hard as he tries not to be, he often appears immature, hyper, and sometimes whiny. He teaches freshman Algebra. First appears on Page 16 of Chapter 1</li>

<p>The first chapter mostly introduces the main characters and some supporting characters. It is Monday and the first day of the new term at Mousaki High School. Mina is running late and has trouble getting breakfast at the local fast-food place because she can hardly speak Japanese. She barely make the train to school and we learn that she is in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we are introduced to Kioko and her friends. Benjiro and Su Sihn meet up with her and they head inside, where they find Jerolin and Kyoshi. Mina finally makes it and feels tiny compared to the size of the huge school. Mina finds her classroom and meets Haruaki, much to Hanna’s distaste. As Mina’s class begins, the new teacher, Sasaki-sensei, is introduced. During his class, Mina encounters Meu-Cu and unintentionally disrupts the lesson.</p>

<p>Jerrod was the King of Edenia. He was defeated and killed by Shao Kahn after Edenia's finest warriors lost in Mortal Kombat. He was succeeded by his wife, Queen Sindel, and his only daughter, Princess Kitana, who were both captured by Shao Kahn. His physical appearance is unknown, but because he was from Edenia, it is assumed he was humanlike and had lived for a very long time. While Edenians do normally look youthful, with Sindel as an example, they may just age very slowly, placing the couple's age very high. It is assumed he is equal to or older than Sindel in age.</p>
<p>It is of note, however that a beheaded statue can be found in the Edenia realm of Konquest mode in MK: Deception. The face apears to be of a bearded man. When the player asks a nearby npc, he states "The statue is of King Jerrod, who ruled Edenia many thousands of years ago.</p>

Raymond Americo Bianchi (1990- Present Day) Born: Detroit, Michigan.</p>
<p>When Raymond Lang was born a serpentine dragon was seen flying out of a well and any corn shucked at that exact moment came out as gold. Aeromancers have judged this to be a true sign from god. Ray dis-proved this by urinating on the doctor.</p>
<p>Born into a middle-class family with the name Reed Americo Lang, his parents quickly grew annoyed with the name, and changed it to Raymond Americo Lang.</p>
<p>After countless IQ tests it's been concluded that he is technically a genius, with an IQ of 141.</p>
<p>Considered to be a "player" or a "pimp" for his smooth words around women, Ray has denied this claim countless times, stating that "I don't want to be a player, or a pimp. My words are only there to make women feel more confident about themselves because there are so many other men out there who only want to make them feel worse."</p>
<p>He's furthermore the leader of the small religious sect "Rayligion" wherein he's the "Sun God". It's more of a humorous joke, but many people have bought into it, with a following of more then 200 people reading the Rayligous Language.</p>
<p>Well-versed in literature, he's written many stories and poems that his fellow students enjoy thoroughly, though most of them are humorous, there are a few based off of Ancient China and Japanese war-fare. His most famous work among his peers is a humorous tale about a cat who works at a magazine company in New York city, a clear jab at modern day sitcoms, "Karen Kitty" has become a staple of student literature at P-CEP High Schools.</p>
<p>After the death of his grandfather Raymond changed his last name to Bianchi to continue on the Bianchi family lineage, and has been threatened with disownment by his parents if he does not get it legally changed back.</p>

<p>The "pop" of a skateboard deck is thought to be by mnay new skaters, the concave, height of the nose and tail of the skateboard. But contrary to popular belief it is actually the amount of "spring" the wood of the skateboard has. So when a board is brand new it has alot of pop, meaning when smacking the tail off the ground when doing tricks the boards "pops" (springs) back fastly and has a crisp response. when the boards loses its pop the board feels mushy and has list its crisp snap.</p>

<p>Pa Cheap Skates is a skateboard shop and mailorder company located a couple miles outside of Pittsburgh, PA in White Oak, PA. They opened in 1987 as a skateboard park and skateshop and had at one time the biggest vert ramp in the upper east coast. In 1988 they started construction on a 12 1/2' high all steel vert ramp which saw the riding of Todd Swank, Sergie Ventura, Tony Hawk, Matt Hensley, Andrew Reynolds, Sal Barbier, and about 50 more notable pros from today and the past. In 1989 they built a 7000 square foot outdoor skatepark with a pyramid, rails and quarter pipe. However, due to rising insurance cost and the threat of liability claims they decided to close the skatepark and move the store to a shopping center and just operate a store. In early 2006 they started an online store called <a href="http://www.pacheapskates.com" class="external free" title="http://www.pacheapskates.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pacheapskates.com</a> which shows their stores inventory and some other useful articles about skateboarding.</p>

<p>A <b>Sith holocron</b> was a device used by <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sith.html" title="Sith">Sith</a> to store information. Sith holocrons originated from secrets shared with the Sith King <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adas.html" title="Adas">Adas</a> by <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rakata_%28Star_Wars%29_fdcf.html" title="Rakata (Star Wars)">Rakatan</a> soldiers trying to gain the trust of the Sith ruler. Adas made a holocron based on Rakatan design and presumably the art of holocron making originated among the ancient Sith from this. They were immediately identifiable with respect to <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocron.html" title="Holocron">holocrons</a>, as they were usually pyramidal in shape, and etched with strange symbols and ancient hieroglyphs. Inscriptions usually lined the bottom of the device, and various dark incantations were found all over the smooth surface. At the holocron's apex rested a black crystal, used to power the holocron's store of information. The design of the holocron was not the only way to discern its affiliation: Sith holocrons emitted a dark presence, creating tremors in the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force.html" title="Force">Force</a> upon activation. It took a great deal of willpower for a Jedi to access the dark devices, and some of the more inexperienced Jedi often felt sick and ill from merely laying their gaze upon a Sith holocron.</p>
<p>Internally, however, Sith holocrons worked in much the same way as did a Jedi holocron. The black crystal of the Sith holocron was made up of intricate lattices and vertices, capable of storing massive amounts of information, as well as the holocron's Sith gatekeeper. The holocron was able to capture the appearance and cognitive networks of the holocron's owner, and transform this into a three-dimensional hologram. This gatekeeper acted as a guide through the holocron's store of information, as a search and recovery engine with a more personal touch. These gatekeepers could relate stories from the holocron's archives to events in the life of the one who activated the holocron.</p>

<p>Jedi gatekeepers could sense the ability and level of a Jedi, and offer or restrict information accordingly—so that <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padawan.html" title="Padawan">Padawans</a> were not shown information too advanced and dangerous for their basic stage. However, Sith holocrons usually allowed the activator unlimited access to its entire <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_side_of_the_Force_9d51.html" title="Dark side of the Force">dark side</a> repository. The gatekeeper would draw the viewer in with tales of power, and could even turn some Force-users to the Dark Side. The pull of the Sith holocron was strong, indeed. Which the Jedi Historian, <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atris.html" title="Atris">Atris</a> discovered as she collected the holocrons that slowly turned her to the dark side. As of 3,996 BBY, only one known Sith holocron existed, having been captured by <a href="../../../o/d/a/Odan-Urr_e8b7.html" title="Odan-Urr">Odan-Urr</a> during the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Hyperspace_War_ba95.html" title="Great Hyperspace War">Great Hyperspace War</a>; forty years later, Atris kept scores of them in the Telosian Jedi Academy. The holocron captured by Odan-Urr was said to contain information dating back to around 100,000 BBY.</p>
<p>Most of the Sith holocrons were created long before the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Wars_%28Star_Wars%29_b249.html" title="Clone Wars (Star Wars)">Clone Wars</a>, and as of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Geonosis_6493.html" title="Battle of Geonosis">Battle of Geonosis</a>, the <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_Archives_6248.html" title="Jedi Archives">Jedi Archives</a> on <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coruscant.html" title="Coruscant">Coruscant</a> contained most of the only surviving Sith holocrons in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Galaxy_9446.html" title="The Galaxy">the Galaxy</a>. These devices were locked away to all but the most senior Jedi—in fact, most of the Jedi in the <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_Temple_78a6.html" title="Jedi Temple">Temple</a> did not even know Sith holocrons resided in the building. The holocrons were kept in case the Jedi would ever face the threat of the Sith again, whereupon <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_Master_7d02.html" title="Jedi Master">Jedi Masters</a> could consult the holocrons for ideas on how to defeat the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith_3330.html" title="Dark Lord of the Sith">Dark Lords</a>. However, the Sith holocrons were not as safe as the Archives Director believed: Jedi student <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorian_Nod_f045.html" title="Lorian Nod">Lorian Nod</a> was able to steal a Sith holocron from the Archives, though the theft ended in his expulsion from the Jedi Order. <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count.html" title="Count">Count</a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/Dooku.html" title="Dooku">Dooku</a> stole at least one Sith holocron from the Temple during the First Battle of Coruscant. The remaining Sith holocrons in the Temple at the end of the Clone Wars were (according to Sidious) forgeries, but Sidious had his apprentice <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> recover them nonetheless.</p>
<p>Several ancient Sith holocrons were kept by <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Plagueis_5666.html" title="Darth Plagueis">Darth Plagueis</a> and were presumably inherited by Darth Sidious. Another Sith holocron was created by <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Andeddu_9602.html" title="Darth Andeddu">Darth Andeddu</a>, an ancient Sith Lord. This holocron was recovered during a competition between <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quinlan_Vos_8827.html" title="Quinlan Vos">Quinlan Vos</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tol_Skorr_59b8.html" title="Tol Skorr">Tol Skorr</a> for Count Dooku during the Clone Wars, while Quinlan was allied with Dooku. It contained much dark side knowledge as well as a red <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber.html" title="Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> crystal embedded in its core, possibly used to power Darth Andeddu's own Sith lightsaber. The holocron itself was kept by Tyranus while the red crystal was used in Quinlan Vos' lightsaber for a brief time.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toydarian.html" title="Toydarian">Toydarian</a> named Zippa tried to sell Lorn Pavan a cubical <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocron.html" title="Holocron">Holocron</a> in 32.5 BBY that Pavan suspected was a Sith Holocron, but as the deal fell through, this was never confirmed as a Sith Holocron.</p>

<p>American born in Guam on February 13, 1991. Son of an U.S. Air Force major, and considered by some the coolest person in the world. He is also extremely smart as seen by the fact that he got all A's this year, and because he has won so many awards. He probably gets these brains from his older brother Andrew Madsen, who got a 34 on the ACT! Andrew is currently attending Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. James' other brother, Peter Madsen, is lasier, but nobody can say he isn't cool.</p>

<p>Student Guild</p>
<hr />
<p>The Murdoch University Guild of Students is the student representative association at Murdoch University. Subject to the introduction of Voluntary Student Unionism legislation by the federal government, students can choose to become financial members of the Guild and receive the associated benefits. The interests of all students will continue to be represented to the university administration regardless of their membership of the Student guild. As well as handling student representation and assistance with education and welfare issues, the Guild manages two food outlets on campus, runs the tavern, sports and recreation centre and the second hand bookshop. The guild partially finances many of the student associations on campus and run specific guild events of their own. Finally, the guild publishes Metior, the campus magazine.</p>
<p>The Guild is affiliated with the National Union of Students, and the postgraduate student representative organisation (Murdoch University Postgraduate Student Association, or MUPSA) is a member of the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations.</p>
<p>For more information, see the Guilds website. <a href="http://www.guild.murdoch.edu.au" class="external text" title="http://www.guild.murdoch.edu.au" rel="nofollow">Murdoch University Guild of Students</a></p>

<p>thizzology: the study of the effects of exstacy on the human vagina. Thizzology is a registered form of science, and anyone can be a thizzologist. All you have to do is insert pills into a female (preferrably recnally(up the shit tube)) without her knowing, then take advantage of her... vagina. Then take pictures as part of your study. and send them into penthouse. After excessive masturbation, of course.</p>

<p>The Reejers are a colorado based band.</p>
<p>Ranging from a gigantic wall of swirling atmospheric sound, to a single road worn acoustic guitar. Every performance is a unique event and never lacking in emotional urgency. Adorned in volume or stripped to the bone. The songs are an accessible stream of melody and raw emotion. The Reejers have crisscrossed the United States a dozen times since 1992 attaining a fanatical following in the big city and the small forgotten towns. Forever expanding an already impressive collection of original songs. The selections below are from their second full length indie record, 'Erased'. Eleven original tracks that take the listener on an aural journey through ambient landscapes. They create a unique sound by combining folk with the aggressive edge of rock. The album was recorded at Warzone studios in Chicago. This band has contributed songs to three nationally distributed compilation CD's, Aware II, Shmowballs, and Chicago subdisc. The Reejers are also featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture 'Motiff County'.</p>

<p>Zhuanglang is a county in Gansu Province, China. It is a poor rural county, one of eight county-level divisions in Pingliang District in the east of Gansu Province. Zhuanglang County is bordered in the west by Jingning, in the south by Qin'an and Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County, in the west by Huating (all in Gansu Province) and in the north by Ningxia Hui Muslim Autonomous Region. Nearby major cities include Pingliang, Tianshui, Guyuan and Lanzhou.</p>
<p><br />
The county town of Zhuanglang is known as Shuiluo, and is a busy administrative, educational and trading centre in the centre of the county. Other market towns in the county include Nanhu, Zhudian and Handian in the north, south-west and south-east respectively.</p>
<p><br />
The people of Zhuanglang are predominantly farmers, producing wheat and potatoes on the terraced hills. The farmers of Zhuanglang were proclaimed in the 1980s for having terraced all available hillside, and a monument in the county town records the famous 'Zhuanglang Spirit' by which this was achieved.</p>
<p><br />
In recent years education has been a priority for the local government, and with the help of World Bank funding, schools in Zhuanglang have been well supported. Nearly all children now complete primary education, while there are 23 junior middle schools, and 3 senior middle schools which send students on to colleges and universities.</p>
<p><br />
The cultural sites of Zhuanglang include:</p>
<p>Yunyasi. The beautiful Yunya temple forms the centrepiece of a protected forest park in the far east of the county, around 40km from the county town.</p>
<p>Zi Jin Temple. This temple was re-opened in 1986 after the Cultural Revolution and is in the centre of the county town. Close by is an earth fortress dating from the era of Mongol invasions through this region.</p>
<p>Chen Dong Temple. This more isolated Taoist temple is to be found in the north-east of the county.</p>
<p><br />
The highest point of the county is Taomushan at 2857m above sea level.</p>
<p><br />
Population (2005 est.) Total = 420,000 Ethnic composition = 99% Han Chinese, 1 % Hui Muslim Major Towns Shuiluo = 30,000 Nanhu = 10,000 Zhudian = 6,000 Handian = 5,000</p>

Llyn Trelfesg is part of the Valley Lakes RSPB reserve on the west coast of Anglesey near to Royal Airforce Valley and within the parish of Llanfair-yn-Neubwll. It was owned by the Magee family until sold to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the 1990s. It is a man-made lake, formed when building material was needed to construct the adjacent RAF base. The lake is surrounded by marsh, scrub and grazing land and is attractive to view. It contains fresh water fish species such as perch, roach, rudd and eels. It has breeding populations of Mute Swans, Greylag Geese, Canada Geese, Mallard, Teal, Ruddy Duck, Coot, Moorhen and Reed Warblers. Slow worms, common frogs, common lizards and adders are found around its shores as are foxes, rabbits and brown hares. Water voles were common in the 1990s.</p>

Hazard is a character from DC Comics. Her real name is Rebecca ("Becky") Sharpe. She has the power of Probability Manipulation: Hazard can psionically manipulate the probability fields in conjunction with special dice that she carries. Any percentile dice roll is read as the high die first for good luck. Any percentage dice roll is read as the low die first for bad luck. She can thus cause good luck or cause bad luck (a harmful accident) to befall someone. The origin of her powers, the nature of her dice and the relationship between them is unknown.</p>

She joined on the one condition that the group refrain from murder. The group's leader, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wizard_a9b4.html" title="The Wizard">the Wizard</a> assented to her demand but had no intention of abiding by them.</p>

<p>"Maltese biographies of the Twentieth Century" - Pubblikazzjoni Indipendenza,ed. Michael J. Schiavone, Louis J. Scerri, 1997.</p>

<a href="../../../2/1/2/User%7E212.56.128.20.html" title="User:212.56.128.20">212.56.128.20</a> 15:52, 1 July 2006 (UTC) Frans Sammut was born on 19 November 1945 at Ħaż-Żebbuġ to Antonio Sammut and Antonia Zammit. He studied at the Zebbug Primary School, St Aloysius College, St Michael Teacher's Training College, the University of Malta (B.A., S.Th.Dip., M.Ed.) and the Perugia University (Diploma to Teach Italian Abroad). Between 1965 and 1986 he taught Italian and Maltese at secondary and sixth-form level, from 1986 onwards was first assistant head and, since 1993, head in Government schools. He started writing early and in 1964 won first prize of the Għaqda Kittieba Żgħażagħ with a short story that befriended him to Ivo Muscat Azzopardi who encouraged him to pursue a literary career. In 1966 he was co-founder the Moviment Qawmien Letterarju which sought to bring Maltese literature abreat of literary developments abroad. In 1968 he published a collection of short stories which evinced his innovative contribution to Maltese letters, but it was with "Il-Gaġġa" that he made his mark in the field. It was the first "new wave" novel to be almost immediately included in the University Maltese syllabus. The novel is considered by leading academics as the signpost for Maltese prose. Another novel of his, "Samuraj" became an instant bestseller after the winning the first Rothmans Prize for Literature in 1974. "Paceville", the winner of the Govenrment award for 1991 remains the best testimony of modern Maltese life, while his other award-winning novel "Il-Ħolma Maltija"(1994) was considered by "The Times" as reaching a level and stature previously unknown in Maltese literature. Sammut published a great number of short stories, some of them as collected works like "Il-Qtil ta' Sqaq il-Ħorr" (1988) and "Newbiet" (1998). Sammut's passion for history is evinced in his books "Ir-Rivoluzzjoni Franċiża" (1989) and "Bonaparti f'Malta" (1997, translated into French as "Bonaparte à Malte") among others. Some of his short stories have been translated into major European languages. He also produced historical works in English and Italian.</p>

<p>In insular <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_languages.html" title="Celtic languages">Celtic languages</a>, a <b>prepositional pronoun</b> is an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflection.html" title="Inflection">inflected</a> pronoun that indicates the pronoun is related to the preposition. For instance, in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_language_83df.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scottish</a>, to say "before him," one would not say <i>ro e</i> but <i>roimhe</i>, an amalgamation of the two words. Prepositional pronouns also have emphatic forms (<i>roimhe<b>san</b></i>, in that case).</p>

Ruskabank is a ska band that hails from Manhattan, KS. They were formed in 1996 from a group of students at the local Kansas State University. As an eight-piece band with many influences, Ruskabank experienced mild success throughout the midwest having appeared with such acts as Goldfinger, Less Than Jake, The Slackers, Fishbone, The Toasters and The Urge. Known for there catchy rifts and high energy shows, Ruskabank peaked at the height of ska music's 3rd wave, but still play regional shows today after a short one year hiatus between 2002-2003. Ruskabank signed on to indie label 'Noisome Records' in April of 2000, and released its follow up to their 1998 album "This Took Some Time" entitled, "I Don't Think You Hear Me, Though" in July of 2000. Ruskabank members especially lead singer and guitarist Dave Spiker, (who also appeared on the amazing race this past year) are strong supporters and advocates of the local music scene in the midwest and continue to help try and influence local bands and venues to work together in order to produce great shows.</p>

<p>Chelsea pulls out a closed bag of chips from her locker, but then the opening of the bag is not shown until Raven reaches into the bag for a chip.<br />
It is learned that Chelsea snorts when she sees a guy that she likes, however she does not snort when she sees Jake Haskell (On Top of Old Oaky) or Ben (Double Vision)<br />
In Raven's Vision, "the seat" is in a different part of the room than where it actually is.<br /></p>

<p>Pierre Bezukhov is a character in Lev Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" Pierre, whom many critics regard as a reflection of Tolstoy himself, attracts our sympathy in his status as an outsider to the Russian upper classes. His simplicity and emotional directness contrast with the artificiality of fakes such as the Kuragins. Though the attendees at Anna Pavlovna’s party consider Pierre uncouth and awkward, this very awkwardness emphasizes his natural unpretentiousness. We see his love of fun in his expulsion from St. Petersburg for excessive partying, and his generosity in his bank-breaking largesse toward friends and acquaintances following his inheritance. Pierre, though intelligent, is not dominated by reason, as his friend Andrew is. Pierre’s emotional spurts occasionally get him into trouble, as when his sexual passions make him prey to the self-serving and beautiful Helene. His madcap escape into the city of Moscow and his subsequent obsessive belief that he is destined to be Napoleon’s assassin show his submission to irrational impulses. Yet there is also a great nobility in Pierre’s emotions, and his search for meaning in his life becomes a central theme of the novel. We feel that his final marriage to Natasha represents the culmination of a life of moral and spiritual questioning.</p>

<p>66.245.254.41 21:49, 1 July 2006 (UTC) Jamees Edwin McConnell (b Jan 12, 1892 in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta%2C_Georgia_4e3e.html" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, d January 24, 1954 in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport_Beach%2C_California_e5c3.html" title="Newport Beach, California">Newport Beach, California</a>) was the host of "Smilin' Ed's Gang", a radio show for children which, in the early 1950s moved over to television. It was sponsored by Buster Brown Shoes. When McConnell died actor Andy Devine took over the show, which was renamed "Andy's Gang". The show featured stories, most memorably those of Gunga Ram in India, and had various characters, such as Grandie the Talking Piano, Midnight the Cat (voiced by June Foray of Rocky and Bullwinkle fame), and perhaps most memorably, Froggy Gremlin, who would appear when McConnell gave the request "Plug your magic twanger, Froggy!"</p>
