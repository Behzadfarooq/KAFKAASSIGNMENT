<dd><b>Comment</b> - ANUS.com started out on the web in 1993 and went into its home at ANUS.com in 1995. It has been written up in SPIN magazine, investigated by the FBI, and reported on in several oblique contexts for its related websites. ANUS is thus an 11-year online presence that has seen many notable mentions and has maintained itself on a high-value domain name without selling out for that time. Only someone horribly bigoted against its content would argue "not notable," and clearly that's the case with "Guy." It is the oldest heavy metal resource on the Internet. Is that "not notable"? Come on, grow up. MouthfulOfFeces 22:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - Yes, lets look at the references. The Houston Chronicle awards ANUS.com as being the best Nihilist Website on the web. They directly write about them and it is an award (criterion 3 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). The Wired article is about the exploits of the leader of ANUS. The MTV and Yahoo articles mention ANUS's relation to the Day of Slayer. The Village Voice article credits anus.com with the heavy metal faq. I'm sorry but you can't just pick and choose to ignore sources that are there. To say that none of the external coverage is about ANUS in particular is just false, the Houston Chronicle award is direct coverage and an award. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 05:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I know I did. And after the Afd, this article was turned into a stub and most of the original research removed. So it's actually better now than at the time of the third nomination.

We have already decided that GNAA was not worth keeping on WP, and because of that, it makes sense to remove ANUS also.

<li>When reading the nom's reasoning, I'm afraid that's the only sourced conclusion one can reach. A mention in the Houston press, a mention in the Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal that is the primary source for the List of Heavy Metal Bands (the entry in the books states the website is "authoritative," if my memorery serves me correctly)...these are reliable and verifiable. Now, as for some sort of thing you can look at without having to buy the book, see Prolog's diif here from the last nomination. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/American_Nihilist_Underground_Society_%283rd_nomination%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96580991" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/American_Nihilist_Underground_Society_%283rd_nomination%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96580991" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/American_Nihilist_Underground_Society_%283rd_nomination%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96580991</a> <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">Ours18</a> 01:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>From the yahoo article: “Apparently the National Day of Slayer was promoted this year by a website affiliated with the American Nihilist Underground Society, who called on fans to listen to the band's music on June 6.” From the Houston Press article: “Many people who click on Anus.com aren't looking for philosophical treatises, but porn seekers just might end up finding enlightenment. A.N.U.S., an acronym for American Nihilist Underground Society….” Now, that’s the exact opposite of what you said. And you still have no response to the site’s mention in the Encyclopedia….because there isn’t anything to say about it.

In particular, none of the mentions are non-trivial and the summary of all the details is drawn by synthesizing disparate details from a variety of sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The article has been rewritten 3 times already, the first was an obviously ANUS driven article, I wrote the second and Prolog has written the 3rd. Quite frankly each article is completely different from the previous, my article and prolog's articles were sourced and are not Original Research, you can go ahead and make that claim that it is original research but it isn't. Now you claim it hasn't recieved any awards. Yes it has! The Houston article is an award saying ANUS.com is the best nihilist website of 2006. This is reputable houston publication claiming this. There are also multiple article which are news coverage of ANUS pranks. You are welcome to claim there are no sources but there are. You are welcome to claim they are non-notable, but in fact they are. You are welcome to claim anything but just because you do doesn't mean your claim is accurate. I passes WP:WEB, it has multiple secondary sources, it is referenced, they are attributed with maintaining the Heavy Metal FAQ, they have recieved an award (so we have WP:WEB criteria 1 &amp; 2 covered), they are an organization who has recieved media attention for their pranks and have been awarded as such. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 16:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The news stories cited are predominantly not about this alleged organization. They reward it for being a good site (an award which fails WP:WEB because, as I said above, it is not a "notable award"—a random prize from a weekly newpaper's annual Restaurants issue with no independant coverage is not a Webby—the Houston Press "award" is not notable per WP:WEB#2 and WP:V), sources discuss ANUS.com in context of music, but they mostly don't cover the article's topic. That is, the reliable sources don't write about the underground as an actual organization (appart from folks who presumably run a website). The more on-topic the references are, the less reliable they are—a problem that was also suffered by the GNAA. If GNAA had been distilled to bare references like this article has, it would still not merit an article. I believe in the precendent set by GNAA and Jimbo Wales. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 22:25, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why do you keep bringing up GNAA as precedent? It had no external links to any newspaper publication whatsoever. There is no precedent, it is a policy called <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If we read WP:WEB Criterion 2 we see: "The website or content has won a notable independent award from either a publication or organization.[6]" and footnote 6 contains "Examples of such awards: Eisner Awards, Bloggies or Webby Awards. See Category:Awards for more. Being nominated for an award in multiple years is also considered an indicator of notability.". The award is from an independant houston based publication. That said do you think there are a lot of nihilism related awards? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 23:04, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, I think there have been no <b>notable</b> awards given to anus.com. Notice that WP:WEB#2 even links to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> to stress its point. A non-sequitur sidebar to in a weekly's "best-of" restaurants issue which generates <i>no independant commentary</i> is simply not a notable award.</li>
<li>Actually, the GNAA <i>did</i> have an external link to a reputable daily newspaper, but I remember now that there was a significant difference. See <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=2283732005" class="external text" title="http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=2283732005" rel="nofollow">the Scottsman article mentioning GNAA</a>. The Scottsman article was poor because it relied on wikipedia itself as a source, so you are right that this article has more independant verifiability than GNAA. I agree with Prolog that this article satisfies WP:WEB#1. I still believe WP:ORG shouldn't apply when the article's sources primarily refer to an organization in their capacity of maintaining a site. At any rate, <b>keep</b>, but the GNAA reference has got to go. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 00:04, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

If the subject is notable enough for <i>The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal</i> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22American+Nihilist+Underground+Society%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22American+Nihilist+Underground+Society%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> then it is no doubt notable enough for an encyclopedia which hopes to provide the complete sum of human knowledge. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 02:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
