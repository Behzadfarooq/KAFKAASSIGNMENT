<p>Encyclopedic Value? Are you kidding me?! Search drinking games as a general subject on Wikipedia and tell me how many hundreds of entries there are! I assume that those, however, ARE of "encyclopedic value." This was very clever and I vote that it stays. I had it forwarded to me, and I have since forwarded it on to several family members and friends. With the Tigers gaining so much television and media exposure, and all with Rod Allen and Mario Impemba as the faces of these great Tigers, I would say that it falls into the category of current event relevance. As far as it being "verifiable," I verified it at Buffalo Wild Wings on Saturday night with a group of friends - what a great and fun game.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.233.57.149 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.233.57.149_f1dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.233.57.149">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Submitter is a life-long Tigers fan and has nothing but respect for both Rod Allen and Mario Impemba (worthy successors to George and Al!). As easy as it is to get swept up in the current Tiger fever, drinking game articles are more suitable to blogs or personal websites than an encyclopedia, especially games that are specific to a small group of friends. --<a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtony102_d9e1.html" title="User:Dtony102">dtony</a> 17:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since you raised the issue, I went and checked <a href="../../../d/r/i/Category%7EDrinking_games_ed39.html" title="Category:Drinking games">Category:Drinking games</a>. Yes, it's well-populated ... but looking at a random selection of articles there, I was astounded at how many are utterly unsourced. And the one Google I did, on Thunderdome (drinking game) turned up one hit independent of Wikipedia or its mirrors, at barmeister.com, which I do not have the time to check for reliability.<br />
I think it's time to go through and winnow this category down some ... it's far too vulnerable to <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>-type stuff. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 14:06, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to have to agree that the category needs to be whittled down a bit. Wikipedia shouldn't become a drinking game repository. For reference, barmeister.com is of the "Submit a drinking game" variety, so its reliability is questionable; it's best as a backup source. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 14:57, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>you obviously didn't look hard enough, because I was able to find independent existence of this game.

<li>The so-called "independent existence" is the blog post linked to up top. As you'll note, it is three days old.<br />
As a rule you'll notice there are <i>no</i> TV-based drinking games in the drinking games category, because not only are they quintessential fancruft, they never really catch on and I doubt anyone actually plays them (Besides, they're not really games, just observations about the show's clichés made in the form of a drinking game.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Unfortunately, pretty much every link mentioning it is a blog, which do not count as reliable sources. And unless the Rod Allen Drinking Game becomes an enormous sweeping phenomenon, or outrageously popular, it won't merit an article. It is still not notable, not verifiable, an inside joke, and is basically something <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up at school one day</a>. The fact that it's barely half a week old is only one of the many, many reasons it should be deleted. I could just as easily create a <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Lange_abee.html" title="Mike Lange">Mike Lange</a> drinking game with drinks based on every time he says something outrageous, and it would just as easily be worth deleting. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, nor should it become a catalyst for insignificant fads. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 21:24, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>who the heck is Mike Lange and why would you want a drinking game for him?!?!? That's preposterous. Like it ot not, Rod Allen is an excellent sportscaster and this article is without-a-doubt-relevant. And maybe one of the 10 links returned from google was a blog, the others were not; they were message boards. There is a very big difference between the two. --<a href="../../../x/9/6/User%7EX96lee15_8d24.html" title="User:X96lee15">X96lee15</a> 03:56, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This pretty clearly illustrates my point. Mike Lange is significant to the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Penguins_65f5.html" title="Pittsburgh Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> and to <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a> fans and has his own drinking games. There's no difference between his significance and that of Rod Allen. About message boards: If you'd like I could make a post on hfboards (hockey fan boards) to spread the Mike Lange drinking game to prove message boards are also unreliable sources. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 12:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I don't care about Mike Lange, you have the right to create a Wikipedia article on him and/or his drinking game, if it's significant enough. If there is significant message board chatter, then I'm all for it. --<a href="../../../x/9/6/User%7EX96lee15_8d24.html" title="User:X96lee15">X96lee15</a> 13:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, quite the opposite is true. I do <i>not</i> have the right to create an article on a Mike Lange Drinking Game if there is significant message board chatter; message boards are not reliable sources. It would be very easy to create a message board fad- this is why articles like Happycat are constantly being deleted. Wikipedia is not for fads or something made up at school one day (<a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 16:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yeah, I agree with what you're saying. My only beef with this whole deletion is that there are other less-relevant (IMO) "Drinking Games" already on Wikipedia. That's why I'm opposed to this deletion. <a href="../../../x/9/6/User%7EX96lee15_8d24.html" title="User:X96lee15">X96lee15</a> 16:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>More accurately, the fact that it was in Wikipedia got mentioned.

<li>The game was <i>three days old</i> when it was posted, and the article mentions Wikipedia as its only source. Everything outside of the first paragraph is quoted from Wikipedia. It celebrates the fact that a drinking game based around Rod Allen made it onto Wikipedia. Basically, the only reason the game got a trivial mention in the online ticker was <b>because</b> it had a Wikipedia article, which is exactly why we don't want articles like this on the site. My stance remains. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 01:41, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I first saw the term Rod Allen Drinking game on a Myspace comment that dates back to 7/6/2006. So the game wasn't invented 3 days ago, just posted on a blog a few days ago. I understand that Wikipedia does not feel like Myspace and blogs are good sources. But no matter how the game got notable, the fact is now the game is notable. People play the game. It was mentioned in the Free Press. If you search Rod Allen on Yahoo, the first "Also try" is "Rod Allen drinking game" <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Rod+Allen&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2&amp;x=wrt" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Rod+Allen&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2&amp;x=wrt" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> If you don't watch the games or know who Rod Allen is, I don't feel like you should decide if the game is notable or not. I dont expect people in California to find it notable, but in Detroit it is. Just because a thing is new, does not preclude it from a Wikipedia entry. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatsHowIRoll_aada.html" title="User:ThatsHowIRoll">ThatsHowIRoll</a> 03:04, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact remains that it was a completely trivial mention based off of notability implied in that it had a Wikipedia article. The newspiece asserted notability through Wikipedia having an article- you argue the Wikipedia article asserts notability through the newspiece. Do you see the same problem I see?

<li>We have different opinions on the news piece. You seem to think it is about how the game got an article on Wikipedia. I feel like the article is about telling more people about the game, hence the <i>another Tigers-based fad is sweeping the state</i> line. Followed by the rules and an example of the game quoted from the Wikipedia article. Its not a nation thing, it a Michigan thing. I'm sure most people don't know the importance of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_League_Chew_2167.html" title="Big League Chew">Big League Chew</a> to the Tigers, but in Detroit, everyone knows. The problem is that the Wikipedia article has become the sole source of the game. That doesn't mean the game doesn't exist. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatsHowIRoll_aada.html" title="User:ThatsHowIRoll">ThatsHowIRoll</a> 03:49, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The "sweeping the state" line gains a lot of support based on the fact that it has a Wikipedia article. Big League Chew has also been around for about 25 years and is significant to more than just Tigers fans- the fact that it's important to them has a brief mention in the "Trivia" section. You're making it sound like the Big League Chew article exists solely because of its significance to the Tigers. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 12:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Jeff, The DFP mention was only in relation to the Wiki Article. The newspiece asserted notability through Wikipedia having an article but you saying <i>Keep</i> as if the Wikipedia article asserts notability through the newspiece. The newspiece came out 3 day after the AFD was put into place. The only mention of this 'game' was on a users blog, they admit to making up. Before making a snap decision, I recommend looking over the history of this debate. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 15:33, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know. I also know that the game was widespread enough for someone to have thought about a news article about it, check wikipedia about it, and then note that Wikipedia has an entry on it. The game is obviously notable if you need notability to make a decision, and the game is now verifiable. My position stands. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I also want to remind people, one newspaper article does not make anything 'notable'. Notability standards usually require citing more than one major news source. Please look at a few of the Wiki guidelines. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wiki is not a Publisher of Original Thought</a> - Specifically - <i>Original inventions: If you invent the word frindle or a new type of dance move (or drinking game), it is not article material until a secondary source reports on it. Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day!</i> Since the newspaper article was written after the Wiki page, and refers specifically to the wiki page, the article is in violation of this rule. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Sources cite on an article must be Reliable</a> - Specifically - Wikipedia cannot cite itself as a source—that would be a self-reference. The newspaper article references the wiki article as a source, hence the wiki article would be self-referencing by using the newspaper article as a source to verify this game. The fact of the matter is, this article fails two of the Wiki policies on Article Standards. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No Original Research</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>, and the majority of anons in this discussion are not basing their statements on the Wiki Standards but on their personal feelings for a sports team. As it is jeff, I personally feel your stand holds no merit when applied to the Wiki Article Standards. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 15:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So are you trying to say that the article would be okay if the Detroit Free Press had written the article and I created it today? The point is simple: this article does not run afoul of any sourcing as the subject has been reported about in a third party publication. We are not citing the article as a source, the Detroit Free Press is the source. Whether they relied on Wikipedia for part of the article isn't relevant. My stand is entirely within policy and guideline here. Just because the article was created two days earlier than you may have preferred doesn't mean it's a bad article now. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jeff, the article most likely would not have been written if the wiki article was not here. But beyond that, one mention in one newspaper does not make this notable. Notability, as a guideline, usually requires three or more major news sources for verification. There is only one local newspaper mentioning this 'game' in only one small article. That, by most standards, is not enough for notability...especially as the article was written after the wiki article, and the 'game' has been shown to have few ghits. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 16:41, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Speculation as to whether the article would exist without the wiki article coming into play is idle speculation at best. Notability, as a statement of fact, has <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">no official policy</a>. The article, as it stands, is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, so it should stay. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:50, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you will throw out the few ghits and the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> citations as not worth paying attention to in this discussion. Because one Local newspaper gave a small article to this game, it should have an article? Well, I have been mentioned in the Fargo/Moorhead Forum numerous times, so I should have a large article as well, right? It's Verifiable by a Reliable source right? No, we have to look at the trinity of the Standards and the wiki article must meet all three..Neutral POV, Verifiable, AND No Original Research. Since the only source for this game (before the newspaper article) was a blog where the author admitted to making up the game, and there are no media mentions before the wiki article (or this DFP article) was made, this falls into OR. The DFP article only refers to Wiki as a source, which makes citing the DFP article in the wiki article self-referencing. There is no mention of the blog on this DFP article. We may also want to look at the fact that the DFP newspaper may fall into a 'trivial' newsource. It is not a national paper (it's local only) and is not nationally known. No other newspapers or media have picked up on this 'game'. The game itself is only a locally known thing, and only because of the wiki article and this newspaper article. Nationally or world wide, it is just unknown. If you dismiss all that, the wiki article does fail OR, and if an article fails any of the three main Standards so harshly, then I believe there really isn't any reason for the article to exist.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 17:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, we're just running around in circles at this point. The article is verifiable by the Detroit Free Press (highly non-trivial and nationally known), it's NPOV, and no longer/doesn't fail original research. I'm failing to see the problem. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:36, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article is trivial in both length and content, it sources Wikipedia, and the Detroit Free Press is "nationally known" on the basis that it has "Detroit" in its name. It is still a local newspaper- it just happens to be in a large city. The original research still stands- where did the material come from? Blogs and message boards. What did the news article add to the wikipedia entry? Nothing. It apparently can't be stressed enough that this article is <b>self-referencing</b>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 17:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So it's a stub in reality. No problems there. As for the Detroit Free Press, it's the 12th largest paper by circulation in the US, that stands for something. Whether the material came from blogs is irrelevant, truly - the information was important enough to be used in a newspaper article. The news article itself may not add anything new to the article proper, but it does infer notability and verifability that may not have existed before. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well, we are running around in circles, but I am not willing to concede to your point, jeff, that it somehow magically passes OR. Looking at the history <s>through untinted glasses</s> [Edit: I don't know if you are a Tiger's fan or not]] shows that this was OR when the AFD was created. The DFP article (trivial or not) still has the article falling short of multiple third-party sources. Since the article references Wiki as the source of this game, I can't, in good faith, accept the DFP article as a mention of notability or Verfibiliy. If the article had mentioned the blog AND there were other newspapers that had picked up on the story before the AFD, I would concede this had merit. As it stands, there isn't an article that references the blog (only verifiable source of this game outside of wiki), and so...it fails OR. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 17:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, this Red sox fan disagrees. It doesn't "magically pass" OR. It passes WP:OR easily, note the key phrase that applies here: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth</b>." WP:V states "Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy." The Detroit Free Press, <i>even if it notes the Wikipedia entry for this article</i>, meets this. The part you're attempting to cite here is at WP:RS: "Wikipedia is a tertiary source. Wikipedia cannot cite itself as a source—that would be a self-reference." Wikipedia is not citing itself in the article in question. The DFP article uses Wikipedia as a source, but that does not run afoul of policy. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Then you run into issues with verifiability. Who do we have to verify this by? A few blogs and message boards, which are not reliable sources. What does the local newspiece say? That Wikipedia mentioned the game, so therefore the game must be notable because it is on Wikipedia. This is very circular logic. Please also take into account the length, relevance, and content of the article and not just the fact that it mentions the game. If the circumstances were the same, but the subject in question were a dog winning a local dog show, would you consider it notable? --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The newspiece cites Wikipedia as an example of how widespread the game's popularity has gotten. That doesn't mean they're treating Wikipedia as a source, nor would that disqualify it. If the circumstances were the same, but the subject in question were a local, unknown dog, maybe it'd be different. This isn't about a dog or a little-known event, though. People who don't watch dog shows typically don't know the names of the dogs. The Detroit Tigers aren't a dog show. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:43, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The newspiece is citing Wiki as an example of how 'widespread' the game's popularity is...but a google search does not back up that claim nor is Wiki an example of popularity as anyone can make an article here. Just look at all these AFDs around this one. Are they automatically 'popular' because they are on wiki? And the DT's are not a dogshow...Yes, you are correct in that, HOWEVER we are not talking about the DT's nor are we talking about the merits of the game's link to the DTs. We are talking about if this Game had any notability beyond the blog that stated they created the game and it merits a page based on such criteria as only having one questionable source....a personal Blog. That stinks of OR. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 19:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, now we're getting somewhere. A Google search is a poor factor of notability, it's why we don't use Google as a verification tool when it comes to verifying notability. So we have to figure out what would be a proper notability situation. As it is a drinking game, it doesn't fit into the basic notability guidelines we have available, so let's look at another aspect: is it verifiable? The answer is yes. Is it original research? If it was before, it isn't now that it has the DFP mention. To quote the nonbinding notability essay (since you're insisting on notability here): "while all "famous" and "important" subjects are notable, not all notable subjects are famous or important." The article is verifiable, it doesn't run afoul of any major policies, so what's the problem? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

The only other source, independent of Wikipedia, put forward that describes this game in any detail is a post on a web log, made a scant few days ago, and that provides no evidence that (despite what the post claims) this game and its rules are not the creation of a single person and that they have actually become a part of the corpus of human knowledge. I cannot find any further sources at all. This article is original research and unverifiable.

For that wildly inappropriate and childish comment, I'll ask that all of your comments be stripped from the argument as they are an amalgamation of how you've been nothing but condescending, presumptuous, and pompous through out the whole debate rendering your side and those on it ineffective and exposing your arguments under the supercilious and pedantic light that you and those on your side inexplicably shine proudly from. 134.215.210.125 22:02, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article may have been tongue-in-cheek, but the fact remains that the Rod Allen Drinking Game is a real thing that has gotten quite a bit of attention (based on the newspaper article, message board posts from 2004 and the lengthy discussion here). The article was pointing out that the ALREADY EXISTING Rod Allen game phenomenon has gotten so big that it even has a wikipedia entry. It's sad that so many people want to have this article deleted. Also, it does not matter that the author of the article said it was a joke; from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>:</li>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">A good way to look at the distinction between verifiability and truth is with the following example. Suppose you are writing a Wikipedia entry on a famous physicist's Theory X, which has been published in peer-reviewed journals and is therefore an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article. However, in the course of writing the article, you contact the physicist and he tells you: "Actually, I now believe Theory X to be completely false." Even though you have this from the author himself, you cannot include the fact that he said it in your Wikipedia entry.</td>
