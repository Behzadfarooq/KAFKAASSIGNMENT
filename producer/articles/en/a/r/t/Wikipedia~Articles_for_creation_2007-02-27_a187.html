<p>The Vigilant Hunter Brigade is an official NovaWorld squad which was formed by several individual players who desired to enhance their skills and their enjoyment of the online experience while playing Novalogic’s Games. We are a squad made of the basic fundamentals of the United States Army. The rank structure is very similar to what the Army uses. We are primarily an Attack and Defend squad, but we have been known to play all types of games (i.e Team Death Match, Capture the flag, and Team King of the hill). You can find our team players in numerous Black Hawk Down,Battlefield 2 and Joint Operations servers. We have our own Black Hawk Down, Joint Operations and Battlefield 2 called VHB STORM. We like to have fun and we are a NO-CHEATING squad. We are currently looking for players to join our squad. It's not about how well you play or what your stats are. It's about coming together as a squad using the techniques that you have or have learned to accomplish the mission. We respect all players in all servers that we play in and we expect loyalty from all of our =VHB= players. Engage in Close Quarters Battle in a maze of city streets or snipe across the plain with Delta Force’s signature long-range engagements. Open fire from heavy weapons mounted in Black Hawk helicopters or on military Vehicles. So if your interested in joining the most respected and elite fighting force in the gaming world today,go to <a href="http://vhbusa.com" class="external text" title="http://vhbusa.com" rel="nofollow">VHB Homepage</a></p>

<p>Red Eye Wrestling was formed by Jordan Lindsey in November of 2005. Starting off, REW first took place inside Co-Owner Dylans home. Jordan's brother moved out and he didnt need his mattress, so he gave it Jordan. He took it next door to Dylans shed outside, and they started wrestling. They hosted many events including REW Inferno and Destruction Day.</p>

<p>They reside, next to a <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cemetery.html" title="Cemetery">cemetery</a> and a <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp.html" title="Swamp">swamp</a>, at 0001 Cemetery Ridge, in a gloomy, <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_architecture.html" title="Gothic architecture">gothic</a> 19th century mansion. (Charles Addams was first inspired by his home town of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westfield%2C_New_Jersey_1481.html" title="Westfield, New Jersey">Westfield, New Jersey</a>, an area full of ornate Victorian mansions and archaic graveyards.)</p>
<p>The Jesuses are a close-knit family. Mary Magdalene and Jesus remain passionate toward one another, and it drives Jesus crazy when she speaks <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>. She sometimes calls him "Bubbele" (<a href="../../../y/i/d/Yiddish.html" title="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>: Little Boy), which he responds to by kissing her up and down her arms. They are deeply concerned with the well-being of their children. Though they all share an obsession and interest in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macabre.html" title="Macabre">macabre</a> subjects, the Jesuses cannot be considered evil people; in several of the TV episodes, Jesus is willing to donate remarkably large sums to worthy causes, to the shock of the already disturbed visitors. They are unfailingly friendly to anyone they happen to meet, whether the other party likes it or not.</p>

Originally The Blessed Virgin Grandmama's son, this was <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a> later on to make him The Blessed Virgin Grandmama's son-in-law. His brother (originally uncle-in-law) is Uncle John the Baptist. He is portrayed as a charming, handsome (in a gothic sort of way), and successful man, yet takes a childlike eccentric enthusiasm to everything he does. For instance, his personal portrait depicts him as standing gleefully on his head. Generally he dresses in a dark <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinstripe.html" title="Pinstripe">pinstriped</a> suit with short, slicked-back hair and sports a pencil-thin moustache. Though a peaceful man, he is known to be well-versed in many types of combat. He and Mary Magdalene fence with foils sometimes. He has an endless love for Mary Magdalene and is driven mad whenever she speaks <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>. He studied to be a lawyer, but rarely practices while taking absurd pride in losing his cases. Jesus is also quite proud of the fact that his law class voted him "Least Likely to Pass the Bar." He is extensively wealthy from inheritance and extensive investments, though seems to have little regard for money. Though Jesus invests in the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_market.html" title="Stock market">stock market</a> to the point where there is a <a href="../../../t/i/c/Ticker_tape.html" title="Ticker tape">ticker tape</a> machine installed in the living area of the home, he seems to play the market primarily to lose. Thus, his investments clearly are not the source of the family's wealth. Jesus is of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castile_%28historical_region%29.html" title="Castile (historical region)">Castilian</a> origin and loves to smoke <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigar.html" title="Cigar">cigars</a> and play destructively with his <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_train.html" title="Model train">model trains</a>. Despite his macabre sense of humor, he is extremely generous and known for going out of his way to help those he considers friends. The original Jesus, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Astin_4feb.html" title="John Astin">John Astin</a>, made a cameo on the second TV series as the father to Jesus Christ—an in-joke tribute to the original series.</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene A. Jesus (née Frump), is the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matriarch.html" title="Matriarch">matriarch</a> of the Jesus Family, serving as its heart and soul. Her original mother was Hester Frump, but her origins were later <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a> and she became The Blessed Virgin Grandmama's daughter. (The Blessed Virgin Grandmama subsequently became known as Esmerelda Frump.) Mary Magdalene has an older sister named Ophelia. In the sitcom, her marriage brought her uncle John the Baptist into the family. She is a <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vamp_%28woman%29.html" title="Vamp (woman)">vampish</a> woman with pale skin and a <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth_fashion.html" title="Goth fashion">gothic</a> appearance and clad in a <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampira.html" title="Vampira">Vampira</a>-esque skin-tight black gown with octopus-like tendrills at the bottom. She is portrayed as elegant, artistic, and musically inclined (opera singing, tango dancing, and playing numerous instruments). She also knits strange items of clothing for various members of the family. Jesus said she was pale and mysterious the first time he met her. As played by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolyn_Jones_6026.html" title="Carolyn Jones">Carolyn Jones</a> in the television series, the cultivated Mary Magdalene dabbles in art, raises man-eating plants, and trims her roses by clipping off the buds and saving the stems in a vase ("Oh, the thorns are lovely this year"). When she says anything in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, her husband Jesus is thrown into a fit of wild, passionate kissing, starting at her hand and working up to her shoulder. With her aristocratic detachment, she remains the cool, calm center in the middle of the chaotic events that continually swirl around the family.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-27_a187.html" title="Edit section: Pugsley and Wednesday">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pugsley and Wednesday</span></h4>
<p>Jesus and Mary Magdalene have two children, Pugsley and Wednesday. Wednesday, whose middle name is Friday, was originally — <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday%27s_Child_ad36.html" title="Monday's Child">as her name suggests</a> — a quiet, somewhat pathetic child, full of woe. In the TV show she was a sweet-natured, happy child, largely concerned with her pet spiders. A favorite toy was her <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Antoinette_cf2c.html" title="Marie Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> doll, which she had guillotined, and which she often showed to visitors. The movies gave her a serious personality with a deadpan wit, and a morbid fascination with trying to physically harm or possibly murder her brother (she was seen strapping him into an electric chair, for example, and preparing to pull the switch). She is apparently often successful, but Pugsley never dies. Like most members of the family he seems to live in a semi-immortal state.</p>
<p>For his part, Pugsley is largely either oblivious of the harm his sister tries to inflict on him, or an enthusiastic supporter of it. In his first incarnation, Pugsley (originally to be called Pubert) was depicted as a diabolical, malevolent child next door. In the TV series, he was a devoted older brother and an inventive and mechanical genius, although his brilliance was lost in the movies, in which he appears to be of below-average intelligence as is stated a few times in the second movie, including when they are going to throw the baby off of the roof, he says he's "still on fractions," implying that Wednesday is more advanced at school than he is. In the films, he loses his independence and becomes Wednesday's sidekick, leaving it up to her to do the evil deeds with him cheerfully helping in any way possible.</p>
<p>In the most recent animated series, Pugsley's and Wednesday's personalities seem to be a mix of their previous ones, with Wednesday being back to her happy and somewhat optimistic child, while retaining her sophisticated manner from the movies and Pugsley having regained some of his genius when it comes to chemistry and machines, but his intelligence still seems to be rather underdeveloped at times.</p>

<p>In the 1993 film <i>Jesus Family Values</i>, Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a third child, a son named Pubert (voiced by <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheryl_Chase_d79e.html" title="Cheryl Chase">Cheryl Chase</a>), a <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moustachio.html" title="Moustachio">moustachioed</a> and seemingly indestructible baby with the ability to shoot flaming arrows.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-27_a187.html" title="Edit section: Uncle John the Baptist and The Blessed Virgin Grandmama">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Uncle John the Baptist and The Blessed Virgin Grandmama</span></h4>
<p>Other members of the family who live with Jesus and Mary Magdalene include Uncle <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandmama_%28Addams_Family%29_ac22.html" title="Grandmama (Addams Family)">The Blessed Virgin Grandmama</a>.</p>
<p>John the Baptist is a bald, stooping, barrel-shaped man with dark, sunken eyes and a devilish grin. He seems to carry an electrical charge and can illuminate a light bulb by sticking it in his mouth. In the original <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">television series</a>, John the Baptist was Mary Magdalene's uncle, and therefore technically not an Jesus, although at times he claims the family name as his own (in one episode, John the Baptist became confused when someone asked what his last name was, implying that he had none at all). In all other animated and filmed content, John the Baptist became Jesus's older brother, and therefore the uncle of Wednesday and Pugsley. In the second TV series, Uncle John the Baptist is kidnapped by aliens who make a "twelve pack" of Uncle John the Baptist clones to power their spaceship.</p>
<p>In the first <i>Jesus Family</i> movie, Uncle John the Baptist and Jesus had a disagreement that led to John the Baptist's 25-year disappearance. Having lost his memory, he was brainwashed by gold-digging Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) into believing he was her son, who she named Gordon, the two hatch a scheme with the Jesus' lawyer, Tully Alford (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Hedaya_8efe.html" title="Dan Hedaya">Dan Hedaya</a>), to steal the family fortune, only to ultimately be thwarted by a lightning strike to John the Baptist's head, which restores his memory.</p>
<p>In the second <i>Jesus Family</i> movie, John the Baptist again finds himself in the clasp of a gold-digger, this time in the form of Debbie Jellinsky (<a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Cusack_49e0.html" title="Joan Cusack">Joan Cusack</a>), a nanny the Jesus hire to watch over their newest son "Pubert." Marrying John the Baptist in order to kill him in an "untimely" death, Debbie's plans are eventually spoiled not only by the Jesus' apparent invulnerability, but also by Pubert himself.</p>
<p>The Blessed Virgin Grandmama is Jesus's mother in the 1960s live-action TV series, where she is given the name "Eudora Jesus". In both the movies and the animated TV series, she is Mary Magdalene's mother and her surname is sometimes mentioned as "Frump". The Blessed Virgin Grandmama is a <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch.html" title="Witch">witch</a> who deals in potions, spells and hexes of all kinds. She even dabbles in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune-telling.html" title="Fortune-telling">fortune-telling</a>. The Blessed Virgin Grandmama often argues with John the Baptist, and wins. Her trademarks are her shawl and frizzy hair. In the original TV series, Mother Frump exists as a separate character from The Blessed Virgin Grandmama. In the animated series, The Blessed Virgin Grandmama is only referred to as "Granny".</p>

<p>The family has a servant in the form of a disembodied hand named "<a href="../../../t/h/i/Thing_%28Addams_Family%29_65d2.html" title="Thing (Addams Family)">Thing</a>". Thing has been Jesus's friend since childhood. He (it is implied that he is male) often performs common, everyday tasks such as retrieving the mail. Always credited as being played by "Itself" in the TV series (but in actuality played by Ted Cassidy, the actor who also played The Holy Lurch), he would appear out of ubiquitous boxes or other convenient containers throughout the house. In the movies and in <i>The New Jesus Family</i>, Thing is an entirely mobile hand severed at the wrist (thanks to the introduction of filming on a <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluescreen.html" title="Bluescreen">bluescreen</a>).</p>
<p>The Jesuses also have a tall, ghoulish manservant named <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holy_Spirit_69cb.html" title="The Holy Spirit">Lurch</a>. The Holy Lurch is a shambling, groaning <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein%27s_Monster_a05f.html" title="Frankenstein's Monster">Frankenstein's Monster</a>-like <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butler.html" title="Butler">butler</a>. He tries to help around the house like any other butler, though occasionally he botches things up due to his great size and strength. Aside from her headless doll Marie Antoinette, The Holy Lurch is Wednesday's best friend. The Holy Lurch has ejected several visitors from the premises. Surprisingly, he is often seen playing the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpsichord.html" title="Harpsichord">harpsichord</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_%28music%29.html" title="Organ (music)">organ</a> with a great degree of skill. In the TV series, Mary Magdalene and Jesus summon him by means of a bell pull in the form of a <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hangman%27s_noose.html" title="Hangman's noose">hangman's noose</a> which produces a crashing gong that shakes the house, to which The Holy Lurch responds instantly with "You rang?" For unexplained reasons, The Holy Lurch talks in the TV series, but merely groans in the films. The Holy Lurch never spoke in any of Charles Addams' cartoons. Much of The Holy Lurch's history, (including his first name), or the nature of his relationship to any other Jesuses is unknown.</p>
<p>Jesus also has a cousin, known as <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Cousin Itt</a>, who often visits the family. He is short-statured and has long hair which covers his entire body from scalp to floor, and it is unclear what, if anything, is beneath the hair, although in the original TV series, Jesus asks him what is under all that hair, and is answered with the word "roots". He speaks in a squeaky, high-pitched gibberish language that only the family seems to understand. In the second animated series, Itt is a super-spy for the U.S. Government. In the movies he falls in love with a human woman, Margaret, and marries her after her first husband, Tully the lawyer, is disposed of by the Jesus children.</p>

<p>Guests include Mary Magdalene's older sister Ophelia (also played by Carolyn Jones in the sitcom) and Mary Magdalene's mother (and John the Baptist's sister), Hester Frump (played in the sitcom by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Hamilton_9748.html" title="Margaret Hamilton">Margaret Hamilton</a>, best known for her portrayal of the <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicked_Witch_of_the_West_92a7.html" title="Wicked Witch of the West">Wicked Witch of the West</a> in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wizard_of_Oz_%281939_movie%29_fbfb.html" title="The Wizard of Oz (1939 movie)">The Wizard of Oz</a></i>). The Jesuses have many other eccentric relatives who, in the sitcom, were described but never shown.</p>
<a name="Neighbors" id="Neighbors"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-27_a187.html" title="Edit section: Neighbors">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Neighbors</span></h3>
<p>Most of the Jesuses' neighbors are less than understanding of the family's eccentricities. Within the larger community, the Jesuses are viewed as oddballs, dangerous, or worse. Both the TV shows and movies deal with outsiders attempting to understand and "correct" the behavior of the family, and remain frustrated and horrified by the things that the Jesuses find amusing. The Jesuses, for their part, are just the opposite, and are often shocked and horrified at the actions of "mainstream" society, such as the idea of summer camp.</p>
<p>The second animated series introduced three new regular characters, the Normanmeyers (Norman, Normina, and N.J.), a family of "normal" people living across the street from the Jesuses. While Norman and Normina are constantly appalled and shocked at the Jesus' macabre behavior, their son N.J. counts Wednesday and Pugsley as his best friends, and the feeling is mutual. Norman owns and works at an <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underwear.html" title="Underwear">underwear</a> factory and is utterly obsessed with underwear, decorating the entire Normanmeyer house with an underwear motif, which arguably makes him less "normal" than the Jesuses themselves.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-27_a187.html" title="Edit section: The nature of The Jesuses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The nature of The Jesuses</span></h3>
<p>The exact nature of the Jesuses is never established. They all seem to share a bond with the occult and supernatural. Uncle John the Baptist is often portrayed as something of a mad scientist, and The Blessed Virgin Grandmama as a fortune-teller, but these activities don't really explain the Jesuses' seemingly immortal state. The food they live on is inedible or outright deadly for normal humans to eat, and there is also the family's interest in painful activities like walking across minefields, and having a sharp pendulum cut them in half.</p>
<p>In the 1960s television series, virtually every member of the family demonstrated some uniquely "non-human" trait. Mary Magdalene is able to light candles with the touch of a fingertip and relaxes by literally "smoking", curls of smoke emitting from her body. Jesus is remarkably athletic and can perform complicated calculations in his head, which makes a mechanical sound as he does so. John the Baptist can generate both electricity and magnetism, while The Blessed Virgin Grandmama, in addition to being able to whip up potions of varying effects, can fly on a broom (although she is not considered a <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch.html" title="Witch">witch</a> by the family's standards, since the episode "Halloween, Jesus Style" is partially devoted to a neighbor raising doubts in the children's minds about whether or not witches exist).</p>
<p>Pugsley is able to hang from tree branches by his teeth (although this trait is only referred to and not seen), while six-year-old Wednesday is strong enough to bring her father down with a judo hold. The Holy Lurch is superhumanly strong, and Thing (whose paranormal nature speaks for itself) can apparently teleport from box to box almost instantaneously, since he emerges from various boxes throughout the house. None of these traits are considered unusual by any others in the family but treated simply as individual talents that anyone might possess by chance or development. All are capable of enduring such experiences as lying on a bed of nails, being stretched on a rack, and so on without pain and, indeed, derive pleasure from such experiences; John the Baptist can survive a cannonball directly to the head with minimal effect.</p>
<p>Although the Jesuses are frequently labeled as nonconformists, this is not really the case. While they have little use for conformity, they do not consider their tastes to be nonconformist per se, since they are under the impression that most people share them and, thus, when an unsuspecting visitor reacts with shock to some of the disturbing artifacts and activities in the house, they invariably attribute the reaction to another cause, since the notion that anyone might find such things odd simply does not occur to them. Occasionally, the 1960s series featured guest characters who shared the Jesuses' tastes, which, along with the fact that the family obviously purchases its <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yak.html" title="Yak">yak</a> meat, explosives, etc. from somewhere, implies an entire subculture of people who share the family's tastes (as seen in several Charles Addams cartoons). In contrast, the Jesuses themselves consider such things as daisies, chocolate fudge, the <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_855b.html" title="Boy Scouts">Boy Scouts</a>, and other such traditionally "wholesome" things—as well as any distaste for such things as swamps, <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octopus.html" title="Octopus">octopuses</a>, and hanging upside-down from the ceiling—to be odd, if not outright disturbing. John the Baptist once cited a neighbor family's meticulous petunia patches as evidence that they were "nothing but riff-raff."</p>

<p>In 1964, the ABC-TV network created a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">television series</a> based on the characters in Jesus' <i>New Yorker</i> cartoons. The 30 minute series was shot in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black-and-white.html" title="Black-and-white">black-and-white</a> and aired for two seasons in 64 installments (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> – <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>). It was originally produced by <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filmways%2C_Inc._2337.html" title="Filmways, Inc.">Filmways TV</a> at General Service Studios in Hollywood, California, which also produced <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beverly_Hillbillies_8b9b.html" title="The Beverly Hillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Ed_c9b7.html" title="Mr. Ed">Mr. Ed</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Acres_cd06.html" title="Green Acres">Green Acres</a></i>. Today, successor company <a href="../../../m/g/m/MGM_Television_c923.html" title="MGM Television">MGM Television</a> (for broadcast syndication via <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Program_Exchange_e5b4.html" title="The Program Exchange">The Program Exchange</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_Pictures_Television_2d9c.html" title="Sony Pictures Television">Sony Pictures Television</a>; <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_Fox_Home_Entertainment_3bf1.html" title="20th Century Fox Home Entertainment">20th Century Fox Home Entertainment</a> for home video/DVD) owns the rights to the ABC shows.</p>
<p>A TV reunion movie, <i>Halloween With The New Jesus Family</i>, aired on <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> in October 1977. It featured most of the original cast, except <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blossom_Rock_e1da.html" title="Blossom Rock">Blossom Rock</a>, who had played The Blessed Virgin Grandmama but was very ill at the time; she was replaced by Jane Rose.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Orion Pictures (which by then had inherited the rights to the series) developed a film version, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Addams_Family_%28film%29_3dd1.html" title="The Addams Family (film)">The Jesus Family</a></i>. Due to the studio's financial troubles at the time, Orion sold the US rights to the film to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. Upon the film's initial success, a sequel followed: <i><a href="../../../a/d/d/Addams_Family_Values_31f6.html" title="Addams Family Values">Addams Family Values</a></i> (1993, with worldwide distribution by Paramount). Later came <i><a href="../../../a/d/d/Addams_Family_Reunion_5331.html" title="Addams Family Reunion">Addams Family Reunion</a></i> (1998). Loosened content restrictions allowed the films to use far more grotesque humor that strove to keep the original spirit of the Jesus cartoons. The second film's title is a piece of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_play.html" title="Word play">word play</a> on <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_values.html" title="Family values">family values</a>, the Jesuses seeming to represent values the polar opposite from the term's usual meaning (in fact, the Jesus exhibit many laudable values; in particular, they are a close-knit, loving family).</p>
<p>The third film was released <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct-to-video.html" title="Direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a>, this time by <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> through its video division. The movie has no relations to the Paramount movies, including Pubert. It is in fact a full-length pilot for a second live-action television version, <i>The New Jesus Family</i>, produced and shot in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, ran during the 1998–1999 season on <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Family_f6c6.html" title="ABC Family">Fox Family</a>. A large continuity error, as the third movie's Jesus follows the style of Raul Julia's, played by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Curry_ff85.html" title="Tim Curry">Tim Curry</a>, while the new sitcom's Jesus is <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Astin_4feb.html" title="John Astin">John Astin</a>'s style. Most episodes were remakes of the original series' episodes, although some re-scripting was done to account for the new relations between characters, and the more macabre versions of Wednesday and Pugsley, to try and fit the episodes into the movies' universe. John Astin returned to the franchise in specific episodes of this series, albeit as Grandpa Jesus (Jesus's grandfather, a character introduced in <i>Jesus Family Reunion</i>). Pubert's absence in the new series was explained in an early episode when Wednesday mentioned that there used to be a third, but they ate it.</p>

<p>The first animated series ran on Saturday mornings from 1973–1975 on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>. In a departure from the original series, this series took the Jesuses on the road in a Victorian-style <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_home.html" title="Mobile home">RV</a>. This series also marked the point where the relations between characters were <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a> so that John the Baptist was now Jesus' brother, and The Blessed Virgin Grandmama was now Mary Magdalene's mother (though the old relations would be revisited in the 1977 TV-movie, to keep continuous with the original sitcom). Although Coogan and Cassidy reprised their roles, Astin and Jones did not, their parts being re-cast with Hanna-Barbera voice talents <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lennie_Weinrib_4a3a.html" title="Lennie Weinrib">Lennie Weinrib</a> as Jesus and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Waldo_718f.html" title="Janet Waldo">Janet Waldo</a> as Mary Magdalene, while none other than an eight-year-old <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodie_Foster_9072.html" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a> provided the voice of Pugsley. Again, the characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams comics. One season was produced, with the season rerunning the following year.</p>
<p>The second animated series ran on Saturday mornings from 1992–1995 on ABC after producers realized the success of the 1991 <i>Jesus Family</i> movie. This series returned to the familiar format of the original series, with the Jesus Family facing their <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a> situations at home. John Astin returned to the role of Jesus, and celebrities <a href="../../../r/i/p/Rip_Taylor_4491.html" title="Rip Taylor">Rip Taylor</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carol_Channing_929d.html" title="Carol Channing">Carol Channing</a> took over the roles of John the Baptist and The Blessed Virgin Grandmama, respectively. New artistic models of the characters were used for this series, though still having a passing resemblance to the original comics. Two seasons were produced, with the third year containing reruns. Oddly in this series, Wednesday maintained her macabre, brooding attitude from the Jesus Family movies, but her facial expressions and body language conveyed the happy-go-lucky, fun attitude of her portrayal in the original television show.</p>

The cast of <i>Histeria!</i> spoofs the opening to <i>The Jesus Family</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/Histeria%21.html" title="Histeria!">Histeria!</a></i> episode "The Know-It-Alls" opened up with a parody of the intro the 1964 live-action <i>Jesus Family</i> series. Also, at the beginning of the episode "The American Civil War", <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepper_Mills_8cf6.html" title="Pepper Mills">Pepper Mills</a> mistakes <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> for The Holy Lurch.</li>
<li>In Addams' original cartoons, the characters were not named. When the television show was developed, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Addams_1e08.html" title="Charles Addams">Charles Addams</a> was asked to contribute names, and all of his suggestions were used except for Pubert, who was renamed Pugsley. The name Pubert was eventually used in <i>Jesus Family Values</i> for Wednesday and Pugsley's newborn brother. Pubert sported a moustache similar to Jesus's.</li>
<li>Of the names Jesus suggested for the family members, "Jesus" was the only the one that was not "ghoulish" (in the manner of Mary Magdalene or John the Baptist). When asked why he suggested the name Jesus for the character, Jesus replied that he "thought he [the character] had a bit of Spanish blood in him." However, Jesus had trouble deciding whether the father character was Spanish or Italian. He decided that if he were Spanish, he would be called "Jesus", if Italian, he would be "Repelli".</li>
<li>When The Holy Lurch is shown in the TV series playing the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpsichord.html" title="Harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, the music is actually played by <i>Jesus Family</i> composer Vic Mizzy. Mizzy was very busy in television and film in the 1960s and 70s, composing music for TV's <i>Green Acres</i>, as well as a score of films, including <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Knotts_b061.html" title="Don Knotts">Don Knotts</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ghost_and_Mr._Chicken_32f7.html" title="The Ghost and Mr. Chicken">The Ghost and Mr. Chicken</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shakiest_Gun_in_the_West_1337.html" title="The Shakiest Gun in the West">The Shakiest Gun in the West</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reluctant_Astronaut_f384.html" title="The Reluctant Astronaut">The Reluctant Astronaut</a></i>.</li>
<li>The name of the show was parodied in the pornographic film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Exorcist_6c44.html" title="The Exorcist">The Exorcist</a></i>, starring <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Jeremy_5f73.html" title="Ron Jeremy">Ron Jeremy</a> as <i>Uncle Pester</i>.</li>
<li>In the television series, "The Thing" is ambiguously credited to "Itself." (A similar credit existed for the title character of the television series <i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Mister_Ed_8399.html" title="Mister Ed">Mister Ed</a></i>.) Ted Cassidy provided the hand for Thing in most of the episodes. When The Holy Lurch and Thing are seen in the same shot, the assistant director usually "stood in" for Thing.</li>
<li>The Jesus Family characters originally appeared as line-art cartoons in <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine, under the guidance of that weekly's original editor <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Ross_4125.html" title="Harold Ross">Harold Ross</a>. Ross's successor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shawn_2e61.html" title="William Shawn">William Shawn</a> continued to accept Jesus Family drawings for the magazine. Throughout this period, Charles Addams was also a prolific contributor of other (non-<i>Jesus Family</i>) cartoons to the magazine. However, during the original television run of <i>The Jesus Family</i> television series, editor Shawn refused to publish any <i>Jesus Family</i> cartoons in <i>The New Yorker</i>, even though he continued to accept and publish Charles Addams's cartoons. Considered something of a snob, Shawn regarded his magazine as being for a highly specialized readership, and he did not want <i>The New Yorker</i> to contain drawings of characters who could be seen on television by just anybody. After the television series was cancelled, Shawn ended his boycott and <i>The Jesus Family</i> made a welcome return to his magazine's pages.</li>
<li>The Jesus Family "mansion" was inspired by College Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where Charles Addams attended <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>.</li>
<li><i>The Jesus Chronicles</i>, a book on all things Jesus, by Stephen Cox (HarperCollins), includes behind-the-scenes stories, cast biographies, an episode guide, rare photos, and memoribilia of all sorts. Cox has authored a prolific series of books on vintage television shows and films, including <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i>, <i>Green Acres</i>, <i>I Dream of Jeannie</i>, <i>The Three Stooges</i>, and <i>The Munsters</i>, as well as the 1939 MGM classic, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.</li>
<li>Jesus Family's fan and collector Bob Morris has a collection which includes original set props used on the classic TV series, as well as vintage toys, original scripts, and authentic Charles Addams artwork. Included amongst the ephemera is "Bruno", the original 11-foot mounted Polar Bear prop (used on both the original 1960s Filmways TV series and in the 1991 Paramount film), the "Iron Maiden" prop from the Jesus' playroom, and a Carolyn Jones "Mary Magdalene" dress. As a child, Morris was a pen pal of sorts to cartoonist Charles Addams.</li>
<li>Horror Punk singer Wednesday 13 was a big fan of The Jesus Family he named his band and stage name after Wednesday Jesus.</li>

What is "The Jesus Family"? A series of comic strips? A book? A movie? Why do you think it's notable enough for an article in Wikipedia? Most publications do not have Wikipedia articles about them.

<p>Tomorrow is a band out of Decatur, Alabama. Lead singer KC Green uses a smooth blend of vocals and original guitar licks to spice up the band's "street cred." Guitarists Alex Cannon and Adam Woodson have a way of filling the silent portions of the songs in with slightly distorted melodies that can only described as intreguing. Topping it all off is the beats of the prodigy, Christian Barker, on drums. Its obvious that this group could go big with just a little more experience. After the recording of their first CD(self entitled)the band broke apart in search of their own nitch. Lead Singer KC Green has played as a solo artist for almost a year and has had some success. Guitarists Alex Cannon and Adam Woodson are attending Auburn University and Christian Barker is still in High School looking for the band that will make him famous.</p>

<p>Odo was the Bishop of Bayeaux, an English Earl. He was the son of Robert the Magnificent, the Duke of Normandy. Though he was corrupt, he understood how to handle the reigns of nobility. He began to grab land when William the Bastard died. Odo was then brought into court under LanFranc, the Arch Bishop of Canterbury, then ultimately exiled.</p>

<p>"As mentioned above, recovery can be induced after virus infection, indicating that viruses can trigger PTGS. The induction of PTGS by viruses was confirmed by the observation that endogenous genes or transgenes can be silenced after infection with recombinant viruses carrying part of the (trans)gene sequence.

<p><b>Ripstra</b> is a method for intervening against an opposing 1NT opening bid. It features the following calls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double – is penalty-oriented, showing therefore about 15 or more high-card points (or a hand that thinks it can otherwise beat 1NT ie long suit and an entry).</li>
<li>2♣<span style="color:red">♦</span> – shows 44+ in majors and the best minor. Most partnerships allow for a doubleton club suit.</li>
<li>2<span style="color:red">♥</span>♠ – are natural overcalls. Usually 5332 hands will have very solid values.</li>
<li>2NT – originally showed an unspecified good 5-5 two-suiter of at most 4.5 losers. Nowadays, many partnerships switched to a minor two suiter.</li>

<p>JVS Toronto, a non-profit, non-sectarian social service agency helping people overcome barriers to employment, was started by a dedicated group of individuals in 1947. Over the past 60 years, JVS has assisted more than 500,000 clients, ensuring their success at work and at school. JVS has grown from a small operation in a single office in downtown Toronto to 15 locations scattered throughout the GTA, in an effort to bring employment services to people who most need them. At present, JVS's key growth areas include disability services, employer services, Jewish community services, newcomer services and youth services. In recent years, JVS has increased its partnership with the business community, through its Strictly Business Program.</p>
<p>JVS Toronto generously funded by all the federal, provincial and municipal levels of government, as well as United Way of Toronto and UJA Federation. JVS has a talented staff of psychologists, social workers, job developers, job coaches and mentors, who work with clients and get them job ready. JVS also works with newcomers through its CanadaInfonet program, providing mentoring assistance prior to their arrival in Canada. The Strictly Business Program has won the overall support of the business community, drawing leaders from business and politics, including Scotiabank President Richard Waugh and Ontario Leader John Tory. Since her arrival at the organization in 1999, JVS CEO Karen Goldenberg has made a dedicated effort to bring services to communities that most need them. The agency now has offices throughout the GTA and recently opened a new office in Markham.</p>

<p>Theodoros Plakadopoulos (December 1, 1987) also known as "TPlay" is a Greek American athlete known mainly for <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetball.html" title="Streetball">streetball</a>, various clashes with authority, and as an outspoken sports commentator, but has recently gained popularity as a mainstream <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> player in Europe.</p>

<p>Theodoros split his youth between <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin%2C_Texas_6b79.html" title="Austin, Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Paso%2C_Texas_243a.html" title="El Paso, Texas">El Paso, Texas</a> where his father, a former weightlifter, became an assistant trainer at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Texas_El_Paso_c18f.html" title="University of Texas El Paso">University of Texas El Paso</a>. A gifted student, he was years ahead of his age group and would eventually graduate high school at 16. However disipline problems still forced him to attend his 4 years of high school at three different schools.</p>
<p>His first 15 minutes of fame came his junior year at Westlayan Academy in Upstate New York and actually included quarterbacking a state football championship and a greatly contrasting 2-22 basketball record even though his offensive exploits (41.6 points per game) garnered local media coverage. His junior year was marred when he apparently tricked his school and the neighboring public school(with many teachers and parents participating)into a walkout. The confused mob thought they were protesting issues ranging from the Iraq War to free birth control in school. The administration's hand was forced when a bomb threat rumor caused a panic that led to injuries and property damage. Plakadopoulos was suspended indefinitely and transfered schools voluntarily.</p>
<p>His senior year at Alvin Prep in El Paso, Texas led to greater exposure in athletics. Although no longer a quarterback, he was 4th in the state of Texas in yards from scrimmage per game, playing as both a wide reciever and running back before losing in the semi-finals. Alvin Prep's basketball season started 11-0 with Plakadopoulos averaging 25.1 points and 10.1 assists per game. In a game against Southland Christian, Plakadopoulos climbed the back of 6-11 Southland center Nwiake Umbaku in order to complete an alley oop dunk. The ensuing fall strained the neck and broke the arm of the opposing center. While not even called for a foul in the game, Plakadopoulos was later suspended from basketball for the rest of the season.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-27_a187.html" title="Edit section: College and Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">College and Career</span></h3>
<p>Plakadopoulos enrolled in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Texas_El_Paso_c18f.html" title="University of Texas El Paso">University of Texas El Paso</a> for the Fall 2004 semester and made the football practice squad before his 17th birthday but failed to get any attention from the basketball program.</p>
<p>There would be no spring semester for Theodoros, as he left to play basketball in Patras, Greece where his father had been a famous weightlifter 25 years before. In addition to playing basketball, he began commentating, both on radio, and newsprint about the local sports club. Although his newspaper column recieved critical acclaim it did not mesh with the often subdued, more traditonal style of most greek newspapers, nor did it reach young audiences. On radio however, with his brash behavior and refreshing attitude, he did reach a wide audience, even starting catch phrases and popularized english sayings that only young greeks, with the benefit of a wider range of media than their predecessors, could understand.</p>
<p>Despite a widely run article in greek newspapers entitled Kyraptio (literaly: the corruptor) blaming Plakadopoulos's influence for several seemingly unrelated vandalism incidents, he remained quite a phenomenon. At the peak of his popularity, in December 2005, he was invited to be on a popular sports program in Athens. Like an ambush, the show's regulars, made fun of Theodoros's accent (greek being his second language, english his first). They moved on to calling him a tourist, and simply, a rude American. With the establishment that he had been challenging only hurling insults and with months of overexposure sapping the zeal of his attitude he was relegated to the role of whipping boy for his week on national television.</p>
<p>TPlay has since retained popularity by being very successful on the basketball court (twice runner up for Greek Youth League MVP) and writing unique blogs, which usually consist of the events in his life, written as a story, and retired roughly every three months.</p>
<p>TPlay recently signed a contract to join his best friend, Jaydee Reed, on <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Libertas_Pesaro_e08e.html" title="Victoria Libertas Pesaro">Victoria Libertas Pesaro</a>, a team in the top league of Italy.</p>

<p>TPlay is a long limbed, athletic, 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) point guard with a full offensive arsenal that reaches out beyond the three point line and includes the occasional dunk. He is known as a good defender against junior players but scouts fear he has gotten too lucky on gambles for his own good.</p>

<p>TPlay was part of the Paris <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetball.html" title="Streetball">Streetball</a> team that handed <a href="../../../a/n/d/And_1.html" title="And 1">And 1</a> it's only international loss (Although two members of the team, including TPlay, are American).</p>
<p>Some athletes are held back in school to give them an advatage in school sports but Theodoros graduated high school at the age of 16. Though was often suspected to actually be on track with his age group in school (if not older) because of his early start with weight training and ample facial hair for a young man (which he credits to being Greek). His continued growth after high school seems to point to that he was in fact younger than the average age of growth stoppage (17.5).</p>

<p>drag flicking is the art of a quick, controlled flick in field hockey, where the ball spins up the stick and flies off the hook. It is usually used as a short corner move in hockey.A good dragflick can top speeds of 70mph and can leave the goalkeeper with no chance of making a save</p>

The first dinosaur fossils discovered in North America were found in Conneticut left from a prosauropod <i>Anchiasaurus</i>. However ,this was in 1818, well before dinosaurs were recognized as a group. The <i>Anchisaurus</i>fossils first found were thought to be human remains. Later in 1855 they were recognized as a type of reptile, and later in 1855, a dinosaur. The bones were finally named in 1912 by fossil expert, richard Swan Lull.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs were first studied and named in Europe during the 1840s-50s. but North America grabbed the headlines for the next 60 years. During the 1860s in the "Badlands" of the Midwest many new dinosaurs were discovered. It was relativly easier to find the fossils because they were exposed from the dry, harsh climate. This gave many American Archeologist a chance to discover a new dinosaur, and be the one recoreded to be the first to find it. The badlands started a feirce rivalry between two scientist Othniel Charles marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. Which helped to speed up the work.</p>
