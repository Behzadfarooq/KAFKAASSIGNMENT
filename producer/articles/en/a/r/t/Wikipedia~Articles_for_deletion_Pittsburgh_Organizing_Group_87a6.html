<dd><b>Administrator's reasoning</b>: The debate below was exactly a tie between well-reasoned debaters. However, the important point is the provision of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The sources provided in the article, and quoted below, are absurdly limited if the organisation has the claimed notability. There were, in effect, three sources. One of these was the organisation itself - not reliable in so far as Wikipedia would require for obvious reasons. Another was cparchives.com - this one is good, but is clearly firmly biased towards such organisations - I can't get anything that would suggest a neutral point of view from it. The best source was post-gazette.com, but sadly it managed to rarely refer to the group itself, sticking to talking about "protesters" in general - nothing relaible when it comes to making a decision on the verifiability and notability of the subject of the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, on grounds of Wikipedia policy, I'm going with a delete because my researches agree with the delete people's arguments below. However, nothing in this decision prevents the article being recreated and I would encourage the keep people to do so - but the resulting article needs to have far less to do with the organisation's view of themselves and far more to do with reliable, third-party sources. The decision is, of course, open to review and does not reflect any personal opinion or bias I may or may not have on the subject at hand. <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">RΞDVΞRS</font></a> ✖ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers"><font color="thistle">ЯΞVΞЯSΞ</font></a></b> 21:20, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a well known group in Pittsburgh that gets significant amounts of corporate media coverage and is well known in the peace movement. Please see <a href="http://www.organizepittsburgh.org/index.php?page=media" class="external free" title="http://www.organizepittsburgh.org/index.php?page=media" rel="nofollow">http://www.organizepittsburgh.org/index.php?page=media</a> for examples of corporate media coverage. I will shorten it if desired. I don't have a lot of experience on Wiki but my expansion of the article was just an attempt to flesh out what was there and include some more info on why the group is considered controversial. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.72.108.167 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.72.108.167_c3bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.72.108.167">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Several sources are given, but none really say anything about the Pittsburgh Organizing Group, although some protests they are involved with have made the news. The group could be mentioned in a larger article, I suppose, but there really aren't sources to back up any of the info in this article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:15, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The only real question (as for other groups without a formal structure) is whether they are actually a named body of people. The city paper thinks they are, and calls them by that name in several article. This is sufficient. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, then, I guess we could reduce the entire article to "The Pittsburgh Organizing Group is a group in Pittsburgh that has organized several protests." Virtually all the rest of the info is sourced from the group itself. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:30, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Delete - if you look at the City Paper, and college papers many of the articles are written BY a "participant" in POG. Basically, any news they make they report on themselves if the news doesn't cover it and never actually reference any other source. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.3.249.202 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.3.249.202_5058.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.3.249.202">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 69.3.249.202 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.3.249.202_5058.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.3.249.202">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<p>This is getting ridiculous. None of those City Paper articles were written by a participant in POG. Chris Potter is the editor of City Paper and Marty Levine was the news editor when these articles were published. Both are well respected and paid journalists. What in particular needs to be sourced and I will source it. You can see by looking a the media page for this group that there are about 100 corporate news stories that info can be sources from. Should I simply put an attribution to back up each and every line in this article? To do so would make for a fairly ridiculous read but I'll do so if necessary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.17.162.248 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.17.162.248_0f9d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.17.162.248">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 70.17.162.248 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.17.162.248_0f9d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.17.162.248">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per the half-dozen articles in the <i>Post-Gazette</i>, which is certainly independent and reliable. There's nothing wrong with having been covered by one source over a period of time. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:24, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A shadowy outfit whose existence isn't attested by reliable sources. All we have is that there is some group of people, who protest in Pittsburgh, that the Post-Gazette is willing to call the 'Pittsburgh Organizing Group.' This group seems to have no named leaders or members (people who, when interviewed, say that they are members). It's not clear why we should call it a 'Group.' The blog posting that is linked from the article (by Jonathan Barnes) implies that the members' anonymity is their choice. If they are too shadowy to have named members, perhaps they are too shadowy for Wikipedia. Seems like the possibility of a hoax. Their contact address is said to be at the Thomas Merton Center. Maybe that Center would be a more logical subject of an article? The Center actually seems to exist. If the article is kept, note that many of the details in the article (as noted above by other commenters in the AfD) are attested only by the group's web site, so they would have to be removed as unsourced. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 05:05, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
