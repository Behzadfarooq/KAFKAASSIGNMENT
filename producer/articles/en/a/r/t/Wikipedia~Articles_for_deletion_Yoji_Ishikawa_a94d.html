<dd><b>Response</b>. I hope you don't mind my slight reformatting of your comment. The former claim: As you may know, books of cheesecake photos (<i>gurabia</i>) come out in Japan very rapidly. There are so many that even the illustrious folk who dutifully write up articles for <i>guraidoru</i> (bikini models) usually don't bother to list them, but there <i>is</i> a list for the pneumatic <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanai_Miri_9dce.html" title="Hanai Miri">Hanai Miri</a>. Note how many books of photos of her there have been in just three years. This list is complete with the "Romanji [sic] title" of each, but the photographer isn't mentioned, probably because very few people care. Some of these photographers — e.g. Sawatari Hajime and of course Shinoyama Kishin — are of course known, and perhaps justly so. (I've seen excellent, non-cheesecake stuff by Shinoyama.) But the mere fact that Ishikawa has churned out the photos for a number of examples of this dubious species of photobook doesn't impress me at all. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC) ..... slightly rephrased 08:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response</b>: please don't quote Fleabay descriptions such as "extremely rare" or "famous". Even via Abebooks, which normally is considerably more civilized, there's at least one US dealer of east Asian books, a member of various serious-sounding organizations, who systematically describes every single book as "rare", "scarce", etc. I never even glance at Fleabay for books, but for cameras, even the Zorki-4 is routinely "rare". But yes, some people are paying lots of money for some of Ishikawa's books. Is this because of their perceived <i>photographic</i> value, or their titillatory (or other) value? As for the comparisons, offhand I'm not familiar with the latter pair, but I am hazily familiar with the Sturges and Mann. They're published (other than by publishers of <i>gurabia</i>, they're discussed, and they're exhibited. And Ishikawa? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 14:43, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And the other quotes&#160;? you answer only to the Ebay one. We have here a verifiable non-Ebay Internet quote by Violeta Gomez, a notable photograph by your benchmark, since she has done exhibitions and been discussed, which says "well-known photographers such as Irina Ionescu or Yoji Ishikawa" . So should we delete Ionesco too&#160;?<a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 14:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/spaincensorship/untouched.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/spaincensorship/untouched.html" rel="nofollow">Your first (Geocities) link</a> lists various photographers and "the Belgian anonymous unpubescent <i>[sic]</i> girls who Yoji Ishikawa photographed twenty years ago" as coming to the mind of the writer (Soren Peñalver, a new name to me) as he views photos by Violeta Gomez (another new name to me). That's all that Peñalver says about Ishikawa. <a href="http://www.thefileroom.org/documents/dyn/DisplayCase.cfm/id/502" class="external text" title="http://www.thefileroom.org/documents/dyn/DisplayCase.cfm/id/502" rel="nofollow">Your second one</a>, by Violeta Gomez, says "the judge confiscated all the photographs and ordered a raid at my house seizing all my prints and negatives, the exhibitions' leaflets, as well as my literary works, videotapes and some art books by well-known photographers such as Irina Ionescu or Yoji Ishikawa." That's all that Gomez says about him. You make the notability of Gomez an issue. It's not fair to judge her merits by the single, Hallmarky photo on display at that second link, but "Violeta Gomez" (of course <i>any</i> "Violeta Gomez") gets just over a thousand Google hits, so she too hardly seems to be all that much discussed.

<li>Did I say that notability depends on the background of the contributors? I didn't, and I'm not sure I understand what you're asking either.

<li>Only to a far-right American politician or talk-show host, I think. Contributions about the French are fine. (Or anyway, I hope they are, because I make them.) But actually I've lost sight of who it is that you're both talking about.

<li>Ok, let me be more explicit. I think it should stay because it is an interesting footnote in the (awful) history of paedophilia in Belgium. I have found very interesting that this is a pre-Dutroux affair thing (I think that his 'collectible' body of work dates back from the early eighties), but when you look at the work he has done in Europe, it is always pictures of Belgian girls taken in bourgeois houses of Belgium, or in the case of Sophie, of Spanish holiday getaways.

<ul>
<li>I really don't know. But is it really a footnote in this history? If so, I'd expect to read this; however, Ishikawa is not mentioned in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Dutroux_6c38.html" title="Marc Dutroux">Marc Dutroux</a>, or in the articles about him in the languages of Belgium: <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_Dutroux" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_Dutroux" rel="nofollow">(fr:) Affaire Dutroux</a>, or <a href="http://wa.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afwaire_Dutroux" class="external text" title="http://wa.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afwaire_Dutroux" rel="nofollow">(wa:) Afwaire Dutroux</a>, or <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaak-Dutroux" class="external text" title="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaak-Dutroux" rel="nofollow">(nl:) Zaak-Dutroux</a>. Indeed, Ishikawa is mentioned nowhere in French, Wallon, Dutch or Japanese Wikipedia. And even within en-Wikipedia, his significance to photography, paedophilia, etc etc is so great that not a single article other than a disambig page and a list links to the article about him. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:07, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's right. Nobody can <i>prove</i> that somebody is not noteworthy. There's always a possibility that that person is noteworthy, and that evidence for this hasn't yet surfaced. It's for the advocates of the article to come up with evidence that the person is indeed noteworthy. If that evidence comes after the article is deleted, a superior replacement article can then be created. Simple re-creation of a deleted article is of course grounds for speedy deletion; but if this article is deleted because of a lack of evidence that (i) Ishikawa has published books notable for his contribution to them, (ii) Ishikawa's work is more than minimally discussed, or (iii) Ishikawa has had no substantial solo exhibitions of his work, and if somebody later creates an article presenting plausible evidence that one or more of (i)–(iii) is mistaken, then that new article can be written accordingly and won't be speedied.
