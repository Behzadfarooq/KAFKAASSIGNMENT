Honestly, the new references added don't help - a recording of a video on youtube, a blog, and a press release, along with another reference. We need something a bit more independent here.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: This is not a neologisms, the term is well defined in article, and is not ambiguously used by others, <i>ism</i>, or <i>ist</i> is not added to word for undue weight on a root word, This is not original research, i don't belong to any of the orgs, and actually dont fully agree with them, so im not self promoting. I wrote more than a definition, it clearly does not reads a dictionary entry. I will add more sources, because you are correct. It needs to be cited as more than a word in an article.

<li>Popular usage: It is true this is not commonly used, however that is not good reason for deletion. It is not an ambitious term. It is not used by a single group, I found 4 seprete news sources using kopimist in their articles. All independent from each other, all unaffiliated with the organizations, and they are not blogs</li>

<li>POV issue: Yes the list of opponents is long and well noted. I will actually delete them. Although it is obvious that they would oppose this philosophy, they have not specifically commented on komimists.</li>
<li><i>self</i> Promotion: As i said, i am not affiliated with any of them at all. The word is used by multiple anti-copyright groups and is used by other sources to describe them, including opponents. Also this term is used to refer to a people with an ideology, so inherently it is promoted/used by those people. Scientology promoted by Scientologists, anarchy promoted by anarchists, etc</li>

<li>I have merged the relevant data to the pirate bay as suggested, however i still think there is significant information in this article. I have added a significant amount of sources. 6 sources, and 8 relevant links. This is much more than most wikipedia articles. I believe I have made a valid argument for each of the complaints on this page, or i have corrected them. So i don't think this should be deleted.
<dl>
<dd>And on a more personal note. I dont understand the opposition to new information being added to wikipedia just because it is not commonly know. If a word is used by more than a small isolated group of people it should be acceptable. Local bands, high schools, small companies, towns, mayors, etc should all be acceptable. If it can make it into the news whether local or global, it should be acceptable. Wikipedia should not be so picky about what is acceptable information and what is not. I knew about mp3s before most of the world knew of them, no one i knew was aware of them. so should i have kept it secret until it made it on cnn. If <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraunhofer.html" title="Fraunhofer">Fraunhofer</a> had written an article would it be self-promoting, and for quick deletion. If somebody wants to know what a kopimist is they should be able to find it on wikipedia.(i have found a couple of forums were people have asked that very question) I am an archivist and have archived about 100,000 <a href="../../../d/a/t/Datasheet.html" title="Datasheet">datasheets</a> at <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archive.org.html" title="Archive.org">archive.org</a> most of those chip are almost completely unknown and very few if any care about them. But lost information is a terable thing. At least in my opinion. <a href="../../../z/y/m/User%7EZyMOS_4fc8.html" title="User:ZyMOS">ZyMOS</a> 02:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The term "kopimist" or "kopimi" doesn't seem to appear on the piratebay website you linked to, even on their "About" page. Therefore, it's not a source for the term. On the kopimi.com site you linked to, there's just a public domain logo. Nothing about the "information wants to be free" philosophy the article mentions. The Urban Dictionary definition for "kopimi" just says that it means something can be copied. Basically, it seems to be a logo signifying that something is in the public domain. Again, nothing about this philosophy. Furthermore, Urban Dictionary isn't generally considered a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The no-war-against-ladonia.blogspot.com talks about "Kopimists" but never really defines the term. Again, blogs are not generally considered reliable sources. From <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>:</li>

<dd><i>School crazes, fads, and fashions can end up covered in Wikipedia, but only if someone first sits down and researches them, and publishes a book, an academic paper, or a magazine/journal article detailing that research. Such resources are reliable, and therefore the subject can become eligible for Wikipedia.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>OK, it's talking about fads and fashions there, but the same can be extended to new words that no one outside of a very small group is using. <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> specifically says that it's necessary to have a source talking <i>about</i> the term, not just <i>using</i> it, before an article is appropriate for inclusion in WP. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 03:19, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

The page is about kopimists not kopime, that page is cited only in that portion. not the main artical. It is not in academic papers but i would imagine 90% of wikipedia articles do not have them as sources. Urban Dictionary isn't a reliable source that is why i have multiple other sources to back the definition up. Kopimi is relevent because multiple sources describe that as the origin, so its would inproper to not mention that. <a href="http://no-war-against-ladonia.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-kopimists-conquered-internets-and.html" class="external free" title="http://no-war-against-ladonia.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-kopimists-conquered-internets-and.html" rel="nofollow">http://no-war-against-ladonia.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-kopimists-conquered-internets-and.html</a> , <a href="http://www.kopimi.com/kopimi/" class="external free" title="http://www.kopimi.com/kopimi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kopimi.com/kopimi/</a> , <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kopimi" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kopimi" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kopimi</a> all talk about the term not just use it. It is true that not all the sources are <i>reliable</i>. But many are and all pages confirm that same thing. It is true that many of the sources are self serving, but is would be improper to not cite them and many of the the sources are not self serving. So i think i covered all the arguments listed about. But even if all my arguments are bunk, whats the harm in having more information. It the word gets more popular them more will be added. if it doesnt is remains a small unpopular article for anyone that wants to know about it. <a href="../../../z/y/m/User%7EZyMOS_4fc8.html" title="User:ZyMOS">ZyMOS</a> 21:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
