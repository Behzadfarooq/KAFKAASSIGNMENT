<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is all been discussed before, as can be seen on both the discussion page of the list article as well as the discussion page of <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a>. I see no indication in this discussion so far that anyone here looked at any of those discussions. I initiated a discussion there to get a consensus on whether to put the list at the bottom of that article or in its own article in large part because the list is more extensive than, say, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monacle.html" title="Monacle">Monacle</a> or <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_hat.html" title="Top hat">Top hat</a>. Is there an objection to having articles on these subjects? Then nominate them all. If <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a> is justified, then a list is justified and the only question is whether to put it all on one page or separate it out for convenience and considerations of article size.
<dl>
<dd><b>unencyclopedic</b> — <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a> is not unencyclopedic, therefore the list isn't either. In fact, the list is closely linked to the <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a> article (see "trivial" below).</dd>
<dd><b>indiscriminate</b> — the list is meant to be made up of well-known people or fictional characters or other entities known for their bow ties. There is nothing indiscriminate about that. Please justify use of that word.</dd>
<dd><b>trivial</b> — evidently not to the many famous people on that list or the millions of bow tie wearers. Incidentally, when a man is thinking about wearing a bow tie or other prominent fashion accessory (top hat, monocle, french cuffs, cigarette holder) he thinks about what associations the tie has. A very important consideration in that regard is what well-known people are strongly associated with it, therefore the list is important.</dd>
<dd><b>unverified</b> — Cute. For every list on Wikipedia with a "verified" list, I can show you 1,000 without, and you all know it. The only verification I've ever seen on any list are the footnotes I've put on list items myself. Do you really want a footnote to confirm that Boo Boo the bear in the Hanna Barbera cartoon always wears a bow tie?</dd>

<li>I note that neither List of monocle wearers nor List of top hat wearers exists as a separate article. If they did, I would nominate them for deletion as well. <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_hat.html" title="Top hat">Top hat</a> contains a list within it, which itself lacks sourcing and so is subject to removal at any time. <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monocle.html" title="Monocle">Monocle</a> lists a few examples of monocle wearers and offers some context for their inclusion.

<li>How so? Can you draw some sort of scholarly connection among the people who wear bow ties? Or is it an arbitrary characteristic? If a person is known for his or her bow tie, it should go in that person's article. GassyGuy 02:26, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here's how: Some people are known for wearing bow ties. It is a part of their public image. Which public figures wear bow ties affects how men (and maybe women) view the wearing of bow ties. They think about this kind of thing if they're thinking about wearing a bow tie or monocle (or whatever) regularly. Use a cigarette holder regularly and you're going to bring up images of FDR (if you're a man) or Holly Golightly if you're a woman. Associations with famous wearers is the kind of thing that almost automatically comes to mind when people see somebody with any relatively rare fashion accessory. It's inherently part of the subject of bow tie. The justification for having the list on a separate page from <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a> is simply because it's rather long. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 02:48, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, don't take my word for it. Take Joseph Epstein's <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=95000421" class="external text" title="http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=95000421" rel="nofollow">word for it</a>. Oh, I forgot, you guys don't indicate that you consider any other ideas before making condemnations. Here's a quote then (pay attention to the middle paragraph; emphasis added):<br />
In a long essay on American English usage in the current issue of Harper's, the novelist David Foster Wallace refers to linguistic pedants and their "snobbishness and bow-tied anality." Nicholson Baker, in "Double Fold," his recent book about the destruction of newspaper files in libraries, seems to have his villains neatly turned out in bow ties: A man named Verner Clapp is a "polymathic bowtie wearer," and the historian and former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin is described as a "chronic bowtie wearer." As a terminal bow-tie wearer myself, what, I have to ask, is going on here?<br />
First, though, <i><b>let me organize a lineup of bow-tie wearers</b></i> to establish a variety. The most distinguished of all, of course, was Winston Churchill, whose favorite was a fine floppy blue job with white polka dots. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a tall man, often adds a giant butterfly to his getup, which gives his appearance a light and rakish air. Saul Bellow has taken to wearing bow ties late in life. Former Sen. Paul Simon is a habitual bow-tie wearer, though, oddly, he seems never to have learned to tie them properly, for the right side of his ties never quite make it to full bow form. For diversity's sake, it would be good to have an NFL linebacker instead of Louis Farrakhan to round off this roster, but Churchill, Moynihan, Bellow, Simon and Farrakhan (a clip-on man, I surmise) perhaps provide sufficient diversity in themselves.<br />
Is there something about bow-tie wearing that suggests temperament, point of view, gestalt, full-blown Weltanschauung? The bill of complaint against the bow-tie wearer includes, I believe, the following: He is overly precise, cold-blooded, unimaginative, pompous and, let us for good measure throw in, mean-spirited. That's a lot of negative qualities to attribute to a bit of colorful cloth tied around a fellow's neck, but there it is. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENoroton_4514.html" title="User talk:Noroton">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Noroton_a85f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Noroton">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>It should mean you should be open to discussion. Did you read my previous points?

This is how she writes about it:
<dl>
<dd>The demographics of men who wear bow ties are changing, owners of bow tie companies say.</dd>
<dd>Bow ties are often thought of as an older man's fashion choice, but more and more younger men are turning to them thanks to some celebrities such as local NBC meteorologist Glenn "Hurricane" Schwartz, MSNBC talk show host and commentator Tucker Carlson and Eagles football star Dhani Jones. In fact, Jones, who's widely known for his unique fashion sense, has started a company to sell hand-crafted bow ties.</dd>
<dd>Jones' image, particularly in an Eagles-frenzied area such as the Lehigh Valley and Berks County, has had an impact on the bow tie business, says Greg Weitzenkorn, co-owner of Weitzenkorn's men's clothing store in Pottstown.</dd>
<dd>"We are not an ultra-traditional store," Weitzenkorn. says. "But we see bow ties coming on stronger in the mainstream."</dd>

I guess the greatest affirmation of my sartorial choice in regard to bow ties is related to my admiration for one of my favorite literary characters, who happens to be a lawyer. Atticus Finch, the heroic lawyer/father of To Kill a Mockingbird, wore a bow tie. I can’t think of a better character to emulate.<br />
All right, don't believe me, Joseph Epstein, Jennifer Sheehan, Greg Weitzenkorn, Kirk Hinkley, Bill Thompson or even Atticus Finch.

<dd>Bow ties, once popular in earlier eras and again in the forties and fifties, are making a small but noticeable re-appearance as a fashionable item, [...] affluent professionals are adopting the wearing of bow ties for their ability to convey stature and enable the wearer to stand out from the crowd.</dd>
<dd>Cutone noted that there is ample evidence to support the uniqueness and stature of those who wear bow ties. In the past, famous bow tie wearers included Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud, in addition to many other notable figures.</dd>
<dd>Cutone seems to think it matters to potential customers that they associate bow tie wearing with admirable individuals. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:59, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

To be honest, the bow tie has always struck me as an unoriginal way of looking original. In the absence of any real imagination, it's an acceptable substitute. If you take a look at a few of the famous bow tie wearers in history, you'll see what I mean:

<li>Titanium's comment is an excellent example of not bothering to even get the gist of the discussion, just voting in a hair-trigger way to delete. I was very clear about why I was including these examples and they had nothing to do with what Titanium says they are about. There's something deeply wrong with this process if the people who vote to delete don't listen to the people who actually care more about an article and have paid more attention to the subject. I've actually got something to say here and I see no evidence that more than a couple of people are actually listening, and I see no evidence that they are considering the point I'm making. This is not consensus, this is railroading. Does Titanium even have an argument? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:25, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that not being swayed by your arguments is an indication that they're being discarded. As silly as I think this is, I will try to explain the point once more and then be done with this. Most of the people/characters on this list are famous and wear bow ties. Few of them are famous for wearing bow ties. It's that difference which changes a list from encyclopaedic to arbitrary, almost a collection of trivia. I admire your perseverance in finding this articles, but, in my opinion, most of them would at best support the idea that bow ties are notable and encyclopaedic rather than the people who wear them. GassyGuy 21:45, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>GassyGuy, as you well know, I was objecting to seeing evidence in Titanium's post that he hadn't even bothered to read the discussion, at least not well enough to understand a simple point I repeated again and again. That indicates something other than disagreement and, I repeat, I've seen no evidence that anyone else has looked at my arguments (which may mean they have and simply choose not to respond — but it's pretty suspicious that I haven't gotten much else by way of response). You're simply repeating your previous point, which is to say that someone needs to be famous for wearing bow ties to be on the list. (See? I'm reading what you say and responding to it.) I'm saying that doesn't matter. What matters is that a lot of people apparently believe, because they say so in writing, that when people decide to wear a bow tie, that decision in part is made on what they think about others who wear them. I repeat, that's a justification for the list. If you don't think this reasoning is good enough to keep the list, please explain why. In any event, I've demonstrated that there is A REASON to keep the list, which some people here have indicated didn't exist. We have articles on the Tom and Jerry cartoon show and you can think of a thousand other articles with less reason to exist than the justification I've just given. So tell me what's wrong with my reason, please. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This advice applies to all lists. An article should only be categorized using notable information included in the article itself. If the article never mentions that someone wore a necktie, then they shouldn't be included in this list. Requiring that the necktie be mentioned in the article implies that it should have been verified by an external published source, and it's unlikely that a publication would mention someone regularly wearing a necktie unless it was somehow a notable distinguishing feature (as opposed to the occasional tux wearer). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 19:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Oddly, though, while the other terms of "soapbox" and "vanity publisher" are discussed in either policy or guidelines, the word "trivia" doesn't seem to appear in policies or guidelines (at least not that I can find). The only item that discusses "trivia" is an essay <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Wikipedia:Trivia</a>, which doesn't yet have consensus (as would a guideline). Personally I wouldn't mind seeing an actual trivia guideline of some sort, since at the moment it is a vague, subjective term that gets introduced in cfd and afd discussions with little consensus on what is or isn't trivia. Probably would be a good topic for discussion, if I can figure out a good page to post a thread. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b>Let's go over Agent 86's objections:
<ol>
<li><b>Quite a matter of personal opinion whether or not someone makes this list</b> Well, no. The article name shouldn't be taken literally, and I think it should be changed. That's what the extensive discussion on the article's talk page is about. I think the list should be about famous people who are known for wearing bow ties — this is not a matter of personal opinion, particularly if editors insist on sourcing. "Famous" could be a matter of dispute, but not beyond the abilities of Wikipedians to figure out ("famous" people are known beyond their local community and outside of a particular profession or avocation; I would include famous people of the past who are no longer well known and anyone famous across their nation, such as the Estonian president and the Belgian politician; this isn't rocket science and the gray area is not so wide that we can't live with it and come to consensus on specific cases). If we want to include, for instance, university presidents on the list, then perhaps we should call it a "List of notable bow tie wearers", if not, then a "List of famous bow tie wearers". Bow tie wearing is either sourced to good sources or it's not. Almost everyone on that list is sourced, and if I didn't remove them from the list then I think they can eventually be sourced (Chippendale dancers, for instance: I haven't found an adequate source that says they are known for their bow ties — yet). Even without any of these changes, this is not an indiscriminate list, and that second paragraph you object to helps to avoid it being an indiscriminate list. Note that good sourcing very often mentions "signature bow tie", "trademark bow tie" and other phrases or facts that back up the assertion. Some of the sourcing could be better, I think, but give it time.</li>
<li><b>Original research</b> — here's the paragraph:</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well-known people who become associated in the public mind with wearing bow ties can have a powerful affect the popularity of this type of neckwear, according to numerous observers, including writers and bow-tie sellers. Bow tie wearing by well-known men is often noticed and commented upon, a phenomenon that differs from commonplace celebrity endorsements in that it includes historical figures, including some long-dead famous people, and the topic is often brought up by writers and observers with no financial interest in promoting bow ties.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It's an introductory paragraph (actually the second paragraph). It summarizes what's in the article and every statement in it is backed up by sourcing in the article. I can provide footnotes, but I thought the connection with the following paragraphs was obvious. Sentence 1 is backed up by the numerous statements taken from the Eastern Pennsylvania Business Journal and the Texas publication and ends with "according to ...". Sentence 2 is quite directly proven by every other source in the paragraphs before the listings start, involving no leaps of logic on my part. Please specify where you believe original research takes place. You might object to the use of the word "numerous" in the first sentence, and I could take that out, but I have no doubt I could eventually find enough articles to justify that word. Do you doubt it? Do you object to the word "powerful" in the first sentence? It seems to me that the sources back it up. Do you object to the word "often" used twice in the second sentence? In the first instance, the list footnotes offer pretty convincing evidence that it is "often"; in the second, ditto, although I might add "no <i>apparent</i> financial interest", but I think that's a little fussy.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as the list now contains only the people who prominently wore bow ties and were associated with them enough to warrant sources. However, much (if not all) of the first half of the article has no part being in this "list" and should be merged into <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">bow tie</a>. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 04:44, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
