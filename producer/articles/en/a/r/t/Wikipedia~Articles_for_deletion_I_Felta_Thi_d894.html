<li><b>Real Group</b> This fraternity is a true organization created by myself and others at Penn State University. No we do not have national membership, but I do not see how this pertains to being notable enough for inclusion. We are not technically a "fraternity" which is why we do not have a national membership. We are a club who calls themselves a fraternity in order to portray the ideals of brotherhood and comradery that we believe in. There are hundreds of articles on this site which do not serve any purpose or have any realistic background and yet they remain. The reason they stay is that there is a demand for the information provided. This article was added recently (today) and is not yet completed with all of the information which we are attempting to portray to others. We are not technically a "fraternity", but we are however a recognized club at the University as are many other clubs ranging from "Halo lovers" to "People who have the name Mike." Yes our name is a play on words and is meant to be humorous, but this in no way discredits our organization or its goals. We developed the group as a place to interact with others at college. We take in at least 20 new members each semester and hope that they continue the tradition when we graduate.

<li><sup>Above comment is by Cousin; new account, fewer than 50 edits, virtually all of which are to this article and to Eric Salopek. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 21:00, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>
<li><sup>So, it's not even a real fraternity, but a student club. If this is merged into <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penn_State_a5b4.html" title="Penn State">Penn State</a>, it needs to be drastically condensed, as there are over 600 student clubs at that university. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 21:11, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</sup>
<ul>
<li><sup>Further correction: it appears to be an <i>unofficial, unrecognized</i> student club. All of the links <a href="http://www.clubs.psu.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.clubs.psu.edu/" rel="nofollow">here</a> make no mention of I Felta Thi. (I say <i>appears</i> because I was unable to check the student club lists for a number of the PSU campuses because there are broken links in that list.) Given the complete lack of relevant Google hits, it is increasingly likely that this is a hoax. If it is not, it is an unofficial student club – that is, a group of guys at a college. There <i>is no</i> <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> information about this supposed club that I have been able to find.

<li><b>Delete</b> as per above reasons. Neither are notable and both appear to be vanity. Good point about the 600 clubs, and as such, a "list of clubs at Penn State" would not be needed. No real purpose for it here. A sugguestion for Cousin; Try geocities or maybe the Penn State website if you want your Fraternity to be known. Wikipedia is not paper, but neither is it a junkyard (<a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">Jni</a>) -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity"><b>my</b></a><a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysekurity_22b6.html" title="User talk:Mysekurity">sekurity</a> 21:36, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Almost certainly a hoax? If those of you who are attending Penn State Univeristy at this moment and are a part of this organization would please stand up. That's what I thought. As for those of you who feel the need to destroy every page that appears on wikipedia that you do not find important enough for your time please heed these words ... stop wasting your time. This is not a joke. This is a true organization. Merging it into Penn State would simply have it get lost among the hundreds of articles and topics that are available there. Deleting it means that your idea of information is better than someone elses. Wikipedia is a place for people to find information. Free information. Who was the person that gave you the power to deem information unimportant and not independently notable 20 minutes after the first draft of text has been uploaded. If you feel the need to delete this page and feel that my attempt at educating people about our organization and efforts are not notable of inclusion in the world of wikipedia then fine. But at least give people like myself and others a chance to provide the information that is desired before attacking us with these deletion attempts. If after this you still feel that my page does not deserve to be placed on wikipedia alongside articles dealing with "credible" information such as the detailed inner workings of a blaster rifle from star wars or other such pages that <i>specifically state that their information is fictional</i> then fine. I have no control over what you do. But if fictional information and hoaxes are what you are after, then I suggest you look elsewhere because I am only concerned with informing people about our organization. --Cousin

<li>Wikipedia is not a free web host. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.

<li>It's not "attacking." It's janitorial work, which I do in addition to contributing my own content.

<li>Android you seem to enjoy arguing for the deletion of "hoaxes" such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richfield_Senior_High_School" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richfield_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">schools</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Vancouver_Bridges" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Vancouver_Bridges" rel="nofollow">bridges</a> as well as college clubs that you dont feel are important enough for your time. And as for the topic of notability, many things are not notable. An apple is just an apple, nothing too notable there yet it gets quite a lengthy page for itself (probably not done in the first 10 minutes of its creation either). You "Wikipedians" may need to choose some new terms in order to argue for the deletion of pages. User profiles aren't too notable or verifiable (cite your sources for your personal information please), yet they get space on the site just like anything else.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The power of annoyance perseveres. Thanks to an apparent unrelenting stream of people sitting at home with nothing better to do than worry about whether or not my organization is real, I'm taking down the information for both of my entries so far. Feel free to do whatever you like. Delete the entries through whatever process necessary. However please remember that patience is a virtue. In the future be more accepting of ideas and allow them a day or two to develop before tagging them for deletion. Verifiable does not just mean that you can Google it. There were times when things such as books, magazines, and newspapers determined what was verifiable. Apparently some of you have forgotten those days. Just because you can't find it in 5 minutes on a site like Google doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Just because some of you have no lives and apparently also have enormous sticks shoved in orifices I choose not to mention at this time does not mean that the rest of must suffer the pains of your scrutiny. In addition I suggest some of you (Android79 and RoySmith particularly) look into joining another club of mine. It's called FA-Q (Say the name out loud if you don't get it Android.) --<a href="../../../c/o/u/Cousin.html" title="Cousin">Cousin</a></li>
