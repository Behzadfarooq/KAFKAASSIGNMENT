<p>Mashie-niblick is an old golf club used over a 100 years ago that resembled the today's 7-iron. It was originally crafted out of wood, but the later version were made of iron. It had a 41 degree loft, which is equal to today's 7-iron, but the length of the club was closer to today's 9-iron. The name comes from the old golf-club naming convention according to which today's 3-iron to 6-iron were called 'mashies', and 8 and 9-iron were called 'niblicks' (wedges). The mashie-niblick was an in-between club, and hence the name, and was often used as the 'trouble club' -- i.e. a club used to escape from tough lies.</p>
<p>The name 'niblick' comes from the Scottish 'nib', which means 'nose'. This refers to the shape of the club that was very different from the longer wooden clubs.</p>
<p>This club was features in a 1931 short movie by Bobby Jones, in which he uses a mashie-niblick to shoot balls over tall obstacles.</p>

<p>(please just ignore any spelling errors; they are intended and not written accidentally)</p>
<p>Line Tower Wars is basically a Tower Wars type of map. It is however quite different compared to other TD maps as it is not all defensive type.This map looks very simple but dont be fooled by its first impression- it has quite a complicated gameplay.</p>
<p>To make things simple, I will devide this into a few different section to minimize confusion that might arise.</p>
<p>As a starter, players will start with a single Human Worker somewhere on the middle of their respective lane given based on the chosen colour. The player will also start with a certain amount of gold( most version, 30 gold) and they have the choice to either spend it on building towers or spawn creeps. Mind though-there is a cooldown time at the start of the game which will not make players spawn and spam immidietly to make things fair and even. Each basic tower cost 10 gold which means a player can only build a maximum of 3 towers . There is also a countdown on the top right corner which will count down from 15 seconds.The countdown starts with a little 25 gold.At the end of the countdown, a certain amount of gold will be awarded to the player to start it all over agian. The amount of gold though differs from each player to another ,depending on the income obtained from the previous spawange of creeps(if any). The amount of gold given is cumulative;that means if a player starts with 25 income, and spawned creeps with a total of 4 gold as income, the next income will be 25+4= 29 and so on.The amount will just add on till the end of the game or till it reaches the max gold allowed(1'000'000, which almost never happens). From the gold given, player can choose to spawn to earn income or upgrade their defence to repel oncoming creeps from other players.</p>
<p>The Objective- its simple and clear enough- to steal life from other players and not lose life. Each player starts with 25 life each(normally, depending on versions)and will try to steal their opponents life to win the game. Whenever a players life reaches 0, he/she will immidietly lose and is out of the game but will still be able to observe the ongoing game.All the towers(and that solo human worker) that was build previously will also vanish. The creeps that is being spawn and/or spammed will no longer move through that player's lane.The last player to survive is therefore the winner. The process of stealing life is done by getting your creeps to go through your opponent's lane and to the rectangular area. For every creep that makes it thru' alive, 1 life will be stolen from him/her and transfered to yours, vise verse.Theres a reward for eliminating a player- an elemental wisp in which could be used to select an element technology for the towers to furthur strenghen the creep's player's defence.</p>
<p>Towers and tower building.Players will be able to build 3 different type of towers from their given human worker.Those are-range tower , melee tower and an non-elemental fighting tower in which it could be upgraded to a specific elemental tower which deals more damage and sometimes have extra effects(cold,poisen,darkness,stun etc). The basic elemental tower cost a huge amount of gold&#160;;200 to be specific;and will only be reasonable to be built in mid game( about 10-20 minutes into the game). As to the other two basic tower , they cost a mere 10 gold respectively each. They too can be upgraded for better damage,range(range towers only) and attack speed .Both towers have both advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. The range tower has moderate damage and attack speed but has good range however the melee tower has moderate damage but a far greater attact speed(or cooldown as it is known) but lacks in range.A great combination of the both will provide greater defence that just a kind of either ones.The melee tower will be able to be upgraded to two different type of melee damage; fast attack speed and single target,moderate damage OR high damage , area of effect damage but slow attack speed.Again, the combination of both will prove better that just one type.As for elemental towers,every player will be given 3 wisp to choose their own elemental towers at the beginning. This wisp will be able to choose a preferable elemental from a range of elements( fire, cold,lightning , dark and light). Each of the elementals has its own different porperties and is good agains different types of enemies. There is also something known as cross-technology in this game. It is basically a combination of 2 same type of element and a foreign element. Eg. Lightning 1 &amp; lightning 2(high single target damage) + Darkness 1(poisen )= Scorpion tower( high single target damage with slow poisen and critical strike).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-22_0a18.html" title="Edit section: Scaitch">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scaitch</span></h2>
<p>A minority dialect spoken in Lowland-Central Scotland, Scaitch is an often overlooked tongue. It is derived from a disparate number of sources, notably Broad Scots, English, and central European languages in the Germanic tradition. In many ways, Scaitch is similar to its more widely-known cousin, Doric.</p>
<p>Some examples of Scaitch in use follows, with accompanying English translations:</p>
<p>Aricht böödwa, höös it gingin'? - Hello friend, how are you today?</p>
<p>Fit ur ye daein the mairn? - What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Ah'll hae twae pöö a' lööröö and yan a' Göönwa plöö - I'll have two pints of lager and one of Guinness please.</p>
<p>Böö - Bye</p>
<p><br />
Aside from the obvious vernacular differences between English and Scaitch, the cultural semantics it conveys are also very different to the dominant tradition in Scotland ("Scaitchlöö"). Scaitch is often portrayed as the language of Republicanism, hence its relative obscurity in a predominantly Protestant country. The ruling Protestants ("Praiddis") have sought to vanquish Scaitch, although it is still spoken in pockets sympathetic to the Republican cause.</p>
<p>Few examples of Scaitch exist in aural form on the internet ("öönternöö" or "öönfirmööröö superhööwöö") as the dialect remains true to its roots of Romanticism.</p>

<p>Walt Disney Classics is a video series created in 1984 to release Disney animated features on video due to the large demand at the time.

<p>(Greek: Okêlis), ancient port on the Red Sea, on the Arabian side near or at Bab al-Mandeb, the strait separating the Red Sea from the Gulf of Aden.</p>
<p>Ocelis belonged to the South Arabian kingdom of Saba-Himyar and is known as a stop on the maritime route from Egypt to India in the first centuries CE. In the 1st century <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periplus_Maris_Erythraei_168d.html" title="Periplus Maris Erythraei">Periplus Maris Erythraei</a> (25) it is described as "not so much a port of trade as harbour, watering station, and the first place to put in for those sailing on". <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> (6.104) reports their destination and describes Ocelis as the first stop on the sea journey from Egypt to India.</p>
<p>The Periplus (7) also reports that Ocelis was visited by traders coming over from the African side on rafts with aromatics, myrrh, ivory and tortoise shell, this being the only report of African navigation in this work. In <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy.html" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s Geography (6.7.8), Ocelis is labelled as a port of trade - emporion.</p>

<p>Festival of Torches</p>
<p>Nemoralia (aka Festival of Torches), later adopted by Catholics as The Feast of the Assumption. This festival is celebrated either on the 13-15th of August or on the August Full Moon, in honor of the goddess Diana.</p>
<p>Ovid describes the celebration thusly:</p>
<p>"In the Arrician valley, there is a lake surrounded by shady forests, Held sacred by a religion from the olden times... On a long fence hang many pieces of woven thread, and many tablets are placed there as grateful gifts to the Goddess. Often does a woman whose prayers Diana answered, With a wreath of flowers crowning her head, Walk from Rome carrying a burning torch... There a stream flows down gurgling from its rocky bed..."</p>
<p>On this day, worshippers form a shimmering procession of torches and candles around the dark waters of Lake Nemi (Nemi, from the Latin nemus, meaning sacred wood or sacred grove), Diana's Mirror. The lights of their candles join the light of the moon, dancing in reflection upon the surface of the water. Today's festival is held in the Greek fashion.</p>
<p>Hundreds join together at the lake, wearing wreaths of flowers. According to Plutarch, part of the ritual (before the procession around the lake) is the washing of hair and dressing it with flowers. It is a day of rest for women and slaves. Hounds are also honored and dressed with blossoms. Travellers between the north and south banks of the lake are carried in small boats lit by lanterns. Similar lamps were used by Vestal virgins and have been found with images of the Goddess at Nemi, so Diana and Vesta are sometimes considered to be the same Goddess.</p>
<p>One 1st century CE Roman poet, Propertius, did not attend the festival, but observed it from the periphery as indicated in these words to his beloved:</p>
<p>"Ah, if you would only walk here in your leisure hours. But we cannot meet today, When I see you hurrying in excitement with a burning torch To the grove of Nemi where you Bear light in honour of the Goddess Diana."</p>
<p>Requests and offerings to Diana may include: small written messages on ribbons, tied to the altar or to trees; small baked clay or bread statuettes of body parts in need of healing; small clay images of mother and child; tiny sculptures of stags; dance and song; and fruit such as apples.</p>
<p>In addition, offerings of garlic are made to the Goddess of the Dark Moon, Hecate, during the festival. Hunting or killing of any beast is forbidden on Nemoralia.</p>

<p>Reverend &amp; The Makers are one of many exciting new bands to have emerged from <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> in recent months. Led by frontman Jon McClure (aka: The Reverend), the band are very much part of the "indie rock" scene, but have created a much more danceable sound than many of their more guitar based counterparts, adding funky basslines and keyboard parts to songs. They could also be described as being part of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Yorkshire_fb1e.html" title="New Yorkshire">New Yorkshire</a> movement, with songs featuring collaberations with other well-known artists such as Alex from <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Monkeys_191b.html" title="Arctic Monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a> (who features on live fave "The Machine") and Tim from <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bromheads_Jacket_95bc.html" title="Bromheads Jacket">Bromheads Jacket</a>, who lays down a witty verse in "Bandits".</p>
<p>BAND MEMBERS: Jon McClure, aka The Reverend - Vocals, songwriter; Ed - Bass, co-writer; Dave - Guitar; Richie - Drums; Joe - Keyboards; Laura - Backing vocals; Si - Trombone.</p>
<p>Taken from the ashes of past groups 1984 and Judan Suki, Reverend &amp; The Makers were formed sometime in late 2005, with gigs beginning to take place early 2006. The band have had a rapid rise, partially down to lead singer Jon's well respected status in the Sheffield music scene (Judan Suki were 2003's hottly tipped new band, whereas 1984 retain legendary status as pioneers of DIY music and were one of the most successful underground groups of the time). <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Turner_f607.html" title="Alex Turner">Alex Turner</a> is one of the ex-members of Judan Suki, and his band <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Monkeys_191b.html" title="Arctic Monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a> recorded an instrumental version of 1984's song "The March", using it as the B-Side to their UK Number 1 single <a href="../../../i/_/b/I_Bet_You_Look_Good_On_The_Dancefloor_66f7.html" title="I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor">I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor</a> under the name of "Chun Yi's Spinning Bird Kick", showing their influence on many of today's young, talented new groups.</p>
<p>Although currently still unsigned, the band have already created a stirr amongst music fans, particularly in the Yorkshire area. "What The Milkman Saw" was first played on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_1_3f66.html" title="BBC Radio 1">BBC Radio 1</a>'s <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zane_Lowe_f05b.html" title="Zane Lowe">Zane Lowe</a> show in December 2005, and interest since then has snowballed. Major music magazine <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a> wrote several articles about the band, focussing on their links with the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Monkeys_191b.html" title="Arctic Monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a> and singer Jon's friendship with <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Monkeys_191b.html" title="Arctic Monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a> frontman <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Turner_f607.html" title="Alex Turner">Alex Turner</a>, even dubbing him "the mysterious fifth member" of the band. Other newspapers and magazines followed suit - with regional music magazine <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandman_%28magazine%29.html" title="Sandman (magazine)">Sandman</a> puttting The Reverend on the front cover and national newspaper <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Star_%28Britain%29_ae18.html" title="Daily Star (Britain)">The Daily Star</a> writing an article about the talented group on the 9th March 2006. The popular TV show <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer_AM_dda2.html" title="Soccer AM">Soccer AM</a> (often credited for helping several UK artists gain publicity, including <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ordinary_Boys_a569.html" title="The Ordinary Boys">The Ordinary Boys</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kasabian_%28band%29.html" title="Kasabian (band)">Kasabian</a>), have also used the Reverend &amp; The Makers song "Heavyweight Champion Of The World" several times on the show.</p>
<p>On the 13th April 2006, the band began a UK tour supporting <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Monkeys_191b.html" title="Arctic Monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a> alongside Liverpool group <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Little_Flames_ce93.html" title="The Little Flames">The Little Flames</a>, and have so far recieved a positive reaction from fans, also playing aftershow partys at many of the dates. Following this, a national headlining tour of the UK has been scheduled, including larger venues such as <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_Metropolitan_University_0e1f.html" title="Leeds Metropolitan University">Leeds Metropolitan University</a> and Sheffield's The Plug. The release of Reverend &amp; The Makers' first single is also to be expected in coming weeks (rumoured to be on infamous Bang Bang Records), although it has not yet been confirmed which song is to be released.</p>

<p>Christabel Bielenberg was the author of The Past is Myself (1968) and The Road Ahead, two memoirs describing, respectively, her experiences immediately before and during the Second World War and its aftermath.</p>
<p>Born on 18 June 1909 in Hertfordshire of Anglo-Irish parents she was the niece of press barons Lords Northcliffe and Rothermere. She won a scholarship to Oxford but decided to study music in Germany. While there she met Peter Bielenberg, who was studying law with a view to joining his father's practice in Hamburg. They married in 1934 and she took German citizenship.</p>
<p>The Bielenbergs lived initially in Berlin and had three sons, Nicholas, John and Christopher (born 1942). The heavy Allied bombing raids led Mrs Bielenberg and her children to leave the city and they eventually settled in the village of Rohrbach in the Black Forest.</p>
<p>Both Mrs Bielenberg and her husband were opposed to Nazism and following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, participated in anti-Nazi activity (her experience of attempting to shelter Jews hiding from persecution is movingly described by her in the television series The World at War, 1974). Peter Bielenberg was a close friend of Adam von Trott zu Solz, who was involved in the von Stauffeberg bomb plot against Hitler of 1944, and as a result of his suspect political views and this close association was arrested, interrogated and imprisoned in Ravensbruck concentration camp following its failure.</p>
<p>In an effort to secure his release, Mrs Bielenberg asked to be interviewed by the Gestapo in order to convince them of she and her husbands' political naivety and innocence. She was successful and he was released to a punishment unit but mistakenly allowed leave before joining it. He managed to slip away and remained in hiding near his family until the fighting ended.</p>
<p>After the war, Mrs Bielenberg returned to the UK with her children, visiting Germany as a war correspondent.</p>
<p>In 1948, the family settled in Tullow, County Carlow, buying a dilapidated farm, which they transformed into a commercial success. As well as writing her autobiography Mrs Bielenberg became involved with the Irish Peace Marches of the 1970s and lectured in Germany. She was made a Commander of the German Federal Order of Merit and awarded a gold medal of merit by the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Peter Bielenberg died in 2001. Christabel Bielenberg died on 2 November 2003. They were survived by their three sons.</p>

<p>The Peruvian Football League is divided into two divisions. The <i>Primera División</i> and the <i>Segunda División</i>. There are 12 teams in the Primera División and 12 in the Segunda División. The Primera División runs from February to December and the Segunda División runs from April to November.</p>
<p><b>Primera División</b></p>
<p>The Primera división tournament is called the <i>Descentralizado</i>, as many teams from outside the province of Lima (the capital city) take part in it. The Descentralizado is divided into two blocks: the <i>Torneo Apertura</i> and the <i>Torneo Clausura</i>.</p>
<p>The Torneo Apertura runs from february to june. It consists of a round robin tournament in which the 12 teams play each other twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 22 matches. Teams get 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and none for a loss. The team finnishing at the top of the table at the end of the tournament is the champion and qualifies for the the followin year's Copa Libertadores as well as to the final of the Peruvian championship in December, to be played against the champion of the Torneo Clausura.</p>
<p>The Torneo Clausura runs from july to december and follow the exact same format as the Torneo Apertura. The champion of the Clausura qualifies for the following year's Copa Libertadores and to the final of the Peruvian championship to be played against the Apertura champion. In the event of a team winning both tournaments, that team is declared as the Natinal Champion for that year. For a team to be eligible into the final match, it has to end at least sixth in both the Apertura and the Clausura. Otherwise the champion of the other tournament (Apertura or Clausura) is declared as the National Champion for that year.</p>
<p>Apart from the two teams that qualify automatically for the Copa Libertadores as champions of the Apertura and the Clausura, the third Peruvian representative is decided by the overall year's table, which includes the performance of the teams over the two tournaments. The best tram in this table apart from the two champions qualifies for the Copa Libertadores while the fourth and fifth placed teams qualify for the Copa Sudamericana.</p>
<p>The team finishing last in the overall year's table is relegated to the Segunda División.</p>
<p><b>Segunda División</b></p>
<p>The Segunda División consists of twelve teams. Most of them are from or around Lima. In fact, all of them were from Lima, but from the 2006 season there are five provincial teams that have been included so as to expand the tournament.

<p><b>Dia Josette DiCristino</b>was born in 1980 just outside of Philadelphia, in a town called MEDIA. She is most notably famous for the eleven brain surgeries she had in 2003 at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Dia was diagnosed in 2002 with a Posterior fossa arachnoid cyst. After her first surgery, she developed hydrocephalus. This caused her to be shunted in January 2003. After the second surgery her cyst had grown back extremely fast, and so the third surgery was performed to change the shunt valve. After this she got even worse and the hydro was so bad that she almost died on the operating table during the fourth surgery because the neurosurgeons couldn't fit a shunt in. Luckily they found a way, but unfortunately this meant Dia having two vp shunts, one in the cyst and another one in the fourth ventricle.</p>
<p>After two days being out of the hospital, Dia started to overdrain in one shunt and underdrain in another. This caused obvious confusion amongst the medical doctors. After another month in the hospital, she had another two surgeries. During the sixth surgery, she contracted bacterial meningitis creating much havoc , another long hospital stay, and two more surgeries.</p>
<p>Three months after the eighth brain surgery, Dia started to overdrain again, and so a ninth surgery was performed to shut the shunt off. Two weeks after this her fourth ventricle had gotten hydrocephalus again, and so a tenth surgery was carried out to give her a completely new shunt system.</p>
<p>An eleventh surgery was performed in early 2004 to give Dia a special shunt system. Because she had failed every adult shunt system availble in Philadelphia, the surgeons decided to give her a pediatric tube in the stomach and an adult reservoir in the brain.</p>
<p>There are many more interesting things about Dia Josette DiCristino, but nothing will ever top the eleven brain surgeries in such a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Africa AIDs Response is a Sister-City organization, joining the two cities of Portland, Oregon and Mutare, Zimbabwe. The main purpose of the organization is to eradicate HIV/AIDS in Mutare, as well as Africa as a whole. The program offers support to urgent grassroots efforts. Among the accomplishments of the organization is the successful building and opening of a clinic in July of 2005. The organization was founded in 2000 after a Portlander Nurse Practitioner specializing in HIV/AIDS went to Mutare for six weeks planning to volunteer in a clinic there - only to find that such a clinic did not exist.</p>

<p>Make-up artist, rapper, writer, and Internet celeb, Jeffree star is popping up all over the world, and into the minds of the young and beautiful.</p>
<p>EARLY LIFE.</p>
<p>Jeffree Star started playing with makeup at an early age; he would see a beautiful picture and try to replicate the idea onto his own face, at 11 Jeffree had decided that he wanted to become a makeup artist, and as the years went by, his talent dramatically changed. At 16, Jeffree had scored himself a fake I.D. and was at the club scene, which is when he started meeting famous stars that fell in love with his devilishly different makeup. As he showed off his natural talent, many stars would whisper, "Make me look like you". Lying about his age, Jeffree received much publicity for his talent.</p>
<p>Jeffree star is now to star in a future hit TV. Show with none other than Bobby Trendy, the socialite princess designer diva that rescued Anna Nicole from an impending series cancellation.</p>
<p>Jeffree is blunt and gets right to the point, but to some that is what today’s society needs, a reality check saying," hey, you aren’t the only type of people, there are plenty of people that I am representing, and if you don’t like it, go die. "Jeffree is representing the new generation, making it easier for boys, girls, and transsexuals alike express themselves.</p>
<p>Many people find Jeffree's music disturbing, or wrong, with lyrics like,</p>
<dl>
<dd>All you dirty scene boys, you love Jeffree Star.</dd>
<dd>I see you lookin' at my pictures, your dick's gettin' hard</dd>
<dd>Go fix your hair, make sure the flatiron's hot</dd>
<dd>Pull down your 7 jeans and show me that motherfuckin' cock</dd>
<dd>Am I a boy or a girl? Well you'll never know...</dd>
<dd>I'm not doin' your makeup, filthy pre-teen hoe</dd>
<dd>Spread 'em, forget 'em and then same my name...</dd>
<dd>I'm Jeffree Fuckin' Star, of internet fame.</dd>
</dl>
<p>and,</p>
<dl>
<dd>You wanna know where the straight boys are at?</dd>
<dd>Leaving credit cards in my ass crack.</dd>
<dd>You wanna know where the straight boys are at?</dd>
<dd>Look under my bed cuz I can't keep track...</dd>
</dl>
<p>But many people disagree and find Jeffree's music fun and expressive.</p>
<p>Love or Hate Jeffree Star doesn't plan to be forgotten by any one person, and continue his career as the queen of myspace, and the world.</p>

<p>The United States-China Business Council, Inc. is a private, non-profit, non-partisan, member-supported organization. It is the principal organization of US corporations engaged in business relations with the People's Republic of China. Founded in 1973 as the National Council for US-China Trade, the Council originally served the early efforts of US business in China in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two nations. With the massive growth of US-China economic engagement since the end of the 1970s, the Council has continued to assist firms entering the field for the first time, but increasingly the bulk of its work has served the interests and needs of US firms with well-established commercial relationships in China. Headquartered in Washington, DC, the Council also serves its corporate members from field offices in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Council provides extensive, tailored Business Advisory Services on a wide range of business interests and concerns to individual member companies. Its meetings and programs, in the United States, China and Hong Kong, provide both broad-gauge and highly business-relevant information, and offer companies the chance to share ideas and experiences as well.</p>
<p>The Council continues to play a central role in analysis and advocacy of key policy issues of significance not only to US businesses but also to the future of US-China relations. The Council's activities in support of government policies conducive to expanded US-China commercial and economic ties include educational meetings with Members of Congress and Congressional staff, and frequent testimony on behalf of the US business community in Congressional or other venues. The Council also works to enhance media and public understanding of complex issues in US-China relations, appearing frequently on major broadcasts and providing accurate statistical and analytical information to media representatives.</p>
<p>The Council's numerous publications include the leading US periodical on China trade, the China Business Review, the members' weekly electronic newsletter, China Market Intelligence, and numerous focused studies on topics of current business interest.</p>
<p>The Council serves as a valued and economical complement to the intensive in-house efforts that US companies devote to business development in China. Council membership in 2005 currently stands at roughly 250 firms, and continues to strengthen in response both to China's economic growth and to the many challenges and complexities US firms face in the Chinese environment. Among the Council's members are many of the largest and best known US corporations, but smaller companies and service firms make up a substantial portion of the overall membership as well.</p>
<p>The Council is governed by a Board of Directors composed of distinguished corporate leaders. The Council's current chair is Michael L. Eskew, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of UPS. Since November 1, 2004, the Council's president has been John Frisbie.</p>
<p>The US-China Business Council has long served as a respected host for senior visitors from China and from the US government. In recent years, the Council has been honored to receive His Excellency President Hu Jintao; Premier Wen Jiabao; former President Jiang Zemin; former Premier Zhu Rongji; and other distinguished Chinese guests from central and provincial government entities. Recent American public figures to meet with Council members have included Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez; former US Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick; US Ambassador to China Clark "Sandy" Randt; key figures from the United States Congress; and numerous specialists on US-China affairs from various agencies of the Executive Branch of government.</p>
<p>In April 20, 2006, the US-China Business Council in conjunction with the National Committee on US-China Relations and the United States Chamber of Commerce, hosted a dinner honoring Chinese President Hu Jintao on his first visit to the United States.</p>

<p>The Shiawassee River in Michigan is approximately 110 miles long and generally flows in a Northerly direction which is rare. It merges together with the Flint River, the Cass River &amp; the Titabawassee River to become the Saginaw River which eventually drains into Saginaw Bay.</p>
<p>Latitude = 42 degrees 43 minutes North .......... Longitude = 83 degrees 30 minutes West</p>
<p>In 2005 a well attended canoe and kayak race was held on a 7 mile section of the Shiawassee River between the cities of Holly,MI and Fenton,MI. Another similiar race is planned for May 21, 2006. Aprroximately 1,061 acres of public recreation land abut the river, and another 211 acres are either land conservancy property or protected by easements.</p>

<p>A Chicago born teenager, about 14-18 years old, born around 1988 to 1991. (exact dates unknown) Lived in Chicago for about 9 years and then moved to San Antonio, went to a northwestern middle school, and was notoriously known there for disruption of educational processes and very high popularity. Alex was believed to have been the instigator and main planner of more than a dozen of crude "pranks" to the middle school he attended. He was held in high contempt because the "pranks" he chose were large-scale, and showed that he was quite intelligent. He was supposedly responsible for a low-power explosive device installed in one of the schools many restroom facilities. Alex was also known for starting an anarchy-related group dedicated to disrupt the learning going on at his school, but to the administrations surprise, his group "Silence" spread to many other schools(between 30-40) and is to day extremely organized. The group was started in 2003 by Alex and 2 other of his friends, (names withheld) This group was responsible for a large sum of budget loss from their school district. Alex continued his battle for complete power, supposedly selling drugs and other illegal things, for higher status. It worked. Alex continued his reign of power until he was caught, finally, after all his tyrades, he was caught. Although the reason why he got caught is unknown, we know it wasnt that big, the admins just wanted a reason to get him, and Alex, flared out, finally lost. His whereabouts are unknown to day. He was sent to an alternative placement, perhaps Juvenile Justics Academy or a simple 2nd party school. The leadership of the group drifted to an unknown person, and Alex supposedly maintains no contact with the group, however, I have heard otherwise, it goes, that he is still large and in charge, but no one knows for sure, and if someone does, they arent talking.</p>

<li>Interesting trivia*</li>
</ul>
<p>+Silence was known for leaving their professionally made buisness cards at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>+Silence eventually gained the respect of real gangs and is allied with them to day.</p>
<p>+Alex used deception to get away from the administration, and sometimes, cops.</p>
<p>+Alex paid people who werent part of the group and helped out, he contracted them by sending out professional quality letter. Stamped and signed "Silence"</p>
