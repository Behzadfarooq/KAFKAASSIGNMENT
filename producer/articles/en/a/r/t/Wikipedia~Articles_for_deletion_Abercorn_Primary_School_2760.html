I'll be AfD'ing here the other eleven primary schools of the same category as well, as they all are similarly basic (one of them has a notable alumnus, but that is a redlink anyway).

<li><b>Reply</b>: if I would start a project of documenting all Belgian bakeries, would that be a reason to have three line articles on each and every bakery? While primary schools are slightly more important than bakeries, I fail to see how having someone who wants to document something is a reason to keep the articles. By that reasoning, <i>every</i> article shoudld be kept (except jokes and attacks), as they <i>all</i> try to document anything. Having a project, a category, ... is only a way of grouping things, but grouping unencyclopedic things does nnot make them any more encyclopedic or worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:45, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b>: I don't think that <i>being a stub</i> is a criteriopn for deletion, and I don't believe anything I said here reflects such extreme position. Articles that document subjects without any importance beyond their existence (i.e., they are a school) are directory articles. Nothing more of encyclopedic value can be said about them. Pointing out anything to the contrary (i.e. a reliable, reputable, verifiable source, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, asserting the importance of this particular school, would be a good argument against deletion. For now, all I have seen is the argument that all schools are inherently encyclopedic, which is equally unuseful to argue for keeping. The article is sourced, but that does not make it encyclopedic. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a directory, and that's policy. And sourced... well, let's take <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrick_Primary_School%2C_Warrenpoint_852a.html" title="Carrick Primary School, Warrenpoint">Carrick Primary School, Warrenpoint</a>: two directories (which Wikiepdia, again, is not), and an article in which it is mentioned in a list of 31 schools. The info given is correct (and I didn't claim otherwise), but of encyclopedic importance? Another one? <a href="../../../i/v/e/Iveagh_Primary_School_a430.html" title="Iveagh Primary School">Iveagh Primary School</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Mary%27s_Primary_School%2C_Ballyward_4760.html" title="St. Mary's Primary School, Ballyward">St. Mary's Primary School, Ballyward</a> are only sourced by two directories and are nothing more than directory entries themselves. Please, give me arguments to keep them, make it clear to me what importance they have beyond being a school, or else admit that all you have as an argument is that all schools should be kept. But please don't try to keep them by misrepresenting my arguments. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:49, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am representing your argument accurately. To take the top school (why not, since they're listed together) there is some information here beyond <i>a directory</i> - not very much, because the article is a stub. The article does clearly not say "<b>Abercorn Primary School exists, and is a primary school</b>" which might qualify as a directory entry. It refers to published documents on the school, et cetera. When evaluating articles at AfD, it's essentially sufficient to ask <i>Is this article verifiable?</i> and <i>Is it encyclopaedic?</i> - in this case, both answers are yes. While there are exceptions to the evaluation I expounded (i.e. <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORKs</a>) it's generally accurate. The article is sourced, and its encyclopaedic. No argument has been presented for deletion that isn't false upon its face. Whether or not all schools are encyclopaedic, I have no idea (although obviously certain classes of things are invariably encyclopaedic) - nor is it really relevent here. Rather than say <i>In my opinion, is this important enough to be encyclopaedic?</i> (which almost always results in someone saying <i>Do I personally give a shit about this article?</i> I find it's far more useful to ask <i>Has some other source found it worthy of encyclopaedic type documentation and publishing?</i> which gives a far less biased result, (although it isn't useful for pushing any agenda). Here, the article is verifiable, encyclopaedic, sourced and the claims that they're directory entires (at least in the case of Abercorn) is just plain false. Evidentally <i>someone</i> has found it important enough to publish this kind of information, which I'll take to mean it is important over the dubious unsupported assertions here to the contrary. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:04, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Umm, the sources for Abercorn are not really of encyclopedic value: there is the school website, a directory service, and the school inspection report. So if I can find a bakery with a website, a listing in a directory, and a food inspection report, I can include it here as well? My arguments are not "false upon their face" and my assertions are not "unsupported", thank you. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:14, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not really sure what you mean by <i>Sources are of encyclopaedic value</i> - Many, if not most towns and cities have articles that are nothing but regurgitated census data created by a robot ... This seems to be almost identical in "source quality/nature" to the school evaluation reports, for instance. With respect to a bakery there are policies/guidelines that apply (i.e. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) where none apply here. The argument you present remains false upon its face, and your assertions on reasons for deletion remain unsupported. Claiming otherwise will not change this. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I take issue with WilyD's assertion that the test <i>In my opinion, is this important enough to be encyclopaedic?</i> "almost always results in someone saying <i>Do I personally give a s**t about this article?</i>." I personally don't give a&#160;!@#$ about <a href="../../../v/i/n/VINSON_3f5c.html" title="VINSON">VINSON</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idol</a>, or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_sociology.html" title="Comparative sociology">comparative sociology</a>, but I understand that these topics in voice encryption, trends in pop culture, and academic research are all ultimately relevant to everyone, and therefore encyclopedic. But the existence of a school called Abercorn in County Down isn't relevant, or potentially relevant, to anyone outside of County Down. If, for example, some kid at that school discovered a method for <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a>, then it might be relevant. But no one is making any such claim.</p>
<p>I also think that it's obvious that the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_education.html" title="Primary education">institution of the primary school</a> is important and encyclopedic. But this doesn't imply that <i>every primary school</i> is encyclopedic, any more than the notability of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home.html" title="Home">Home</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grocery_store.html" title="Grocery store">Grocery store</a> implies that my house and the grocery store I go to are encyclopedic. The burden is on the other side to show why <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abercorn_Primary_School_7b51.html" title="Abercorn Primary School">Abercorn Primary School</a> et al are distinguishable, and assertions such "Abercorn 'provides a secure and stimulating environment for children ... emphasis is placed on children showing courtesy to classmates, teachers and visitors and all staff endeavour to relate work to the children's interests and daily lives'" just don't cut it.</p>
<p>Finally, proponents of including schools in Wikipedia often cite some characterization or other to the effect that encyclopedias are compendia of knowledge, info about a school is knowledge, therefore schools merit inclusion. To this I would respond that the nominated articles don't impart any meaningful knowledge at all. Everybody knows that there are primary schools in Northern Ireland (if not they could read <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Northern_Ireland_bce2.html" title="Education in Northern Ireland">Education in Northern Ireland</a>), and knowing that one of them is called Abercorn, and it's in County Down, just isn't meaningful. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a stroll through AfD and really give it a look and you'll see it to be the case. Notability is used either as a euphanism for SPAM, or to say <i>Well, I don't care about it.</i> - As for the article, it remains sourced, encyclopaedic, verifiable and everything else you could reasonably ask of it. The main thrust of the argument for deletion is it's low information content (because it's a stub) but this isn't a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:38, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) Others may use NN interchangeably with SPAM or "I don't care about it," but not me, and all the people voting "delete" in this debate have intelligent arguments that amount to a lot more than "I don't care about it." (2) I agree that the nominees are sourced and verifiable. The question is, are they encyclopedic? I argued above that they are patently unencyclopedic because they have no relevance or even potential relevance to anybody living outside of County Down. Now, can you say why the nominees deserve to exist on Wikipedia, but not the grocery store I go to, which enjoys news coverage from local business papers? Or local bakeries, which as Fram pointed out above, may have websites, and may be listed in directories and food inspection reports? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:12, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not really sure exactly how far the influence of something has to spread before it's "encyclopaedic". I am, however, fairly sure it's not "the whole globe". As for a bakery, a concensus exists with <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, no such equivilent exists for government institutions. I continued to stand by my position that it is preferable to use the judgement of the government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland about whether this school is notable than it is to use my own bias. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:19, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) By analogy with WP:CORP, which distinguishes notable from NN businesses, I would argue we need to distinguish between notable and NN schools. And whatever criterion consensus would come up with for judging notability of schools, these schools just wouldn't make the cut. (2) I don't think the gov't of the UK has made a judgment that these schools are, or are not, <i>notable</i>. The gov't of the UK accredits, funds, and, I suppose, may run these schools to some degree. That's why they list them in their directory of schools. That has nothing to do with encyclopedic notability. If it did, then my home would be encyclopedic and notable simply by virtue of being listed in my city and/or county register. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:27, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is a bad analogy because its a specific guideline - generalising from it is not really advisable (because it's a haphazard process of random guesses, essentially). No criterion concensus exists for schools, nor will one exist soon (if you see many schools in AfD, you'll know why), and to try to guess <i>anything</i> about how it'll turn out is simply impossible. The evaluation report is not simply a directory of schools, but a third party publication. At least until a <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOLs</a> guideline is set, trying to ram schools through AfD that pass every relevent criterion, policy and guideline is inappropriate. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:32, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point was that <i>any</i> nontrivial guideline for schools would have to exclude the nominees at issue. There is simply no distinguishing feature here. If these schools were kept per whatever guideline we eventually adopt for schools, then all schools would be admissible under that guideline. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:54, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I completely agree with Pan Dan.

I find myself reading them and asking, "What's important about this school?" My response is, "Nothing." Then I ask myself "What impact has this school had on society as a whole? What's unique about this school as opposed to all other primary schools in the world?" And again, the answer is nothing. We have an article on primary schools that should explain what goes on in these schools quite nicely. It boils down to the fact that there is nothing unique to say about any of these schools, so the entries all amount to, essentially, a directory listing. I'm sure the schools are important to the children that attend them, perhaps even the graduates and certainly the teachers and parents. However, they're not notable (yup, I said it, and what I mean by it <i>in this context</i> is: <b>important</b>) outside of their respective towns. There are a bare minimum of several hundred thousand primary schools in the world. These are just like all the rest. If someone can supply us with a famous alum or notorious incident that occurred at one of the schools, I'd change my "vote" to keep, but just for that one. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 18:55, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, "Information such as enrolment, date of foundation, class size etc" doesn't need its own article. I suppose I agree with your partial suggestion, Kappa, of merging that info into a more general article. But second, Kappa, I really have to disagree with your assertion that this info "is encylopedic because it aids understanding of a topic people care about, i.e. it is knowledge." People who send their kids to schools in County Down care about it, and that's what local information sources are for. County Down parents aren't gonna come to WP to look for this info, nor should they. Above all, I urge a distinction between knowledge that is ultimately relevant to everybody like the info in the article on general <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_education.html" title="Primary education">Primary education</a>, vs. knowledge that has no relevance or meaning to anybody living outside of a certain locale. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:44, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>County Down parents <i>should</i> come to wikipedia for encylopedic treatments of local schools, because that's our job - being an encylopedia. By synthesizing multiple sources we can provide a service no-one else can (<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventually" class="extiw" title="m:eventually">eventually</a> in some cases) It's reasonable to make a distinction between general-interest knowledge and specialist-interest knowledge, but since we are promising everyone access to the "sum total of human knowledge", destroying all specialist-interest knowledge is the not the way to do it. Personally I am interested in schools in various countries (not include Northern Ireland as it happens) and I would love to be able to read encylopedic treatments of them without having to go there and/or learn the language. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b>: What? In what way is this a disruptive nomination (borderline or not)? These articles are very similar, both in subject and in content. It would be ridiculous to Afd one of them and not the others (even in this AfD, the often misused argument "because unrelated article X is not deleted (yet), this one should stay to" is already used: imagine if the same could be said about a truly similar article!).</dd>
<dd>I'm amazed that some supporters of all school articles, no matter how uninformative, uninteresting, and unencyclopedic these articles are (and ever can be), feel the need to try to reason away the AfD by making borderline attacks instead of trying to defend the articles. All the defense we have until now is "the articles are correct" (true, but irrelevant), sourced (true, but irrelevant), and encyclopedic (untrue, but debatable). Most of these articles are only directory entries and thus fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> fair and square: the few that have an additional line of info are still utterly irrelevant for anyone outside the village they serve, and would be better as short sections in the articles of those villages. All of them can be deleted by Wp:NOT, which is a policy. No one has explained why we need "comprehensive coverage of education in County Down" to the level of listing the number of students, the address of the school, or the distance between the school and the town centre. Wouldn't it be better if we had an article or even a paragraph discussing "education in County Down" instead of a bunch of extremely similar, uninformative directory listings of all individual schools, if your aim truly was "comprehensive coverage of education in County Down". With the current articles, I know nothing about education there except that there are schools. This is the most obvious and least informative info possible on the subject. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:48, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the case of the nominees for deletion here, the "knowledge" they provide is meaningless and irrelevant to anyone outside County Down, and for those in County Down, it's directory info. Now, those who seek to learn more about primary schools in Northern Ireland, as Kappa does (and I respect Kappa for that desire, make no mistake), can read the article on <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Northern_Ireland_bce2.html" title="Education in Northern Ireland">Education in Northern Ireland</a>. I fail to understand how Kappa and others' quest is satisfied by reading that there is a school called Abercorn in County Down, 500 students attend it, and it "provides a secure and stimulating environment for children ... emphasis is placed on children showing courtesy to classmates, teachers and visitors and all staff endeavour to relate work to the children's interests and daily lives." And as Fram pointed out, there is no one here who has any ideas on how this article or its fellow nominees can be expanded. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:38, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A school with 500 students is very different from a school with 100 students. A school which emphasises courtesy is different from a school which emphasizes achievement, or discipline, or independence. These things help readers to understand the school, hence they are encylopedic. What wouldn't help me to understand the school is its telephone number... that's the kind of thing I would look for in a directory. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:31, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I don't understand how you can learn anything about the school through that quote (the one about "provides a secure and stimulating environment..."). It sounds like it came from a brochure, and brochures, like advertisements, sometimes lie. In fact it sounds like it could have come from the brochure of <i>any</i> public primary school in the English-speaking world, including those schools of which it's not a true depiction. A definite knowledge of what a school is really like can only come from talking to people actually involved with the school, and as such talk is never published, alas, there's no way for that kind of info to make it onto Wikipedia without violating WP:OR or WP:V. Now, the gossip might get verified and published by reputable newspapers if the school was especially <i>notable</i> for some reason--that's why some of us here keep talking about notability--it really is essential to an encyclopedic article. But for non-notable, run-of-the-mill primary schools like these, there's just no way to get complete, sourced articles, which is sort of the point that Fram has making all along, much more ably than me. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Even if it could be verified that Abercorn practices the (unremarkable) philosophy espoused in that quote, I fail to see what significance that unremarkable fact can possibly have to anybody outside of County Down. As for the fact that there are 500 students--I fail to see, again, how that bit of trivia can have any meaning at all to anybody other than a County Down parent. What <i>would</i> be notable is an overall assessment of the different philosophies of all the schools in Northern Ireland, and overall statistics on school size in Northern Ireland, but such info belongs in a more general article, such as <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Northern_Ireland_bce2.html" title="Education in Northern Ireland">Education in Northern Ireland</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:03, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I want know about a school, the first things I want are its size, how long it has been there and its philosophy (assuming philosophy varies by school, as in the UK, instead of by district, as in the US.) For Northern Ireland I'd also like to know its religious profile. If I have these things I feel I understand it, in a basic way. To me these things are knowledge. If you tell me I can't have these things, they are "not knowledge", that I should read education in Kyrgyzstan and draw my own conclusions... well I think that you have denied me something very precious. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:41, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OR/V is answered by government inspections and coverage in local newspapers and books about local history.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, but the notability issue persists. The gov't inspections and coverage in local newspapers talk about things that could be said about any school. They don't distinguish the school. And I am not persuaded that if you want to research the religious profile (as you said above) of schools in Northern Ireland, that you would be best served by reading one article for each of the thousands of primary schools in Northern Ireland. Far easier and more reliable would be to read something that discusses primary schools in Northern Ireland in general, for example <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Northern_Ireland_bce2.html#Integrated_Education" title="Education in Northern Ireland">Education_in_Northern_Ireland#Integrated_Education</a> (which should expanded, by the way). One simply gains no more edification from understanding "in a basic way" a local primary school—one of thousands in Northern Ireland—than from understanding local grocery stores, pubs, or coffee shops. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:52, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Primary schools are indeed notable in their communities and in Northern Ireland and are vehicles to attract more readers and contributors to Wikipedia. This has been proved as the lists and my stub articles are now being added to by other new contributors. Most of the articles are stubs to be built upon, or have we lost that concept?

<dd><b>Reply</b>, actually, they do meet the criteria of WP:NOT, as Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information (and these articles are just that), and Wikipedia is not a directory (and an article like <a href="../../../i/v/e/Iveagh_Primary_School_a430.html" title="Iveagh Primary School">Iveagh Primary School</a> is nothing but a directory entry). Can you give us an idea of what information, specific for any of these schools, would be added later on? You are basically saying that they are notable and interesting, but that that will only become clear when the article is expanded. If you don't have any info that supports that opinion, then it is only wishful thinking. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:27, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b>: like Pan Dan said (thank you)/ Take <a href="../../../i/v/e/Iveagh_Primary_School_a430.html" title="Iveagh Primary School">Iveagh Primary School</a>: the complete article comes from the link "Schools Web Directory", except the age of the pupils and the number of them (a whopping 50, or some 6 per year...). That info comes from the other link, the Good Schools Guide, which is nothing but a directory (the information you getr when you follow the link at least). This article is nothing but directory information. It contains no info on what makes this school notable, how it would be interesting to anyone outside Rathfriland, how the educational system of County Down works, etcetera. The only reason anyone can give to have this article is that for them, all schools are notable, even if there is no info available except the address and number of pupils. I don't have anything against that position, although I heavily disagree with it, but I don't get why most people seem so anxious to admit that that is their criterion, and try to find other reasons, or try to make this AfD look negative on principle. But since this AfD seems at first glance to be going to a no consensus, I suppose we'll have to see in a year or so if a) these articles are indeed vandal magnets (a primary school with 50 pupils? I would be surprised), and b) if they indeed will have improved in a year time. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 18:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I added the articles (specifically as stubs) to encourage other users (educationalists and professionals, not just school kids) to start to contribute and enter more information, particularly where I haven't been able to find a mass of starting information. Schools are a very good starting point to drive up interest in WP (surely one of the goals??) I thought WP was meant to be a collaborative effort and not about only adding fully and finally researched and completed articles - hence stubs - of which there is a vast volume in WP (and rightly so).

<dd><b>Reply</b>: No, I have not dismùissed or forgotten the concept of stubs. I refer here to the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, which talks about stubs (with potential), which should get expanded, not deleted. I considered these stubs as stubs without potential: you can write more about them (and it may be verifiable and sourced), but in my opinion, it would still be an example of indiscriminate, unimportant information. I come back to my bakery example: you can write a stub about a bakery, and probably someone can come along and write something more, with info out a local newspaper, a food inspection report, ... This would still be a perfect object for deletion via AfD, as the consensus (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) is that these are not important enough to list. The problem is that no guideline on schools has been agreed on, so that we have to rely on our feeling of what is and what isn't notable enough. Being a stub that may be expandable is not an argument against deletion per se: if the expansion would not make the stub any more notable, then it would still be fit for deletion, unless you feel that all schools are per se notable. The arguments about them being stubs is a non-issue. Either they are stubs, in wich case I can't delete them because they will be expanded, or they are full articles, in which case I can't delete them because they contain lots of info and work. This is of course false: the real choice is that either they are about notable subjects (keep), or they are about non-notable subjects (delete). While for some of the articles more info has been added after the AfD started (which is good), none of them has made the school any more notable. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Above the case was made on the basis these articles violated the deletion policy by containing only "directory information".

A reading of <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> shows that it makes no reference to "stubs (with potential)" or otherwise, and Primary schools articles have lots of potential if you choose to see it. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> makes no mention at all that "the consensus is that these are not important enough to list". Both statements are entirely unsourced and seem to be merely one person's opinion. I would be happy to see the quoted references. Comparing bakeries to Primary schools is also illogical and spurious, how can educational establishments not be notable. Obviously Wikipedians in Australia and Hong Kong didn't find primary schools non-notable and set a valid and important precedent - you will have an interesting time suggesting deletion of all those articles (which of course would be consistent with your view). You also didn't answer my question posed so long ago about whether porn stars are more notable than Primary schools - yet WP is stuffed full of porn star articles. Let's get rid of them. What about all those airline stub articles for airlines with one plane - let's get rid of them, or what about comics, why are they more notable.

<li><b>Reply</b> to "reply to user Fram", a few posts above: in the "Problem articles where deletion may not be needed" of <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, there is an ecplicit reference to "stubs but with potential", which should not get deleted. I agree;, being a stub is not a reason for deletion per se, and contrary to what people seem to have read in my posts, I don't think I have ever used it. I have used two main arguments for deletion: some of the articles are nothing but directory articles, and all of the articles are about non notable subjects. The first is a policy, the second is a general way of looking at what should be included and what not, again in the spirit of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, the general rule that WP is not an indiscriminate collection of information. There is no notability guideline for schools, and that is a pity, but if you put your standard for inclusion higher than "all schools are notable" (which, I repeat it, is in itself a debatable and valid position), then many primary schools, for example the ones up for AfD here, would be the first to go. I hope we can all agree on that? Now, when you try to find comparable guidelines and situations, one you easily find is <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which I used <i>not</i> to show that schools should be deleted (as <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> does not address schools), but that the arguments used that an article should not and can not be deleted because it is sourced and verifiable are invalid. A sourced and verifiable band, corporation, person, game, ... can all be deleted if they fail to reach the minimum standard for notability. Since there is no <i>fixed</i> minimum standard for schools, it is up to us, every AfD again, to decide individually what our standard is, and it is the right of the defenders of the articles to give as much information and sources as possible to make the articles pass the standards of more people. I hope that still everyone agrees? Now, the debate is about what your individual standard is, and if any of the articlss have given any info that would make them acceptable to more people than just those who think that all schools are notable. For me, none of the articls have done that, and as my standard is that a school is not notable for being a school, they all should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 07:08, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Just because the kids are younger and take fewer drugs shouldn't affect that criterion. However, I don't think that means there should be atomic articles for each primary school. Much more useful to have the primary school discussed in the context of it's village and general population IN the article about the village/town.

<p><b>Comment.</b> You know, I have read, somewhere in Wikipedia space, how the encyclopedia is <i>not</i> limited on space. I suspect that many rules (regarding <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> etc) were written at a time when space was a premium. Wikipedia has existed for a good number of years now (I remember when it was text-only), and start at a time when hard drive space was comparitively small and costly. Today one can buy a gigabyte of storage space on a handy USB keyring device quite cheaply. Hard drives cost less than 50p (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterling.html" title="Sterling">Sterling</a>) per <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigabyte.html" title="Gigabyte">Gigabyte</a>. More importantly though, the size of hard discs is increasing almost exponentially. The first hard drive I bought was 20 <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">Mb</a>. My current <a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_e536.html" title="RAM">memory</a> is 50 times bigger! The current average hard drive storage space is over 4,000 times bigger. The current article about Abercorn Primary School looks to me to be about 1 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilobyte.html" title="Kilobyte">kb</a>. Two hundred of similar such articles would therefore take up 200k - less than 0.00025% of the average currently sold hard disc.. <i>in total</i>.<br />
I personally don't see the reason why Wikipedia cannot be an encyclopedia on everything: we are not confined by shelving space, portability or storage space.<br />
There are plenty of articles that exist already which are arguably less 'notable' than primary schools in a given region of the world. If an editor wishes to start an article on <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navel_lint.html" title="Navel lint">Navel lint</a>, I don't see why this should be prevented. In fact that particular article's existance could be defended as being 'notable' as most people of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_World_97bb.html" title="Western World">Western World</a> have been 'victim' to it! In summary, at the minute, I feel like we have plenty to be getting on with, and we don't appear to be running out of space in the forseeable future. The rules, which I assume were written some time ago now, are possibly out-dated (in relation to the reasons for their creation). --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 07:57, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Repeating your denial doesn't make it anymore true. I have given this example article many times without getting a reply: in what way is <a href="../../../i/v/e/Iveagh_Primary_School_a430.html" title="Iveagh Primary School">Iveagh Primary School</a> <i>not</i> a directory entry? For crying out loud, the only sources are two directories... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:15, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I had been looking mostly at Abercorn, which is obviously not a directory entry. Admittedly, Iveagh is a pretty poor article - but the "sources are only two directories" is a really weak argument. Apart from which, none of the implications of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> seem to indicate it is a directory or directory entry anyways, as opposed to a stub. At some level they may look similar, but they're really not quite the same. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:04, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the article <a href="../../../i/v/e/Iveagh_Primary_School_a430.html" title="Iveagh Primary School">Iveagh Primary School</a>, it does not list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules, etc. as stated in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. It is not a directory at all.

<li><b>Reply</b> to <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> again. I notice you completely ignored my reference above to the primary school articles in many other countries which set the precedent for these articles. Delete these articles and these others surely have to go too - hardly acceptable or sensible. As an experienced Wiki-contributor I researched this before I started on primary schools articles for Northern Ireland. Perhaps some similar research on the part of others would have prevented this whole argument. I reiterate they are stubs and will be further developed. They are all linked to the towns/villages they refer to, but as these often have multiple schools merging the articles would not seem sensible. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 18:25, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please note that contributors have begun to expand some of the "offending" NI primary school articles already - hence proving the value of adding stubs in the first place and confirming the collaborative nature of our efforts to be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 18:43, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(Edit conflict)Can you point me to all those articles on primary schools that have survived an AfD? I'll help you and give articles that don't have subarticles for every primary school, like <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaverton_School_District_f764.html" title="Beaverton School District">Beaverton School District</a>. In fact, none of the articles in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchool_districts_in_Oregon_5b9e.html" title="Category:School districts in Oregon">Category:School districts in Oregon</a> have links to articles about elementary schools (and hardly any middle schools): only high schools get articles. One other random example? <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchool_districts_in_Indiana_8a14.html" title="Category:School districts in Indiana">Category:School districts in Indiana</a>: many high schools linked, a few middle schools, <b>not one</b> elementary school. There are of course articles about primary schools (sadly), just like there are many, many other articles that have no place on an encyclopedia. I already get nasty remarks about nominating twelve related ones at once, so you can hardly expect me to nominate them all at once... But there aren't that many as you may think: 17 for the whole of Australia (<a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrimary_schools_in_Australia_cfe5.html" title="Category:Primary schools in Australia">Category:Primary schools in Australia</a>), or 1 for Lancastershire (<a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrimary_schools_in_Lancashire_a2a2.html" title="Category:Primary schools in Lancashire">Category:Primary schools in Lancashire</a>). There is also 1 in Cork (<a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrimary_schools_in_Cork_a305.html" title="Category:Primary schools in Cork">Category:Primary schools in Cork</a>), which if kept is in need of a serious rewrite (even more than many other school articles is this just an advertisement, not an encyclopedic article at all). The content of many of these articles is depressing from an encyclopedic view (<a href="../../../m/i/l/Millfields_Primary_School_cac7.html" title="Millfields Primary School">Millfields Primary School</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/k/Sekolah_Kebangsaan_Taman_Suria_3262.html" title="Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Suria">Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Suria</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/a/Mearns_Primary_School_1aaa.html" title="Mearns Primary School">Mearns Primary School</a> (yeah, you can go shopping at lunchtime...)). In the few instances that many articles are created (Category:Primary Schools in Buckinghamshire), they have been left as stubs for almost a year now, with virtually interchangeable contents. Or can you tell the difference between <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grendon_Underwood_Combined_School_ed07.html" title="Grendon Underwood Combined School">Grendon Underwood Combined School</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steeple_Claydon_School_d804.html" title="Steeple Claydon School">Steeple Claydon School</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whaddon_Church_of_England_School_840e.html" title="Whaddon Church of England School">Whaddon Church of England School</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Crendon_School_ec7f.html" title="Long Crendon School">Long Crendon School</a>. It's the proliferation of those non-articles (who by the way do not show any sign of being "vandal magnets", as was said above as a reason for keeping (in some twisted way)) that I want to stop. They are uninteresting, interchangeable stubs because they are uninteresting, interchangeable schools. Just like the twelve schools up for deletion here... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:19, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reply to myself. I got a bit carried away, I hope I don't come across to harsh or aggressive here. If any of my comments were offensive, just drop me a note and I'll remove them. I don't want to turn this discussion into a battle, but I suppose most of you know the feeling of frustration when your arguments don't sway your opponents, and you just can't understand how they can have a different opinion on something so simple (well, obviously it isn't simple).

<li><b>Comment</b> "Uninteresting, interchangeable schools" - nice - people in Northern Ireland and in those communities would be so delighted to hear this, just as much as this author is delighted to hear it and authors in USA, Singapore etc etc etc will be delighted to hear it. You are of course entitled to your opinion, but I do have a problem when it is hampering work many of us feel is important however. As a result the frustration of <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> is, of course, nothing compared to my own.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Notability itself is not a policy (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>) because it is too hard to draw a line. Neither do <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESchools_f044.html" title="WP:Schools">WP:Schools</a>. It is a trap to compare a school other things. Its nature is simply different.

You might never know what <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_County%2C_Nebraska_145b.html" title="Valley County, Nebraska">Valley County, Nebraska</a> is.
