<li><b>Delete</b>: Non-notable band that broke up five years ago with no mentions on allmusic.com and only a used EP available on Amazon. According to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, a band is supposed to have two full-length albums but even this article admits they only have two EPs. This only survived the first Afd because it received so few votes and one of those was the maintainer. Google has a few hits but only a few German-language reviews in magazines that may or may not be notable.

<li><b>Anything Besides Delete</b> - First of all, the argument for deletion is not very convincing, as some of the information is not correct. I have never even heard of this "Alexa" traffic ranking. Even if it is a reputable source of information, the current time of year does not accurately represent the site's true traffic standpoint (it is currently not hurricane season, thus making the visitation to the website low). Second, there is an incomprehensible amount of articles on Wikipedia that have only been edited by one user and have not been deleted. And the fact that the article hasn't been edited in the last five days is not pertinent to this deletion at all. Who cares? I'm sure there are millions of articles that haven't even been edited in weeks or even months. Third, there is criteria met under the WP:WEB category. There are links to this site from "significant" weather sites such as Weather Underground (wunderground.com). Fourth, the title does not mean a center that tracks amateur hurricanes - it is a hurricane center run by amateur meteorologists. I am the author by the way, and just about every article that I have written has either been put up for deletion and called a drug dream or rudely edited from a well thought out, comprehensive article into someone else's trashy insult-of-an-article work without even crediting the original author.

<p>The article describes what it itself admits to be a neologism. The entire article boils down to "<b>Bouncy Balls</b> is another name for <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_sex.html" title="Anal sex">anal sex</a>.". At best, this would be a redirect, and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_sex.html" title="Anal sex">anal sex</a> would either mention the alternative names that it is known by or link to a WikiSaurus entry for that purpose. But after a modicum of research I can find no evidence that this <i>is</i> another name for anal sex. The article cites no sources, and everything that I can turn up turns out to be about ordinary balls, that bounce. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary of slang</a>, in any case. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:22, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. Having been convinced to actually buy one of these compasses, I can say that they don't really do what one would infer from reading about them. They don't actually point to the qiblih, they point to magnetic north like any other compass. The buyer is merely given a list of major cities and the corresponding degree heading by which to turn, so there's really no cool technology at work. The design is pretty flimsy as well - just lightweight, easily cracked or scratched plastic. A little research reveals both compasses to be made by the Silva company in Sweden. Being that: 1) the product description is a bit disingenuous, 2) I don't think there's really enough information here to justify a full article in its own right, and 3) this article is essentially an (unintentional, I'm sure) advertisement for one company, I move for article deletion. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKeldan_44b0.html" title="User:Keldan">Keldan</a> 08:09, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A deletion decision should not be based on what <i>is</i> there in the article, but what <i>could be</i> there, because each stub is "an acorn from which mighty trees can grow." The subject is clearly notable: millions of people own these things. Can a worthwhile article be written about it? Well, I'd say that what you've just written is interesting in itself. I'd prefer to <b>keep</b> it around for a while. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 08:26, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I doubt very seriously if "millions of people own these things". I'd be surprised if it were over 200 - the product is fairly new. All the same, I see your reasoning, and appreciate your input. I don't mind keeping it around for awhile (I'm certainly not trying to instigate some speedy deletion here), though I think I'll let the nomination for deletion stand. I also think I'll hop over to the article itself and NPOV some of that stuff from the AfD page, since out of the AfD page and in an article context it's rather caustic. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKeldan_44b0.html" title="User:Keldan">Keldan</a> 13:14, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I find the nomination very unsatisfactory; just because the nominator doesn't like this particular product itself isn't a good reason to delete an article about a class of historically interesting instruments. This is certainly not a new idea; I bought one (much nicer than the Silva one!) a decade ago, and they have been around for centuries (see <a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=AST0443" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=AST0443" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://islamicbookstore.com/a3708.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://islamicbookstore.com/a3708.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/astronomical_instruments_03.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/astronomical_instruments_03.shtml" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Although they function in the same way as a magnetic compass, they are more sophisticated (and elegant) than that sounds; they often have at least one additional pointer, inscriptions indicating major cities around the world, and tend toward the very ornate.

<p>Crooked Zebratry is a slang phrase referring to referees in American professional football that routinely make bad or questionable decisions. Often, it is seen as a case of bias or, less frequently, chronic incompetence. It usually refers to an entire referee staff as opposed to a specific individual, though it can refer to either. The reference to zebras is due to the referees' distinct black-and-white outfits.</p>
<p>An example would be an NFL Playoff Game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, January 15. 2006. Troy Polamalu clearly intercepted a Peyton Manning pass in the waning mintues of the 4th quarter. What would have been a game-ending play was overturned and ruled an incomplete pass. Later the NFL addmited it was an incorrect call and apologized</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> <a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmx3_0d46.html" title="User:Dmmx3">User:Dmmx3</a>, you might have divulged when voting that 'twas you who created this article, and indeed are quite likely to be Daniel himself- do you deny? At least I gather so, given the equal propensity for hyperbole. For starters, the reference to "Headed the #1 newspaper in the country" is presumably to the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockville_High_School_%28Maryland%29_22ee.html" title="Rockville High School (Maryland)">Rockville High School (Maryland)</a> student paper- which does seem to at least have been been the National Winner in the "High School publications" category of the <a href="http://www.edpress.org/mediacenter/2005StudentWinners.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.edpress.org/mediacenter/2005StudentWinners.htm" rel="nofollow">2005 Student Publishing Awards</a>. However, as per your/Daniel's article this was several years <i>after</i> your/Daniel's editorship: the actual editors who won the award could understandably feel a little peeved at this attempt to claim credit. As you note, this is supposed to be an encyclopaedia, and not some substitute for some (ex-)students' noticeboard.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Did maggin head the newspaper? yes. is the newspaper #1 in the country? yes. that said, i understand your semantical point. the phrasing could be confusing. so edit anything you see as untrue/misleading. i dont understand why one would want to delete because of that. when maggin headed the paper it did not compete in the national competition. however it did compete within the state and was not only number one, but receved 98.5 out of 100, the highest score ever for a publication. maggin also won various specific awards that could be included here including awards for layout, news article writing, and headline writing. ill see if this info can be fuond online and include a link.</li>

<p>There is no article for writers in the Birr area: he is a notable writer. While the books are self published, they sold well and he got good exposure locally.</p>
<p>Writes extensivly in the local media, through his and other papers, and published the "Sliabh Bloom" periodical every 4 months.</p>
<p>Has certainly done enough for Birr to be included. Maybe merge with the main Birr article?</p>

<li>Zoe correctly notes below that this phrase is in the appropriate article (which needs to be sourced). The Bart article has no link to The Simpsons catch phrases so I think at least a small merge should be performed, to keep a reader of the character bio aware that the series' subarticle about catchphrases exists.

As it happens, Atheism arises from reasoning about both physical and metaphysical concepts, both of which are amply demonstrated in Richard Dawkins' work, contrary to the POV expressed by the article's creator. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background: #800080" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font></a> 21:15, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And your user-page, full of the huffing and puffing and delusions of grandeur one would expect from an Atheist (assumed to be more creative - for example), is a typical example of the Atheistic arrogance from which you suffer, it's ok for you to generalize, but God forbid when a Christian does it, or any Theist for that matter. Atheism must be defeated head on, I would be glad to meet you in battle and slay you myself, you are nothing but filth to me, believe me, you are like dirt to me, you must be wiped out with aggression. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.144.83.215 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.144.83.215.html" title="User talk:86.144.83.215">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.144.83.215_7426.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.144.83.215">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>I'm new to this process, but I nominated this article as it seemed to me to be an obvious case of an article that would bring Wikipedia into disrepute if read by any serious seeker of information, and which seemed incapable of salvation without starting wholly afresh. I nominated this article for deletion after spending some time trying to edit it constructively; at first I thought maybe it could be cleaned up, but I changed my mind after trying. The problems with it as I see it are multiple. As a review of the "History of zoology post Darwin", it stops at about 1910, it only addresses a single narrow issue (and from a rather strange personal perspective), and it does so in terms so outdated that the discussion is of mere historical curiosity. Anyone reading for any factual content would be very seriously misled. I think that an article on this topic is a fine idea, but I do not think it is possible to use this text as a starting point for an article of any contemporary credibility. I have no idea why you've got people transcribing science articles from the Encyclopedia Britannica of 1911, this seems crazy to me. <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGleng_c015.html" title="User:Gleng">Gleng</a> 10:30, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> obviously I am against this deletion. I made this list in an effort to preserve some of these patches in an encyclopedic fashion. I also beleive that this page is useful for showing what a major element patch trading is at the national jamboree and scouting in general. Obviously not all the patches are the best of scans, but this is an ongoing project of mine,(and anyone else if they would like to help) and If I find better scans I would put them on here. I do not know anything about the commons and GFDL so I'm really unsure about all of that. I understand why this is being considered but I'm asking for it to stay because I do think it is noteworthy when you consider just how big an event the National Jamboree is in scouting (think olympics like, considering it only happens once every 4 years) and just how big an aspect patch trading is. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeefybot_ce15.html" title="User:Beefybot">Beefybot</a> 22:02, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> Interesting, yes, but completely unencylopedic POV, original research, opinion, what have you. As Zargulon said, almost every item here is open to debate. For example, "12 noon" is not necessarily redundant, it depends on the usage and application. In applications where a numerical time indicator is required, the "noon" or "midnight" (or perhaps a.m. or p.m.) qualifier is essential. "As to whether" is arguably not a redundancy, it's just incorrect grammar. And how about "bouquet of flowers". I don't think that's redundant. Ever heard of or seen a bouquet of balloons? I have. Amusing and interesting, but not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 00:25, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Some</i> high schools are notable. <i>A few</i> high schools are notable. The rest are just cookie-cutter entities, another Smartie in the box. As far as articles about every school in the English speaking world goes, I think that's (thankfully) wishful thinking - fortunately, it looks like a couple of the big stub-mill editors have run out of steam and the rate of production of these pathetic little articles is diminishing. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 01:32, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b>, or at the very least, merge any useful content and redirect.

<li><b>Redirect</b> back to main article. I don't see the need for a merge, as the content originated in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> (its all either there, or in history). <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> in theory needs to be broken out, but the problem is, that whenever there are spin-off articles, people insist on writing in excessive detail about it in the main article. I suggest 80% of what's normally in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> (which changes day-to-day) is better placed in some sub-article (such as the ones for the individual controversies, trials, albums, individual songs, individual videos, every song he ever wrote, his former pet, his house, his associates, etc.......). Another spin-off won't fix it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:12, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> is too long, and it has been shortened. I think having a main article that explains Michael Jackson's music career and personal life, and then a sub-article that explains his personal life in more detail, and album pages for every album so to explain them in more detail, is a great idea. We need to keep the main article at an appropriate length, and putting in too much information about controversies will only make it longer. Over time we can improve both articles and in particular, improve the main article so there's an even amount of music career and personal life. This could work out really well if you give it a chance. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 11:20, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<li>LOL, we are <i>not</i> the same person. I suggested something in the Michael Jackson talk page about merging the personal life with the biographical details. Patrick then acted on it and split the personal life from the main article (after I had merged the personal life stuff with the music career/bio stuff). Also, people saying the personal life stuff is "hidden amongst" the music career stuff, or saying the main article is like a "glorified discography" is really frustrating me. Read the current article and you'll see there is as much (probably more by now) personal stuff as musical stuff in the biography. Alot of work has gone into structuring the main article like a biography and it annoys me that people think myself and the users who helped edit the article like a bio have some POV agenda. I personally think alot of people who edit <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> also have a POV agenda, but an anti-Jackson one, as they seem to want to remove all musical stuff from the article and just have personal life. Hello? Michael Jackson is a recording artist. There you go, my rant for the day. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 12:36, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appears to be a vanity page created solely to describe El Kermito. Note that the only user to edit this page is Davekermito. The only page that links to it is El Kermito (<a href="../../../h/a/l/Halesowen.html" title="Halesowen">Halesowen</a> used to until I reverted Davekermito's changes.) <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 16:29, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect. Check Ryans gig guide for details (available in all good newsagents). Partly correct however is the fact that El Kermito are one of the more famous exponents of the scene (single hitting no 74 in the Norwegian top 75) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Davekermito (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavekermito_c9f7.html" title="User talk:Davekermito">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Davekermito_70cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Davekermito">contribs</a>) 11:43, 24 January 2006 (UTC-5)</small>

<li>Please remember to sign your talk-page edits with four tildes (~). It helps us keep track of who says what. Also, do check out <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for information on the inclusion of music-related articles. I don't think Noodle-rock meets those criteria. Arguably, neither does El Kermito, but that's a discussion for another time. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 16:47, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thats a matter of opinion.

<ul>
<li>Which is why we're having this vote for deletion. It's used to resolve disagreements. (Adding insults to a user's main and talk pages is generally not as effective, by the way.)

<li><b>Delete</b> "Noodle Rock" gets only 120 unique google hits, some of which are not to uses of the term but to phrases such as "...Noodle. Rock is..." and many of the rest are to blogs or similar sites of limited reliability. The current article cites no sources. Unless reliable sources are cited in the article establishing soem degree of widespread usage or other notability for this term this articel should be delted. El Kermito BTW, was recently deleted as non-notable under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> criterion A7 (non-notable people or groups). <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:30, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Davekermito has made a claim of notability (namely its appearance in an industry publication). If true, I think that would remove it from speedy consideration, although not from this VfD. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 17:33, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>To be clear, I wasn't saying that this page should be speedy deleted -- speedys for non notable items apply <b>only</b> to individuals, or to groups of people such as clubs and bands. See <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#Articles</a> (criterion A7). I was merely reporting that the formerly linked article on the band El Kermito was deleted -- it seems that I made an editing error and failed to copy that link into my comment above.

<li>As <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> points out, the word is actually <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pantywaist" class="extiw" title="wikt:pantywaist">pantywaist</a>, which has nothing to do with vaginas. The creator of the article is arguing (on my talk page) that the fact that the word has been used in a movie, showing its occurrence in popular culture, makes it encyclopaedia-worthy. That is a patently flawed argument, as there are <i>lots</i> of words that one can find used in movie dialogue. A word being used in a well-known work doesn't make an encyclopaedia article. Quotations make dictionary articles, not encyclopaedia articles. A quotation, showing a word in use in context in a well-known work, is straightforward dictionary article content. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:08, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> As the author of of this bit, I have to say I am somewhat hurt with the hostility taken by some(although most have been quite nice) of the other editors here. Pamento thought it would be a hoot to link this page to my home page for an example of panty waste, while Dan stated he wanted it deleted with prejudice(if you have already prejudged the article, should your oppinion even count) both of whom were asked to help me write the article(I guess it was funnier to make fun of my article than to help write an article). But mostly I was shoicked to find<a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrator.html" title="Administrator">Administrator</a> UncleG making claims that I argued the articles relevance based on it being in a film. I never made this argument and as an administrator(an a man whom I truely truely admire) I would have thought he would have not made the accusation, or at least appologized after realizing that it wasnt the intent of my argument. What I said was that I used the same formula that was used in the <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagnut.html" title="Zagnut">zagnut</a> article, telling what the meaning of the word is and then referencing it to a film where people could here the term being used in a film, and also (presumably) see what a person who is considered a panty waste might look like. I was deeply hurt that he never bother to at least appologize for misinterperating me. At any rate I want to at least give the reasons I wrote this article(although it seems at this point that it is unlikely anything I say will change the outcome) so that people will realize I was attempting to make a legitamit article, and while Im sure that the knowing ones will be able to tell me a million different reasons why I was stupid to think this, I wanted to at least make this known. I looked up the term panty waste and found it had 7300 plus entries, that is aproximately seven thousand more entries than the term pantywaist has(about about four hundred fifty). By my resoning I thought that the fact that the vast majority of people refered to the term in this manner it would make the term valid...regardless of weather the knowing ones can prove that NO SUCH TERM EXISTS...to me it seeems that if the vast majority of people THINK the term has meaning, then it therefore DOES have meaning. It seems similar to the case of <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Norton_5135.html" title="Emperor Norton">Emperor Norton</a> WAS the emperor of the United States, at least in the san francisco area, because those in the san fransico area treated him as if he WERE the Emperor of the United States. If a large amount of people Accept that a term exists, I felt that simply the fact that since so many (7300) were using the term, it therefore DID exist. But my friend cenestrad had warned me about such assumptions, stating that while wikipedia has a brain it has no soul, and that regardless of what the average person thinks is correct, The knowing ones will be quick to explain to them that no such term exists has ever existed or ever will exist. It seems as though he was correct, and I shouldn't be suprised by it, but I am a little saddened. I will not vote to keep my article as the KNOWING ONES have already informed me I should have never written it to begin with, but I will offer mya pickle for the knowing ones, or truth in a homespun dress<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel</a> 20:58, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>: i appreciate that you are genuine in your desire to contribute a good article to Wikipedia. However, this article is innapproriate, and from your comments on his talk page I do not think <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> is too mistaken in stating that you considered the article had relevance because of film references. Regarding the spelling, I presume by entries you are referring to google search results. In which case "panty waste" give 9840 <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Panty+waste%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Panty+waste%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> results, where as the correct "panty waist" gives 17,700 <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Panty+waist%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Panty+waist%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> — vastly more.

<li><b>Keep</b> I was told by Pickelbarrel that an article he wrote entitled Panty Waste was the subject of an AFD and he wondered if I could use my powers to help save the article. He had been tireless in the campaign to save the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taint.html" title="Taint">Taint</a> article so I felt obligated to take a look. After reading the article and the debate on both sides I am afraid I have no choice but to side with the argument for deletion for the current article. But before those of you voting delete get excited at having my endorsement my research did turn up several uses for the term and so the current article will not exist for long. It seems located in the City of San Francisco there is a museum dedicated to undergarments named Panty Waste (yes that is the spelling). If the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Bad_Art_c323.html" title="Museum of Bad Art">Museum of Bad Art</a> can have its own article I suppose the Panty Waste museum can as well. The museum also sponsors a touring exhibition again entitled Panty Waste. The article is getting larger. Also of note is a line of Adult Movies entitled Panty Waste. So it seems this misspelling (an art Pickelbarrel has mastered) has unearthed a cornucopia of possible new articles. I see a possible Panty Waste disambiguation page in the future. Lastly I would like to ask that more senior editor treat newer editors with kindness. I know that sometimes they can be tiresome but remember it is their boundless energy that fuels the world of Wikipedia. This I order for the common good. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad The Emperor of Wikipedia</a> 03:27, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Perhaps you should read Section 329 of the Elections Act and find out. What you quoted is misleading. --199.44.251.2 02:11, 24 January 2006 (UTC) .. BTW if anyone is interested. Reuters has posted the results. A link can be found on the discussion page for the article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I read Section 329 and found it unclear on the exact application of the law. Here's an article from the CBC today that sheds some more light: <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/nb/story/nb_web_20060123.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cbc.ca/nb/story/nb_web_20060123.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/nb/story/nb_web_20060123.html</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 02:20, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p><s>:*Section 329 seems to specifically address the idea of "outside Canada" and I think that's wrong. Besides, Wikipedia is not "outside Canada." What's relevant is that people inside Canada can access the information. It doesn't matter that the servers for Wikipedia or the offices for Wikipedia are located in the U.S. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 02:29, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</s> never mind.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I don't think anything in this article is useful, correct, and unique to this article. First, the author doesn't know whereof he speaks, since a set cannot contain itself in the modern axioms of set theory. The point of the article seems to be to expound on <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell%27s_paradox.html" title="Russell's paradox">Russell's paradox</a>, but in such an unsophisticated way that it is entirely superceded by that article. Second, he doesn't understand his terminology and seems to think it makes an essential difference to talk about <i>sets</i>, <i>families</i>, <i>collections</i>, etc. The distinction between <i>set</i> and <i>class</i> <b>is</b> important, but he doesn't even mention the word (even where it would be correct). This article is half in error, half in ignorance, and half in over its head. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 14:29, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> when redirecting without merging, the target article should be determined by the title, not the content, because the content won't be there anymore (except in the history). I don't think it makes much sense to have "sets of sets" pointing at <a href="../../../n/a/i/Naive_set_theory.html" title="Naive set theory">naive set theory</a> (which by the way is a problematic article for other reasons, but that's not important right now). <a href="../../../v/o/n/Von_Neumann_universe_53c0.html" title="Von Neumann universe">Von Neumann universe</a> on the other hand talks about sets that consist only of sets. A more specific target would be <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_set.html" title="Hereditary set">hereditary set</a>, if we had such an article. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:13, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Update</b> I went ahead and wrote a brief article at <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_set.html" title="Hereditary set">hereditary set</a> (I haven't called it a "stub" because I'm not sure how much more we really want to say, though there is an interesting philosophical sidelight to mention if I could find the reference).

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, in set theory as usually studied, a set <i>can't</i> contain itself as an element. (That is, no sets in the von Neumann universe are elements of themselves.)

<li><b>Comment.</b> The reason I'm fighting this so much it that I think it sets a dangerous precedent for including articles for every young person who particpates in these young peoples music competitions, maybe wins one and gets written up in their hometown paper. It's easy to make it look impressive and if we allow this, Wikipedia will be inundated with articles of talented kids. This is not <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midori_Goto_780c.html" title="Midori Goto">Midori</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Groban_1fa6.html" title="Josh Groban">Josh Groban</a>, not even close, and I do not see that she was "featured" in the NY Times. The article was from the New Jersey local news section of the Times (she lives in New Jersey) talking about teenagers that weren't getting into trouble. That's a long way from a feature story in the Arts section of the Times. With all due respect, I really think AfD submissions like this deserve more careful analysis. It's nothing personal against Ms. Yan, who seems like a perfectly charming, intelligent, and talented young lady who will go very far in music, or whatever she decides to pursue. It's about keeping to the WP:MUSIC and WP:BIO guidelines. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 12:48, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The NY Times article was not about youths not getting into trouble; it was merely an opening. The rest of the article features two young pianists, Dae Hyung Ahn and Sophia Yan, both NJ residents. I believe the same article was later distributed in the Metro section of the Times. In addition, some of the competitions are now registed under a different name, but the winners do not change. From what I could find, she seems to have placed first a number of times in various competitions. You win a Steinway in one of them (cannot remember which) as the first place winner! Also, Midori can no longer be considered a youth. The difference is this -- while Midori and Groban have careers, they are professionals. Yan is a rising star, which is why I am intent on following her career path. Exactly that makes her a notable youth. There are some more details that I suppose can be included to fit the bio requirements. Mozart250</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If Wikipedia is about noting rising young stars with potential then we should Keep all the new young rock bands we keep Deleting here. As for Midori, I meant Midori when she was young and competing on the stage on equal footing with adults. Same with Groban. Also, I don't see anywhere that the Steinway Society competition "gives away a Steinway." According to the Web site, "The Steinway Society is a tax exempt, piano scholarship organization" which people pay to join. Also, people pay to attend the conerts. They take the proceeds from the membership and the concert admissions and divide it up into scholarship funds for the winners. Last years it was "$3-4,000" to all the winners. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 18:36, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

IN any case, I'm not sure if the value of the prize is any relation to the notability of the perfomer. Speaking of the MTNA competition, it does say that the purpose of the national competition which Yang won is "to provide educational experiences for students and teachers and to recognize exceptionally talented young artists" which again just puts her in the really talented student category, not qute in the WP:MUSIC league. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 21:22, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've thought about this a lot after cleaning up the article and attempting to monitor it, and I'm no longer sure it deserves a place on Wikipedia. Look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Enterprise_alleged_continuity_problems&amp;curid=1239021&amp;diff=36431411&amp;oldid=36430736" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Enterprise_alleged_continuity_problems&amp;curid=1239021&amp;diff=36431411&amp;oldid=36430736" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> - It may be perfectly valid as a theory, but there's no way to check if the contributer simply thought that up on the spot and added it, thus <strike>it's original research</strike> it might be original research. The same could also be said about some of my own additions. The article is wide open for original research and in some people's eyes may qualify as Trekcruft. There's also the very real danger that it is succeptable to an easy loss of POV, given the 'soapbox' style favoured by some. The article's talk page demonstrates some of these problems. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 09:50, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. I think it's an interesting and encyclopedic article (despite hardly being a Trekkie at all, honest.) I agree that OR is a problem and I agree it's a big one - with a lot of articles - but it calls for discussion and cleanup, not deletion. Someone should certainly go through it carefully and remove the OR. Is there a "This article is suspected to contain original research" tag that can be put on articles like this? Can we have one?

<li>The trouble is, with something like this, there's no way to determine what is or isn't original research. You can't cite sources for arguments as you would with another article e.g. <i>"The <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Voyager_%28Star_Trek%29_c62e.html" title="USS Voyager (Star Trek)">Voyager</a> once docked at</i> <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Space_Nine_9b3a.html" title="Deep Space Nine">Deep Space Nine</a><i>. (VOY: "Caretaker")</i> Almost all the sections run with "some fans theorise..." With the exception of those situations where the studio has put forth an explanation for 'errors' and this can be cited, this could all be seen as OR. And given that the studio has been largely silent in regards to its alleged violation of the Star Trek canon, except to say "we haven't done it," what does that leave for the article? - <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 11:23, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually there is, and you mention it yourself: Cited sources. If people have already published books or magazine articles propounding arguments about continuity and self-consistency, then documenting those arguments is not original research. One <i>can</i> cite sources, <i>if</i> they exist. The problem with the article is whether the sources exist, or whether the entire contents of this article are new arguments and theories made up by Wikipedia editors directly in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:17, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But you also have the problem of judging <i>reputable</i> sources. I'd hate for the article to be filled up with links to places like Neoseeker where coversation runs in a similar fashion to, <i>"an wat are the romulanz doin wiv warp drive - pissants don't have it yet."</i> And even respected sites such as Ex Astris Scientia are ultimately run by one person so whilst I may find it to be a valid source, User X may not. This is what I see as the main problem with the article. By its nature, it cannot be adequately cited as say, an article about perceptions of FOXnews, which would be covered in national papers and the like. For something such as this, I feel the only options are allowing OR or deleting the article. Clearly, the first is not allowed so that leaves one solution. - <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 17:45, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article does have its merit, it may not be provable that these are discontinuities but the article points to real and certifiable concerns of some of the Star Trek fans about the production of new episodes for the series.

<li>Even if it had "potential", or parts of it had "merit", do you guys really foresee that the necessary work will be done to source it properly? It seems more likely just to be a persistent embarrassment to WP (like many other pages), not doing justice to the parts of it which are good, which would be far more credible in the context of various other articles.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There's hardly a TV show out there that doesn't have "continuity problems" like this.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I disagree with Monicasdude. Details are everything to the harder-core Star Trek fans. Perhaps "Continuity Problems in TV Show 'Family Ties'" doesn't warrant a page, but it certainly does for Star Trek. I sympathize with the people who point out its lack of sources, and the page certainly needs work, but I think it's an important enough topic to warrant an article (or at least part of one). -<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBindingtheory_054a.html" title="User:Bindingtheory">Bindingtheory</a> 14:45, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Merge most important points into main article</b>. This vote comes after a lot of soul-searching since I was one of the people who originated this article, spinning it off from the main series article. Its purpose prior to May 2005 was essentially to try and provide an outlet for both criticism and rebuttal of a then-current television series which had become very controversial, and the tug-of-war between people who assumed every line of dialogue was wrong and those who actually liked the show had derailed the main article once to often. The series is no longer current, therefore IMO this article's function is at an end <i>in it's current form</i>. Perhaps an article on overall Trek continuity issues could be created from this; after all, Phil Farrand published at least 3 "Nitpicker" books on the subject for TOS, TNG and DS9. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:05, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please give the admins more credit than this. First, you've turned the AfD page into an awful mess. A simple sockpuppet notice at the top of the AfD would have been sufficient. Second, you're also likely creating a bias against a delete vote by your actions, since editors will see this mess and automatically assume that the nomination was in bad faith. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but please bear in mind that closing admins are supposed to look at such things when determining consensus. Also, bear in mind that this is not a vote. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 16:20, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Talk page linked from the main article The Game (game). While the location is obviously innapropriate, I believe the page itself has no relevance, either (hence why I brought the issue here). As "The Game" is a meme, there is little to no evidence of "The Game" being played in any of these locations, nor do I believe would such a list be encyclopedic (would "List of places where Monopoly is played be appropriate?). <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:45, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Further to my previous vote, I have reviewed the site and had a second thought. My first was that the site merited a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-empty_b1c9.html" title="Template:Db-empty">db-empty</a>}} tag for failing to assert the notability of the website, as per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. My second thought is to reduce the vote to <i>delete</i> in order to give the author and/or other minded contributors time to review the website and include its notable elements in the article text. I concede that the article informs me of a website of which I was not previously aware. I will also point out that the article is devoid of all mention of the notability of this website amongst its peers. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background: #800080" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font></a> 17:42, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I originally nominated the page for speedy deletion; in hindsight, it doesn't actually meet the CSD, because it does assert notability. -Ikkyu2 01:18, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. To repeat my crossed-out comment: I think Unlawful arrest should not redirect to false arrest, as it is a much broader concept. False arrest is a common law tort. An arrest can be unlawful for many reasons, such as (in the United States) that it violates the Fourth Amendment. --<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunk_641f.html" title="User:Thunk">Thunk</a> 22:56, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The page is not an article that sets out to explain the concepts in a coherent fashion but is a series of points and factual statements without proper context.

<li><b>Keep</b> – I'm the one who created the article, so I might be biased. But I believe the Weka project implementations are fairly well known in the machine learning community and used in contemporary research. Accordingly, I feel this subject matter is encyclopedic. I'm planning on submitting a paper to ICML that cites these implementations for some of the algorithms I tested in the research.--AlphaEtaPi 23:23, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
