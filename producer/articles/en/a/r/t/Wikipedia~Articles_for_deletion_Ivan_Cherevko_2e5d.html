<p>Listed for speedy by Hedley, because "Only Google hits are on pages containing this Wikipedia content or entries into 'Ivan' or 'births' lists labelling him a child prodigy. How is this person notable? Saying their IQ is 'much higher than 200' probably means they added themselves, his book gives no results bar those contexts just displaying the article shown on Wikipedia. I nominated for speedy delete because I see 'self-vanity' articles nominated all of the time." , then anon changed it to vfd and forgot to actually add it.

<li>I am plain citizen of Ukraine. My name will not tell you anything, but name of Ivan is known in all corners of out country. I hope you'll excuse me for my poor English. I with my friends was very glad and proud of our country when we saw this article. I was confused and ashamed when I encountere this VfD - this article shows facts, not "hoax" or some other fraud. Hedley, Grue and RidG are trying to make their guesses to be facts. But is there really any reason to delete Ivan Cherevko article? What the honorable criticists are negating? Fact, that Ivan finished the school at eleven years ( <a href="http://www.rronline.ws/cgi-bin/news.pl?MODE=GET_NEWS&amp;ID=209410" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rronline.ws/cgi-bin/news.pl?MODE=GET_NEWS&amp;ID=209410" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - article in a "Russian advertising - Russian newspaper New York", <a href="http://edu.kiev.ua/press/rubez/sch_ext.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://edu.kiev.ua/press/rubez/sch_ext.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - Kiev's education)? That he is studying in one of the elite Ukrainian universities in such a young age ( <a href="http://www.day.ua/127094/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.day.ua/127094/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - article in big Ukrainian newspaper "the Day")? That Ukrainian Academy of Sciences has published his book when he was ten years old (<a href="http://pleyady.kiev.ua/ukr/izdat/books.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://pleyady.kiev.ua/ukr/izdat/books.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> - "Pleyady" publishing house article)? Fact, that he is an author of his own published ecological theory (Seventh International University Conference in field of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, Lviv, Ukraine, 2004)? You accuse this article of hoax and vanity. Hoax is anything deliberately intended to deceive (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hoax" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hoax" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). There are links from independent sources listed above, that prove almost everything that Ivan Cherevko is about. I hope there is a lot of Wikipedians that speak Russian and Ukrainian. Vanity is an excessive pride in or admiration of one's own appearance or archievements (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Vanity" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Vanity" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). If there is only one such kid in Ukraine, country with 50-million population, where does "excessive" pride can came from? I stated before that everything in this brief article is correct and corresponds with my image of Ivan Cherevko, child prodigy from Ukraine. <b>Keep</b> - --<a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykola_Petrenko_4486.html" title="User:Mykola Petrenko">Mykola Petrenko</a> 18:12, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Look, there are NO Google hits for both Russian and Ukrainian spelling of his name, a few lines about him in newspaper isn't enough, a book written under a pseudonym could've easily been written by anyone else and a statement about IQ is completely unverifiable. Obviously he's not as notable as you want him to be, even in Ukraine. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 18:47, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Anyone so 'notable' nationwide would have a more vivid set of Google results. The first article mentions Ivan/Vanya Cherevko - Even if that is the same person, how does that justify inclusion? Another article I translated is about young scientists - Nothing to do with Cherevko. I assume you must be affliated or the article writer - I'll be voting delete until you can prove his notability. Furthermore, the article was originally written by 'Yanus' who only edited a few articles, the majority adding Cherevko's name. Possibly self-addition/vanity.<a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 19:03, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all - there is yandex.ru for russian spelling. Timofei, you have to know that Google does not support case endings so is very limited in russian/ukrainian search, and both russian and ukrainian version + Vanya Cherevko + Ivanko Cherevko and variation yield quite a linksome, and you also could help Mr. Hedley by adding that Ivan and Vanya are the same, and that second article clearly states in fourth paragrsph: "Close idea [to the one of Alexei Bondar] was submitted by the youngest participant of competition, Ivan Cherevko, 13-years-old sophomore student of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy..." (full text in Russian for you, Timofei: Близкой по идее оказалась и работа самого юного участника конкурса Ивана Черевко, 13-летнего студента второго курса Киево-Могилянской академии. Иван проблему утилизации бытовых отходов, в частности пищевых упаковок, предложил решать на уровне создания технологий их производства, где бы заранее закладывался экологически чистый способ их уничтожения. А так как в будущем Иван готовится стать экологом и очень переживает за «чистоту» пространства своего государства, он разработал серию игр для детей, которые бы с малых лет приучали молодое поколение не только быть экологически грамотными, но и придерживаться правил экологической культуры в своих разнообразных действиях.). If you were more attentive, you could read at link number [2], that Cherevko and Kowchuk is the same person: "Під псевдонімом Ковчук написав книгу "Мої десять". Це його перша книга , в якій відтворено бачення минулого, оцінка і характеристика теперішнього, а також погляд у майбутнє.", or 'Under pen name Kowchuk has weitten book "My ten". This is his first book, in which vision of past, analysis of present and view into future are united". And yes, from some point of view I am Ivan's affiliate, as I am one of Albert Einstein and Lewis Caroll. I am fascinated by his affairs, just like Einstein's and Caroll's, but I haven't met neither of them in reallife. Assuming such a serious accusement to the Ukrainian Academy of Science that have supported him in fraud you should have some serious proof to support it - not just "possibly". As was stated on one of the "Wikipedia:" pages, deletion is not an easy affair. You can't just say "delete-because-I-want-to". You proof is too light, I need to say? Need more links? Oh, I have handsome of them just near me, starting from homesite (<a href="http://ivcherevko.narod.ru" class="external autonumber" title="http://ivcherevko.narod.ru" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, I guess.... Yes, exactly), and right to the text of interview at BBC russian. I want to add, that I've done not so much work gathering those links, and plain unattentiveness should not be your guideline at voting.--<a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykola_Petrenko_4486.html" title="User:Mykola Petrenko">Mykola Petrenko</a> 20:52, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I happen to read Russian, and some Ukranian. This "он разработал серию игр для детей, которые бы с малых лет приучали молодое поколение не только быть экологически грамотными, но и придерживаться правил экологической культуры в своих разнообразных действиях" basically says that he created a series of games for children designed to promote knowledge of proper ecology, etc. - that hardly qualifies him as a child prodigy. I see absolutely nothing in the links you've posted that supports your contention that he has published his own ecological theory. I think that in this case, the burden of proof lies upon you to lend factual credibility to your assertions. I would be more than happy to review other links you post, whether in English, Russian, or Ukranian. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG">(talk)</a> 21:12, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, what we've got: <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_prodigy.html" title="Child prodigy">Child prodigy</a> states that child prodigy is the kid that at age of 10 doing just like adult. He wrote a book at year of 10 (nobody objects this by now, I hope). Dudes, I am 19 and could never write anything like this even at the price of my life.

<li>Marginal <b>keep</b>. It is a best practice to err on the side of inclusion and in this case there is substantial notability to justify retention of this article. --GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 17:59, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thats like me adding the Fig Roll Monster of Doom and saying it exists because theres references in a cave located on one of <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter.html" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s moons. If there are references you should supply them to the VfD consensus. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:54, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>So Google is The Authority, and a library in Ukraine doesn't count as being on Earth? Are sure you want to say this, because it sounds completely bigoted to me? <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2005-03-17&#160;15:46&#160;Z</small></i>
<ul>
<li>That was not what I implied. What I was stating is that it is very easy to say a library in Ukraine contains information on him, but nobody can check that, thus it is like me saying information proving the existance of Fig Roll Monster of Doom (in example) exists, but that I can't show you it. In the case of a VfD, information in a Ukrainian library isn't available, and so Google has to be the authority as there is no other alternative. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 02:14, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I believe that instead of a full article, a mention should be made in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_prodigy.html" title="Child prodigy">Child prodigy</a> article, like it was made for Jessica Constant or Alia Sabur. What I feel I must say is that there, in fact, are 2570 Google hits for the Russian spelling of his name (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD+%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BE&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD+%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BE&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> - Grue, if you didn't find any, thats probably because there's some weird sort of thing going on with codepages when cyrillic characters are used in the actual URL), and that Russian search engines do return a few results, yes.

<li>He shouldn't be in the child prodigy article. His article is a blatant ego trip, which should have been speedied in the first place. If Cherevko stays the entire membership of MidYis and organisations of 'geniuses', assuming Cherevko is one (after all, he needs to get people from a University to 'support' him on this VfD, note all the new users voting here), should also be added to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:50, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>First, you didn't put quotes around the name, so some of these are "Cherevko Petr, Aisuk Ivan, ...". Second, there is a saxophonist, a former worker of a factory, a diver and a lot of other people who share his name. All not notable. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 15:55, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Agreeed on both points; but then I was merely reacting to your "there are NO Google hits for both Russian and Ukrainian spelling of his name" phrase.
