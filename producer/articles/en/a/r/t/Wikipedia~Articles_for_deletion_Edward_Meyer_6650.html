<p><b>Delete</b> - Nn "Hollywood player," only credits are segment producer for Entertainment Tonight and the upcoming (next year) movie Horrorween. The page is now filled with patent nonsense, but even the original version had items like "is compared by some to Colonel Tom Parker." Methinks tis a vanity page <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 21:42, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Doesn't appear to be notable. As a side issue, the person who created this article appears to be spamming Wiki with multiple articles advertising 'Horrorween'. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 21:55, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG DON'T DELETE</b> POV corrected and previous article version restored. Current article version contains no patent nonsense, nor vanity. Notable as writer, producer, director and star of one of the most publicized upcoming Independent films <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horrorween.html" title="Horrorween">Horrorween</a>, staring the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Body_Guy_91a4.html" title="Dead Body Guy">Dead Body Guy</a>. Over 100 stars &amp; celebrities are involved with the project, so the many people adding <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horrorween.html" title="Horrorween">Horrorween</a> to these peoples articles is not spam! Further, more than one of the above mention Deletes, come from people who have continued to edit the page, after they recommended Delete???--Whoizzy</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> All of your edits have been towards this person and this movie... a movie that isn't even filmed yet. Yes, adding content about a film (which had yet to materialize) to various articles is, in fact, linkspam. Also, regardless of removing the POV problems, this person just plain isn't notable. His IMDB credits are a grand total of two. As for the editing, you seem to insist on making all external links in bold and so those need to be edited. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 04:46, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>STRONGER DON'T DELETE</b></s> Before you unprofessionally jump to uniformed conclusions, please take your time and research the existing press for this movie and the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Body_Guy_91a4.html" title="Dead Body Guy">Dead Body Guy</a> it<i>s star. It is predicted by the press to be one of the biggest films of 2007. It has a cult following, as also does the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Body_Guy_91a4.html" title="Dead Body Guy">Dead Body Guy</a> it's star, in the hundreds of thousands of fans already! I am one of those fans&#160;!!! Whoizzy</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b> Before making wild claims like <i>It is predicted by the press to be one of the biggest films of 2007</i> back up the claim. Show ANY respectable media which has said this. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 16:04, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who is making wild claims, as you don't seem to know anything about the movie and the worldwide press that it is getting each and every day! You call yourself an Editor??? I guess anyone can call themselves an Editor on Wikipedia? Whoizzy</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are the one making wild claims. You have not provided one shred of evidence to back your claims that this person and this film are even remotely notable. If it is all over the media, it shouldn't be too difficult to do so.<a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 21:56, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that you just want to slander, libel and trash <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horrorween.html" title="Horrorween">Horrorween</a>, look at your previous article IrishGuy, it didn't even meet any Wikipedia criteria at all!!!!!</p>
<p>IrishGuy, here is your previous article...</p>
<p>User:Irishguy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>This is my wildly unexciting article.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>...and you compain about other people's legitimate articles IrishGuy!!!Whoizzy</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b> that isn't a <i>previous</i> article. That is an editor's welcome page. There is a difference.<a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 22:36, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Find some evidence of notability. Period. Short of that, this article will need to go. The article you are linking to isn't mine. That is why it is a redlink. I have no idea what you are even talking about at this point. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 22:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Go on the www.DeadBodyGuy.com site and the www.Horrorween.com site and look at the press, then also search in Lexis/Nexis, Newsblaze.com, Yahoo, Google, etc., etc. You will see all the articles and blogs, and if you are a real Editor, which I doubt, you can see the notariety of this movie and it's cast &amp; crew! STOP FLAMING AND GET A LIFE!!!Whoizzy</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have looked at those sites. Horroween.com only has two lines quoted, both of which give no verifiable source. I googled. Only two hits for the Horroween film, the rest were for other things (videogames, etc) with the same title. There is no palpable sense of anxiousness for this film. There is no sign at all of notability. If you believe there is then provide it. Otherwise let it go.<a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 22:13, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><s><b>AN EVEN STRONGER DON'T DELETE</b></s> Look again, you missed alot. You are lying also, because on the Horrorween.com site, there is a link to an article written by the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning newswire service!!! Have you or Wikipedia ever won a Pulitzer Prize??? I invite you to call Katie Couric and Matt Lauer at the Today Show, and asked them how they announced Horrorween to millions of people. Oh, I guess Katie Couric is not a credible news person. Tell that to CBS!!! IrishGuy, you're just flaming!!!Whoizzy</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at www.DeadBodyGuy.com also, and check out all the news articles about Horrorween on that site also!!! 5 million people visiting www.DeadBodyGuy.com can't be wrong!!! Stop flaming!!!Whoizzy</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b> You don't get to vote numerous times. Stop doing that. The one line quotes weren't from a profile of the film. They were from a profile of dead-body-guy. He mentioned that he would be in a film that no one had heard of. Don't be disingenuous. The article link is from signonsandiego.com and it, too, is about dead-body-guy with the merest mention of horroween. This article isn't about dead-body-guy. DBG is emminently notable. This film is not. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 22:36, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>BEFORE YOU CAST YOUR FINAL VOTE, NOTE THAT USER IRISHGUY HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY REMOVING PROVEN FACTS FROM RELATED ARTICLES SO AS TO FLAME THIS PERSON!</b>Whoizzy</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b> enough with the personal attacks. I haven't removed anything from this article. All I did was unbold the external links. Anyone can look through the article history to see the single edit I did and my reasons for doing so. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 16:15, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Read the history of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horrorween.html" title="Horrorween">Horrorween</a>, and review Horrorween.com, and you will see where IrsihGuy removed proven links to discredit <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Meyer_3f21.html" title="Edward Meyer">Edward Meyer</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horrorween.html" title="Horrorween">Horrorween</a></b> Whoizzy</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b> how many times must we do this? I removed exactly one line because it was unverifiable. It it <i>is</i> verifiable, you should have no problem illustrating it. Just provide a respectable source. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 15:18, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
