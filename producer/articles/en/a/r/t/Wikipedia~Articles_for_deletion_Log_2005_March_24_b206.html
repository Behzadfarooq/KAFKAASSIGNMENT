<li>"In his college career, he is most notable for his talent to avoid work and drink copious amounts of rich golden fermented beverages. He is also known for his oratory skills which are frequently compared to those of Adolf Hitler, but only in ability rather than content. He is also stylized for his unique comic (no toilet seat is safe) and zymurgistic (completely not potable) talents. Along with long time friend and creative partner, Stephen Deutsch, the two have made a name for themselves in the local film community as eccentric, eclectic, and socially critical satirists. Some of their works include "Vanquishing Foes," "Le Film de Quatres," and "What is it?: Redux." He is remarkably strong for his size and currently resides in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

<p>In some cases, Wikipedia users write articles about themselves when the more apporpriate action would be to create a user page. In these cases, the article is normally moved into the User namespace rather than deleted.</p>
<p>Could somebody move the article over to my user page? That's what I meant to do. Sorry again.</p>

<li>I'm sorry, I fail to see how the rewritten version addresses the issue of original research.

<li>I realize the article addresses published sources, it nonetheless still needs a soruce for the arguments it makes against/for the CE and JE positions.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Or encourage User:68.215.84.79 to create an account and make this material into a user page, where it would be perfectly appropriate. This is one of the <b>best</b> vanity pages I've ever seen. It's a well-written vanity page. It is a vanity page full of skilful irony and dry humor. It is a vanity page full of a deep understanding of the human condition. It is a vanity page such as Jane Austen might have written, before she became notable. If I were rating vanity pages, I'd give it a 9.5. No! make that a 9.7. This superb vanity page deserves the kindest, gentlest, and most appreciative deletion. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:26, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>The reason I asked for a speedy, since there was two pages that dealt with the same person, with the same information. After I voted, I found out there was one more. Though the content has not be deleted before, I personally believe it would have been reposted under names like this one. If you still think it is not worthy of a speedy, then I will change my vote to a simple <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 01:13, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Agreed on the amazon point and on the all music guide point, however on that point-there is a one-paragraph review of the EP-perhaps that should be the basis of a stub instead of the full-length article? Would point out two issues 1) I am a sci-fi buff and just joined Wiki and happpenstance found this discussion. I used it as an excuse to read the rules regarding deletions-one one of which states (paraphrasing) that "when in doubt-do not delete." I think at least in this (and other discussions I have seen for other pages) there is an overzealousness to get rid of information. 2) I wonder about <i>your objectivity</i> in this situation about this article based on the verbiage you use in your dismissal of the contents (see earlier comments about other users) and your <i>ad hominem</i> attack on my membership. New users have as much right to begin to join discussions as veterans. I think for this article, the article should be re-written to under a paragraph and not deleted. (See the entry for "The Seldon Plan" refrencing th Asimov concept-how I got to this page.) The number of entries I have made should play no bearing in the relevance of my viewpoint as it should not weigh in, in the relevance of yours. Finally, I tried to cite some research on this article in offering my opinion about it-none of the above users, including yourself did that in asking for deletion. --<a href="../../../g/o/f/User%7EGoferwiki_c163.html" title="User:Goferwiki">Goferwiki</a> 12:35, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hi there. Welcome to Wikipedia, Goferwiki! A couple points, which I hope you will find constructive and helpful. (1) The purpose of this VfD page is to arrive at a consensus at what is noteworthy enough to be included in an encyclopedia. Please look here - <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> - for a discussion of what doesn't belong. The general consensus in the past has always been that vanity pages are no-go. (2) Although arriving at such a consensus is not always easy, Wikipedians try not to get involved in or incite flamewars. That means we don't make accusations or conduct personal attacks against other users. (3) The only justification for having a stub in the encyclopedia is that the subject of the article belongs in the encyclopedia but nobody has written a more in-depth article yet. (4) The <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_Portal_6a3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Community Portal">Wikipedia:Community Portal</a> page has pointers on how people can put their creative energies to use for the good of our cooperative encyclopedia project. So feel free to roll up your sleeves and jump right in! Be bold in editing and improving articles. (5) The more contributions a person makes to encyclopedia articles, the more weight their opinions carry here. --<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithfarm_eede.html" title="User:Smithfarm">Smithfarm</a> 13:27, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Smithfarm, thank you for the points. I just read Please do not bite the newcomers and I want to point out that I was trying to be helpful and was a taken aback by the tone of the response. I understand clearly the vanity issue, my point is that this article should just be scaled way back as I think we might have problems proving 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that it is self-serving. I wanted to err on the side of scaling back and not-deleting versus just deleting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b> I would prefer to err on the side of inclusion. I have done some editing to make the tone more neutral. If someone is familiar with the music genres this band is listed as a fusion of, those might make some good categories. Having said that, if the article goes into that good night, I won't cry over it. They can always be resubmitted should more notoriety attach to the group. -- <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_Finney_c6cd.html" title="User:Glen Finney">Glen Finney</a> 20:15, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article has not been edited since january, and all the same issues remain. It's based entirely on original research, with such claims as the idea that anarchism isn't a political philosophy. From the very core, it is an article written to support a tiny ideological group's attempts to redefine a historical movement that rejects it, in a way that favours their inclusion.</p>
<p>As with before, this debate is covered on several pages already, and there is no need for a POV article that is so inactive as to have zero positive changes since our last VfD listing in December of 2004.</p>

The fact that the article summarizes a debate or critique does not mean it is biased, and frankly I don't see NPOV issues here. VfD submitter's own POV seems to be heavily towards left-anarchism and directly in opposition to anarcho-capitalism, and that might be a factor here. My suggestion is to send this to cleanup, for this would benefit from more encyclopedic writing style.

<dd>Clarification. What you say is true, but it's not what I said. Art journals are not newspapers. In the art world, being mentioned in a trade journal is a sign that one is on the up-and-up. Sorry I didn't clarify this.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ernie Boch has actually given quite a bit to charity, including a performance center on Cape Cod and a wing at Norwood Hospital. No way is he only known in the Norwood area, but his ads litter the Boston (and likely Providence) TV stations. Boston is quite bigger than Madison, Wisconsin. Boch is frequently close to the top Toyota dealer in the country, and his 4-year old Honda franchise was the top-selling Honda dealer in the world last month. I don't think there are many people in the Boston area who don't know who Ernie Boch is. The article may look like an advertisement, but it's not. Don't be confused, the Boch empire is quite far from Joe Schmo Isuzu. <a href="../../../2/0/9/User%7E209.6.133.76.html" title="User:209.6.133.76">User:209.6.133.76</a>.

<li>(Vote change) <b>Merge and redirect</b> to the alternative history page mentioned below. The game allegedly has 150 people interested in it enough to subscribe to a mailing list, which IMO is enough to warrant a mention in a larger article along with a redirect to that article. --<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithfarm_eede.html" title="User:Smithfarm">Smithfarm</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am the one who posted this page. This is really my first experience with posting on wikipedia, though I do intend to make future contributions as time allows. Let me share some of why I posted this. I believe the game is notable due to a combination of factors; for its longevity (continuously running for 5 years), its unusual premise in gaming (it is a game where the character is one's own personae, placed in a different environment), and as an example of a very detailed alternate history scenario. These reasons are why I felt it might be worth an encyclopedia entry. It is true that the game itself is rather small, with 152 members currently subscribing to the list. I came across the game through some google RPG seaches earlier this year. I was impressed enough with the game premise to join it myself. I further felt that the alternate history the game generated was a valuable addition to the alternate histories on the web, and was one of the ones who recently encouraged the nascent construction of the WIKISOT site to make that wealth of storytelling more accessible. So in one sense, I would have to say that I am not unbiased in this discussion; in another, my own response to the game and the alternate history it has spawned makes me think it might be worthy of note. As I said, I am relatively new to posting wikipedia entries. Further reviewing some of the information on posting, I can see where this entry might be considered marginal. I will still suggest keeping it, but would certainly be willing to hear from individuals with more experience in wiki posting on alternatives that might be considered. I'd rather not simply see the entry deleted. -- <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_Finney_c6cd.html" title="User:Glen Finney">Glen Finney</a> 21:15, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Question: is the game part of a larger framework? If so, then the article could be integrated into a larger article on that. In any case, I'd suggest updating the article to reflect how many people play the game (150 is not necessarily a small number). Then wait and see whether other people think it's notable or not. --<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithfarm_eede.html" title="User:Smithfarm">Smithfarm</a>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: I'm not certain what you mean here by a larger framework. The game was started by members of a usenet group on alternate history, but has long since diverged. It could fit under the category of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_history_%28fiction%29.html" title="Alternative history (fiction)">Alternative history (fiction)</a> since its key feature is the alternate timeline the game generates. So we could <b>Merge</b> it with that page, and have the current page redirect to that section of the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_history_%28fiction%29.html" title="Alternative history (fiction)">Alternative history (fiction)</a> page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Yes, that would work. Make a new section entitled "Games based on alternative history novels" (or similar). Then make a subsection under that with your text. --<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithfarm_eede.html" title="User:Smithfarm">Smithfarm</a>
<dl>
<dd>Okay. Does anyone know how I should procede then? Should I just go ahead and do it, or should one of the moderators do it since this page is under discussion for deletion? I really would like to at least have this as a redirect page....I'm going to need to brush up on how to do so. -- <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_Finney_c6cd.html" title="User:Glen Finney">User:Glen Finney</a></dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'm no seasoned Wikipedian, but I think if it's your page you have every right to resolve the VfD issue by merging and redirecting it. To merge, edit the source page in one window, edit the destination page in another window, and cut and paste the text from the source to the destination. To redirect, insert the text #REDIRECT [[destination page]] in the source page text window. It should be the only text in the window. This is covered in the user manuals, too.
<dl>
<dd>Reread the VfD header on the article. Editting to improve the article is allowed, but we are asked to refrain from merging, so I guess we wait for an administrator. -- <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_Finney_c6cd.html" title="User:Glen Finney">User:Glen Finney</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Do as you like. You certainly won't do wrong by waiting. I don't think the header instructions are carved in stone, though. Over on the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Neltharion_fa35.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Neltharion">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Neltharion</a> page someone just said: "Go ahead and merge". Perhaps the header instruction is intended especially for pages where there could be some controversy. I don't see any controversy here, though; do you? But, like I said, it's your page. Wait if you like. --<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithfarm_eede.html" title="User:Smithfarm">Smithfarm</a></dd>

My newness to wikipedia is in part why I am here now, and I would rather not err again so soon. I have already done a redirect from a related page that was not nominated for deletion but had the same issue. I would like to see something similar done to this page, and would do it myself, but after reviewing carefully the guidelines, it appears that redirects are deferred until after discussion has closed. Tomorrow will be five days so this should close soon. Hopefully, the administrator will see my vote tag, and if there is rough concensus here, will do just that. At the very least, if they put in a conclusion to that effect, I would then be happy to do the work myself. Again, I really do want to respect the rules and guidelines here. Thank you for your interest and advice, everyone. Also, if you were to change your votes or add your votes for "Merge and Redirect" as I have done above, I believe that would help clarify that we have rough concensus, which appears to be the case from the feedback so far. -- <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_Finney_c6cd.html" title="User:Glen Finney">Glen Finney</a> 21:50, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've removed things that were irrelevant to Solomon's science. It is <i>not</i> just a page for some kid. It's a page about a research scientist who is actively involved in astronomy research, age not withstanding, with a paper to be submitted to The Astronomical Journal by the beginning of the summer. I can point out pages on Wiki for numerous other astronomers, to which I see little difference. The page is now, I believe, purely science-oriented. I apologize for anything outside of the accepted Wiki bounds, but I believe the page is now fine.</li>

<li>To Izak: I was unaware I was supposed to make an account, sorry....all of the IP address edits are mine, I believe, this is the only computer I have access to at the moment. As for international conferences, none, sadly, just planning on submitting to the 2006 AAS meeting.</li>
<li>So you're going to submit a paper? So what. I do that regularly - it's my job to. So do most of the people at work. There are plenty of University researchers around, and the vast majority (including myself) are well below the bar needed for this list. Have you been to any international astronomy conferences? The lecturers, with a hundred publications to their name, giving the invited, plenary talks might get on the list. Students who might submit a paper definitely won't. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 12:42, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>&lt;lame humor&gt;Well before you delist it, you need to call for a Vfd for this Vfd page. Unfortunately, there's nothing in deletion policy that covers the deletion of Vfd pages. Of course, you can remedy that by just inventing your own policy. Or you can start a petition to invent such a policy... remember to put it under a subpage of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_de-adminship_8eb9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship</a>, which is our new namespace for petitions. Actually, rather than delisting this Vfd page, what you should do is move it to Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship/Votes for deletion/Requests for de-adminship/Snowspinner, because contrary to appearances this was never a Vfd at all, it was just a petition, so it belongs in the petition namespace. Or maybe now the new petition namespace is in Netoholic's user space, so we should move this page to User talk:Netoholic/Requests for de-adminship/Votes for deletion/Requests for de-adminship/Snowspinner. Maybe I'll go ahead and do that. Oops, hang on. Netoholic moved it back out of his user space just now, a minute ago.

<li>And he accuses Snowspinner of making up policy as he goes along... Surely there are better ways to propose —and implement— policy changes.

<li>An appropriate response to this vfd might be to transform it into a RfC. He already has two supporters so if they can agree on a single issue where they have evidence of unresolved grievances they can kick it off and have community discussion. If a consensus arrives that Snowspinner should not be an admin by reason of abuse of power or for some other valid reason, arbcom could be directed to investigate (their charter directs that they'll take cases when ordered to do so by the community). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:00, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Page move</b></p>
<p>I have moved the page to Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Snowspinner2 and reformatted it.</p>
<p>It is wholly inappropriate and unseemly to attempt to utilize a nonexistent mechanism that clearly lacks community support as a means of dealing with a personal dispute. The RFC mechanism is the means presently available for dealing with such matters, and so Netoholic's dispute properly belongs there. Since a major goal of the RFC process is to centralize such disputes to avoid having them scattered across the wiki, I have chosen to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> in moving it there.</p>

<dd>Any "misconceptions" are of your creation, and it's hard not to believe they're not deliberate.

<dd>I think, actually, the community <i>has</i> voted to delete it. The usual VfD term is of course 5 days, but in most cases the heavy turnout is the first day or two, and under these circumstances I really can't imagine why the overwhelming trend of comments would reverse itself. Perhaps instead of getting people wound up over whether the VfD tag is properly on the page, Netoholic could spare everyone the non-suspense by slapping a {{delete}} tag on it instead. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 04:04, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
