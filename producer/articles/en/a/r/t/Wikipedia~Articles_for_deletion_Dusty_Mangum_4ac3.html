<dd><b>Comment</b> As the article points out, he also holds the school record for most consecutive PATs (Points After Touchdown) for a storied football program such as UT, that is certainly notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> as a big football fan, I am sympathetic to the cause of any bio article on a football player. However, though Mangum was a good kicker, he has little chance of every playing in the NFL and in a few years he will just be a distant memory of another player in the Longhorns' history.--<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESophitus_c635.html" title="User:Sophitus">Sophitus</a> 10:25, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> — Set a school record at a major university. Borderline keeper, but he'll probably be the answer to a trivia question some day.&#160;:) — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 15:27, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the more notable players on a UT football team is just half a notability rung down from the NFL. You won't see me putting Kansas's "kicker" up on WP anytime soon, but Mangum is at least regionally recognized. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 16:55, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> getting into the NFL is not an agreed minimum standard.

<ul>
<li>Delete: A school record isn't very meaningful. The heroic act on the field was memorable. However, it is better to merge his matter to the Rose Bowl in question and set up a redirect there <i>until he establishes more than local notability or has a sustained career.</i> School records fall every year, while NCAA records much less often. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:53, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although I agree that Rangerdude is being disruptive, I vote <b>delete</b>. Non-notable college player. If he makes it in the pros, or is voted into the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame_85e4.html" title="College Football Hall of Fame">College Football Hall of Fame</a>, then I will reconsider. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 19:49, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I still think it's B.S. that the Rose Bowl isn't Pac10 vs. Big 10 any more... regardless, Mangum is certainly notable enough to be included in the (notpaper) encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> 03:02, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I agree his performance in the Bowl, together with the record, make him notable, at least insofar as he is a likely trivia answer. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:24, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I don't think that is kind or especially relevant -- might be considered "biting" a newbie. I've just registered, but I'm a long time peruser and occasional grammar correcter. I was this address formerly (141.211.138.85.) 500 edits. If someone can make a reasonable and sincere contribution anywhere, please don't try to ostracize them. Don't assume people are sock-puppets if they can write in complete sentences. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:29, 29 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no personal attack there, nor was one implied. I did not even say you were a sock puppet. The above is merely a statement of fact. And if you look at the procedures for votes for deletion, you will see that the votes of anons and new users can be discounted by the admin who closes the vote. This was merely applying more information for the admin. And if, as you say, you're not a newbie, then you would know that. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 05:41, May 29, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't claim it was a personal attack, but do maintain it is irrelevant in light of my provided information. I have, as a somewhat-newbie, only seen these posting-number "clarifications" attached to sock-puppets in the past. This is why I believed the notice was unkind, when attached to one who has -- finally -- bothered to register. In any event, my post served to notify the admin of my additional edits, relevant information. I have no aspirations to be a Wikipedia devotee, but I will defend my right to vote as a sincere good-faith user.<a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:59, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Then may I suggest you contribute to the actual article space? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 07:09, May 29, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you examine my former IP address provided prior to your rhetorical question, you will see that I have, and I will. I am too circumspect regarding my intellect to contribute enormous content, but I do proofread well enough. Your rhetorical question also strikes me as less than kind, incidentally, but I will restrain from bickering further. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 07:38, 29 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fascinating debate here, and one that raises a question for me. I've had a user account for about two weeks and been editing anonymously for about two months. Yet, I didn't know that "newbie" votes could be discounted. Does that still make me one of these newbies? At what point, after how many edits or how long after becoming a user do my votes count? I hope that my work on Vfd has not been in vain. I hope you can clarify this, Rick.--<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESophitus_c635.html" title="User:Sophitus">Sophitus</a> 08:03, May 29, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course it's up to the admin who actually closes the discussion, but the general rule of thumb is 50 edits. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 21:28, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
