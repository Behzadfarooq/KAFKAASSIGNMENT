<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>, but do not keep it in the current form. I compiled a summary at the bottom. Many want to have the article deleted, some want to merge part of it in <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> (but some are opposed to this out of fear that the list will grow too large again), almost all want to shorten it.

<li><b>Delete</b>/<b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a>. I love YTMND and the site, but I've been having mixed feelings about this being an article. It is way to big to maintain, and really doesn't deserve this much stuff--very few of those things have actually reached true fad level. I liked it better when there was a small list on the main YTMND article page, rather than this sprawling bohemouth of disorganized fads. It <i>is</i> true that these sites have reached a certain level of notablity (see ytmndtakesovergoogle.ytmnd.com/), but few of those mentioned are actual fads. I like the text at the top of this page, and feel it should be incorperated into the main article, as with a few of the actual big fads, and a small mention about things such as the Tiger merging fads. If YTMND wants its own wiki, it can set one up. -[[<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity">User:Mys</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity">kurity</a>|<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysekurity_22b6.html" title="User talk:Mysekurity">Mysekurity</a>]] <sup>[[<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mysekurity_f119.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mysekurity">additions</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mysekurity_b472.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mysekurity">e-mail</a>]]</sup> <sub>01:55, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</sub></li>

<li>WikiBestofYTMND sounds great to me. I just don't see how this stuff is encyclopedic. But then again, I am not super savvy on internet culture. I read somewhere about wikipedia wanting to focus on what will be important 100 yrs from now. This stuff seems like the filler that the internet is <i>already</i> overflowing with. I'm not saying that some of it isn't funny, but it seems to me that wikipedia has an opportunity to be a powerful voice in the internet community and to raise things to a higher standard. <i>Maybe</i> this could be in BJAODN. However, the sheer size of the thing and that fact many of these are funny jokes of the moment that some kid in Peoria who knows something about Flash programming put together to impress his friends suggests that they are flashes in the pan. Sorry for going on like that...<em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup> 07:18, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</em></li>

<li>To reellaborate, the internet is a vast collection of assorted tomfoolery that will not die because a bunch of soccor moms disapprove of what YTMNDs; fads offer. Schivacos' death HAS been a source of moraleless humour on sites beyond YTMND, so they are no special case. YTMNDs' "fads" are self contained within thier own community, however, their community has been gradually expanding into mainstream noteriaty, one may even suggest that YTMND ITSELF is an Internet fad, not quite outperforming other contraversial sites such as say, a Newgrounds, but it may very soon eclipse it. And indeed, some of the sicker humour involved (be it about Schiavo) is just further proof that not everyone on the internet looks at the community as one that needs moral direction. If people are trying to delete something that dares to find humour in tragedy, you wither need to live a little, take a joke, or start hunting down and delete every parody site in the past, the present, the future. Take a damn joke. I'll be saving this information to put straight back up if it IS deleted, YTMNDs' fads have a place here, and its' survived deletion before, if a merge is what is required to sustain its' lifespan, so be it, but its' not a question of "should we keep it", its' a matter of "when we keep it" RKZ <b>KEEP</b></li>

<dd>Yeah, there's no denying it's great stuff, but the question is whether or not it's encyclopedic. At the very least it needs to be cleaned up, but the inborn nature of the article means that it's prone to every shmoe who's created a site to add theirs in. Stuff like Schiavo and "What is Love", the various stapler parodies, Bannana Phone, Yakkety Sax, and the numerous others are worth noting to YTMND lovers, but the question is; are these really notable to people who don't know about the site? Are you honestly saying that people who have no idea about YTMND would want to read such a huge page? If nothing else, it needs to be condensed, and I love the idea of transwiking it to another project (Mediawiki or otherwise). -[[<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity">User:Mys</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity">kurity</a>|<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysekurity_22b6.html" title="User talk:Mysekurity">Mysekurity</a>]] <sup>[[<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mysekurity_f119.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mysekurity">additions</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mysekurity_b472.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mysekurity">e-mail</a>]]</sup> <sub>03:44, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</sub></dd>

<p><b>KEEP</b> this page, it serves as a handy, up to date reference for the many fads that we come across on the web.

<li><b>Transwiki</b>. There has been a lot of effort for this that does not justify for it to be just deleted.

<li><b>Merge</b> - This list is too lengthy for what it is trying to serve. This article should be merged with YTMND article, cleaned up, and shortened down to common music and other common fads. Other so-called "fads" have been used only a handful of times, if even that many, and are then forgotten. Why they are even put up here eludes me. I agree with much of what Mysekurity says about this. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZig973_7c35.html" title="User:Zig973">Zig</a> 02:54, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It can't be waisting space, and clearly enough people care about it that it has been expanded to its current size. Merging doesn't make sense, becaus it's too large, that is why it was created. Just keep it. And to weather any of the listed phenomenon every became fads is realy dependent on what you consider a fad. There is no reason to delete this article. - Mr.owen 11:50 10/22/10</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> it with the main article, and cut down the list of fads. It has some usefulness in giving readers an idea on what some of the fads "ytmnd" has, but it solves no purpose as a separate list of fads, other than showing what are basically general internet fads being made into ytmnd sites at the time of said "fad".

<li><b>This is what should happen:</b> The information <i>relating</i> to YTMND fads should be kept, and the article should be renamed to "YTMND fad". <i>Then</i>, the list itself is deleted. The list at first was good, but then the list went out of control. The list should die. The list requires a death sentence. The information, however, needs to be acquitted for murder charges.

<li><b>Keep/strong merge</b>. This list is useful beyond words and I would hate to see it go, but in a more serious matter I find that having an index of the fads on YTMND shows how the subculture has developed and flourished. That being said, the list should definitely be kept (clear out redundant/unproliferated fads), and while I would like most of all for it to stay as its own article I would accept a merge as well. <a href="../../../e/s/z/User%7EEszett_b7a9.html" title="User:Eszett">Eszett</a>, 16:24, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
