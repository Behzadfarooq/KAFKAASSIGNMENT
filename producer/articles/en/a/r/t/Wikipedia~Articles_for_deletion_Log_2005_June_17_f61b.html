<p>This stub was adapted from some text that I wrote, by someone not familiar with the material, so it comes off as crackpot. My original text is based on understandings gained from a year and half of reading Thomas Cleary. This is a condensation of study in this school begun around 25 years ago. The wikipedia stub Taogebra may appear offensive on first reading, but I am hoping that it may be given a chance to be edited into credible form. Keep the disclaimer up. I agree with the policy of having a reputable encyclopedia, and I also see room for the valid translation of important ideas. Taogebra is based on concepts I remained sceptical of for a very long time. But to cast it out is to skip a stage in comprehension; to let an over zealous rationalization of an uninformed translation define how we understand. In my studies I learned to accept the valid part of a statement and not be bothered by the rest. 05:12, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, it's not totally original research since Thomas Cleary writes in "The Secret of the Golden Flower",1991, about the potential for the techniques of the Complete Reality school of Tao [Ch'an, Zen]to be used for general problem solving. I tried to edit some of the bunk out of that entry; it said the edit needs to be merged, which I haven't figured out yet. -fractile *****</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>. There are six votes to delete, two of which were cast before the article was significantly modified, but which give no alternate instructions (e.g. they do not say delete <i>unless...</i>); there are three votes to keep, plus <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>'s fairly lengthy discussion noting the modification, which, in combination with his labor in expansion of the article, projects a desire that the article be kept.

<li><b>Comment</b> Although UncleG has done an admirable job of filling this article out, I still don't think it merits inclusion (and I say this as an avowed inclusionist). "Bang" really does just mean "room" or "rooms"... the only thing that is distinctive about it are its <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collocation.html" title="Collocation">collocational</a> properties. The different kinds of <i>bang</i> -- sarangbang, noraebang, PC-bang, DVD-bang &amp;c. -- are distinctive cultural phenomena that do merit their own encyclopedia articles. Each such article might reasonably mention the composition of the word from <i>bang</i>. But <i>bang</i> itself is no more distinctive than any other random Korean affix. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 05:58, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There article may have been expanded, but I'm not sure it's been improved. Now it reads like one of these VfD votes (<i>according to IMDb he's been in all these movies:... I also found out he's done this too...Who says this guy's not a real actor?</i> (OK, I exaggerate)). Wikipedia articles generally only list major roles (or else we'd have a list of a couple thousand films for actors like James Woods, and any guys who have been doing it forever). If this article is to be kept which of his roles are the "major" ones should decided upon.

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the article's talk page, if it exists; or after the end of this archived section. The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>There are several interlinked decisions in this thread. It is made more complicated by a very chaotic pagemove history. After carefully reviewing all the comments and the evidence presented (and ignoring the "vote count" because it's not helpful in this case):</p>
<ol>
<li>The article currently at Don Black (non-notable person) describes a physics student, webmaster and IEEE chapter chairman. The article does not present evidence that this person meets the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. Nor did the discussion below raise strong evidence of this person's inclusion in a general-purpose encyclopedia. I am going to call this as a "delete" decision.</li>
<li>The article currently at <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_%28nationalist%29_1204.html" title="Don Black (nationalist)">Don Black (nationalist)</a> describes a white supremacist and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Reviewing that article and doing some research of my own, I find only marginal evidence that this person meets the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> either. There are lots of racists and even lots of people holding offices in the KKK. I find it relevant that he is <i>not</i> mentioned in the KKK article itself nor is there any attempt to chronical every leader. His primary claim to fame seems to be his role as webmaster of Stormfront. If that is the case, he would be better discussed in context. (You could also make an argument that <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Red_Dog_dfac.html" title="Operation Red Dog">Operation Red Dog</a> is notable but again, that argues for discussion <i>within</i> the article, not a separate biography.) However, this article was never nominated for deletion. I am going to call this a no-decision.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_cc55.html" title="Don Black">Don Black</a> is currently a disambiguation page with four entries. Two of the four have no article today. There was some evidence presented that the pilot might deserve an article but scanning for similar articles, I find few EVPs with biographies. With all due respect to his WWII career and his charity work, these are not unique contributions to society.</li>
<li>The musician is more problematic. There was no evidence presented in this discussion that the musician meets any of the recommended criteria. My own research turns up a lyricist who once worked with Andrew Lloyd Weber. I can't personally find enough to meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines. However, there is a redlink at <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_%28musician%29_62b8.html" title="Don Black (musician)">Don Black (musician)</a> with quite a few inbound links. Deferring to the collective judgment of those other editors, I am going to consider that a requested article.</li>
<li>That leaves us with a disambiguation page with only one article linking to it and one link that might someday get an article. Of the two (or four) Don Blacks, the white supremacist seems to be the one with the most press though the musician has the most inbound links. Short disambiguation pages are strongly discouraged. Disambiguation pages should be created only when needed to disambiguate between actual articles. I am going to exercise my discretion and create a stub about the musician, cross-link the two articles and pare this page down to just those two lines. I am also going to make this an orphan (as good disambig pages should be). If/when <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> non-stub articles are created about the other Don Blacks, they can be added later.</li>
<li>I consider the term "nationalist" to be ambiguous to anyone not deeply familiar with the current US white supremacy movement. I recommend a further name change to the article (and an update of all the inbound links). "Activist" is equally ambiguous. Personally, I recommend "white supremacist" or "white nationalist" but that is not a decision for VfD. Further discussions about the final article title should be held on the appropriate Talk pages.</li>

<dd>"Don Black, a self-described racialist and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan." - <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a>. The individual uses the term to describe himself. The term "nationalist" is an obfuscation of "white nationalist". The proper term is "racist", and is the appropriate disambiguation discriminator for the topic heading.

The editor, Softcafe, did all the wrong things for perhaps a somewhat right reason. I think that "Don Black" is a sufficiently common name, and the one Black has sufficiently high notoriety, that having a disambiguation page, even with only a few instances, may help inform our readers and prevent confusion. Lastly, I notice that there may be a (barely) notable profesor (Don V. Black) with verifiable information.<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dblack/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dblack/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Maybe the article "Don Black (non-notable person)" could be moved to Don Black (physicist) and I'll see if I can dig together enough of Dr. Black's discoveries and facts to make a decent stub. I am familiar with the milieu of the more famous Don Black, though I've barely edited that article. "Racist" would be a POV description, but I believe the "Racialist" may be appropriate. It is on a par with "Nationalist", though slightly different, and is sometimes used by [racists] to describe themselves. However "activist" seems to be an NPOV term for similar subjects (e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28activist%29_8b88.html" title="Bill White (activist)">Bill White (activist)</a>) so I suggest <b>moving</b> Don Black (racialist) to Don Black (activist). -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 07:40, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>"Don Black (activist)" will require another level of disambiguation, since the "Don Black (non-notable person)" may consider himself an activist, and lead to more activity. The "Don Black (racialist)" is most appropriate, as noted above. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.200.240.250 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.200.240.250_4001.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.200.240.250">contribs</a>) 07:48, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Yes, or "Don Black (non-notable person)" may also come to consider himself a racialist. We can worry about those when they happen.

<p>Gentlemen -</p>
<p>While I am affiliated with UCI, I am not a professor.</p>
<p>However, there is another Don Black who is notable. He is the classic "Right Stuff" individual. He is a former Executive Vice President and General Manager of the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation. He was a pilot in indonesia during WW-II (flew the hump). He is still saving lives by donating his time to managing an organization that finds shelter for the homeless in Southern California. He also contributes his time to other charitable works such as ensuring open-space will exist in Southern California for our children.</p>
<p>The original generic "Don Black (non-notable)" should be allowed to stand on its own merits as representative of the other Don Blacks.</p>

<li>I truly sympathize with your plight, but I'm trying to see how we can help you. Can you write an article for the encyclopedia about that "Don Black" using verifiable resources? That's what we need. Our efforts have to uphold our principles of "neutral point of view", "no original research", and "consensus editing". Please allow the consensus to decide what name to use for the articles. "Don Black (activist)" appears to be a clear distinction from "Don Black (pilot)" and "Don Black (physicist)". At one time, we had a note at the top of "Don Black" which made clear mention of "Don Black (musician)", even though there is no article about him. We can perhaps do the same for these other Don Blacks. That would save us the disambiguation page. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 05:06, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I really have a problem with an article about Don Black (non-notable person) since it screams non-encylopedic. Or, am I missing something? If I have this right, then I see this page as a <b>Delete</b> but keeping the DAB page. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 07:14, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course there's no way we can keep have an article called "Don Black (non-notable person)" for long. Getting back to the general question, there are probably lots of Charles Mansons, et al. - people who share their name with a notorious person. But really, unless the other persons of the same name are notable there's not much that we can do. I don't see any brilliant solutions, but here's my suggestion of the night. I propose that we <b>delete</b> Don Black (non-notable person), <b>keep</b> the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_cc55.html" title="Don Black">Don Black</a> as a disambiguation page with a sentence about each of the other "Don Black"s who deserve minor acknowledgement, and <b>move</b> Don Black (racialist) to Don Black (activist). I've edited the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_cc55.html" title="Don Black">Don Black</a> dab page to cover other Don Blacks. Is this acceptable to Softcafe and others?

<li>That sounds good to me, provided that the disambiguation page retains all the significant information from the article on the physicist. If that turns out to be beyond the scope of a disambiguation page, then he warrants a separate article. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 10:57, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I am sure that we are all bright enough to realize that the real question before us is not "Don Black (non-notable person)", it is whether Wikimedia will allow "Don Black (racist)" and his supporters to use Wikipedia to promote the Ku Klux Klan, and their particular brand of hate and racism. As for POV, by linking to these websites, we are promoting them.
<ul>
<li>Hatred and racism are notable and encyclopedic, even though they're bad things. Linking to a website is not the same thing as promoting it. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 10:54, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is really nothing notable about any of the Don Black's listed, except that their names appear on the internet. My recommendation is that this "VFD" be promoted to include all the "Don Black" entries, especially the one promoting racism, since none of these people are notable. In which case I would vote that they all be DELETED, or all remain with the DAB. In the latter case, I fear that Wikipedia will become irrelevant and eventually join the ranks of National Enquirer. -Softcafe 03:32, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Don Black (non-notable person) definitely has to be renamed, since the article mentions notable things about him. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_%28nationalist%29_1204.html" title="Don Black (nationalist)">Don Black (nationalist)</a> seems to be even more notable, and I think we would all welcome an article on Don Black (pilot). Since the main issue here is the rather confusing naming situation, I'm not sure why this is being discussed on VfD. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 10:54, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I find the propensity for wikipedians to use 'vanity' to slander articles amsuing, given the amount of space they afford themselves and time they spend on their user pages.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Ludicrous vanity. Meeting someone famous people once does NOT merit an article (I doubt that even the hardcore inclusionists would argue against that). The saddest part is that even the meeting Metallica at the airport claim isn't verifiable. <i>"James Dodd" +Metallica"</i> returns just 15 Google hits, most of which are forums and none of which seem to be about the events described in the article.

<dd>I shouldn't have to do that. That's quite an extreme length to go to in order to prove the validity of an article. If there is no other material available anywhere else that validates this article then what Wikipedia would be doing by keeping the material is aggrandising an otherwise non-notable individual, which is not what this project is about. Wikipedia is about providing factual information, not about making anyone more famous than they need to be.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I did not search for this article, but found it through a link.

<li><b>Keep</b> It is not clear that "taijin kyofusho" (TKS) is a culture bound syndrome <a href="http://gateway.ut.ovid.com.libproxy2.umdnj.edu/gw1/ovidweb.cgi" class="external autonumber" title="http://gateway.ut.ovid.com.libproxy2.umdnj.edu/gw1/ovidweb.cgi" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. Nor is it clear that TKS is merely a translation of DSM-IV social anxiety disorder [SAD], although it is sometimes used as such. There is evidence to distinguish TKS from SAD and there is a scientific literature focusing specifically on TKS. For example, students scoring high on a factor associated with "offensive-type TKS" (a category previously validated <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15558882&amp;query_hl=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15558882&amp;query_hl=1" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>) scored low on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Japanese version, suggesting that they could be diagnosed as having TKS but not SAD <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15709650&amp;query_hl=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15709650&amp;query_hl=1" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. <a href="../../../m/p/u/User%7EMpulier_5afc.html" title="User:Mpulier">Myron</a> 18:38, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article appears to have started as nonsense, someone put it up for Speedy Delete then someone took it off and tried to make it respectable/a real article but as is obvious by all the tags on this that its a very convoluted article and it is not even clear what its on.

<li>I don't apply notability to computer software. This is a pretty useful piece of open source software in a field I'm very familiar with.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Zero possibility of expansion. The source code for this utility is &lt;100 lines. It's a tiny awk script that is basically the software equivalent of a substub. Software is actually an excellent place to apply notability criteria because it's usually straightforward. In general software is simply not encyclopedically notable unless it has a significant user community or it has historical significance or it employs a novel algorithm. It's a very bad sign if the only available information is from the author's site, or verbatim copies of the author's description. Notable software will almost always be reviewed or discussed on other sites. Without this you have the software equivalent of original research. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 09:01, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. First, that's simply false in general, because in many cases software can't be verified by wikipedia because of environmental requirements that are hard to meet. With commercical software verification can be hard because it may require purchase. Now, directly to the point. Who has done this verification? If no one has had any interest in verifying or saying anything about this software at all, and wikipedia alone has to do the verification, it is original research and vanity to boot. I'm challenging you to find a single site other than the software's home page that has anything interesting to say about lisp2dot.<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a></li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I don't understand what you're trying to say here, Tony. Of course, it's verifiable. The software exists. The question at hand is whether or not it is notable enough to include in an encyclopedia. I've written many useful scripts, including some that I've posted on the web. Just because they work doesn't mean they should have articles about them. --<a href="../../../x/c/a/User%7EXcali_e28f.html" title="User:Xcali">Xcali</a> 04:26, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't have anything invested in this article either way, but I just want to note that the outcome of old deletion discussions that result in "keep" can be revisited, usually by opening up a second (or third or fourth) AfD on the article, and linking to the earlier AfD(s) in the nomination. Also, remember that this VfD occurred over an year ago, when relisting may not have been so common, but the closer did keep the VfD open for 13 days, so please don't be so hard on him. Nonetheless, as per <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a>, notability can be revisited on later good faith AfDs, especially in such a marginal case.-- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">C</a></sub> 17:10, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi, kids! Aaron Rowe here. I can't vote on this because that would be a conflict of interest, but I'd like to note for discussion that I didn't make this page, nor did I ask for it to be created. It was created by fans of mine and is as such not a way for me to jerk my ego.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. Rowe is an up and coming writer of our era. Many people know of him and support him and wish to find more information on him and the only place to find it is Wikipedia. If the goal of this site is to provide information then definately keep it. Hellishdreams</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> not notable. I can find no evidence of a cult following of his work. If someone can provide evidence I could possibly change my mind. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockyhorror42_91aa.html" title="User:Rockyhorror42">Rocky</a> 15:34, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. Obscenity shouldn't really be a condition of whether or not a topic is encyclopedic (although warnings about source material are certainly fine). In addition, there are many articles on obscure topics on Wikipedia, and given that Rowe seems to be gaining popularity (I hadn't even heard of him just a couple years ago), I think it's reasonable to keep this one. ADDENDUM: Wasn't one of his web sites mentioned in Time or Newsweek or a similar major magazine? I'm dead serious here...I remember someone pointing it out to me maybe a year ago? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankg_fe2e.html" title="User:Frankg">Frankg</a> 15:00, Jun 23, 2005 (EST)

<p>Subject is supposedly a 16-year-old actor. Googling "Dylan Rosenthal" +"Cheaper by the Dozen 2" (his only really notable alleged work) receives 0 hits.

"Dylan Rosenthal" + actor on Google gives three hits, two of which are from a local paper. He seems to be a young actor who may potentially become Wikipedia-worthy, but, as his career stands currently, he is not yet notable enough. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 20:23, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Since Cheaper by the Dozen 2 won't be released until next year we can't really say he's been in the movie. It's still being filmed. IMDb doesn't list him and my attitude towards IMDb is that an entry there doesn't necessarily mean you're notable enough for WP, but no entry there disqualifies you here (that is, if you're a film actor). This doesn't even say what role he allegedly plays, I wouldn't be surprised if he's an extra.

<li>The problem is that in comparison of web browser are fare more browsers than which Secunia monitor. So either there will be some browsers (table rows) without security column or will be better to keep it on special page. --Ptomes 06:08, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>So I think this type of comparison should stay on Wikipedia, becouse they are interesting and important for many users. They also have relation with topic such as web browsers, security or critism of Microsoft for security of products. They are based on facts and reports from renowned and highly regarded security firm - <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secunia.html" title="Secunia">Secunia</a> and can bee anytime monitored and easily updated.</p>
<p>But I respect your opinion and I wait for result. I won't have been too disappointed and stick around though. --Ptomes 06:04, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC), creator of this comparison</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_operating_systems_%28security%29.html" title="Comparison of operating systems (security)">Comparison of operating systems (security)</a> is another one of your creations, and on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7EComparison_of_operating_systems_%28security%29_6a1b.html" title="Talk:Comparison of operating systems (security)">Talk:Comparison of operating systems (security)</a> editors have suggested exactly the same merger (to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_operating_systems.html" title="Comparison of operating systems">Comparison of operating systems</a> as simply another section) as here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:06, 2005 Jun 18 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Mergify</b> - per UncleG. Great effort and work, Ptomes - the Wiki spirit lives within. However, I disagree with your reasoning for not merging. If Secunia does not list these other browsers, that is not reason to disinclude them from listing them. Surely there are other sources that could be used - BugTraq, perhaps? --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 06:55, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do you think bugtraq.ru? I don't understand this language.&#160;:( I would like to cooperation with somebody on that. I try include Securityfocus but the problem is that this source doesn't update status of vulnerabilities (for example - fixed). I have not been found another useful source yet. I welcome any suggestions. But this is not problem. The problem is, what Wikipedians and Wikipedia users want. Do you want one another column in browser comparison page with information about vulnerabilities or do you want well aranged browser comparison of security, where anybody can see big diferences between browsers? I think exactly that is purpose of this table, but I said I will respect result of this discuss. --Ptomes 07:14, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The choice is not the dichotomy that you paint it as being. This table, minus the three columns duplicate columns, can be simply merged into <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_web_browsers.html" title="Comparison of web browsers">Comparison of web browsers</a> as another section.

<li>I think in browser comparison are many obscure, non-modern, non-used and prehistoric browsers - pointlessly&#160;:( Now in this comparison is everything hardly finded.

<li><b>Keep</b> and move to Toxicity (single) or some such name since its about the Single-release and not the song itself.

<li>As songs are generally more notable than singles, I would say that the article should be made more about the song and moved to the "(song)" title, with information on the single included (this seems to be how most songs are handled). Otherwise I can imagine someone writing a separate <a href="../../../t/o/x/Toxicity_%28song%29.html" title="Toxicity (song)">Toxicity (song)</a> article, arguing that it's different from Toxicity (single) because one is about the song and the other about the single.

<li><b>Delete</b>, neologism, but mostly because I'm a language stickler. Heterophobia combines the prefix hetero- (other, different) with the suffix -phobia (fear, dislike). Thus, heterophobia <i>should</i> mean "fear of things that are different", or something similar. Heterosexophobia (or something similar) would be a more appropriate term. Sadly, homophobia (which <i>should</i> mean fear of things that are the same or uniform) has taken on the meaning that should be covered by homosexophobia and is wide-spread enough that we must be forced to adopt the new meaning. Heterophobia, however, is not a wide-spread word and I don't see the need for an article promoting the misuse of the word until general use has forced us to. Maybe that's a good reason to delete, maybe it's not. I don't know, but that's the way I feel. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak">Pagrashtak</a> 15:27, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

So I made a list instead where I could put up the fair use argument covering all the stats. Then the individual chracter articles could be linked to the list with no problems. If my "fair use" argument is erroneous, then the stats should be deleted. But otherwise, I don't really see why someone interested in Darth Vader might not also be interested in his character stats. -- <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthEren_2ad2.html" title="User:DarthEren">DarthEren</a> 22:33, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I recall, Pokemon <i>is</i> a roleplaying game, while Star Wars is a series of movies, which makes RPG stats considerably more on-topic for Pokemon than it does for SW characters. In fact, I would guess that the vast majority of people interested in Darth Vader either cannot interpret d20 stats or don't care about them. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 23:21, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
