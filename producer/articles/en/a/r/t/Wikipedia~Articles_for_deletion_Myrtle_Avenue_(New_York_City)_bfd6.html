<p><s><b>Delete</b>. I prodded this as a "minor street". Deprodder wisely reminded me that it's not minor.

<li><b>Srong Keep</b> - Nominator lacks perspective on the topic. Myrtle Avenue is by no means a minor street, obvious by the fact that it spans many neighborhoods in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens.html" title="Queens">Queens</a> (CrazyRussian so nonchalantly calls "outer boroughs"). If we erase this article then we set up an even more dangerous precedent: one that concerns itself only with the surface phenomenon (that the article isn't developed yet) and blindly fails to see the potential down the road. In other words, just because the article is a stub now, doesn't prove that a New Jersey resident can fairly say "nothing is going on" there. This should've been discussed before nominating here, after I de-PRODed. Thanks. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 19:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That the article isn't developed yet is not what brought this nomination. It's that the <i>street</i> is not developed yet. And no Jersey discrimination please - Brooklyn is the ancestral home of the crazy Russians, you know that...! - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 19:12, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not hating on Jersey, I got family there too.

Myrtle Ave has been changing a lot, increasingly becoming a main street of commerce as a result of the college students who go to <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pratt_Institute_0db6.html" title="Pratt Institute">Pratt Institute</a>, and the recent real estate boom and popularity of living in Brooklyn. <a href="http://www.myrtleavenue.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.myrtleavenue.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 19:23, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The basis for keeping is based upon connecting two other notable subjects? I realize that's a factor in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but it really doesn't apply in this case. If this was true, someone whom taught a notable person in grade school could merit an article. Also, another basis for keeping is based on the potentional for notability. This is so <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">a crystal ballism</a>, Wikipedia takes record of notability that has occured, not notability that will not or has yet to occur. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="blue">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">sox</font></a> 22:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The current version of the article focuses too heavily on Brooklyn. Myrtle is particularly important in <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridgewood%2C_Queens_16b3.html" title="Ridgewood, Queens">Ridgewood, Queens</a>; one of two main commercial shopping districts in Ridgewood (other is Fresh Pond Road). Traffic jams are present in the daytime, and traffic drops off dramatically after businesses close. The Q55 bus that runs along the street can be standing-room only during rush hours to and from its terminus at <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrtle-Wyckoff_Avenues_%28BMT_Canarsie_Line%29_32af.html" title="Myrtle-Wyckoff Avenues (BMT Canarsie Line)">Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues station</a>, and that station is one of the busier <a href="../../../l/_/%28/L_%28New_York_City_Subway_service%29_081d.html" title="L (New York City Subway service)">L</a> line stations in Brooklyn. How do I know? I live in <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushwick%2C_Brooklyn_72c0.html" title="Bushwick, Brooklyn">Bushwick</a>/Ridgewood on the Brooklyn side, not too far from Myrtle. I am also familiar with the road through Queens and Brooklyn. It's the main thoroughfare in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_Queens_febb.html" title="Glendale, Queens">Glendale, Queens</a> - see that article. It runs through <a href="../../../m/e/t/MetroTech_Center_cfc1.html" title="MetroTech Center">MetroTech Center</a>. Historically, the street's notable: the Jamaica Plank Road (as it was known) existed before the communities were built. As for expanding the article, I can't think of anything else other than what I said above. I will try to improve on the article, but only after further discussion.</li>
<li>Crzrussian (and others), if I may ask, what are your <i>minimum</i> requirements for a "major avenue"? And what does the Wikipedia community say about what is a "major street" (other than state routes, county routes, etc.)? <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 12:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I cannot speak for others, but I think numbered state routes are always OK, but individual streets require a showing of notability. Generally, only the most famous streets in the biggest cities get included. Thus, Manhattan has 100, and Brooklyn has 10. I think that's about right. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 13:30, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you Tinlinkin for adding another perspective. I instinctually started with information on the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill side of Mytrle, because that is what I am most familiar with. Your information about the Queens side, I think demonstrates that Myrtle is longer and more influential in communities than most other mundane streets in Brooklyn. It should be kept in Wikipedia; Please feel free to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> and expand the article. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 13:44, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Myrtle Avenue may not be much today, but it does follow the path of the Myrtle Avenue and Jamaica Plank Road (also called the Brooklyn and Jamaica Plank Road, or just the Jamaica Plank Road) which was created in 1853/1854. There is information available on this historic road, and if this article had more on its history it would be greatly improved. Is it a great article as is? No. Will it be a Featured article one day? I doubt it. Does it deserve to be deleted? NO. We need to develop clearer criteria for inclusion of roads that goes beyond can anyone sing a few bars of "I Left My Heart On Myrtle Avenue." <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 14:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Major street in a major city, although we obviously need articles on most streets given their histories and the fact that things go on there. The only dangerous precedent is the wanton use of a prod tag and AfD. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:30, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - If the largest roads in certain cities are allowed to exist, then Myrtle Avenue certainly deserves to stay. It is a very prominent avenue crossing and influencing many neighborhoods including my own, Ridgewood. It is one of the most significant places to us I know from experience. Sorry if this is more anecdotal than anything, but we refer to it as "The Avenue", like we refer to New York City as "the city". It also has a very rich and detailed histroy, that unfortunately has not been elaborated on this page.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. <a href="../../../a/n/5/User%7EAn56_328d.html" title="User:An56">An56</a> 04:44, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
