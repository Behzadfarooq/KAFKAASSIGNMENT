<p>Sent via: Via Electronic Delivery Re: Demand to Cease and Desist and Retract Libel</p>
<p>December 19, 2005</p>
<p><br />
Dear Wikimedia Foundation Inc:</p>
<p>This agency represents Nico Demonte and we have been asked to write this letter to you. Many of your statements about Nico Demonte in your web and e-mail postings are untrue and defamatory. You made them maliciously to injure Nico Demonte in his trade, office and profession. As such, they are defamatory per se. Under O.C.G.A. 51-5-11, this letter constitutes a demand for immediate retraction in writing of these false and libelous statements. In accordance with O.C.G.A 51-5-11(b)(1)(C), Nico Demonte demands that your retraction and correction be accompanied by an editorial in which you specifically repudiated your libelous statements.</p>
<p>As you neither asked for nor received permission to use his biography, as the basis for Nico Demonte’s trade, office, or profession, nor to make or distribute copies, including electronic copies, of same, I believe you have willfully infringed upon Nico Demonte's rights under 17 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. and could be liable for statutory damages as high as $150,000 as set forth in Section 504(c)(2) therein.</p>
<p>Your web postings and conduct also constitute tortuous interference with the business and contractual relations of Nico Demonte. As such, they are actionable and expose you to the imposition of compensatory as well as punitive damages.</p>
<p>Below, we have noted some of the more patent, malicious, and libelous comments made by you, Wikipedia’s members, editors, and your representatives in your e-mails; some of them also evidence your tortuous interference. If Nico Demonte is forced to file suit to stop your wrongful conduct, he will also seek an award of his attorney fees and litigation expenses.</p>
<p><br />
1. In your postings, – you and/or your editors have stated that Nico Demonte is a Non-notable artist. This is patently false.</p>
<p>2. In your postings, you consistently and falsely stated Nico Demonte "added a lot of his stuff there." Your comments about this are false and malicious.</p>
<p>3. On the subject of Nico Demonte's biography you stated that "I thought that, the way it looks like it could even be copyright violation." Your malicious attempt to interfere with Nico Demonte's business and contractual relations with Astley PR has damaged Nico Demonte for which you are liable in damages.</p>
<p>4. You incorrectly stated and inferred that Nico Demonte's is responsible for so-called "Vandalism" on Wikipedia's website. This is patently false.</p>
<p>5. In one of your postings, you referenced an article on Nico Demonte and claim with no basis in fact that it is similar to Nico Demonte’s biography on Discomusic.com. Your comments about this are false and malicious.</p>
<p>6. In a web posting you stated: "For Nico Demonte, however, he added a lot of his stuff there, without Wiki formatting or anything, just like we saw already. I thought that, the way it looks like it could even be copyright violation, and well, looks like it really is. That text comes straight from this page, and as you can see in the bottom, the content is indeed copyrighted. Now unless he is Bernard F. Lopez himself, it is a violation." Your contact with Nico Demonte constitutes tortuous interference in Nico Demonte relations and contract with Astley PR. There is no basis in fact for your malicious comments. This is patently false.</p>
<p>Many of these errors have been previously brought to your attention. Your failure to correct your erroneous and false statements and their reputation after notice of their falsehood constitutes further publication of libel. It also confirms your malicious intent to maliciously injure Nico Demonte in his trade, office and profession..</p>
<p>I demand that you immediately cease the use and distribution of all infringing information derived from the Nico Demonte’s biography, and all copies, including electronic copies, of same, that you deliver to me, if applicable, all unused, undistributed copies of same, or destroy such copies immediately and that you desist from this or any other infringement of Nico Demonte’s copyrighted works, information, images, reputation, and recordings. If you do not immediately publish the requested retraction, and cease and desist from tortuous interference and making false and malicious comments about Nico Demonte, his copyrighted works, biography, recordings, likenesses, and reputation, we will file suit against you. Please govern yourself accordingly. If I have not received an affirmative response from you by January 1, 2006, indicating that you have fully complied with these requirements, we shall take further action against you.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Anna Astley</p>
<p><br /></p>

<li>Libel. These Wikipedians below are creating a potential Libel against Nico Demonte. First, wikipedia has identified this entity using identifiable voices, likenesses, or descriptions of or concerning a person or a company. Wikipedia's comments by its users present the following potential libel case against the artist: 1) It would reflect badly on the character of the person or entity and 2) It could harm the reputation, diminish the esteem, respect or good will in which the person or entity's relevant community holds him, her or it. Insinuations made by Wikipedia's workers, drones, editors, and Users, might reflect badly on character and/or harm reputation of Nico Demonte based on insinuations (see below), insinuations, and statements that imply that there are unstated defamatory facts underlying such statements. Warning: Republication of a libel creates another libel and labeling such artist within said framework, including but not limited to "Vandalism" constitutes further libel.
