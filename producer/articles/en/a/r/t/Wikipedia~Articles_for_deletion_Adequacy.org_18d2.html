<li><b>Keep</b>. Adequacy's infamous "Computer Hacker" article was featured on the TechTV program "The Screen Savers", and in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the "serious" satire piece "Why The Bombings Mean We Must Support My Politics" was actually syndicated by AlterNet. This should be more than enough to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but the problem is that given the amount of time that has passed, it is difficult to document these references (I found AlterNet's copy of the Adequacy article <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/11623/" class="external text" title="http://www.alternet.org/story/11623/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and will add it to the article page later, but "The Screen Savers" has been off the air for some time). Though this page could use some work, deleting it seems ridiculous to me, particularly when there are articles like the one for <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segfault_%28website%29.html" title="Segfault (website)">Segfault (website)</a> that contain no more claims of notability and yet are (apparently) perfectly acceptable. 152.61.42.109 16:31, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Who said that page was acceptable? You do know that people can create pages whenever they want, don't you? That's kind of the point of this site. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 16:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that the Segfault page has been around for two and a half years and that it has (apparently) never been nominated for deletion is a pretty good indicator that it is acceptable. For the record, I'm not suggesting that the article be deleted -- as somebody who fondly remembers Segfault, I would consider deleting its article to be as ludicrous as deleting Adequacy's.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 152.61.42.109 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.61.42.109_79bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.61.42.109">contribs</a>).</small></li>

There's plenty more that I intend to add, particularly in reference to notability, though with the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday it may be a few days before I can really get to it. At any rate, I hope that any decisions regarding deletion in the short term are made with this in mind. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventypercent_9424.html" title="User:Seventypercent">Seventypercent</a> 21:49, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Most of the sources you cite are either blog posts or message board threads of some sort. Several of them don't even mention Adequacy.org. The 8 sentence thing on TechTV is the only thing I'd really qualify as any sort of source, though a single "Site of the Day" mention isn't that impressive (imo at least). <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 19:32, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Not all of the sources I added were intended to establish Adequacy's notability. I listed some of them to document the background information that I was providing (i.e., Eric S. Raymond's post-9/11 comments and the reaction to them, the specifics of the Koleen Brooks story, etc.) Were I reviewing this article, I would certainly expect this information to be documented, so I documented it. I can appreciate your opinion that the Screen Savers appearance was unimpressive, but one of the goals of having subjective guidelines such as <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is (hopefully) to remove individual opinion from the process. A segment on an internationally-broadcast television program may not be impressive, but it is also not trivial. You did not comment on the AlterNet syndication; while I suspect that you would also find this unimpressive, the fact remains that Adequacy was paid a monetary fee for the rights to an article by a syndication service that receives millions of visitors per month. (Incidentally, this could arguably fit either the first or the third criteria for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the third being "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.") The bottom line here is that I believe the concerns cited in the deletion notice for this article were entirely legitimate; as such, I spent many hours poring through Google (and G4TV.com's excruciatingly slow Web site) and augmenting the content, and based on my reading of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, I believe that the concerns have been adequately (if you'll pardon the pun) addressed. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventypercent_9424.html" title="User:Seventypercent">Seventypercent</a> 05:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would appreciate a comment on (or at the very least an acknowledgment of) that justification; if the fate of this article hinges on a judgement call as to whether TechTV/G4TV and AlterNet are "well-known", then I would hope that the admins would want to err on the side of inclusion, particularly when this article (with the new material) documents itself better than the majority of other articles in similar categories. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventypercent_9424.html" title="User:Seventypercent">Seventypercent</a> 16:56, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
