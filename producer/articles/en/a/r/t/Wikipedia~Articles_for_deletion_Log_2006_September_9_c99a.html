<dd><b>Comment</b> While not titled properly, this is article is essentially a list. It is lacking reference and looking at the article the items that are normally the first line in each section <i>("This logo was first used in ....")</i> is what's most pressing for a ref. The rest is just a description of what the logo looks like that correlates with the photo to the side. From <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> it clearly says <i>"An edit counts as original research if it proposes ideas or arguments."</i>. The description of the logos proposes nothing and you can't even stretch that to be synthesis. Overall the OR argument is weak. I think the much stronger arguement is context and the fact that an entire article on the logos is not needed. As the majority of editors here on this AfD agree, there is some merit in maintain information on one of the world's most iconic logos and it's therefore better off to be merged. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 17:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I disagree with the accusations that the article "Wolftime" as well as the article "Silhouettes" fail WP:CORP. I view them rather as descriptions of the endeavors of entrepreneurial teenage filmmakers, including the mentioned Kevin Walker. I also view it as irrelevant the the official website is hosted by GeoCities, since the company still has a domain name registered on the WHOIS database. Thus, I do not believe the mentioned articles should be subject to deletion. Keep in mind that Wolftime is an independent company, and likely doesn't make a profit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kevinw91 (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinw91_e3d1.html" title="User talk:Kevinw91">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kevinw91_b94f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kevinw91">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>I would like to mention that Wolftime has made three films, has won two awards in esteemed film festivals with three nominations. The score for their latest film was written by a professional film composer who has made collaborations with such names as Bill Clinton, Sophia Loren, and Antonio Banderas (see beintus.com). Wolftime Films is a legitimate company, and the article is in no way intended to be a sales pitch or a marketing ploy, since the organization does not make a profit. I view it as inadvertent prejudice that the company is marked as illegitimate based on the appearance and Google rankings of their site.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kevinw91 (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinw91_e3d1.html" title="User talk:Kevinw91">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kevinw91_b94f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kevinw91">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is not just your company. There are thousands of aspiring filmmakers trying to gain some exposure by listing their short films here. Films which may have been screened at a festival or two, but have hardly been reviewed anywhere, written up anywhere, noticed anywhere. Most have received more notice than your films, which seem to have received none at all. Wikipedia does not exist to promote unknown people or enterprises, but to document those which have already become notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>By the way, the claim by Kinu that the article violates WP:VANITY is ad hominim, a court term proving that "an argument is an attack again against the person."

<p>Yes, my name is Kevin Walker (I apologize if it seemed that I was trying to hide that). Nice to meet you. Allow me to again reiterate that this is not an unknown company, nor an unknown film. They have received a great deal of attention by hundreds of people. Perhaps I can get you to see the latest one, "Silhouettes?" Kevinw91</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. You've spent enough time trying to do that in the article itself. By the way, someone saying the company or film fails <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> isn't an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack. S/he's not calling you vain, s/he's referring to a policy (that s/he didn't write) which happens to bear that name. What's the argumentative ethics term for being really disingenuous again? - <a href="../../../w/_/g/User%7EW_guice_dd47.html" title="User:W guice">W guice</a> 02:19, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact is that s/he cited a Wikipedia requirement against vanity. Thus, s/he is citing the article I wrote as vain. Kevinw91</p>
<p>I would like to draw attention to one of my previous comments supporting Wolftime as a legitimate company enjoyed by the public and, just like the other filmmakers you mentioned, has been featured in "one or more film festivals": Wolftime has made three films, has won two awards in esteemed film festivals with three nominations. The score for their latest film was written by a professional film composer who has made collaborations with such names as Bill Clinton, Sophia Loren, and Antonio Banderas (see beintus.com). Kevinw91</p>
<p>Let me mention as well that the article was not trying to market "Silhouettes." W guice, "You've spent enough time trying to do that in the article itself." That is certainly an ad hominim, sarcastic attack. Kevinw91</p>
<p>I am arguing for the inclusion of the articles because it is my life ambition. You are arguing for their deletion because you feel contempt against my company. Can you please expain why. Kevinw91</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Even if we were to set notability totally aside (which we won't), the #1 ironclad rule here is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable Sources</a>. That one's non-negotiable. We have here an article written by you, about your company, and the only source is a website created by you.

<p>I assure you the world will be the same place if you let this go. I urge you to spend time on more important matters (matters I would be attending to if it weren't for this debate). Keep in mind that any profit that Wolftime makes goes to charity. By the way: <a href="http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/" class="external free" title="http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/" rel="nofollow">http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/</a> search the page for "Teen Planet." I'll look for more verifiable links. Kevinw91</p>
<p>That picture is of me and my co-director receiving an award in front of hundreds of people in a UC Berkeley auditorium for the screening of "Teen Planet," a Wolftime film. Though it's not a great picture of me (lol). Kevinw91</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry, was that last comment a violation of WP:VANITY? Kevinw91</p>
<p>Here is a link for you to view "Silhouettes." I hope you enjoy it. I apologize for taking two and a half hours of your time, but I just want you to take this company seriously. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wolftimefilms/media/films/silhouettes/silhouettes_medium.mov" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/wolftimefilms/media/films/silhouettes/silhouettes_medium.mov" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/wolftimefilms/media/films/silhouettes/silhouettes_medium.mov</a> Kevinw91</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Taking you seriously is not the issue. Wikipedia does not exist to promote unknown ventures. Period. The result of this AfD was never in doubt from the moment it was posted.

<p>You can't be serious! I have given you a link to verify the company. I have even offered a compromise. Can we please close this discussion, I have a lot to do regarding this film. It has an estimated site circulation of 220 people in the next three days surrounding the film's premiere. Kevinw91</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the purpose of Wikipedia is to have lots of articles detailing practically everything in the world. This includes independent production companies, and in my case, a legitimate, verified company. Would you please give me your phone number if you wish to debate this in person. Kevinw91</p>
<ul>
<li>You're mistaken. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, and the link to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">our standard for companies</a> has been repeatedly posted here.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Nothing further (such as a link to a encyclopedia policy or notability guideline) can be suggested that has not already been mentioned at least once herein. Whether you choose to take those suggestions or simply ignore them is up to you. I am recusing myself from the remainder of this discussion.

<p>How am I to verify that the films have been mentioned in print? What I am dealing with is bureaucracy. Unfortunately, I have lost a great deal of respect for the Wikipedia system because of this. Again, if you truly care so much about removing an insignificant article about Wolftime Films, please give me your number so we can talk in person, otherwise we will be here all night. Kevinw91</p>
<ul>
<li>No we won't. I have other things to do tonight, and I'll repeat: continuing this discussion will make no difference. We have policies. You don't like them. That's it. Best of luck. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a></li>

<li><b>Different Tack</b> Have you been in a newspaper or magazine article, or is your film on imdb, or something that would imply that anyone other than you knows anything about this? You don't know if you have or not? Whenever I'm in the paper, my Mom cuts out the article and sends it to me, and so do 15 other people. Lots of times, the publisher will let you know if you have a mention. If you don't know whether you've been covered, than you probably haven't. Did these festivals have materials or webpages or anything like that? The problem isn't that you're writing about yourself; the problem is that only you have been writing about yourself. If you do, then you'll probably be fine. If not, then your company probably isn't ready to be included yet. rather than talking about <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or the badly named <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVanity_6666.html" title="WP:Vanity">WP:Vanity</a> policy, we probably should be talking about the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifyability</a> argument. How can people find the more complete resources to back up this article? If they wanted to learn more about you, where would they go, other then to your own web page? <a href="../../../g/u/m/User%7EGumbyProf_552c.html" title="User:GumbyProf">GumbyProf: "I'm about ideas, but I'm not always about good ideas."</a> 05:06, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally a user that has productive comments. I know what you mean about the "being in the paper" thing. I received lots of cut-outs when my films have been mentioned in print. Go to <a href="http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/" class="external free" title="http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/" rel="nofollow">http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/</a> search the page for "teen planet." The image is of my co-director and I accepting an award in front of a large audience for the screening of a Wolftime film. Visit this site: <a href="http://dicff.org/pages/12/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://dicff.org/pages/12/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dicff.org/pages/12/index.htm</a> and click the schedule link. Search the page for "the kid who talked too much" and you will find information about the screening. The PDF on the page links to a schedule that inludes the two screenings of "The Kid Who Talked too Much." The film is pending on the IMDb. The other proof I have is on paper, and therefore I cannot convey it online.</p>

<p>I object to the last comment. No, just kidding. But I honestly don't see why so many people care about getting rid of something that doesn't affect them personally. I know this sounds a little "live and let live" but can't you guys just let it go? I'll fight it all the way through to its deletion. Nonetheless, I'm sure minds will change once more information has been certified on IMDb proving that this company is far more than Kinu and others realize. Just give it a chance, and yeah, live and let live. There are far more important things going on that we should all make an issue about. If anything, this debate is just driving a lot of traffic to wolftime.com, which wasn't the intention in the first place, despite above claims. This is trivial. You are not saving the world or making it a better place by opting to delete an article that myself and many others truly care about. Consider that. I'm leaving the discussion. Kevinw91</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I did not intend to enter the conversation again, but when a comment comes up that is blatantly ad hominim and inappropriate, I have no choice but to defend myself and my ambition. The comment left by My Alt Account was clearly wrong. If every user has the mentality of this individual, it is very apparent that they do not understand my defense of the article in the first place. The comment has prompted me to change my beliefs to again argue for the inclusion of the Wolftime article. I hope that the final administrator who reads this discussion views it on a deeper level and understands that my efforts are not a folly. The discussion moved from an argument against the inclusion of an article to attacks against my company and myself. I didn't want to cause any more trouble, but the last comment was far from constructive, and has unfortunately prompted me to change my position. By the way, "Teen Planet," "The Kid Who Talked too Much," and "Silhouettes" were not school projects. Again, <i>I apologize for taking your time</i>. Kevinw91 22:54, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral</b> Yes, it is CB. Yes, the article is beyond awful. However, there is significant buzz for this: "clive barker" "scarlet gospels" gets 2790 (342) ghits. Astonishing for a book that is merely being anticipated. This is because of speculation that it will involve the death of the very notable <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinhead_%28Hellraiser%29_3a07.html" title="Pinhead (Hellraiser)">Pinhead (Hellraiser)</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'll go one step further than BozoTheScary. This is a known and verifiable project, even if it isn't published yet, from a famous author. It's not CBism in that Barker is known to be working on it, ergo it exists in some form.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom despite BozoTheScary and Bondegezou. Wikipedia is not a hype rag, and just because the fact that he's writing it can be verified doesn't mean that anything else about it is verifiable. Once it's done and is notable in its own right, then it can be re-written, preferably citing sources when it is. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 07:22, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but rewrite</b> - This was a genuinely notable issue (totally separate from Y2K, by the way) but I don't know anything about the "9999" being used as a "stop command"--that sounds pretty platform-specific. However, I do remember some concern because a lot of programs used "9/9/99" as a sort of default "future" date. As it stands the article is pretty vague (stating that "all computers would fail") and informal ("<i>Our</i> power didn't go out"? Talk about original research). Side note: The reason why "nothing happened" when the date came is because, (just as with Y2K), a lot programmers spent a lot of time fixing everything so that it <i>wouldn't</i> happen. Just wanted to throw that out there. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 15:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You mean the archaeology exhibition/museum which is described by <i>its creators</i> in the NYTimes article as:"<i>New York Unearthed</i> will be a modest enterprise, its creators say, not a reason itself to make a trip to lower Manhattan but a worthwhile addition to a Battery-South Street itinerary." If the official blurb is that visiting the museum is not worth me taking a subway trip from Upper Manhattan to Lower Manhattan, it's probably not a notable exhibition. As for the Chase Center - why, that's the tallest building in all of Arizona, woohoo.

And it currently has <a href="http://www.southstseaport.org/places/nyunearthed.shtm" class="external text" title="http://www.southstseaport.org/places/nyunearthed.shtm" rel="nofollow">about 2 million items</a> in its collection, which isn't too shabby. In any case, it's something distinct about the building that can be used to expand the article. And why should the building be penalized because Manhattan is so densley packed with skyscrapers? Would you really consider this building more notable if it had been in a smaller city? <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 19:20, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, I was mainly addressing Wknight's comment, "I brought this to AFD mainly because there was so little info in the article." But with regards to your argument -- <i>are</i> there any established notability criteria for skyscrapers? I would think that all buildings that exceed a certain height threshhold are inherently notable. The World Almanac traditionally lists every building in the US over 500 ft tall, and I don't see the harm of giving each of those structures a Wikipedia article.</li>

<p><i>In the 1970s, some very interesting mid-size office buildings were erected by the William Kaufman Organization on the east side of Lower Manhattan - 77 Water Street and 127 John Street, and a bit later, the beautiful curved, reflective glass tower at 17 State Street, but these paled in comparison with the scale of the silvery twin towers of the World Trade Center, the strong vertical piers of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, and the ungainliness of the huge tower at 60 Wall Street for the Morgan bank.</i></p>

<p><b>Delete.</b> Bioconservatism is not a coherent position or philosophy. Almost no one has identified him- or herself as a bioconservative. Rather than serving to characterize people who agree with a given viewpoint, the article provides a catch-all term for people whose only similarity is skepticism about implementing one or another technology. Its use has invariably been by a very few writers who contrast their favored position with "bioconservatism."--<a href="../../../s/t/n/User%7EStN_acd1.html" title="User:StN">StN</a> 05:05, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We could debate for hours about whether or not bioconservatism is a coherent position or a vague catch-all term (a debate which could be summarized and added to the article if it survives!). However, the fact that almost no one identifies himself as a bioconservative or that the term has invariably been used by writers who contrast their favored position with bioconservatism is NOT reason enough to delete this article. Otherwise, according to this logic, since almost no one describes himself as a reactionary, we should delete the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">Reactionary</a> article. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELoremaster_a9d3.html" title="User:Loremaster">Loremaster</a> 19:53, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see your point about the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">Reactionary</a> article. But there the fact that no one describes himself as a reactionary is reflected in the statement up front that it is "a political epithet, generally used as a pejorative."--<a href="../../../s/t/n/User%7EStN_acd1.html" title="User:StN">StN</a> 20:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, and I have no problem with the Bioconservatism article having a similar statement as long as it acknowledges that the political epithet "bioconservative" is meant to be used as a non-pejorative alternative to "<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioluddite.html" title="Bioluddite">bioluddite</a>". --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELoremaster_a9d3.html" title="User:Loremaster">Loremaster</a> 22:21, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That "bioconservatism" is not a coherent position is, of course, not a major reason for it being inappropriate for inclusion in an encyclopedia. The primary reason is that it is not in widespread use—possibly because of a lack of coherency. If, in a couple years, the term catches on, it may then be able to justify its own article. <b>I am most concerned about the misuse of Wikipedia as the primary authoritative source for a definition of "bioconservatism".</b> The top two Google hits, and four of the top seven, are Wikipedia and its clones.

<li>I can assure you that "AN Other" (usually written, in the common British English way, with no punctuation or spaces between the initials) is a very common "placeholder" for sporting squads - eg "Squad additions (3): JN Smith, WT Taylor and AN Other". That sort of thing. I don't know how old the usage is, but it's certainly no neologism: I've seen it in newspapers since the 1980s at least, and it might be decades older than that.

I don't know how many more localities fit those two criteria but it seems to me that just merging it into the Wagga Wagga article might not do it justice. - <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimboid13_a48f.html" title="User:Gimboid13">Gimboid13</a> 07:01, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I grew up in Wagga living there for 18 years. The 5 o'clock wave is very well known local folklore. For many years there was a surf shop (i.e. it sold board shorts and tank tops, not surfboards!) in the main street call The 5 O'Clock Wave in reference to this local folklore. The text of this entry is entirely accurate in its description. Possibily this myth has been forgotten in more recent years, I havn't lived in Wagga for 8 years or so, in which case documenting a disappearing oral tradition becomes more important!

<p>As for the images being <i>copyright</i>ed, well, getting permission to use them is nice but since May 2005 we have been trying to avoid using "copyrighted, permission for use" images because the permission can only extend to Wikipedia, not later users such as our scrape sites (answers.com, reference.com and the like), and we want all pictures on Wikipedia to be as freely reproducible as the text of articles. My suggestion would be to take your own pictures if possible, and then upload and license them as {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}}<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>. Where is a copyrite violation? I consider this group notable in the fact that they are one of only a few which goes around to festivals teaching about the history of swordfighting and with credits to them for being professionals at what they do not only at festivals around the country and the globe but also for the contrabutions to films and plays around the country. That is what makes them "Notable".

Just because they do not sing you choose to delete them. Half of the people on the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance_Fair_c810.html#Notable_entertainers" title="Renaissance Fair">Renaissance Fair#Notable entertainers</a> list I have never heard of... That makes them Non-Notable to me. I am the one who authored this artical... because I thought they were intresting enough because of the fact that they DO exactly what the first Ren Fest was created to do and that is EDUCATE! As for the Copyright... I obtained all the photographs and information from Randal Scott who I have FULL permission from to do so... so there is no violation of the copyright when the owner of the copyrite gave me the stuff to use. Do as you will but I if they are to be deleted then so must the entire list of "Notable" preformers on the "Renaissance Fair" page. If that is gonna happen then deletion of all of the fairs listed there should be deleted as they are all advertising their fairs. ph0t0bug 13:20, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok.. Since everyone seems to want to kill this page lets first look at the word that was used the most: Notable</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Defined by the American Heritage Dict.:</b><br />
no·ta·ble (nt-bl) Pronunciation Key adj. Worthy of note or notice; remarkable: notable beauty; sled dogs that are notable for their stamina. Characterized by excellence or distinction; eminent: formed a commission of notable citizens. See Synonyms at noted. n. A person of distinction or great reputation. See Synonyms at celebrity. often Notable One of a council of prominent persons in pre-Revolutionary France called into assembly to deliberate at times of emergency.<br />
<b>End of Definition</b><br /></p>
<p>The people to whom this page refers to fulfill all the requirements for the first definition by right of what they do. They educate the public and are known by millions of people who have seen their "shows" and lectures. So to say that they are Non-Notable is just being un-educated in the use of the word. Because someone does not know who someone is does not mean that that person is not notable to others. Thus we must look at what Wiki defines notable as.... which at this point I cant seem to find an artical on... so.. I digress. They also have shown "Excellence" &amp; "Distinction" in their field so this proves them VERY Notable indeed. If there are changes that need to be made please suggest them and I will be more than happy to comply with those changes but don't just assume that because someone posted an artical about a person or group means that "THAT" person or group posted it just to "advertise". The Artical was never ment as an advertisement. --Ph0t0bug</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a>, While that is a page on Wiki that starts to define what the guidelines are you did NOT read the whole artical. CLEARLY stated at the top of the artical next to the "?" it states the following:</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
This page is a <b>proposed</b> Wikipedia policy, guideline, or process. The proposal may still be in development, under discussion, or in the process of gathering consensus for adoption. <b>References or links to this page should not describe it as "policy".</b><br />
<br />
Once adopted as policy that would be Wiki's guidline but until then it is just perposed and can not be considered as law.<br />
I must say that I DO apreciate <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuyanakoolaid_5548.html" title="User:Guyanakoolaid">Guyanakoolaid</a> is saying and I will do the research. I wish more people responding to this would be as objective. --Ph0t0bug</p>

<dd>There are very few hard policies on Wikipedia, %90 (or more) of the "rules" are actually just "guidelines". The reason is, it's very difficult to make a hard policy that works in every case - so we have pages like this where consensus is built around the guidelines - in the end its all about consensus, because even the guidelines can (and do) change all the time with consensus. My recommendation would be to learn more about how to write Wikipedia articles so they satisfy peoples sense of notability - look at other similar articles and re-write yours to be similar. Tone down the pictures so it doesn't look like a promotional site (one or two small pictures). Tone down the amount of text so it doesn't read like a home web page. Make it encyclopedic - information that will last 100 years, as if written by an academic scholar and historian. Also don't make it look like it was written by The Duelists, that is also grounds for deletion (self promotion is considered spam on Wikipedia). -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 14:08, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Understood... but there in lies the problem. Concensis. I can find thousands of people on WP who have never heard of these men and maybe even a few who are aginst the group as a whole... but... I could, and will state right now that I havent and will not, find a thousand to get on here and post "Keep". I have seen pages done by some of the people who are in this list that I have NO idea who they are... but I am not going to go to those pages and set them up for deletion. All in all it seems like a bad way of deciding what stays and what goes. It seems that some would just look at the new pages that are being added and not going out and activly finding the ones that already exist that look like advertising. I know a few of the groups that are listed on the Ren Fair artical and while I personally think that all of them should stay I also think that if this page is to go I will begin to do the same to bring any other "Advertising" page to the same demise. I have been to several of the other pages for "Notable" groups and NONE of them are up for deletion. I ask then WHY is my artical up for it. Lets be fair about it. Lets put them ALL up for deletion... of course refering to the "Notable" group on the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance_Fair_c810.html" title="Renaissance Fair">Renaissance Fair</a>. In fact I think that any person who would gain profits by even having a page on Wiki should be deleted. But if we did this ALL movies would have to go, Director &amp; Actor Bios would have to go, Any living Artist would have to go. All Bands will have to go as well... See, anyone looking up something on Wikipedia may come across a link to something that points to those persons website.... which could be considered advertising and furthermore on that website could have a store, shop, t-shirts... and this is all from clicking on an external link on an Artical on Wiki. I say lets not do something half way... if your going to do it... go all the way.... but wait... that defets the reason to have a world supported encyclopedia --Ph0t0bug</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> if and only if the article actually gets some meat added to it - right now it looks like an ad. Info on just what WMA traditions they use, what their shows have to offer besides the generic descriptions, significant performances etc. would do much to improve it. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgative_rlt_09a4.html" title="User:Ergative rlt">Ergative rlt</a> 22:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>And if you could, what might really help your case would be some media coverage, with specific citations (online would make it easy to verify, but find what you can) of the non-trivial variety (i.e., not just a passing mention), a general principle in many of our issue-specific notability guidelines. Show us that people are urged to go to Renaissance fairs to see these guys. Show us something about their movie and TV work. Show us news stories that are primarily about them, and put them in the article as references.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Only one non-list mainspace article links to it; its usefulness in terms of promoting context is limited, at best. The article focuses mostly on what it is <i>not</i>, rather than what it is, which appears to be a function of the fact that we don't have enough reliable sources to write about it with strict verifiability. The fact that it is unaccredited can be <i>very</i> easily handled with a simple mention in whatever articles it is mentioned in.

<li><b>Comment</b> And when we have enough material that meets our policy for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for such institutions, and when we've written up stubs that meet Wikipedia policies for all of them, perhaps we can revisit this article; in general, articles are not protected against recreation when the deletion is not related to a living person or a constant troll-magnet. In the meantime, this article is a perpetual stub that focuses on what the subject is not, rather than what it is. I, for one, think it would not be wonderful to have an encyclopedia wherein most articles consist of saying "This person is not an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">elephant</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godzilla.html" title="Godzilla">Godzilla</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmylou_Harris_5639.html" title="Emmylou Harris">Emmylou Harris</a>, or <a href="../../../m/8/0/M80.html" title="M80">M80</a>", because we don't have enough material to write with strict verifiability about what it <i>is</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 21:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete for now</b> The article should probably exist, but it's so vague and empty (and full of negatives, Cap'n) that it's not actually useful. Maybe the best course would be to delete for now, and come back with a better article. Maybe a little [WP:Vanity] would be OK, since they themselves might know what they actually do and stand for. Some of those seminaries have articles (like <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Reformed_Seminary_25b0.html" title="Geneva Reformed Seminary">Geneva_Reformed_Seminary</a>, but they don't mention it.

<li><b>Delete</b> There is one good reason for keeping these sham institutions: since Wikipedia has such a high google ranking, anyone looking for information can see the WP page and learnt that it is, indeed, an unaccredited diploma mill since it's page will appear as # 2 or 3 probably. They can then further find out what a <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">Diploma mill</a> is by following the links and, if truly ambitious, discover the entire shady world of such "institutions." That said, Wikipedia is not here to provide <i>caveat emptor</i> services and this place should be expunged.

<p><b>To All Concerned</b> I've read the article(s) relating to WikiSpam. I can see how my contributions/inclusions have been <b>misinterpreted</b>. I was following help suggestions from Wikipedia that created this dialogue. Items shown in red indicate a term or article not yet present within Wikipedia. That prompted me to be more thorough and supply cross reference material that it appeared that Wikipedia needed. I find it ironic that assertions of SPAM or AD campaigns were created in part, by Wikipedia's "help" suggestions. I'm unsure what could be more credible/notable than a physical copy of the industry specific newspaper which anyone may freely obtain in a US mailbox or online.Dude Walker 18:09, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This link is not a proper Britannica article, it's a "sidebar". I have no idea where it would appear in a print version of the Britannica, under W for Why? The title sets a very bad precedent for wikipedia. The topic itself is dubious; the title is atrocious. Are we to entertain an article for every hypothetical what-if out there? This merits a paragraph in the Auschwitz or Holocaust articles, or rolling it into a more encyclopedic topic like <b>Allied Response to the Holocaust</b>. If we have this article, why not "Why Dachau Wasn't Bombed" etc. etc. etc. - "Why snoopy isn't drawn like Mickey Mouse" or how about "Why the sky is blue". No article should start with "why". <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourdee_e40c.html" title="User:Fourdee">Fourdee</a> 01:56, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know where you get the idea it's a "what if" article. It doesn't ask "what would have happened if Auschwitz <i>had</i> been bombed?". It's an article that will summarize the literature on why the Auschwitz <i>wasn't</i> bombed, and it wasn't, so there's nothing hypothetical about it. It's a big topic in Holocaust history, and therefore encyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why is Auschwitz significant and not the other camps? Shouldn't the topic of this be why no camps were bombed? This topic appearing in a *sidebar* of the Britannica does not lend credibility to it appearing as a main article here. We don't have the equivalent of a sidebar or sub-article, but I am positive this would never appear as a main article in the Britannica - again it would fall under W alphabetically which is ludicrous. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourdee_e40c.html" title="User:Fourdee">Fourdee</a> 03:34, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We're here to reflect reliable published sources, and historians discuss why Auschwitz wasn't bombed for a number of reasons: (1) the Allies were asked to bomb it or the railway lines leading to it; (2) the numbers being killed there were known about — in May–July 1944, when the bombing discussions were at a height, 12,000 Jews a day were being taken to Auschwitz from Hungary alone; (3) the railway lines would have been easy to bomb, according to some historians; (4) there were a number of Allied sorties in that immediate area during that period. I don't know what you mean by a "sidebar." It's a full article in the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Berenbaum_56f5.html" title="Michael Berenbaum">Michael Berenbaum</a>. How can you be "positive it would never appear as a main article," when in fact it does? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Check the Britannica link again. It is clearly described as a "sidebar". If you've ever seen a print version of the EB, it is listed in alphabetical order. I don't believe you will find anything listed under "Why". In a similar vein, "Why did Germany Start World War II", "Why did Hitler invade Russia", "Why did the US delay entering the War" - these are a "big topics" - bigger topics than why Auschwitz wasn't bombed, yet they are included in appropriately titled articles. Why does Auschwitz get an article about why it wasn't bombed and not Dachau? I repeat, no article should start with "why" and no article should include a contraction like "wasn't" - articles titles should reflect a succinct topic, not a sentence.<a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourdee_e40c.html" title="User:Fourdee">Fourdee</a> 03:48, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not sure of the point of this; if you have a complaint about Britannica, you'll need to write to them. Their article is part of a series of articles called "Reflections on the Holocaust." It's listed under Auschwitz, question of bombing; and in the Reflections series, it's in part III, one of the articles in the Allied response to the Holocaust section. But as I said, I'm unclear about the difference that makes.

<li>I had read through several discussions about this topic on soc.history.what-if and the question has been researched in deep there, including technical details on logistics, decision processes of militaries and statistics. These discussions are huge, last for weeks and (mostly) based on qualified sources. Current article would be torn apart very quickly. If kept the article should be renamed to remove the question, to include the whole machinery of concentration camps and their infrastructure (to bomb railways has been considered and rejected) and "expert attention needed" label put on it. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 11:22, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The above argument could be used on practically any topic covered on Wikipedia. For example, if people want a list of products made by a company, they should contact that company.

There is no reason a list of undergraduate degrees at Rockhurst University cannot be featured on this website, as similar lists are for other universities.

<li><b>Delete</b> for reasons listed above. However, I will also say (and yes this probably sounds sexist) but the notion of men fathering alot of children is not really notable or of encyclopedic merit. (And BTW, where's <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawn_Kemp_e24f.html" title="Shawn Kemp">Shawn Kemp</a>?) They can father children with many women and not miss a beat. Now for a <i>woman</i> to be on this list (especially the ones that had over 5), that is a bit more impressive since the physical demand of having a child and carrying for 9 months is more of an ordeal.

<p>To whom it may concern: I was the one who submitted this and it is a fact that Ron Strumpf is genius. I was a customer of his when running the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gaming_Center_BBS_f661.html" title="The Gaming Center BBS">The Gaming Center BBS</a>. I apologize for the vain remark, but I can not say enough about his skills in regards to latency. He did things over a dialup network in regards to multiplayer gaming, that is only (recently) now being matched.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, SirDoom can be verified by checking with anyone who used the SirDoom software back in the late 90's. This would be any Worldgroup BBS that supported multiplayer doom. It would not be correct to delete this as it is very relative and pertainent to the online gaming community, more specifically, multiplayer Doom, Heretic, Dukenukem and other such innovative first person shooter games. I will try to find more content. Please do not delete. Here is a link I found on the internet to the original Client used by gamers to connect to a BBS and play.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by TCdoom (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TCdoom_40d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/TCdoom">contribs</a>).</small><small>TCdoom is also the creator of the article in question.</small></p>

<p>SirDoom not "non-notable"? I am not going to say anything other than I disagree quite strongly and I think deletion would be a disservice to the many gamers who served as a catalyst for online gaming as it is today, more specifically, first person shooters like Doom and Dukenukem. Deletion is not the appropriate response for this post and should be further reviewed.

<li><b>Delete</b> Misleading list. Most of these "stereotypes" are either cliches that can be found in any narrative media (I think the ideas of the lone hero / damsel in distress / villain seeking world domination / nameless soldiers / treacherous supporting character / dual identity / lack of discussion about characters' "bodily functions" &amp; body odour (how often did <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odysseus.html" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> bathe?) etc. are quite a bit older (centuries or millennia) than the invention of the video game) or they are actually deficiences in artificial intelligence or limited programming resources (I don't think programmers would generally prefer to have mindless enemies/"ADD-afflicted" enemies/repetitive NPCs in their latest game if they had the choice). Strip these out and you're left with a few cliches regarding game design features, not character stereotypes (end of level bosses, stamina bars, hidden characters) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:05, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, so now it's not "spammy" it's a "Non-notable Charity" .First of all, it is not listed in the article as a "charity" and it is not a "charity" it's a "not-for-profit" which is substantially different. Secondly it is a unique organization, the only kind of its type in the field of magic, and if you can find another one, show it to me. Third, it has a membership of over 500. Isn't that enough to make it "significant"? Okay, I expanded it. Is that enough for it to merit inclusion in Wikipedia.

Please sign your comments by adding ~~~~ at the end, and please do not separate the signatures of others from their comments. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 00:59, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There's no original research on this article whatsoever. If you think there is, please tell me where it is and I'll delete it. Does this mean that you can't have a wikipedia article UNLESS there are published articles about an organization? There is NOTHING unverified in the article. What is unverified? Is it better if the entry is much shorter? The only "self published" sources are the mystery academy website and Eric Henning's website! I'll try to make the article more consice and smaller. Didn't mean to seperate signatures or anything. Am new to wikipedia.</li>

<dd>Your criteria is subjective and difficult to fulfil. What kind of articles do you need and how many? Local papers? City Papers? National Distribution? What is it specifically that you want to establish notability? "I don't think it's notable" doesn't provide me with any useful information on how to bring it into compliance.</dd>

<dd>The criteria are <b>not</b> subjective. We have given you links to the specific policies and guidelines. Here they are again: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>; <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>; <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Please read these as they all give speicifc, objective criteria. I've looked through the references you added to the article. First, thanks for doing so. The problem is they don't help with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. The Baltimore Sun and City Paper articles only establish the notability of the "Kids in College" program, not the "Mystery Academy", because that's all they mention. The City Paper "article" is only a local listing, not an editorial article. The Baltimore Sun article would be a good <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> if it actually mentioned your academy, sadly it doesn't. One brief mention of the program your academy is part of doesn't count.</dd>
<dd>The rest of the references you've gave either simply establish that the Mystery Academy exists (which isn't in dispute) or are pages from people directly involved in the program, such as Eric Henning's page. You need to find an article like the Baltimore Sun one but about the Mystery Academy itself, which describes why it is important.</dd>
<dd>Finally to deal with the original research aspect. Here are some really probelmatic quotes from the article: "Mystery Academy is a unique project in human history..."; "Mystery Academy involves a rigorus (and sometimes contraversial method) involves teaching tricks which are the highest possible caliber"; "Mystery Academy is also unique in that it is the only Magic organization in the world to award rank (achievement levels based on skill)". None of these have sources, they are all unverifiable. They are all the opinion of the writer of the article, not independent, sourced assessments of others. These are clear original research by the writer. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 13:09, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gwernol: Edited the article to take out the statements you objected to, plus similar statements. The pages I gave establish enrollment and curriculum, not Merely Mystery Academy's existence. (Which was actually in dispute when this article began). Sorry that you think this process is objective, because it isn't. Otherwise we wouldn't be discussing it, there'd simply be a bot that established whether the article was acceptable or not. Even the requirements that you have cited are highly subjective, from a philosophical standpoint. They do not give "specific" or "objective" criteria but mainly interpretable guidelines. I ask again, for the third time: is the only way to establish notability a published article about an organization? If so, what kind of a publication is required, what does it's syndication numbers have to be, and how many articles are required? If your notability requirements are "objective" then this should be an easy question to answer. As of yet, no one has answered it. -Magicbymccauley</p>

<li>Sorry, but if that is the case your source is no good. It is an article about a college and it simply does not mention the Mystery Academy. As to 'ALL' your other sources - why are you assuming I have not checked them? FYI I have and I find that there is nothing in any of them to suggest that the Academy is of note. (And your own web page is hardly a reliable source to suggest such is it?) I can only say that if or when the Academy is truly noteworthy - a thing verified by independent and reliable sources (which actually mention the academy) - then the article will stand on it's own merits. Until then, it is still Delete. Sorry. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 18:29, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is no original research in the article anymore. Nothing in the article is there that can't be found in one of the sources. If so, then tell me what is original reasearch. And how is it not from reliable sources. Do you mean to say that accounts from publications put out by the U.S. government are unreliable? Because if that's what you mean, then I disagree with you. As far as notability goes, people still refuse to tell me what constitutes it, if it is so "objective". Seems like wiki people are more used to raising objections rather than defending their own arguments. -magicbymccauley</p>
<p>Marcus: The article about the college mentions (through half of it), the "Kids in College" program. Mystery Academy was part of the "Kids in College" program, as was backed up by the other sources that I cited. You say: "I have and I find that there is nothing in any of them to suggest that the Academy is of note." This clearly violates the NPOV. There couldn't be a more opinionated statement you could have written. You then say: "I can only say that if or when the Academy is truly noteworthy - a thing verified by independent and reliable sources (which actually mention the academy) - then the article will stand on it's own merits." Mystery Academy doesn't need to be written up in a Nationwide newspaper for it to be noteworthy. Check the series of articles on porn stars on wikipedia. None of them are mentioned as "noteworthy" by any independent newspaper or publication. Yet they aren't on the slate for deletion. If a porn star that's starred in two movies that no one's ever seen is noteworthy enough to be on Wikipedia, then Mystery Academy is. If you want to vote to delete it, go ahead. I certainly can't stop you. I've eliminated all POV, and OR issues from the article, but that's just not good enough, so you resort to the most subjective criteria in wikidom, the NN opinion. Whatever. If you don't want the article then fine. It'll all be gone and no one will be the wiser. Luckily though, we'll all be able to see the credentials of every porn actress that's ever been in a movie, which really makes me feel better about the whole thing. -magicbymccauley</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please feel free to nominate, as an AfD, any article on Wikipedia which you feel does not meet the criteria for inclusion. Good luck with the academy. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 10:32, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The point is that those articles don't get nominated, marcus, but mine does. Why is that? Could it be that notability is a completely subjective concept? If those articles have 0 references and there are no publications which mention them, doesn't that mean that standards are being selectively applied? Once again, if those articles are "notable" then Mystery Academy meets that standard of notability. If they aren't up to that standard why have they been up for years but no one nominates them for deletion? You can't claim that my article needs to meet the standard of publication while other articles don't. That's my point. -magicbymccauley</p>

<dd>Wikipedia has (at this second) 1,382,051 articles. Thousands of them require deletion by Wikipedia standards and may go months, even years, before someone notices. I know it seems unfair that this one got caught when others haven't, but life isn't fair. Pointing to other flawed articles in defense of another flawed article is no defense. (I still do it myself sometimes even though I know better.) <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:43, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But are these articles truly "bad" articles, or are they accepted by wikipedia? Are you claiming that all articles that exist without published sources are "bad" articles? That's quite a claim! Are you saying then that ALL wikipedia articles require a citation with a published source with a national distribution to establish "notability"? So NOTHING can be on wikipedia that hasn't been in a published source? I find that hard to believe. Searching through the notability pages, it seems there is quite a lot of disagreement about what notability is. There are certainly people who will argue that every single porn star is notable, while others disagree. I submit that if these articles ARE notable, then so is Mystery Academy. Wikipedia doesn't seem to have an official policy on notability at all. Assuming then that the article is free from Vanity, has a NPOV, is verifiable, and contains no original research, then we are finally left with the issue of notability, which is a completely subjective issue. I asked repeatedly (four times now), and have yet to be answered: what kind of article in what kind of publication establishes notability. I expect that no one has answered this question because they don't have an answer. If the only issue we have yet to face with this article is its notability, then it seems I am answering to subjective claims, rather than objective ones. -magicbymccauley</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think a lot of people attribute too much credibility to news coverage. If you look at the articles and the sources on his webpage, the only mainstream source giving substantial coverage (i.e. not just a brief description and quote) is the Boston Globe. But looking at the Boston Globe's "Meeting the Minds" series (which that article belongs to) shows that it is part of that paper's local/regional news science coverage (which includes similar profiles of students)<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=+site:www.boston.com+boston+globe+%22meeting+the+minds%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=+site:www.boston.com+boston+globe+%22meeting+the+minds%22" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> At the moment, and based solely on the French blog, although I think one need not doubt the authenticity of the Abbé Adam, it is certainly questionable as to whether or not this chap is sufficiently notable to warrant an article.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The Abbé is a genuine historical persona but he looks to have become mixed up with fiction. References are few. Not sufficiently notable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 21:02, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article derives from Lewis Spence's <i>Encyclopedia of the Occult</i>, one of the standard reference works on the subject. I have added the reference. Not appearing on Google is not a criterion for deletion. As to being fictional or not, the article says "according to legend". In the Middle Ages, and particularly relating to religious "events", fact and fiction could easily become confused, and this story was apparently well-known at the time. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 22:48, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Spence is just quoting the much earlier French sources which I added to the article. (but he's probably more accessible to an English-speaking readership than they are). The article is really about a legend which is one of very many similar ones, rather than about the genuine historical person about whom we have virtually no other information. There's an argument for a <b>merge</b> into some sort of Medieval Legends article but I don't know of any suitable one offhand. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'd request that someone give some context and explain this mix of fact and fiction in the article. I am still confused about what this article is really about. This and a total lack of sources at the time are what led me to AFD in the first place. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 01:56, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Sorry to be obtuse, but I'm unsure what you're confused about. The first paragraph says he <i>lived</i>. The second paragraph begins <i>according to legend</i>. Where's the confusion? He was a really person who became well-known due to a story about him. This was not at all uncommon, particularly in the Middle Ages, and I would have thought it was fairly obvious that a story about driving off the Devil was not hard and fast fact! -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:19, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>This has no rigorous criteria, lacks references and gives no indication of the type and severity of self-harm.

<li><b>Keep</b> Criteria: it is outlined in the parent article, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a>. References: aren't the films, plays, books, etc. themselves references?; Severity and type of self-harm: that can be added yourself if you want, but some characters practice several kinds of self-harm simultaneously, which bloats the list. If you think it's ill-defined, then fix the parent article (<a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a>) instead. Dobby and Spike are there because they fit the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-loathing.html" title="Self-loathing">self-loathing</a> part of the self-harm article (which deals with medical definitions of self-harm). So if they don't fit the definition, I don't know who does. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="blue">Buchanan-Hermit</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="red" size="1">?!</font></a> 16:31, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

There seems to be consensus that being fictional is not a reason to delete (much of Wikipedia covers fictional subjects). I don't know what you mean by "mish-mash". <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">Self-harm</a> is in most cases well-defined, at least as much as sexuality. There are borderline cases, but similarly we could quibble about male characters who once kissed a guy, and ask if that makes them gay? Such borderline cases do not detract from characters which clearly are portrayed as gay, or self-harmers. I'm also not sure why a non-human character means the concept of self-harm can't apply? The list could certainly do with references/explanations, similar to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_self-harmers.html" title="List of self-harmers">List of self-harmers</a> - we should make an effort to add these, rather than simply deleting (I note that many of those under <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian%2C_or_bisexual_figures_in_fiction_and_myth.html" title="List of gay, lesbian, or bisexual figures in fiction and myth">List of gay, lesbian, or bisexual figures in fiction and myth</a> are also guilty of this). By the way, I would actively argue <i>against</i> trying to classify by people "type and severity of self-harm" - <i>that's</i> where things would start to become very ill-defined. How do you define severity? Should we list how "gay" people are in those other artices? <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 17:53, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> This is utterly useless and needlessly controversial. The fact that the self-harmaers are fictional makes me want to forget about them as soon as the TV broadcast is over. This is nothing but "self-harmer" boosterism. Sorry, screw your affliction. Go listen to [Nine Inch Nails] and [My Chemical Romance] until you feel like living again, or go ahead and kill yourself. Really we'd be better off without these fucking flakes. They take valuable time from interns and residents who have to sew up their stupid wounds. I myself am sick to death of stitching shut these dumbassses' abdominal cuts. Self-harm is a subject.

<dd>Regarding the "Hey Nostradamus!" addition: Not all characters are named, even the main ones. For example, I <b>think</b> the main character from "Fight Club" was never named directly, and was referred to as "The Narrator"? Besides, the entire Nostradamus book had 3 chapters in total, making the chapters quite long; I don't think there's a better way to explain who the character is without naming him like that. And also, why wouldn't Dobby be named twice? He's in both the book and the film; we can't just simply list one of them, for example, because that'd be regarding the film or the novel superior to the other. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="blue">Buchanan-Hermit</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="red" size="1">?!</font></a> 08:22, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> How it is POV? I do somewhat agree that the biggest problem with this is knowing whether the motivations would be what is usually considered <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a> (there is a similar issue with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_self-harmers.html" title="List of self-harmers">List of self-harmers</a>, but there we can go by what the person themselves have said); having said that, this is also an issue with many of the others in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_fictional_characters_by_medical_condition_dd6c.html" title="Category:Lists of fictional characters by medical condition">Category:Lists of fictional characters by medical condition</a> and elsewhere (e.g., List of fictional characters with phobias). Also it could be said that there's less reason to worry about borderline cases on a fictional list - the problem with labelling someone as bi/gay/a self-harmer when they don't consider themselves that is that it's bad for that person, and potentially libellous, but obviously this doesn't apply to fictional characters!</li>
<li>By the way, I would be happy to trim down the list to get rid of any borderline cases; there are still plenty of cases where there has been a clear intent to portray a self-harmer (the book Drawing Blood, or the film Secretary).</li>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I saw that you did not like my post&#160;:) This is a real nice company with lots of cool pda and smartphone cases. It is one of the elading companies in the PDA case market and is appreciated by many users. A simple Google search for "sena cases" returns about 261,000 results in my computer which I believe is a sufficient indicator of the size and penetration of teh company. Here are a few further pointers for you if you want to see more:</p>

<p>The WP:Corp says the following: <b>"The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself."</b> Furthermore, it says <i><b>any</b></i> of the rules and I strongly believe that it satisfies this criteria if not the others. I believe about.com, pc magazine and gizmodo among many others are sufficiently independent and well established publishers.</p>
<p>There are many more articles from many different publishers in addition to lots of interviews with the founders. I will leave the Google work to you.</p>
<p>By the way, I am not affiliated with the company in any way. I am just a PDA Geek who thinks Sena Rocks!&#160;:)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, it looks like a nice PDA case and your posts were fine. I merged the info about the cases themselves into the article on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_digital_assistant.html" title="Personal digital assistant">Personal digital assistant</a>. What we're discussing here is the importance of the <i>company</i> which makes them. The above reviews are of the cases rather than the company. If there are Web articles about the company itself I've missed them - post them here or on my talk page and I'll take a look. PS I have followed the links from the article itself - one of my motivations for nominating the article was that as of 2003 it looked like there was a handful of people in an online store and that manufacturing was probably outsourced. So any company statistics would be very relevant. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 18:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm always about expanding , perhaps there is something unbelieveable about this company that we don't know, at least let the page develop it needs some work so i vote, <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> if it doesn't expand.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Dlyson,</p>
<p>I have not really had much time to check if there is any media coverage about the company. However, I think you can not expect each company to get as much media coverage as Google or IBM. This is not a billion dollar worth multinational giant. This is probably a small/miod size private company which is not required to publish any data about itself until it goes public. I really don't think that they are just an online store operated by a couple of people. You can hardly find any small online store that has quarter million Google entries and that has real good reviews from well extablished publishers. As far as I could see, Amazon.com sells its products from its own inventory, Palm.com sells them, Dell.com sells them, I am sure many others sell them. All in all, I think it is a farily large and established company that is worth at least a brief mentioning in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Also the fact that most coverage is about the products does not mean that the company is bad or worthless. Those products are what the company makes and in a sense the products <i><b>are</b></i> the company.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I have used their cases for my Palm T3 and Treo 650. I am not sure how big the company is but one thing for sure is that they have their own unique designs for these cases.

<li><b>My Alt Account:</b> Being fairly new to Wikipedia, I'm unsure what etiguitte you speak of, please advise. <b>JulesH:</b> The term is widely used within the industry within association meetings, at conferences and within chat forums. You make a valid point and observation. There is a limited supply of credible information that relates to the Mobile Disc Jockey industry. Mostly individual websites that promote services, not the industry itself. <b>AbsolutDan</b> to address my earlier "comment". I was responding to this specific discussion. My original comment disappeared when I pressed "save page". It was, as if, someone had deleted my response immediately. With respects to neologisms, by wiki standards, you are correct. There is very little in writing currently. Perhaps in time the term may be reintroduced.<br />
<b>To All Concerned</b> I've read the article(s) relating to WikiSpam. I can see how my contributions/inclusions have been <b>misinterpreted</b>. I was following help suggestions from Wikipedia that created this dialogue. Items shown in red indicate a term or article not yet present within Wikipedia. That prompted me to be more thorough and supply cross reference material that it appeared that Wikipedia needed. Two things I find ironic: 1) I find it ironic that assertions of SPAM or AD campaigns were created in part, by Wikipedia's "help" suggestions. 2) I find it ironic that an article currently within Wikipedia created confusion about me.

(I'm not in the least interested in football. I'm basing this only on the content of the article as presented.)

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. There are claims made below that the site is notable because it will be featured by a show on ABC, etc. The article even purports to have links which show this. Thus it would seem that the site qualifies under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>; if these links delivered as promised, this would be a "keep". However, when one follows these links, they do not back up the claims. For example, there is a link to abc.net.au which looks promising. But if one follows that link, one finds no mention of Gamestah. Moreover, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=0zk&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=site%3Aabc.net.au+gamestah&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=0zk&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=site%3Aabc.net.au+gamestah&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">there is no page on the ABC site which mentions Gamestah</a>, yet <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=F0k&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=site%3Aabc.net.au+%22good+game%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=F0k&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=site%3Aabc.net.au+%22good+game%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">several hundred which mention this upcoming show "Good Game"</a>. It strikes me as unlikely than no page on this show mentions its debut topic. Long story short, although there is a veneer of notability, the links do not show what they claim to, and there is yet to be a single link in the article or in this debate which mentions Gamestah (aside, of course, from the links to the site itself). This veneer of notability is quite thin, it seems. --- <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 03:26, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It sounds like you're a source short to me, but if you already had been covered on TV, that would be multiple independent coverage assuming the two bits were about different things. The question would then be whether the coverage was trivial. Somehing along the lines of saying that the website exists would be trivial.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have edited the Gamestah entry, and believe it is now notable. While the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria state multiple sources, it does mention it is a rough outline. Coverage on a mainstream national television network is about as notable as you can get for an organisation of this type! Add to that one of Australia's best-selling PC gaming print-media magazines and I think that should satisfy the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> crteria. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong though, as I've never looked into the WikiPedia project before - just browsed articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> - true, it could do with a cleanup, but this article provides an insight into the rich background story of the game, something which every other fictional franchise on Wikipedia is entitled to. The background story of RuneScape is often manipulated by its gods, hence the title. Maybe rename it to 'History of RuneScape', or similar?

In the fullness of time this article could perhaps be merged into the main article or be made stronger and resist crufty additions, but to throw it away now is to punish contributors for not having eight pairs of hands. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 02:55, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This brings up a really good point, which is that RS has no plot.

<dd>RS doesn't have a plot in the typical sense, but the gods are often the only link between quests and various aspects of the game. Yes, it's fancrufty, of course it's fancrufty - attention has been elsewhere. In the past month the focus of the RS series has been wrenched back on course by a combined effort, many articles have been removed or merged. As part of that process, the mini-games article has had a drastic revamp, some of the remaining articles are still in the process of being merged and rewritten. Once combat, weapons/armour and mini-games are taken care of, the RS gods article would be a good follow-up. To remove it now before that process has even begun is to ignore completely what has been achieved recently and what will continue to be achieved. The statement of intent is there, if flinging another article on the fire is more important than adding a clean-up notice and allowing contributors a chance, then there's nothing pleasant that can be said. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 03:19, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - After reading the article (specifically the Show Involvement section) and the previous AfD, I'm convinced that this is deserving of an article. Looking strictly at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (which is only a guideline, not absolute law) would indicate that we should delete this, but if all else fails, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a> and do what's best. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 22:45, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Per Daniel Olsen. There are a number of little things working in this article's favor, none of which would be good enough on their own, but the sum total makes me conclude that bypassing the letter of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines would be advisable in this case. In internet forum terms this site is ancient (2001), it has some press coverage from a major outlet, it was mentioned multiple times by the series creator, and there have been other verifiable claims about staff involvement. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIrongargoyle_444b.html" title="User:Irongargoyle">Irongargoyle</a> 23:29, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Per the two above. Also, it was mentioned on the commentary for three (I think) episodes of The Simpsons (two were on the season that just came out), and Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein answered questions from the websites members a while back, so it has obviously been recognized <b>several</b> times by the Simpsons staff, not just the time mentioned above. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarpenoctem_01dc.html" title="User:Carpenoctem">Carpenoctem</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarpenoctem_5761.html" title="User talk:Carpenoctem">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Carpenoctem_7e41.html" title="Special:Contributions/Carpenoctem">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
<p>Another is mentions by Show Creators in the dvd commentaries for seasons 6 and 8. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshy0_a612.html" title="User:Marshy0">Marshy0</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marshy0_e38b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marshy0">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per above. If we aren't going to keep it as an individual article, then we should at least merge it with <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.tv.simpsons.html" title="Alt.tv.simpsons">alt.tv.simpsons</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_Archive_4f4c.html" title="The Simpsons Archive">The Simpsons Archive</a> to make a single article on Simpsons internet fandom. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 02:46, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - For those that have already mentioned the season 8 DVD commentaries mentioning No Homers, and for those willing to hear it, I shall share them both here: <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~ericbighead/kangcommentary.mp3" class="external text" title="http://home.comcast.net/~ericbighead/kangcommentary.mp3" rel="nofollow">"Citizen Kang" DVD commentary</a> and <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~ericbighead/enemycommentary.mp3" class="external text" title="http://home.comcast.net/~ericbighead/enemycommentary.mp3" rel="nofollow">"Homer's Enemy" DVD commentary</a>. With acknowledgment from the show producers themselves (on several occasions, including on the board itself), I'd say it's more than just a message board and certainly more than worthy of keeping its article on Wikipedia regardless of Alexa rankings and such. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricbighead_c453.html" title="User:Ericbighead">Ericbighead</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Per above commentary references. Clearly, the recognition by the shows creators on the DVDs themselves (and these are mass-market DVDs, not a niche-product aimed only at fans) seperates this site from others, and adheres to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines. Second Zagalejo's suggestion that if nothing else, this article should be merged with other well-known Simpsons sites covered by Wiki into an article on Simpsons fandom. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilmmakker_e6f3.html" title="User:Filmmakker">Filmmakker</a> 04:27, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The site may not have many members but it has been referenced by the show numerous times.

<li><b>COMMENT:</b> You didn't obviously read no. 6...<b>key word "independent."</b> This has nothing to do with <i>his</i> publishing on American Free Press, but the fact that <i>other</i> people, independent of Bollyn, write about him...google should indicate that aside from the usual "we hate him just because he's a nazi" there is some serious (yes, even scholarly) coverage/review of his work. As for nos. 2-5, by virtue of this article being here at AfD, it appears the nominator isn't exposed to a lot of things in the world outside his own petty interests. In the neo-nazi fringe, he's a cult figure, people concerned about the rise of neo-nazism etc. know about him, people who know anything about the subject know about him. The nominator isn't well-versed in the subject, I assume, and I'll forgive him for that one. Most people didn't know who <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amafanius.html" title="Amafanius">Amafanius</a> was either, before the AFD last week (he was kept, by the way). Ergo, it's pretty obvious why I think Bollyn meets nos. 2-5. As for condition no. 1. You might think him a quack but then again, today we think <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">Eugenics</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_Earth_17b3.html" title="Hollow Earth">Hollow Earth</a> theory and other subjects are the making of quackery, but we still have articles on <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Galton_50bc.html" title="Francis Galton">Francis Galton</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleves_Symmes%2C_Jr._dc5e.html" title="John Cleves Symmes, Jr.">John Cleves Symmes, Jr.</a>. I'm not an inclusionist, but Wikipedia, if it is to be somewhat credible, should cover things that are beyond the pale of current popular culture and Star Wars/Star Trek/Pokemon characters...yes even those who have a minority opinion and operate on society's fringes...<i>provided</i> they meet the notability guidelines (which this guy DOES). I'd for one rather have a neutral article here for someone to learn about this guy if they happen to come across his name, than as a result of ignorance and lack of information get sucked in by his racist bullshit. I'm afraid you're more concerned about deleting another Nazi scumbag (as Bollyn is) than seeing the bigger, more important picture. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 10:55, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - this series of AfDs is driving me nuts. No report by a conspiracy-theory website on a conspiracy-theorist should ever be considered as an independent reliable source. Yet look at the references in the article! Even the Daniel Pipes reference cites him as a "fringe antisemitic writer". I happen to have Google set so that French-language hits appear higher up and all the french references are from places like the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltaire_Network_6281.html" title="Voltaire Network">Voltaire Network</a> which however cool its name may sound is clearly viewed by every reasonnable french-speaker as an utter joke ready to jump on alternative theories of anything no matter how ludicrous. I'm not convinced by the "he's the king of nutjobs" argument. If the article is kept (which it might on no consensus) the article needs to be entirely re-written. The only fair way to describe him is "this guy is in the view of an immense majority a complete wacko. However a few scattered people take him seriously."
