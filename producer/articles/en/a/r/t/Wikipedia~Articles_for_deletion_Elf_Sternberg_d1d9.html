<li><b>Expand</b> Elf Sternberg was one of Usenets most motable people back in the 1990s, probably one of the 20 or so most famous people on the net. He posted extensively to alt-sex. These indiscriminate bulk VfD from Walsh are getting very tiresome.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 20:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You have no interest in the merits of the article, only in making attacks against credibility or my intetions in improving the encylopedia.

<dl>
<dd>What do you mean by non-members? Usenet is not a club. The current host of the FAQ describes it as "the most-often-accessed sex-education document on the net", and I guess she has the statistics to prove it. --<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalnatoke_b045.html" title="User:Palnatoke">Palnatoke</a> 20:49, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I mean that Usenet is an insular community. People who do not post/read it will have no concept of what it is. Unless this person has had publicity outside of Usenet, in the form of press, book/magazine publishings, etc then there is no justification for inclusion. <a href="../../../e/r/w/User_talk%7EErwin_Walsh_ed05.html" title="User talk:Erwin Walsh">Erwin Walsh</a></dd>

<dd>Walsh, do not make silly accusations. You were probably not around when Usenet was the online community. It has not had that position since Canter and Segal destroyed it. Elf is a very significant online pioneer. He was one of the first people to post a regular FAQ to any of the usenet groups. His was certainly the most significant, it transformed the newsgroup. Your criteria for notability are somewhat strange, Paris Hilton is better known than Tim Berners-Lee, which one of the two do you think would be considered more notable by the editors of Britannica? I doubt you have heard of Butler Lampson or Tony Hoare but they are both very significant Turing Award winners. Perhaps if you bothered to explain your VfD nominations on talk pages, took a few seconds to Google the item and stopped deleting criticism of your sloppy actions from your user page you might be more credible.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 23:48, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Expand</b> - I have now changed the emphasis of the stub from his fiction to his Usenet and sexuality activities. He may not be notable as a writer (although he is good), but he is absolutely notable as a Usenet person, especially in the vicinity of alt.sex. --<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalnatoke_b045.html" title="User:Palnatoke">Palnatoke</a> 20:27, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless notability is more clearly established. Being "an usenet personality" or writing many usenet sex stories doesn't qualify, IMHO. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:40, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd vote to <b>Expand</b> it. While fanfic is not <i>normally</i> notable, his best known piece of writing may be an exception. The erotic short short story "The Only Fair Game" is the leading candidate for the single most infamous piece of fanfic in existance. Its speculation about homosexual practices amoung <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Niven_d1bb.html" title="Larry Niven">Larry Niven's</a> <a href="../../../k/z/i/Kzinti.html" title="Kzinti">Kzinti</a> got <a href="../../../e/l/f/Elf_Sternberg_b2e9.html" title="Elf Sternberg">Elf Sternberg</a> a cease-and-desist letter from Niven's lawyers in an incident that to date remains notorious within the SF fandom community; there's mention of what happened on the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">fan fiction</a> wikipedia entry, as well as by Niven himself in the introduction to <i>Man-Kzin Wars IV</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0671720791</a>). Furthermore, Elf was a relatively well known personality on Usenet prior to development of the WWW and the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_that_never_ended.html" title="September that never ended">September that never ended</a>, a prominent poster in the alt.sex.* heirarchy and rec.arts.sf.written — some of the most widely read newsgroups of the time. His editorship for a time of the alt.sex FAQ reflected this. At that time, probably only <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibo.html" title="Kibo">Kibo</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Templeton_e205.html" title="Brad Templeton">Brad Templeton</a> were more well known on Usenet. He's not <i>widely</i> famous, but the controversy of the Kzinti piece alone probably makes him worth a <i>brief</i> article — although one that will probably never grow much beyond the current stub. <a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbb3w_fbee.html" title="User:Abb3w">Abb3w</a> 20:56, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you. I have included the story in the article; still a stub, though. --<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalnatoke_b045.html" title="User:Palnatoke">Palnatoke</a> 21:51, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Hmm. We already have a reasonable precedent for notability of articles on Usenet folks, some of whom are notable otherwise (Gene Spafford, Henry Spencer, Brad Templeton) and some of whom are only notable in the context of Usenet (Robert McElwaine, Kibo, even B1FF). I'd guess worth keeping even in the absence of notability for the writing. This is something slightly more notable than "X is a frequent poster to the forums at Y and is really cool", which we see a lot... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 21:01, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
