<li><b>Comment</b> What edit war? What attacks? How does it involve this article or WWAC-TV? It's the first time I've heard of it or seen it. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WWAC-TV_7dea.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WWAC-TV">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WWAC-TV</a> afd discussion ended several days ago with a full confession and retraction from the hoaxers (including Ngsantia and WWACArtist and maybe UncleFloyd). Anyway, I don't think Gardner was ever mentioned in that discussion. I'm neutral on whether to keep or delete this article. Gardner does seem to be a real reporter though. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:53, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b>. Gardner has been quite well-known throughout southeastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey for decades. I cleaned up and corrected the information presented by the aforementioned troublesome editors, as well as expanded the biography with the external links. The information now in the article is greater than the summarized stub descriptions at WPVI-TV Personalities. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlessi_e981.html" title="User:Olessi">Olessi</a> 18:53, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note: He is not widely known, I have never heard of him in Ohio. He is still not notable, but merging the new info back into the WPVI-TV Personalities article would work. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigel_Wick_4c75.html" title="User:Nigel Wick">Nigel Wick</a> 19:02, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>. Dozens of local news personalities in other cities have articles (<a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Simmons_3da6.html" title="Sue Simmons">Sue Simmons</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Dunphy_cadb.html" title="Jerry Dunphy">Jerry Dunphy</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Jacobson_a94d.html" title="Natalie Jacobson">Natalie Jacobson</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irv_Weinstein_70ba.html" title="Irv Weinstein">Irv Weinstein</a>). Jim Gardner has the lead anchor for decades at one of the highest-rated major-market stations in the country. If <i>national</i> notability was a requirement for inclusion here, we'd have to delete half the bio articles on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 21:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> He passes the google test. --South Philly 22:46, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and Merge</b> per nomination. Non-notable local tv person. <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Simmons_3da6.html" title="Sue Simmons">Sue Simmons</a> he is not, as she has been on some national shows, appears to be one of the first African American woman televison news anchors and is on a channel with national and international distribution (according to the <a href="../../../w/n/b/WNBC_15c0.html" title="WNBC">WNBC</a> article). Comparing her to yet another white guy anchor who who has just been on local TV is comparing apples and oranges. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Dunphy_cadb.html" title="Jerry Dunphy">Jerry Dunphy</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Jacobson_a94d.html" title="Natalie Jacobson">Natalie Jacobson</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irv_Weinstein_70ba.html" title="Irv Weinstein">Irv Weinstein</a> (same name as my dentist), et. al along with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Gardner_019c.html" title="Jim Gardner">Jim Gardner</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Roberts_%28reporter%29_3a6b.html" title="Dave Roberts (reporter)">Dave Roberts (reporter)</a> all need to be deleted and merged into pages about their respective stations. They all may be well known in their local area but I have never heard of them, except Jerry Dunphy, but I live in the Southland. If you look at the edit history of WPVI-TV Personalities you will see that the relevant section was edited, and a good chunk of text was transfered in to the "new" article. It should be merged back. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkyChicken%21_e35d.html" title="User:FunkyChicken!">FunkyChicken!</a> 23:04, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I see nothing wrong with pages of local newscasters in major cities. Jim Gardner is certainly one of the biggest such figures in Philadelphia, which is one of the largest US markets.--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliga10_0ee9.html" title="User:Caliga10">Caliga10</a> 23:07, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>He's just as popular in Philly as Bill Beutel was in New York. You could make the exact same case for deleting <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Beutel_b550.html" title="Bill Beutel">Bill Beutel</a> as the "delete" voters are proposing here. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 15:45, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No you could not make the same argument for <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Beutel_b550.html" title="Bill Beutel">Bill Beutel</a>, as Bill Beutel anchored <a href="../../../a/m/_/AM_America_e0df.html" title="AM America">AM America</a>, was an <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_News_2f7d.html" title="ABC News">ABC News</a> correspondent where he worked with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Jennings_2f0c.html" title="Peter Jennings">Peter Jennings</a>, and is partly responsible for the development of the <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyewitness_News_21bb.html" title="Eyewitness News">Eyewitness News</a> format. If you are going to make comparisons make accurate ones, as this Jim Gardner never did anything of national stature. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Matt_Feldman_Experience%21_7e5f.html" title="User:The Matt Feldman Experience!">The Matt Feldman Experience!</a> 16:35, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would have to agree with The Matt Feldman Experience that Kirjtc2 is making a dubious comparison. It looks as if <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Beutel_b550.html" title="Bill Beutel">Bill Beutel</a> has had considerable national and international reporting duties as well as hosting ABC's morning show whilst Jim Gardner seems to be a minor local reporter and newsreader. I would venture a guess that more people know of Beutel than Gardner and those who know Beutel would not just be in a highly localized area. And by the way, Philadelphia will never be on the same par as New York, it is another dubious comparison. It is like comparing a 1973 Buick Skylark to a 2006 Bentley. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkyChicken%21_e35d.html" title="User:FunkyChicken!">FunkyChicken!</a> 21:40, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are you all the same person? This reminds me of <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpotteddogsdotorg_56c5.html" title="User:Spotteddogsdotorg">User:Spotteddogsdotorg</a> who used sockpuppets to get his way with his pro-NYC anti-Philly news bias in afd last year.

<dd>No we are all clones. *Joke* Seriously, this whole Wikipedia thing I thought was supposed to be fun, but apparently if someone agrees with me they are a sockpuppet and I am some sort of puppetmaster? Sounds more like there are <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_McCarthy_1e1b.html" title="Joseph McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> clones running about seeing sockpuppets under every rock. Just because you disagree doesn't mean you should attack and accuse just to keep people out of your cabal. I think I may quit Wikipedia if this is the level of debate seems to be tar all those you disagree with as sockpuppets if they don't agree with you. Very mature! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Matt_Feldman_Experience%21_7e5f.html" title="User:The Matt Feldman Experience!">The Matt Feldman Experience!</a> 17:37, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let's see. You have a message on your page saying you want to quit. I received a message from FunkyChicken! saying he quit. TVXPert, who voted, said he quit on his userpage. Coincidence? <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikNY_f163.html" title="User:ErikNY">ErikNY</a> 18:30, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am sorry for the confusion caused when making my attacks on <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpotteddogsdotorg_56c5.html" title="User:Spotteddogsdotorg">User:Spotteddogsdotorg</a> which I was, but the person with that website was insulting me on tvnewstalk.net because he would not give me a WCAU tape and got me banned more than once. Then I remembered the Wikipedia as a way to get revenge on him by taking things from his website and putting them on to look like he did it but I Scott Brown did do it to make a mockery of him. I am not going to kill myself because I want to relive the time that WCAU was CBS, boy those were the days! I am not crazy and going to kill myself and do not need help. I don't like Jim Gardner and his story should be deleted. I now have a sattilte dish and can't watch Philladelphia, but get WCBS and WNYW and WCBS has The People's Court which is the best show on the televison today. Not as good as when WCAU was CBS, but good still. I hope that my destroying of the good name of the person was mean enough to get them in trouble with all of you and didn't mean any problems with the Wikipedia with making revenge on people who do not give me the tapes that they promised. Thank you, Scott Brown. <a href="../../../m/r/p/User%7EMrPhillyTV_125f.html" title="User:MrPhillyTV">MrPhillyTV</a> 22:26, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody's buying the 'Scott Brown' story. 70.108.82.120 18:32, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I got into his account because he is one who has a password which is password and I know that is stupid and you can try it too by using login as FunkyChicken and password as password! Stupid moron has made his password password and does not expect people to try to fake being him? That is just being a stupid moron. And I was making it look like I was not alone in my love for WCAU and the People's COurt. He said he was going to leave and I make the account an active one, but this time for Scott Brown and will make all sorts of delting votes for things I do not like, like WPVI which was not as good as WCAU when it was CBS and I can't get either on my sattilite and that is a shame. I, Scott Brown and am sorry and will not kill myself and try to be a better user from now on and not lie or use other users who are stupid enough to use password as their password then quit the great wikipedia and will not use wikipedia as a revenge on people who do not give me my WCAU tapes that they say they were going to give me but do not give. THat is mean and they need to be given ppunishment of being blacklisted on the wikipedia and accused of bad things. I am sorry for not properly making wikipedia editing but I have been feeling bad ever since my mother left and I miss those good days since then WCAU was CBS and I did not have to watch WCBS as CBS on my sattilite. No I am not going to kill myself as the tvnewstalk.net people have made fun of me for and now the radio-info.com people are making fun of me too. This is wrong and I am sorry but they can't be mean to Scott Brown and mock my love for WCAU as CBS. I am sorry if I hurt anyone and if you could fix or delete any wrong things or passwords I would be happy and will not bother you again and maybe later I can make better editings to the wikipeida, but please delete the Jim Gardner article as he was never on WCAU when it was CBS. Thank you and I hope to be a better person when it comes to making wikipedia changes. Please accept my appology.
