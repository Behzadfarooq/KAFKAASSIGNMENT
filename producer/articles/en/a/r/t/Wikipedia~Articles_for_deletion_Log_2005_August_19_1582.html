<li>We don't generally pre-emptively create redirects for all potential mis-spellings, as we pre-emptively create redirects for pluralizations, different capitalizations, and so forth. But if someone has <i>actually made the mistake</i> and created a duplicate article at the mis-spelled title, then we redirect, on the grounds that if one person did it once, then others are likely to do the same in the future, and the redirect both prevents the whole cycle repeating and edifies readers. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:09:43, 2005-08-19 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this page yesterday and have had less than 24 hours to work on it. I plan on improving this article to list all the county supervisors who have served in Santa Clara County. In the state of California Countys play a large role and are important elected officals. They serve over 1.7 million people and the county staff exceedes 15,000 employees. Most are former mayors and some have gone on to serve as state legislatures or US representatives.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Before we decide to keep this article, has anyone actually read it? For some reason the first sentence specifies 5th district, though it seems more than one district is represented, based on the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Gage_4bce.html" title="Don Gage">Don Gage</a> stub (VfD fodder that one is) and the fact that there's so much overlapping of years it almost seems they were made by a random number generator. Someone decided all the names should be linked, even though they are almost all non-notables (a few are notable for going on to positions of some importance, but not for being county supervisor), and many are incorrect links. At the <i>very least</i> this needs extreme de-linking (I'll take care of that) and some sense to be made of the years and who exactly is covered by this article. If we're going to do a shoddy job we might as well not bother at all. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 03:03, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I originally suggested the Delete, and I'm sticking with it for several reasons: First of all, Wikipedia is going to list a lot of porn/nude models if we go by the Google count, whether they have an ambition to become "artists" or "actors" or not? Second, the Google count - which is probably high for any nude model - is boosted by her boy friend holding a gun to her head. Still doesn't make her notable. Three, the fact that she has posed for a Norwegian girlie magazine or appears in a Norwegian tabloid hardly makes her noteworthy. What's next? All the Sun's Page 8 girls? <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsav_c8c3.html" title="User:Asav">Asav</a></li>

<li>Much as I hate to say it, <b>Keep</b>. That specualtions are made by the press, and by police, and fairly widely reported, is a fact. This article merely notes that fact. It does not claim that the specualtions are accurate, merely that they ahve been made.

<li><b>Delete</b> - A single original story, which doesn't even suggest anything more than coincidence amounts to nothing notable. If this was widely reported and discussed, than yes, I would support it's inclusion in wikipedia in *some* article. Let's pretend it was real: why create an article? There's a widely beleived correlation between crime novels and crime, but we don't create a specific article for each in every combination of specific crime novel and specific crime. Instead we make an appropriate comment in the article about the book (if it's pecular that specific book), or to the crime (if a type of reading material is common to the crime), but we don't (or shouldn't) have an article on every conceivable crime/book/tv/movie/work-of-art combination that some local cop noticed. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 04:23, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (but I am the author of the original article.) As pointed out above, I was merely noting that the correlation was considered and widely discussed, not that it was necessarily true - it could be like the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_Rainbow_Party_2ace.html" title="Sexual Rainbow Party">Sexual Rainbow Party</a>, which was a subject of wide discussion despite flimsy evidence the phenomenon actually existed. I think that if we keep that article, this is worth keeping as well. Oh, and here's another recent article on the subject from <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/justice/article.jsp?content=20050530_106573_106573" class="external text" title="http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/justice/article.jsp?content=20050530_106573_106573" rel="nofollow">Macleans</a>; this isn't based on just one news story. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoultaco_1629.html" title="User:Soultaco">Soultaco</a> 04:33, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: Well, if we follow the Maclean's article, we can either create a Star Wars and pedophilia article also. or we can find an appropriate existing article, and put it there (*if* sufficient notability exists). I'm sure there must be hundreds of *other* apparent commonalities or patterns that police see (or think they see). Also, putting this "theory" in an existing abuse-related article will subject it to appropriate peer review, by active editors on the subject. Passing off a POV in such an article will get you reverted much quicker than in some obscure little article, nobody sees. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 12:05, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Inherently POV; no matter how matter-of-factly the article is written, the discussion of such a correlation on what is presumably a coincidence is always going to result in a skewed point of view. Trekkies, as abhorrent as they may be, may not necessarily <i>all</i> be paedophiles. Consideration of a correlation does not make for an encyclopaedic article. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 11:09, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, it does specifically note that the hypothesis does <i>not</i> imply that all or even most Trekkies are pedophiles - rather, it implies that pedophiles are attracted to Star Trek, which is quite different, as it says nothing whatsoever about Star Trek fans in general (who could also be attracted to Star Trek for other reasons entirely). <a href="../../../s/o/u/User_talk%7ESoultaco_02c5.html" title="User talk:Soultaco">Soultaco</a></dd>

<p>The page has been improved slightly since my request for removal.

<li>The band is fairly well-known (or perhaps notorious) at the campus radio station where I work. In casting my vote, I extrapolated that other campus/community stations in Canada are probably familiar with this band as well. In any case, I'm reluctant to delete a band that has released a full-length CD recording, and has distributed it to stations outside of their hometown (the worthlessness of their music notwithstanding). The WP:Music guidelines only provide criteria for bands to be judged as <b>indisputably</b> notable; they don't cover all of the grey areas. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 19:08, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Can you actually quantify the line where one can realistically mark a clear division between "notable" and "extremely notable"? I sure as hell can't...to me, the line is contextually relative to the genre in which the band operates, rather than an objective scale that ranks all bands by the same measure. They're no match for the notability of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, granted, but within the specific context of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indie_rock.html" title="Indie rock">indie rock</a> in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>, The Dears can certainly be described as "extremely notable". <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:04, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a band has widespread popularity like the Beatles, then a side project (like George Harrison's solo work) is worthy of an encyclopedia. If a band <b>doesn't</b> have that, (as in the case of the Dears, having put out a few albums but, as far as I can tell, not know very much outside of Quebec), then while they themselves may warrant an encyclopedia article, their side projects may not. Anyway, in the realm of, say, Star Trek fandom, obscure bits on machinery might be considered notable, but would never make its way into an encyclopedia because it's too irrelevant to most people. This seems like music's version of that. It just doesn't hit enough points in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> to warrant staying.

<p>The Dears are considered "extremely notable" across Canada having had a near-cult following on many college campuses for years. There is no better guage for "notable" in indie-rock's transient and poor-student-driven world. Launie Anderssohn are genre groundbreakers misunderstood by the dull, and celebrated by intelligent witty townsfolk and hard to thrill musicians alike. As in, they have their own sound and message and media package. As in, they are influential. The fact that they play at smaller clubs should not make them less noteworthy for the history of musical progress. Wikipedia is a boon to music writers everywhere, let's keep it that way.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Hi. I've just removed the speedy tag from this page. I hope you do not mind. If any of you have been following developments on the VfD page, the "undelete" process at VfU, and related pages at AN/I, you will know that there has been a great deal of controversy recently over the SD process. There are editors who monitor deletions and undelete articles that have been speedied, if in their opinion the article did not meet any SD criterion. This has happened even in cases where the most obvious hoaxes and similar nonsense were the subjects of the articles; i.e., you cannot count on common sense prevailing over a concern for "process." This has also occured the other way around: undeleted articles get re-deleted, then undeleted, and so on and so forth until all that is left is an unnecessarily acrimonious atmosphere and a bad taste in the mouth for all concerned. So we should all be careful with SD; if we're not, you can bet the house that the article will be dragged out far longer than it would with a normal VfD process. If you are going to speedy, make sure you know the criteria listed in <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. There are 8 General criteria, 7 Article criteria, 4 Redirect, and 3 each for Images, Categories, and User pages. I cannot see that Anything in G1-8 or A1-7 applies. The editor who SD tagged gave the reason that it is patent nonsense. But it is not. There is a page that explains patent nonsense, <a href="../../../p/n/_/WP%7EPN_ca1e.html" title="WP:PN">WP:PN</a>; there are two criteria both of which are unmet by Fuck Hole.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 13:09:24, 2005-08-19 (UTC)<b>Note:</b> there was a suggestion that this was a personal attack (on Boortz). It might qualify for A6 if so, but there is also a suggestion that the content of the article is true, ie. that Boortz actually believes this and has written it. I am not knowledgeable enough about this to know; Wiffle0rz, can you provide evidence that the claim is true? If it isn't there is a good case for A6.

I really don't care how it is coded as long as it looks good and links together.

<li>Philie T is known to the IDM community (WATMM is a good example). He worked with people like Squarepusher and Ceephax as a filmmaker, and other Chelmsford artists included Cassette Boy. He'll never be in the top 100 music chart, because he's an underground artist, and he gives his art away for free on www.philiet.co.uk I don't believe for a second that wikipedia's hard drives will crash and burn by adding an article about an underground artist who is well known in IDM circles. This article is an expansion from the Ceephax Acid Crew article. Had to mention his starring in Philie T's films, Philie T is well known to the IDM community. Why not add an article about him? Because he's not Britney Spears or AC/DC. Pff. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyrex_1fab.html" title="User:Joyrex">Joyrex</a> 15:24, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

He may be mad awesome, but the information in the article is currently 100% unverifiable. If we include him as someone garnering shoutouts from Aphex Twin, we will also have to include "Gentle John, Cylob Industries, Grant and Jen, Mike D, ...???...

<li><b>Abstain</b> (I haven't a clue about this fellow) but <b>comment</b>. For those who don't know: the VfD procedure theoretically involves the WikiPedia community taking a look at a page which may be borderline (clear deletes are marked as "speedy"), and voting on whether it should remain in an encyclopædia or not. As such, the votes of anonymous users who happened to breeze in, or fans of the subject of an article recruited to WikiPedia <b>solely</b> so that they can vote against its deletion, are naturally not considered as important as those of regular 'pedians. Indeed, the practice of rounding up one's friends and getting them to cast a vote on a website that otherwise holds no interest for them is considered quite rude; it's called "sock puppeteering", a term that originated on USENET, associated with fraudulent or anti-social behaviour. <b>That</b> is why all y'all new users haven't been greeted in the warmest of terms. That said, um ... welcome! I hope you stick around and make a greater contribution to this encyclopædia than a single, discountable vote. If you do, believe me, your opinion will start to matter at last. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> 17:28, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I asked forum.watmm.com to come here and comment. Easterlingman uses Wikipedia since before, and is a genuine guy. Chaosmachine is a seperate guy, but still classed as sockpuppet. Apologies for ruding Wikipedia from me. Sorry about that. I edited the article now to make it a bit better. Can't improve it much more myself. Philie T's notability comes from his link to Ceephax (by making films with him) and his high up friends in British <a href="../../../i/d/m/IDM_787a.html" title="IDM">IDM</a>. He will never be in the top 100 pop chart, because his ethic is to give away music for free in mp3. There is too much about sockpuppets now to change anyone's mind, but I will try and make the article again in the future (coupled of months), because I think the present edit is not so bad as the original, and it shows Philie T's link to Ceephax Acid Crew, which is my motivation for writing the article (expanding knowledge of Ceephax's career, and noting things from the IDM community.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I see this as an impotant step in the development of Big Bang theory, not a theory in it's own right. I also see it as deserving better than this.

<li><b>Comment</b>. EMS, I agree. I'd be in favour of a "merge" to the rest of the nucleosynthesis. Presumably because of a single sci.physics.research post, people think it refers to the CMB, and it would be good to have the correct information in the wiki.

<p>I just linked this article in to the Big Bang entry because someone changed "expansion and evolution" of the universe, there, to refer to expansion only. There are a lot of expanding models (for example an unstable static Einstein universe) (positive cosmo constant) perturbed so as to expand, or a de Sitter universe. The Big Bang was clinched by the CBR, but the near uniform primordial element abundance is a very strong point. Deleting this classic entry is like deleting Christopher Marlowe because Shakespeare eclipsed him. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 16:01, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I disagree that it is a memorial page: she is notable for how she died, and the article focuses on cheerleading, which led to her death.

<li><b>Delete</b>. In reply to Tonywalton, all that proves is that the rate of death from cheerleading is fairly low, and/or that the number of people who participate in it is also fairly low. Most individual deaths are not notable, unless the person who died is notable before their death, with few exceptions. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 18:23, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Put Elsewhere</b>. I tend to agree with Tonywalton on this. Cheerleading is a dangerous sport with the constant possibly for severe injury or death. Instead of giving it an entire page, could it be added to the cheerleading page already in existance? And then, other cases can be added as they occur, also. I think it's important to show that it's not just a bunch of girls shaking pom-poms for boys, but a sport where people can get hurt or die. Why not include it with cheerleading? <a href="../../../k/_/o/User%7EK_of_slinky_a34a.html" title="User:K of slinky">K of slinky</a> 20:15, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As the original editor of the article I assert it is not a memorial page as has been suggested in the nomination for deletion. I am an Australian. I have never seen live cheerleading and would not participate in such an activity and would actively discourage my daughter from cheerleading. I wrote the article when I became aware of the death and issues of notability on the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Talk%7EDeaths_in_2005_79dc.html#Ashley_Burns" title="Talk:Deaths in 2005">Talk:Deaths_in_2005#Ashley_Burns</a>. Before coming across the reference to her on that page I had never heard of her. At that stage, just over a week over her death, a <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22ashley+burns%22+cheerleader&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22ashley+burns%22+cheerleader&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">simple google search</a> showed 464 hits. Today, three days later, the same search shows 609 hits. Her death, reports of the funeral, reports of the potential impact on cheerleading stunts has received national coverage being reported several times in the Washington Post, on CNN, in the Houston newspapers as well as local Massachussets papers. It is my assessment that the threshhold of notability has been reached and that although there are limits to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">the Google test</a> other articles have been kept with fewer hits. I have referenced Ashely Burns's death in the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheerleading.html" title="Cheerleading">Cheerleading</a> article but I do not think it appropriate that the article be taken over by details of this incident. As a passing observation on process I find it strange that the nominator of the VfD chose to abstain. I also think as a matter of courtesy original editors of articles should be advised if an article into which they have obviously put more than a passing amount of effort were notified via their talk page of the deletion debate. Because of subsequent edits to the article the nomination to VfD did not show up on my talk page and I nearly missed the debate.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 10:17, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I brought the matter to VfD having following the discussion on Recent Deaths (and wishing for the widest possible consensus), but I truly have no firm opinion, so I abstained, which is not uncommon. I do not follow the practice of notifying contributors of VfD's on their creations, at least not when ample and capable defenses are otherwise provided by dispassionate parties. Although I continue to abstain, I believe some would argue that the Google Test is less appropriate here, on the theory that this is a transient phenomenon, and not likely to be widely remembered after a short time has elapsed. My suggestion that is a this memorial page follows from my belief that nothing is memorable about young Burns except her tragic death. Any other details (about cheerleading hazards generally) would belong at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheerleading.html" title="Cheerleading">cheerleading</a> or, possibly, the odd-sounding cheerleading hazards. On the other hand, I acknowledge that press makes one notable. Hence, I am undecided, and <b>abstain</b> as above. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:32, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Query</i> I deleted Frugby the first time it appeared (quite a long time ago), noting that it didn't seem to have been mentioned in the Oban Times, which I would take as an initial test of notability for new things in the area.

<li>Keep: This page may breach some of the rules of wikipedia. It may have overstated some aspects of the sport, only in good humour. These problems can easily be rectified and the page's creator has already offered to cooperate with any suggested changes. As a member of the Oban community and frugby player myself - I can attest to the positive influence of this sport on the young people of the town. It is true that this sport has not yet been recognised by the Oban Times. As Dux (academic leader) of the local High School, I was misquoted only last week on the front page of said newspaper. The truth is that frugby has improved my life, and I believe it can have the same positive effect on others. This sport is refreshingly new, you dont need to be an athlete to compete. As such, I vote to keep this page and encourage other youngsters to share our enthusiasm for the sport of Oban's youth. Sincerely, Andy lennox (16) User's first and only edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Andy+Lennox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Andy+Lennox" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>KEEP: I recently found this article in the Wikipedia after hearing rumors of such a sport. The rumors had made their way down from Oban Scotland by word of mouth all the way to Islington/Hackney London, where I see people playing it in the parks around here. I would use the words "Intrepid" "Brave" "Honourable" to describe these young Men (yes I use the word men, for who else can participate in such a lively sport) rather than such a cowardice word as "vanity." I am proud to say I support such an entry into Wikipedia and if it was not for my wooden leg (a war wound) I would be playing myself.

<li><b>totally keep man</b> yo, i am the lads Frugby coach. JohnK just brought this to my attention and i think you have totally gotta keep it. The boys came to me last Christmas asking if i would help them arrange times to play and i agreed. they have all worked so hard tom promote and develope the sport , this article took a lot of work as JohnK (the author) has a severe strain of dyslexia and so even trying to write an essay like this took some balls. as an after thought to BALLS, maybe some of you guys should try and grow some, i mean who the frig collects flags?! coach morrison 20:03, 21 August 2005 (UTC) Vote by the user is their first and only edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Coach+Morrison" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Coach+Morrison" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></li>
<li><b>keep</b> I previously requested this article as i promoted the advent of Frugby in the boys school as a sort of project to encourage them to take up a sport. Frugby has now spread throughout the Scottish west coast and is becoming more and more popular. It may sound ridiculous but it is similar to the "jump london" craze a few years ago.

<li><b>keep</b> Frugby means alot to alot of people and to remove would be to remove the most important part of their community. Frugby has touched the hearts and souls of many people in the Oban area and this site is a perfect way of spreading the message further afeild. in these troubled times the only thinks that keep us saine are what remains of our community spirit.

<li><b>keep</b> I am the author of this thread and whilst that may make my opinion biased i really do see a need for this thread. I don't believe the thread is at all Vain; i tried to make it as informative as possible to as wide an audience as possible. On the subject of the logo; it is barely recognisable from the EA logo and it has been altered substantialy enough to avoid copyright infringement.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Through one of my many adventures throughout the World Wide Web, I have recently come across the sport of Frugby. Pursuing my curiosity, I tried Wikipedia to see if I can find out more about the support. Upon seeing this entry, I believe that this sport has potential throughout the world to become major. Deleting this entry will not help the inventors of Fruby, and it may stop the sport from becoming Global.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can it be vanity if i am not referring to myself or including myself? Also they are the social elite of the area. Half of them are Dux of the local High school, one of them is a fleet admiral in the navy, and the other is from America. So they are all elite.johnk <b>Keep</b> someone please have the courtacy to explain why this article has to be deleted? Believe it or not but it is actually not a piss take. Also why are all positive votes being deleted. The IP address is the same as it is actually possible to have more than one person using the same internet connection.</p>

<li>Yes, however these people are the ones who are most likely to read the article and ,currently, those who will get most out of it.
<ul>
<li>Since, it is most likely a local thing, what you could do is copy the information you have here and start up your own website about Frugby. There are various website providers willing to give you free space to use. But, on Wikipedia, we have criteria of what can be included. And some users feel that Frugby does not meet these standards. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 19:39, 20 August 2005 (UTC)#</li>

<li>what about the article you have about yourself? is that not, most likely, a "local" thing? Personaly i would say this is of more interest to more people than any article you have written about yourself. As this has been accused of being an essay on vanity (which it isnt) how would you describe your own autiobiographical piece?</li>

<ul>
<li>What I have is called a user page. Wikipedians, once they get an account, are given a page to put information about themselves if they want.

<p>what about if i include a single paragraph about myself?</p>

<li>Create an account called Frugby (which is legal).

<ul>
<li>who should i contact with regards to a bribe to keep this page?
<ul>
<li>I do not take bribes, but most likely, the page will be deleted. And, if that is the case, you and your friends are not allowed to create it. If so, the page will fall under speedy deletion and will be deleted without going through this process. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 20:17, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. For the purpose of an Encyclopedia a biographical entry ought to be about a person of historical interest, academic significance, or be a contributor of new ideas or fresh perspectives in a given field. This apologist could not at this stage in history be identified as a major contributor, a seminal thinker who has produced new ideas or perspectives, or be ranked as an important popular writer. Once his career nears its end then it would be possible to make a mature assessment of his contributions. One way of contemplating which pop apologists deserve mention in Wikipedia is to consider their career and training. This apologist does not have any theological training, in contrast to other popular apologists such as Josh McDowell. This apologist only holds credentials in library science, and thus the output of his work can be measured in a few ways. One is by the originality of his work at a pop level - does this apologist rank as someone who has lucidly summarised the work of academic apologists and hence made their work more accessible to a non academic reader? Another test is to consider the comprehensive nature and understanding of the apologist when writing on a given topic. A good illustration of this is the article he wrote against the atheist Richard Packham. Packham, a lawyer, had written a critical piece on John Montgomery's legal apologetic. The apologist's article was lacking in proper background research, and this was reflected in the content of the article. For example, the apologist dismissed Montgomery's legal apologetic but was unaware of the fact that in the history of apologetics more than 120 apologists have engaged in legal apologetics. It is a school of thought in the history of the field, which has only just started to be recognised in its own right. While the apologist is entitled to dislike legal apologetics, the substance of this particular article was not at a standard that could be rated as properly researched or making a significant, valuable contribution to a specific debate. The apologist's output on the Mormons is likewise not of sufficient quality or depth to be deemed a vital or important contribution that improves on comparable publications in the subject. While this apologist has had a strong web-presence, this factor by itself does not establish significance, mere prolixity of words or pop traffic to the site is not a good indicator of importance. As one who has taught the subject at a tertiary level, I have not included this apologist in course references. This is not prejudice but on the grounds that he would not be rated as important enough to merit inclusion for a course bibliography, whereas pop apologists like Strobel and McDowell would be included. This latter comment is not to devalue his efforts or dismiss his website. It might be noted that in the Wiki article "apologetics" his website is listed as an external link. In my opinion that is sufficient presence for this apologist at this time in Wikipedia. User: philjohnson 9.42 am August 24 2005.</li>
<li><b>strong keep</b> I believe Holding's work the Impossible faith is very noteworthy. <a href="http://www.tektonics.org/lp/nowayjose.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tektonics.org/lp/nowayjose.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> I also thought his Exodus/Scythian argument was noteworthy. <a href="http://www.tektonics.org/af/exoduslogistics.html#scy" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tektonics.org/af/exoduslogistics.html#scy" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> To give one more example of work I think is notable of JP Holding, I think his commentary on resurrection accounts which discusses the ANE cultural aspects was very helpful in regards to this issue.<a href="http://www.tektonics.org/harmonize/gospelprecision.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tektonics.org/harmonize/gospelprecision.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a><a href="http://www.tektonics.org/harmonize/lincoln01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tektonics.org/harmonize/lincoln01.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> In addition, I believe Holding covers many topics that are often offered by skeptics but which I believe are not often covered by other apologists such as the "copycat Christ" argument. <a href="http://www.tektonics.org/copycat/copycathub.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tektonics.org/copycat/copycathub.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> Also, I believe Holding offers a useful service to the Christian community in having a very large library of articles on various Bible verses many of which I have found helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In regards to the Packham commentary I would say that I did not entirely agree with Holding's essay on Packham although I agreed on some points. I do think Western legal standard apologetics have their place for example. Also, Holding did say that Montgomery made some legitimate points. <a href="http://www.tektonics.org/lp/packham01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tektonics.org/lp/packham01.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>However, I don't think that Packham really deserved a rebuttal essay given his legal commentary although I am glad some Christians with legal backgrounds have responded either directly or indirectly. To give one example, Packham didn't cover the obvious argument for the pro resurrection testimony in regards to the exception to the hearsay rule from a legal standpoint -namely "statements against interest" given in this code (Cal.Ev.Code §1230; F.R.E. 804(b)(3).)<a href="http://lawreligionculturereview.blogspot.com/2005_01_01_lawreligionculturereview_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lawreligionculturereview.blogspot.com/2005_01_01_lawreligionculturereview_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. Packham's rebuttal to someone who critiqued his essay just mentions this issue but does not comment on it very much and Packham currently offers a dead link to the statute!<a href="http://home.teleport.com/~packham/pehrson.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.teleport.com/~packham/pehrson.htm" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="http://www.trinitysem.edu/journal/pehrsonpap.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.trinitysem.edu/journal/pehrsonpap.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></p>
<p>I personally think Packham's work was sloppy, ill thought out, and did not cover the major issues. Part of the reason is that I think his heart was not in it and I suggest looking at Packham's career as a lawyer to decide if this was the case. <a href="http://www.trinitysem.edu/journal/pehrsonpap.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.trinitysem.edu/journal/pehrsonpap.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></p>
<p>In addition, I think you dwelled entirely too much on his Packham essay and did not cite and did not comment on Holding's more well known essays like the "Impossible Faith". I only addressed the Packham essay to show it was not very notable and Holding's quick dismissal of it was not a tragedy. In short, I think it was an exclusion fallacy you were practicing. Also, you claim Holding's commentary on the Mormon religion was not quality work but you did not say why. Given your comments on legal apologetics, I think you should have practiced the principle that the burden of proof is upon the claimant.</p>
<p>In short, even Babe Ruth missed few pitches so I think your dwelling on the Packham essay was insufficiently gracious. I don't think I was being unfair to the Packham essay but I will let each person decide for themselves in this matter based on a review of the legal apologetics that have been written. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/apologetics/AP0302W3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/apologetics/AP0302W3.htm" rel="nofollow">[33]</a><a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">ken</a> 19:21, 24 August 2005 (UTC)kdbuffalo</p>
<p><b>Brief rejoinder</b>: The comments above made on the article where Mr Holding replied to Packham, and hence dealt with Montgomery's legal apologetic, was concentrated on as an illustration of the difficulties that can beset a popular apologist when tackling a technical subject that it would be prudent to leave to those with juridical credentials. I indicated to Mr Holding in an e-mail shortly after his article was published that his position was vulnerable from inside the history of Christian apologetics given that at least 120 legal apologists have published material in defence of the faith. The Montgomery legal apologetic has been defended in a special issue of Global Journal of Classical Theology (2002), and one of the essays there provides bibliographical data on at least 90 legal apologists.</p>
<p>I offered the remarks made on the previous day about the legal apologetic article as one tangible example that could be considered by a Wiki panel in deciding whether to delete or improve on the existing entry about Mr Holding. In submitting the prior post I believed that it was inappropriate to make a protracted presentation of difficulties that can be pointed to in other items (such as the material on the LDS).</p>
<p>My initial post indicated in passing that I have taught apologetics at a tertiary level. I also happen to be extensively published with books and articles, and have been a practitioner since 1978, but I do not believe that an article about my work should appear in Wiki. But whether my personal commitment is that of a Christian or not, has no bearing on the merits of an article about Mr Holding as an apologist in Wikipedia. I indicated on the discussion page that I was not making comments to support his non-Christian critics. In light of the fact that I briefly identified my worldview (and hence potential bias in Mr Holding's favour), and simultaneously avoided ad hominem commentary about Mr Holding, a final comment on the above rejoinder is warranted. I believe that the following remarks made above violate the Wiki netiquette, as well as being gratuitous and offensive: "Perhaps Mr. Packham gave you lessons on how to present a convincing case in this matter." user; philjohnson25 August 2005 11.19 am.</p>
<p><b>Brief comment on rejoinder</b> You made <b>many</b> statements that legal apologetics are valid. I agreed with you that they have their place. Now given your many comments about legal apologetics it seems to me that it is fair that you follow judicial standards and if you make claims about JP Holding that you have the courtesy to support them or refrain from making them. It seemed to me you want the privilidge of making a critical claim without the attendant responsibility of supporting that claim in regards to Holding's Mormon commentary. I suggest you retract the claim and apologize for not supporting it or support it. I certainly hope you do not believe that critics are immune from criticism or that critics should not support their claims. Now I agree that my comment was overly pointed and sarcastic. It just appeared to me that you needed to be knocked off your high horse though. I would remind you that criticism without supporting that criticism is easy but nobody ever built a monument to a critic who did not support his criticism.</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> I do not know what is particularly random about Michael Horner. Perhaps, duncharris can elaborate. LOL I also see no evidence that the members of the Canadian university are particularly afraid of homosexuals although they disagree with homosexuality which I think is tolerable in a free society. Also, I cannot imagine the fairly peaceful Canadians as being particularly hateful. I would also point out that a leading atheist debator Dan Barker went out of his way to debate Mr. Horner.</p>

<li>That's a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>, and it's completely misplaced. Firstly, my article survived a VFD with a keep result based on my being a published author and compiler of election results, not as a local councillor. Secondly, the person who nominated it for deletion was me: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Boothroyd&amp;diff=20573562&amp;oldid=19309553" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Boothroyd&amp;diff=20573562&amp;oldid=19309553" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>.

<li>There is obviously no room on Wikipedia for personal attacks, and on this point I agree with user David.

<li>Apologies David if you feel this was a personal attack: it was not so intended. The disagreement is solely over the interpretation of <i>notability</i>: 1. a prominent person 2. being notable: (i) worthy of note; remarkable (ii) distinguished; prominent.

<li><b>Keep</b> the fact that they have been elected to public office says they are noteworthy. Simon Ashley is the leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Manchester City Council.

<li>If you are arguing that anyone elected to public office anywhere is notable, then I disagree.

<ul>
<li>That is a sophist's argument. In my experience most councillors in three-member wards do apportion them out. While all three may speak collectively for the ward, it is normal in measuring the level of representation to take the number of electors per councillor and not number of electors per ward.

Also what happens where councillors in a ward of differing political parties? Who decides who represents which third is those circumstances? Utter rot to suppose that wards are divided by three.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm gonna go for delete on this one. How many local councillors can you name? I'm not sure about systems in other countries, but in the UK, local councillors just do menial bureaucratic tasks. They do have influence on the local area, and have some local notability, but it's on a too small scale. When local council elections take place, the news channels never look at specific election battles, or even bother naming any individual candidates. It's just used as a popularity poll for the major parties, and can help people guess the outcome of a general election, when people vote for MPs, actual notable people. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 02:47, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Having too much time on my hands I have looked up the election results<a href="http://www.manchester.gov.uk/elections/types/local/2004.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.manchester.gov.uk/elections/types/local/2004.htm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. Not only do the wards have only 10,000 voters on average but the turnout in 2004 was about 30%. Each voter has 3 votes i.e. the total number of votes in each ward was ~9,000. but as far as I can tell none of these councillors got more than 2000 votes. Obviously if you have enough friends and relatives (about 500 will do) and join a voting block in Manchester you can become a councillor. These stubs are only to increase the notoriety of nn officials.--<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 06:06, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Just a thought.</b> If you are going to publish details about us for an encyclopedia online, then perhaps the first thing you should do is contact us to ask us to funish you with information you are interested in publishing. The entry about me (for example) would appear to have been taken directly from a summary list that was created for the Manchester Liberal Democrats website, and certainly does not cover my political career, nor does it give any mention of my personal philosophies and/or achievements. The difficulty you would appear to be having here is that some person has, unbeknowned to me (and certainly at least one other councillor who drew my attention to this site) taken copyrighted material out of context and posted it here, leaving you in a most unnecessary quandry as to what to do with it. I believe that if you are looking to produce an online encyclopedia that perhaps the most productive approach would be to create a basic summary of the local work of the three parties elected to local government in Manchester - 57 Labour, 38 Lib Dem, and 1 Green. This could then be linked to the appropriate local Government and local party websites for further information. Our local party website, just for the record, is WWW.manchester-libdems.org.uk. Sorry about the poor editing btw, couldn't quite work it out. Iain Donaldson</li>
<li><b>Question</b> - is this a case that if one goes, the whole lot have to go?
