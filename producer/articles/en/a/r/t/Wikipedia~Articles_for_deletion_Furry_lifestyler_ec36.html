<p>Please read this carefully. At first glance, this <i>seems</i> valid, but I assure you the topic matter of furries and furry fans is not my motivation for this nomination. I have a few, please react to these arguments in your votes:</p>
<p>1.Unverifiable-- (Wikipedia policy requires all articles be verifiable) Furries are very verifiable and notable, and they have their own description at several wikipedia pages, such as <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a> and others. I argue that any information on the term furry lifestyler is unverifiable: Zero hits on LexisNexis and Google News (news search engines with archives of two years) for "furry lifestyler" Zero hits on Jstor search</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now, there is a cited "source" that I could go into the rules about using self published articles, but it turns out I don't need to, because this essay on furry fandom does not use the term "furry lifestyle" or "furry lifestyler" once. How can it be a source for an article on the term if it doesn't use the term once?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have called for and argued for verifiable sources on this page since this January.</p>
<p>2.Original Research- (Wikipedia policy requires that pages not be original research) No original research states "the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources which provide information that is directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say." Since are no sources, I don't think I need to argue this point too much. There is the self published essay, but it isn't "adhered to" since it's info is used to define a term it doesn't ever use, "furry lifestyler" or even "lifestyle." Use of published primary sources is okay, use of unpublished primary sources, forums or newsgroups before a reputable news agency has made light of them, is against policy. People who call themselves furry lifestylers have edited this page, however"policy prohibits expert editors from drawing on their personal and direct knowledge if such knowledge is unverifiable." And I believe I have established that this article is unverifiable.</p>
<p>3.Non-notable(which I know is a suggestion, not a policy for deletion)-- 366 hits on google for "furry lifestyler" in quotes. This page is, on close inspection, an attempt to describe and define posters to the furry lifestyler newsgroup. People on the talk page have described it as a sort of "everything else" newsgroup where furry fans did not discuss furry art, but other things. I can only speculate, since I have found no documentation or reliable definition of furry lifestylers. Whether or not it is a clearly defined term in real life that could have a coherent and true article written about it is questionable, but somewhat irrelevant since I believe I have proven such an article would be in violation of wikipedia policy on several points.Articles such as this are welcome at places like wikiinfo, but are put here because of the trust and popularity of wikipedia, which is of course based in the policies that are against this article. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 15:42, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>From a glance at <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a> (which in itself is a completely justifiable article), it seems to me that there are too many separate and disparate furry-related articles as it is. I don't think furries are a wide enough phenomenon (outside of a very particular subculture) to justify so many articles. This article seems to tell us little that the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a> article doesn't, with the added point that the phrase "furry lifestyler" itself doesn't, based on a Google search, appear to be in particularly popular use (and according to the article it's just a synonym for the far simpler, far more widely-used "furry"). Ergo, I can't see a reason for this particular article to exist, and would suggest <b>merging</b> any original and useful content (if there is any) into <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a>. I wouldn't even suggest a redirect, though, since the phrase just doesn't seem common enough. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 16:14, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. There certainly are people calling themselves "furry lifestylers", everyone who's involved in the furry fandom can tell you that.

<p>Policy says it's the right way to go. If you don't like wikipedia policies you don't have to contribute here. "Text that does not conform to all four policies is not allowed in the main namespace" and one of those policies is verifiability. Also, your chronology is off, a page should not be created and wait until it has been in a published source that can back up that content. That's after the fact justified original research. Another "not" entry, wikipedia is not a crystal ball. We are not meant to put up what we do not know is verifiable because we think some newspaper will back up our content or should, at some point in the future. So help me out here: What's your justification for a merge or keep? <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 22:08, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there's a difference between mentioning something and having an article about something.

<li><b>Keep</b> - valid subset of furry fandom, and merging might start a lengthy discussion that could get messy. Fact is, "furry" gets lumped together so badly by major media that it's not surprising there are no distinct references to furry lifestyle. Here's some other links: <a href="http://www.humantruth.info/furry.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.humantruth.info/furry.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as an alternate source of information that does use 'furry lifestyle'. <a href="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/ClevelandChannel5_20010506.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/ClevelandChannel5_20010506.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> refers to the 'furry' lifestyle in the title. How'bout a ref from entirely outside of the fandom citing the research mentioned in the article (Absolute Astronomy?! Huh.): <a href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/enc3/furry_lifestyler" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/enc3/furry_lifestyler" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> And <a href="http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=4869&amp;issue=904" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=4869&amp;issue=904" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which mentions the furry lifestyle, as another.

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a>, or even <b>keep</b>. (Disclaimer: I probably fit to the vague description of a "furry lifestyler", but since it's impossible to prove conclusively that I exist, please try to avoid the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology.html" title="Ontology">ontological quandry</a>.) Let's shoot this interesting deletion motion down, shall we? 1) Unverifiability: The nom's argument hinges on news media's mentions. Contrary to that, there's actually people calling themselves "furry lifestylers". Yet, you don't hear the <i>news</i> organisations calling them that. It's almost like if <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_M._Stallman_5369.html" title="Richard M. Stallman">RMS</a> said something in public and the news media said "Yesterday, a famous <i>open source evangelist</i> opened his mouth again. There were no survivors." (emphasis mine.) I'd contest this is a highly "technical" term that the news media is simply not interested about. Look for "furry fans who believe they have some connection to the animals" and you may be start finding something.<br />
2) OR/Sources: I admit full well this is on much shakier ground. The article <i>does</i> cite the origin of the term (namely, discussions in Usenet) and the existence of an actual Usenet discussion group alt.lifestyle.furry. If you dig through the Google Groups archives, you'll probably found wealth of information on the particular culture - when I followed the group, they had FAQs posted periodically (<a href="http://www.tigerden.com/infopage/furry/lifestyle.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.tigerden.com/infopage/furry/lifestyle.txt" rel="nofollow">actual copy of the FAQ</a>), and had frequent user surveys. Some actual research to this phenomenon or media mentions would be extremely sweet, <i>that</i> I agree. But I'd like to say what verifiability policy said last I checked: Extraordinary claims need extraordinary proof. We don't need extraordinary proof to establish the <i>existence</i> and even <i>extent</i> of furry lifestylers. <i>Details</i> may be a bit more different.<br />
3) Notability: I really wonder if Google is broken with these searches, I remember the lifestyler activity being fairly active =) I concur this may be a little bit of a fringey stuff to be mentioned in an article of its own, but it <i>is</i> a notable phenomenon <i>within</i> furry fandom. Thus, I'd be cool to have a merge at least; and hey, there's always WikiFur for this kind of stuff. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:57, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Lack of Google News or LexisNexis articles does not mean a lack of significance, and I think the argument for deletion is artificially downplaying the significance. Wikipedia's benchmark for significance is Google, not Google News. A Google search on "furry lifestyler" brings up "about 8,390" hits (369 for exact phrase), and "furry lifestyle" has "about 619,000" (604 for exact phrase). So much for notability. Among them I have found citations that can be incorporated into the article (and I'll do so when I get the chance), such as <a href="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/ClevelandChannel5_20010506.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/ClevelandChannel5_20010506.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and <a href="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/Tennessean/47865895.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/Tennessean/47865895.shtml" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> (which explains the difference between furry lifestylers and furry fandom). It appears to me that there's not so much a lack of citations as that no one got around to finding them or has been motivated to. You're not going to find them merely in Google News because it doesn't keep articles around indefinitely. You shouldn't base deletion proposals on looking only where the light is better. <a href="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" class="image" title="Image:Tycon.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/c/c1/Tycon.jpg" alt="Image:Tycon.jpg" width="25" height="21" longdesc="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" /></a><b><a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoyoty_72ae.html" title="User:Coyoty">Coyoty</a></b> 19:39, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Self published articles do not qualify as sources. Moreover, some of the links that y'all provided don't use the term furry lifestyler. The reason why furry lifestyle without quotes gets so many hits is because every day of the week a lifestyle column in a paper prints a story about "our furry friends the squirrels" or similar. Calling furry fandom a lifestyle is not evidence for the usage of the neologism "furry lifestyler". None of you have provided any suggestion that the article is not unverifiable through reputable sources, as I have said. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 21:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A Cleveland television news channel report is self-published? A Tennessee newspaper article is self-published? That's what those links are to, <b>mainstream news articles</b>. Either you didn't bother to read their provenance, or you are lying about accepting good citations. "The Tennessean" specifically uses the term "lifestyler", but you are trying to claim the articles don't say anything about them. "There is a distinction, they say, between the people who enjoy the costuming aspects of the culture and <i>lifestylers,</i> who incorporate their animals into their lives in a more spiritual way." I don't know how much clearer that can be. Or the Cleveland News 5 article title, "Group Celebrates 'Furry' Lifestyle". You are setting extraordinary criteria in order to dismiss the citations you asked for and probably did not expect to get.

<dd>So you feel that any source that does not use the word "furry lifestyler" directly next to one another, despite that last one in the Tennessean referring to "lifestyler" in the context of discussing "furry," as well as other similar references, is unqualified to be considered in this discussion? My apologies, but you're doing a very fine job of splitting hairs here. Editors have presented a large number of new references, including to mass media outlets, that quite obviously refer to the furry lifestyle. I'm certain the administrator who looks over this discussion when time comes to close it will consider those favourably. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 00:01, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article nominated for deletion is not furry as a lifestyle choice(as is the article you mention), but the neologism "furry lifestyler" and some spurious definitions and qualifications on it. The article does not, as you say, refer to "lifestyler" but lifestyles. An article on womens' lifestyles would not justify a wikipedia entry on the term "Woman lifestyler." It happens to have some of the same words, or similar words to the article furry lifestyler, but does not validate any information therein. Your "large number of sources" is only that one article, and many self published websites, which are not allowed as sources as a matter of policy. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. But the article has not been deleted yet. If the claims in the article can be sourced, go to the article and source them. If there are mass media sources that differentiate a furry lifestyler from a furry fan, as the article purports, I'd like to see them. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 00:52, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The wiki article is about defining "furry lifestylers" as 25 different things, fans or fursuiters or people that don't want to be called fans or fursuiters. I'm hard pressed to think that the article is definitively, or clearly about anything at all.

<dd>It's analogous to the difference between Trek fandom and devoting one's life to Vulcan or Klingon philosphy and traditions. Or better yet, lifestylers are the furry equivalent of the Society for Creative Anachronism. Those examples are inexact, though, as a lifestyler may point out. It's more of a zen thing. <a href="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" class="image" title="Image:Tycon.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/c/c1/Tycon.jpg" alt="Image:Tycon.jpg" width="25" height="21" longdesc="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" /></a><b><a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoyoty_72ae.html" title="User:Coyoty">Coyoty</a></b> 04:40, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Make Article Redirect to Furry Fandom and Move Content. Then revamp furry articles for verifiability and published sources</b> - I thought furry lifestyler and furry fandom or at least one were up for deletion upon a time and I know there's been merger votes. I don't remember the results. Anyway, furry lifestyler and fandom seem about the same thing and the fandom has a lot of different types of furries--nobody can agree on which is which and there's tons of debates on it, such as sexual aspects are always a big debate. For my revamp thing, there's a good trend on controversial wikipedia articles for every bit of info has to have verifiable sources that can be found to state what the info is. Furry articles are full of debate about what is what and all info needs reliable sources (wikipedia says something like news media and puplished academic research? Well that sort of thing). Most of the sources are "in my experience, furries are like this and there's not like this." I personally think Wikifur does a much better job than the furry articles here because it is more inclusive. So basically I can't grasp a clear difference between fandom and lifestyler so I say merge, and furry articles are controversial so they need everything there supported by sources that meet wikipedia's standards for sources and not personal experience like the article is now. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 03:26, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No - very much no. The distinction is pretty obscure, but can be summarized thus: The otherkin community is more or less defined by a belief that one existed as some form of mythological creature in a previous life. The furry community is a bit more fuzzily defined, but can be generally lumped together as people who identify with animals to some degree or another. There's significant crossover between the two groups, but they are emphatically not identical. A person who believes they are the second coming of Dracula is probably not a furry, and a person who likes to draw anthropomorphic foxes isn't necessarily an otherkin. That all being said, though, I still find the distinction between the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a> as a whole and the concept of the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_lifestyler.html" title="Furry lifestyler">furry lifestyler</a> unnecessarily narrow; as such, my vote to merge stands. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 10:28, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I dont believe the common furry has the whole spiritual and body mod thing going on, granted this is lacking in quantity of information, its simply a topic that realy does not have a lot of reaserch done on it. so lets say someone wants to learn about the whole furry lifestyler thing, its got enoff difference that it should be its own thing otherwise that person is going to have to sift through all the regular furry stuff just to find the info they need. i say keep it and work on improving the quality and quantity of info. also just because SOMEONE does not like the idea of this lifesyle does not mean it should be deleted. i bet you just dont want to incurr the wrath or any other alternitive lifestyles so you pick on an obscure one.-me-06/04/06 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 192.18.128.13 (<a href="../../../1/9/2/User_talk%7E192.18.128.13.html" title="User talk:192.18.128.13">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.18.128.13_3e31.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.18.128.13">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
