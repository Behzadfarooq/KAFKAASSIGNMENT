<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Sorry, but I disagree. The article doesn't seem to be promoting anything... it talks about Chrismukkah.com in an attempt to establish a point about the term Chrismukkah. Also, this goes beyond <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, because although the specific term Chrismukkah may be new and not in heavy usage, the practice of fusing Christmas and Hanukkah in interfaith households is a legit topic, and I'm not sure where else it should be covered (though if it's already discussed elsewhere, redirection may be an option). This does need cleaning up and sourcing, but in my view that's an achievable goal for this article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:57, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Don't you people watch <i>The O.C.</i>? And I'm from a mixed family and we totally call our Holidays Chrismukkah. Not that that's evidence, but you know... <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJengod_485b.html" title="User:Jengod">jengod</a> 19:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> A rather poor article, but on a appropriate topic <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:17, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not the place for things that are not notable yet but may be in the future. The assertion that this general topic of fusing holidays is inherently notable a) needs a source in and of itself and b) doesn't mean that this particular article is legit.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 19:22, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reluctant Keep.</b> However much this article reads as a vehicle for the website and however much the very concept turns my stomach, there's been mainstream media play, and that much has been sourced. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:43, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The assertion that this is a valid holiday is false and while there are references, the content of these is more to talk about interfaith households and December holidays, not to reinforce the use of the word "Chrismukkah." Let's not confuse the concept of households celebrating both Christmas and Chanukah with thinking that there is such a thing as "Chrismukkah" beyond a few pop culture references. I might be inclined to keep, only if the article were changed significantly to mention that the term exists specifically as a pop culture refence as per <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJengod_485b.html" title="User:Jengod">jengod</a>'s note. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 12:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The problem is that "I don't agree with it" isn't a valid reason to delete an article; our job isn't to weigh in on the advocacy issue or whether this is a "valid holiday" (and how is that defined?) one way or another. The issue is whether the subject meets verification and notability standards. Unfortunately, it does. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:08, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Understood. But the article as written, with the intro, "Chrismukkah is the modern-day merging of the holidays of Christianity's Christmas and Judaism's Hanukkah as celebrated in interfaith households where one parent may be of Christian heritage and another parent of Jewish heritage." is so far removed from an accurate description of what it should be that the entire intent of the article is missing. It should be: "Chrismukkah is a term coined in some early twentieth century popular culture references to describe the merging of the holidays of Christianity's Christmas and Judaism's Hanukkah as celebrated in interfaith households where one parent may be of Christian heritage and another parent of Jewish heritage." and take it from there. What I object to is the creation of an article as a statement of fact when in reality -- see comment from <a href="../../../s/h/l/User%7EShlomke_975f.html" title="User:Shlomke">Shlomke</a> below, we are really just taking a neologism and declaring it to be an actual entity. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 01:28, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Another comment</b> You might look at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrismahanukwanzakah.html" title="Chrismahanukwanzakah">Chrismahanukwanzakah</a> which opens with the statement that it is "a fictional holiday" and references Chrismukkah as another fictional holiday. This article should be treated the same way. I'd be willing to change my vote to <b>Keep and edit</b> if we can agree on that. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 01:38, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as for better or worse the term is in use due to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interreligious_marriage.html#The_demographic_crisis" title="Interreligious marriage">intermarriage</a>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:54, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as seems to violate <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. Wikipedia should not be the place to coin new terms. Perhaps the subject can be covered by a different article name. <a href="../../../s/h/l/User%7EShlomke_975f.html" title="User:Shlomke">Shlomke</a> 17:06, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have to echo Jengod: don't you guys watch The OC? I don't watch it myself, but I'm still very familiar with the Chrismukkah name and concept simply from surrounding media coverage. There are 90,300 Google hits for "chrismukkah -oc", most of which don't seem to be directly related to the show, and it's very easy to imagine that someone would look up the phrase here for more information. I also added two citations (both from 12/04) to the article yesterday. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPropaniac_b94b.html" title="User:Propaniac">Propaniac</a> 17:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> and <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a>. <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> is not an adequate reason to delete, the term appears enough in pop culture to be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS" class="extiw" title="w:RS">reliably sourced</a>. Agree, however, that article should be clearer to describe the origins of the term as arising in pop culture rather than religion, although agree that the term has sometimes been used in the context of issues of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interreligious_marriage.html" title="Interreligious marriage">intermarriage</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> You might be able to argue that the article could discuss the subject under a different title, but the term "Chrismukkah" is used widely enough that even then, it would still make sense to redirect "Chrismukkah" to that article. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 10:06, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
