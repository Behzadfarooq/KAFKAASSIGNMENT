<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. This article is heavily puppet-infested, and going over it gives a strong "delete" flavour. Most puppet-infested AfDs have ended up as "deletes" earlier too.

<li><b>Keep</b> Seemed pretty easy to document all the sources if I did it right.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikki_Lee_Travolta" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikki_Lee_Travolta" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Easy to find tons of references to family, career, everything. It was fun and not that hard. I wouldn't delete it at all. Apparently John Travolta only has a half-brother named Michael, which might be the cause of all this commotion. Once I stumbled on that discovery it was easy to see the glaring fact that the listing of John Travolta's siblings specifies not total number of siblings, but total number of siblings from the union of Salvatore Travolta and Helen Burke <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Travolta" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Travolta" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Big difference when you look at it in that light. References in all the press to Rikki Lee Travolta are all to grandfather being Salvatore Travolta and father being born outside US (as in shamed outside of marital grounds pregnancy). No mention to Grandmother being Helen Burke. That is further hit home in the brand new category by Arniep Travolta Family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Travolta_family" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Travolta_family" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> that again stipulates only decedents of the union of Salvatore Travolta and Helen Burke Travolta. That would exclude any half siblings and descendents. I suggest Rikki Lee Travolta be kept and category "Travolta Family" should be changed to "Travolta-Burke Family"? <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingJamesCav_b946.html" title="User:KingJamesCav">KingJamesCav</a> 05:33, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

I agree that there is an awful lot of terrible self promotion and that the article should be cleaned.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I started the Annie Travolta page and have been a contributor to many of the Travolta family pages including Margaret Travolta, Rikki Lee Travolta, Annie Travolta, and John Travolta. Many of those changes are reverting vandalism. It is right there in the history. There is no way, shape, or form that could remotely be confused as being in an “advertising scam”. I have NEVER removed members of the Travolta family from listings. I have worked hard to keep the integrity in tact. I think upon closer inspection you’ll see there was an influx of attempts by an anon (66.121.40.132) to vandalizing different Travolta family sites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.121.40.132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.121.40.132" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> (changing facts without providing sources or citations). When the anon seemed to be starting a revert war with different users I followed Wiki policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revert_war" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revert_war" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>and contacted them on their discussion page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:66.121.40.132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:66.121.40.132" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> to request documentation for the changes being made.</li>

<dd><i>Its been noticed that you have made several repeated changes to the family elements of the John Travolta page and related pages. The policy at Wikipedia is to try to avoid revert wars going back and forth over the same territory. As follows are what we have confirmed as members of the Travolta family: Margaret Travolta, John Travolta, Ellen Travolta, Joey Travolta, Rikki Lee Travolta; Jack Bannon, Rachel Travolta, Nicole Travolta, Michael Salvatore Travolta, Helen (Burke) Travolta, Kelly Preston, Salvatore Travolta, Molly Allen Ritter, Jonathan Rau, Jet Travolta, Tom Fridley, Sam Travolta, Ella Blue Travolta, Valentino Travolta, and Annie Travolta. This is not an all inclusive list, but all those listed are confirmed. In respecting Wikipedia policy it is always necessary to approach differences of opinion in good faith. Although we have documented each of these individuals as relatives (of different levels of removal or closeness of course) within the extended Travolta family, ff you disagree with any person(s) on this list please provide the documentation and we should be able to come to a simple understanding relatively quickly (no pun intended). We thank you in advance for your cooperation.</i></dd>

<dd>Firstly, the TV guide link says "<i>There's also some kind of grassroots campaign on behalf of singer/theater actor Rikki Lee Travolta</i>". A grassroots campaign led by who??? Secondly the Chicago Sun Times link is inexplicably not at the Chicago Sun Times website. Thirdly, the person you contacted had removed Rikki Lee Travolta from all the Travolta pages saying "<i>Rikki Lee is not part of this clan</i>" you then reverted them (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.121.40.132_8c42.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.121.40.132">Special:Contributions/66.121.40.132</a>).

<dd>THERE'S a strange postscipt to our item the other day about the Internet rumor that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have created a computer-generated actor called "Rikki Lee Travolta." A rather odd actor named Rikki Lee Travolta does in fact exist, and held a press conference in Chicago Tuesday to prove it. "It's good to be alive," he stated. "I am an actor. I am a human being." Travolta, who is of Italian and Native American extraction and claims some family connection with John Travolta, appeared in "West Side Story" on Broadway. He wrote a novel, sports a gunshot wound and claims a doctorate in religious studies. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Bottom line, no matter if he's related to John Travolta or not, how does anything he's done make him notable enough for an article? I am on record as having had strong disagreements with Arniep in the past, but he cares about Wikipedia. It sounds to me like these "sources" are all bits that came from a very good publicist. So again we get into my own problem, which is what Wikipedia considers a good source. Just because something's in print doesn't make it so. And Rikki Lee Travolta has publicity mill written all over him. I don't know the criteria for putting a person in Wikipedia - but if there is criteria, on that alone, I vote for deletion.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChandler75_a033.html" title="User:Chandler75">Chandler75</a> 22:32, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You actually cannot put in a fake film on imdb - their criteria and the information they required is strict and verifiable - but it probably was an independent, right to DVD movie. Anyone who has worked in a film gets an imdb profile and will have verifiable credits listed. The bio, however, can be written by the person, a friend, a publicist, and can make all sorts of outrageous claims. There is still nothing that makes him noted enough for a bio on Wikipedia.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChandler75_a033.html" title="User:Chandler75">Chandler75</a> 01:32, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

In 2000 I submitted to the IMDB the full cast and credits of the film "The Prophecy 3" (with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Walken_2eec.html" title="Christopher Walken">Christopher Walken</a>). However, I added actress <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linnea_Quigley_ad62.html" title="Linnea Quigley">Linnea Quigley</a> to the cast, as playing a character I labelled "Hooker". The IMDB put her in along with everyone else. The credit is still there today, and will no doubt stay. Quigley was actually asked about how it was working with Walken in an interview! The best part? She said she didn't remember if she was in the movie, and she thought she might have been! That's how reliable your IMDB is. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackO%27Lantern_5fea.html" title="User:JackO'Lantern">JackO'Lantern</a> 01:37, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If the actor has an imdb profile and the film is real, I suppose you can put someone in the cast who wasn't there because they could have been cut. I have independent films on DVD on my desk that I can't get on the imdb site, and I was a guest on 7 episodes of a TV show and can't get my own name on the episode lists that I myself added (I'm not currently on imdb as a "name" only as a contributor).<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChandler75_a033.html" title="User:Chandler75">Chandler75</a> 02:32, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously, there must have been some first-time actors in a video movie like Prophecy 3. And obviously, the IMDB would have accepted them and created profiles for them, if say, I had submitted them as part of the whole cast, like I did Quigley. So it is fairly easy to create a first-time actor, and "maintain" them, if you submit a bunch of reliable looking credits for films. You can find Quigley's reaction (funny because it reflects the reality of the video horror industry) to being asked about the film in this interview, <a href="http://www.horror-asylum.com/frameset.asp?page=http%3A//72.14.207.104/search%3Fq%3Dcache%3A7jNCVNqo_n4J%3Awww.horror-asylum.com/interview/specials/screamqueens/linneaquigley/interview.asp+%2522Linnea+Quigley%2522+Prophecy%26hl%3Den%26gl%3Dca%26ct%3Dclnk%26cd%3D6" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.horror-asylum.com/frameset.asp?page=http%3A//72.14.207.104/search%3Fq%3Dcache%3A7jNCVNqo_n4J%3Awww.horror-asylum.com/interview/specials/screamqueens/linneaquigley/interview.asp+%2522Linnea+Quigley%2522+Prophecy%26hl%3Den%26gl%3Dca%26ct%3Dclnk%26cd%3D6" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackO%27Lantern_5fea.html" title="User:JackO'Lantern">JackO'Lantern</a> 02:39, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There have been fake films added to IMDb before and also ones that were announced but never made or released. They generally get deleted if evidence accrues that it never existed or is not going to be made. <i>Black the Ripper</i> was deleted I think after a TV Guide column in which people who were supposed to have been involved with it were interviewed, and entries for the 4th and 5th <i>Return of the Living Dead</i> movies disappeared and reappeared as it went through development hell. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 15:52, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't like him? I don't know who he is! Even Wikipedia with its rather loose "legitimate references" I don't think considers publicity items and "high googles" legitimate. Now, if you want to make a case for him being notable as an ersatz celebrity who launches wild publicity campaigns and self-publishes a bio as if he's already established as the next James Dean, you may have a point.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChandler75_a033.html" title="User:Chandler75">Chandler75</a> 02:44, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, then I'd like my own page. I've had three books published, had my own weekly column in an international magazine, and have appeared on stage and television -more than Rikki Lee. I also generate more hits than he does since I now write a daily column. I'll add to my website that I was considered for a Bond girl, claim to be Madonna's cousin, and we're good to go. If someone tried to write me up and submit me for an article here, I think it would be proposed for deletion - probably by Arnie!

<dd>I worded that a little wrong. What I meant by "might be fake" is that it (the Bond rumor)might have been self-promoted by him. Still though, he has over 20,000 google hits, and while it's hard to find one true reason to give him an article, it's hard to find a reason to get rid of it completely. He seems to be a guy that puts up a facade about himself, definitely.

<p>I’m going to start by following the guidelines and announcing for the whole wide world that I have contributed to editing the Rikki Lee Travolta wikipedia page. This is the point that I get attacked for having contributed to the Rikki Lee Travolta wikipedia page and it should somehow disqualify me from voting on whether it should be deleted or not. See, there’s a flaw there. I contributed. I have an active interest. I have an established knowledge that proceeds this debate. Therefore it makes full sense that I should cast a vote.</p>
<p>In fact, the wikipedia guidelines specifically state that when someone submits a page for deletion the principle contributers should be notified for the very reason that their input would be valuable. To go one step further the wikipedia guidelines actual encourage notifying the key contributors prior to submitting a deletion nomination so see if a simple fix is possible.</p>
<p>Guess what? I was never contacted. I stumbled on the fact all this kangaroo kourt business is going on when someone changed a page I was watching that I contributed to and I followed the links back to here. Boy was I surprised.</p>
<p>Guess what else? I did a little research in following talk links. Not only was this page put up for deletion without notifying me, who admittedly only did a few edits, but NOBODY who made ANY positive comments or contributions was contacted. That’s not the policy.</p>
<p>Wait? You mean this little kangaroo kourt might not be on the up and up. No! Don’t say it.</p>
<p>Guess what else? There people contacted, it seems everyone who had something negative to contribute at any point in history was contacted and encouraged and invited to come vote for deletion.</p>
<p>AND, everyone who voted to keep the page was contacted and encouraged to change their vote.</p>
<p>Not understand that I don’t particularly give a poppycock whether the page stays or goes, but it should be done by the rules. When someone is so committed to fast-tracking a kangaroo kourt deletion that they lie, sock puppet, and break rules left and right then something is wrong with the picture.</p>
<p>I made a point on the discussion page. The attacker is misrepresenting all his or her opinions as fact and then disregarding the true facts because he/she doesn’t like them.</p>
<p>The wikipedia site is referenced. It points to documented sources. Good hard news sources.</p>
<p>The attackers seem to make up quotes and expect them to believed. The mention parts of articles and leave off the parts that they don’t like – you know, the parts with facts in them.</p>
<p>You have hundreds of thousands of sources stating Rikki Lee Travolta is John Travolta’s nephew. The attacker says none of them count because one article in the Chicago Sun Times stated he is not. In fact the Sun Times went back and corrected that statement, but the attacker leave that part out…just like the attacker leaves off that the article in question that they are claiming is the one true fact out of hundreds of thousands of counter-articles is all about the guy being the star of syndicated television series. Why leave that part out of the quote? Not because that part would make the guy notable – right? That would be unfair. That would be breaking the rules.</p>
<p>The attacker lists 2006 sales figures for a 2002 book Travolta wrote. In 2002 Amazon had it as a Top 25 recommendation. (I couldn’t find the Top 10 proof but there are were more than enough Top 25 references). In 2003 there was a New York Times Best Seller named “Dad, Dames, Demons and a Dwarf” by radio personality Mancow Muller. In 2006 it’s sales figures are a worse ranking than Travolta’s book. That doesn’t mean the books weren’t popular in their day.</p>
<p>I read all these comments. Every time someone voices a positive opinion, the attacker (or appropriate puppet) jumps in and bashes and trashes with no facts, just accusations and falsehoods.</p>
<p>Do you need to be told what your opinion is? I don’t.</p>
<p>Attack me. I don’t care. At least I can stand by my opinion and interpret facts without being swayed by bullying attacks.</p>
<p>Fact: 2 albums Fact: Nominated for Grammy Fact: Movie credits Fact: TV credits Fact: Ranked in top 5 in world as star of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat by Broadway World News Fact: Member of Travolta Family Fact: He wrote a novel that was really popular in its time. Fact: A movie company is making the book into a movie Fact: Was reported around the world as possible James Bond Fact: Check the current news and there’s articles about him. Fact: Google hits over 20,000</p>
<p>I don’t care what you decide. I don’t care how you vote. But the vote on facts, not how some joker wants to sway you to vote just to prove he or she knows more than you do. ~ Bostic5.0 05:49, 8 April 2006 (UTC) <small>This user's only edits have been to this article or to add this person's name to other pages.

I was only just notified by another. editor because of other actions by this person. Votes to keep have been attacked and bullied. He has gone out to recruit and ask people to come vote to delete.

<dd>As someone who has been on the opposite side of Arniep, I will tell you that your recruitment theory is incorrect. He asked me only, as someone involved in film and theater research, to see what I could learn about Rikki Lee's career. He never once asked me to vote or put my opinions on this page. These accusations you bring are nothing new for Arniep, but as in the case I was involved in, they're also not true. I will agree that sometimes he has a way of doing things that seem to stomp all over other views, but this is a discussion about whether or not this person warrants an article in Wikipedia at this time, nothing else. It doesn't mean that if it's deleted now, there will not be an article at a future date.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am proud to have been the editor to start the Joey Travolta page. I know a lot about the Travolta family. I have contributed as an editor to the Rikki Lee Travolta page. Undoubtedly Rikki Lee Travolta is a real person, is related to Joey, Ellen, John, Maggie, Sam, Annie, Tommy, Jonathan, Rachel, Jet, so on and so forth on and on et al.... That is not and should not be his claim to fame. He is an accomplished actor, well known and well respected. Clearly "Arniep" (and his pseudonyms) has an issue with Rikki Lee Travolta and is making a personal attack. I've looked at his contributions. He has gone recruiting to get people to vote 'Delete'. See the warning at the top of the page. Ballot stuffing shouldn't be the goal. The truth should be the goal. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the article. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcemountain2_86ea.html" title="User:Icemountain2">Icemountain2</a> 22:03, 8 April 2006 (UTC) <small>This user's only edits have been to this article or to add this person's name to other pages.

<li><b>Delete</b> This smells like a mix of well done self promotion (of a real but non-notable person. see <a href="http://www.arty.com/creative_team.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.arty.com/creative_team.htm" rel="nofollow">photo</a>) with a dash of hoax that has sucked in a few publishers and journo's. And the influx of orchestrated puppeteering rings warning bells to me. -- <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanbrown_eb80.html" title="User:Ianbrown">Ian</a> ≡ <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanbrown_5157.html" title="User talk:Ianbrown">talk</a> 15:18, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with the bulk of the above comments. Appears to be self-promotion for a non-notable person whose famous familial links are tenuous at best. None of the reference links appear to be anything other than personal PR on the part of this person. 70.60.149.226 15:43, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am not certain if I am in fact allowed a vote. I contributed in the past to the Rikki Lee Article in minor fashion. I do not consider myself of any ranking of expertise. The dialogue presented in these proceedings suggests all parties who have contributed to the article in question or any article concerning a member of the Travolta family is not qualified, nor allowed, to register a vote for consideration in this discussion. That said, revue of the governing ordinances suggests otherwise. If my vote is allowed, so be it. If it is not, please disregard it. I was not advised of these proceedings by the instigator the nomination as is suggested by governing ordinances but upon notification by 3rd party via talk/discussion I have voluntarily added myself to the proceedings in effort towards positive resolution. I have done a modicum of research towards adding references to information contained within the article in question. References now exceed 30, which in comparison to other articles is clearly indicative of a larger than is usual. I hope this information should prove useful. If not, no offense taken. <a href="../../../c/o/k/User%7ECokenotpepsi_d43f.html" title="User:Cokenotpepsi">Cokenotpepsi</a> 04:17, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You are not forbidden from expressing your opinion, but this is not a vote. The fact that you have never made any edit that did not relate to Rikki Lee Travolta does have some bearing on your credibility. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 04:49, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The problem is that very if any of the references count as reliable source. For example, if you look at the claim he is being considered for the role of Thor, you have four citations but they all trace back to a single announcement by ComicBoards.com. The book <i>My Fractured Life</i> has never been mentioned in a major newspaper or magazine either as a book review or in connection with the alleged movie deal. His IMDB entry was written by his personal manager. And so on. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rikki_Lee_Travolta_3569.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Rikki Lee Travolta">Wikipedia Talk:Articles for deletion/Rikki Lee Travolta</a> for more information. On the flip side, I am curious as to how it comes to pass that at least eight people join wikipedia in November, 2005; only edit articles about Rikki Lee Travolta, and never edit any other articles until his article is challenged. At the very least, it is a staggering example of <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synchronicity.html" title="Synchronicity">Synchronicity</a> and I'm sure the eight of you have an awful lot to talk about (if you don't know each other already.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:16, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, apologies if I'm repeating what someone else said about (there are a lot of comments to read through up there) but I went to the imdb page for "Twilight Serenade" and I have to say there is something a bit off about it. If you click on all of the names of the people purported to be in the cast of this movie, every single person in this movie, with two exceptions, has <i>exactly one role in their entire lives ever</i>, and of those two, one has other credits as gay porn, and the other has a credit as an "Ewok". Now, I'm sure it's possible that a movie existed and every single person in the cast did that one exact movie and then disappeared, but this seems really fishy to me. Of course, aside from all this, <b>delete</b> in any case because this is unnotability at its finest. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 04:22, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I am totally astonished by this. Not all the refs are to IMDb: look at <a href="http://chicago.about.com/cs/events1/a/Fabio_Travolta.htm" class="external text" title="http://chicago.about.com/cs/events1/a/Fabio_Travolta.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a> or <a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/cgi-bin/news/newsbrief.plx?id=2240162384&amp;fa=1" class="external text" title="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/cgi-bin/news/newsbrief.plx?id=2240162384&amp;fa=1" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, for instance. For me to believe that this is an elaborate hoax strains credibility; I can't begin to imagine how a person could manage such a thing. And yet there is indeed something quite odd about it all, and the idea that he is a exceptionally prolific self-promoter also seems totally plausible. I could not possibly vote on this as I have absolutely no idea whether the article is entirely true, partially true, or entirely false. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:15, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: If there is doubt, if there is murkiness in the references, then, <i>as an encyclopedia,</i> we don't include it. Let's be simple about this: Wikipedia is not a primary source. If the person is a great astroturfer, then his fame will last only as long as the electrons fly, which isn't long. Until there are real and inarguable roles of substance, there is no article. Remember that anyone who thinks that advertising on Wikipedia is a good move is already failing at art, music, business, or life (one of the new Geogre's Laws). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:21, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
