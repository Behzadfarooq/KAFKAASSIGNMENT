<li>I did something even better, I wikilinked OIC to its wikipedia article. This way, there is no need to bog down the opening paragraph with statistics, as everything you want to know about the OIC is one click away. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 18:29, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It does matter a great deal and that is why I am saying it at this AFD page instead of article talk page. When we say two things FACT-1 <a href="../../../o/i/c/OIC_56f1.html" title="OIC">OIC</a> has all Muslim majorty countries and FACT-2 same <a href="../../../o/i/c/OIC_56f1.html" title="OIC">OIC</a> recognize <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_mosque_627e.html" title="Al-Aqsa mosque">Al-Aqsa mosque</a> as third holiest site. Then why this article should remain kept? To annoy all the Muslims or to achieve some other hidden objectives. If you do not want to change it back I will request someone else. I believe there are still neutral persons in wikipedia and someone can do that edit for me. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 18:35, 17 November 2006 (UTC
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately in your case, wikipedia is not a vehicle for disseminating the opinions of the OIC. The OIC carries significant weight, which is why it is the only organization mentioned in the lead of the article, but as there are plenty of reliably sourced and verified statements that there are valid alternatives, to delete it because <b>you</b> do not like it is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Similarly, adding extra sentences in the lead to (not-so-subtly) try to push one POV over another would also be a violation of NPOV. The OIC is given the weight it deserves by being in the lead. Our job here is <b>not</b> to appease the worlds Jews, Muslims, Christians, or animists; but to create a fair, impartial encyclopedia that bring suitably notable, reliable, and verifiable sources as devoid as possible from the specter of editor bias, <b>and let the reader decide, and not decide for them.</b> Threatening to violate wikipedia policy by using another editor is not an appropriate step in the dispute resolution process.

<li>I have been here since a year and never get banned or even treated like that.

Which I just have done in above post and I have not post any request in some user talk page. I know WP better than you and you do not have to tell me to read something. I hope your wish to ban me will be soon fulfull so that you could sleep at night.

You seem not to understand wikipedia as well as you claim. 3RR warnings are given to people to <i>prevent</i> them from violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. You do not have to be a sysop to give the warning, that is what <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a> is for. There was no threat anywhere about banning, unless you have a guitly conscience, perhaps. Also, doing it again here? Can you point it out to me? I merely said that <i>your</i> threatening to violate wiki rules by enlisting the help of others is not a step in the wikipedia <a href="../../../d/p/r/WP%7EDPR_0351.html" title="WP:DPR">dispute resolution</a> process. I fail to see a threat against you. Also, you should read up a bit about the difference between a <b>ban</b> and a <b>block</b>, you are interchanging the two improperly. <s>But, as I mentioned earlier, I am finding it harder and harder to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> based on your proven track record of misquoting cittations, adding POV's, delivering threats, misunderstanding editors, and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">lack of civil</a> replies to those who would attempt to talk with you reasonably; but I will continue to try. So, I would suggest that 1) you may wish to study up a bit on wiki policies and guidelines more, as I think it is <b>you</b> who may not have a full understanding of the many policies of wikipedia and how they apply and interrelate, and also the definitions of various terms such as ban, block, 3RR, NPOV, RS, CITE, CIVIL, NPA, etc. Secondly, I think you should relax a bit about the block; it's very simple, no sysop should ban anyone unless guidelines and policies were violated, although warnings <b>should</b> be applied for the education of the editor and for tracking for sysop purposes (e.g. new users should not be blocked for WP:3RR without sufficient warning, etc.).</s> Lastly, I think you should once again read about the <b>purpose</b> of wikipedia, and how it is not to push one POV over another, but to provide a fair, impartial encyclopedia that brings suitably notable, reliable, and verifiable sources as free as possible from NPOV. You have much to offer, but please do so in accordance with policy. Thank you. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Conditional keep, based on cleanup</b> Further research for me has shown that while there exists disagreement over the identity of the site, academic support in English is weak. I've removed most of the "tourist-guide" stuff, but I'd prefer to see the article be culled from more obvious POV mentions and stick with the sites that are actually considered such as Imam ALi and Hala Sultan. At this point, I most probably could live with a <b>redirect</b> to Islamic holy sites with the following two caveats 1) The notable entries here are brought there in their entirety, without hiding or deleting the information, and 2) if more notable information is found, that the article get recreated as a non-POV fork per <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">summary style</a> -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 14:32, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If that is a dispute between Shia/Sunni then many Shia should be editing here and voting for keep. Where are they? I found no Shai but only people related to Israel editing there. Obviously, we all Muslim think Jerusalem as our third holiest site and very important for Muslims and it used to be our first Kaba. In the early days of Islam prior to the <a href="../../../h/i/j/Hijra_%28Islam%29_85e0.html" title="Hijra (Islam)">hijra</a> and until the beginning of the seventh month after hijra Muslims offered salat facing towards Jerusalem. <sup id="_ref-james_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-james" title="">[1]</a></sup> . These people related to Israel want to make it disputed using fake media/travel-websites sources. Those sources are already discussed in above AFD. Do you think the article name is right? <b>Third holiest site in Islam..</b>??? Should we also create articles about <b>First holiest site in Islam</b>, <b>Second holiest site in Islam</b>, <b>Fourth holiest site in Islam</b>, <b>Fifth holiest site in Islam</b> and so on? All Muslims in last AFD have voted to delete the article hence apparently they do not think the information mentioned in this article is right. Which Shia is fighting to keeping this article? However, some people <s>like <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a></s> who had never worked in any Islamic article and active in Jews article become interested in this one? Mostly Jew editors in last AFD voted for Keep. Do not you smell that something here is extremely wrong and they have created this article to deny Jerusalem importance in Muslims eyes? Oh I should be stupid and continue to assuming <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> despite all the things I see open and clear?

Keeping all the sites lumped together like this as if the respective assertions from various sources were all of equal value or weight seems to me, on its face, to be a misapplication of the NPOV policy, if a well-intended one by most of the editors who worked on improving this article.

Please ensure that nominations to delete an article which was previously voted "keep", are carefully considered, and are based upon policy. Repeated attempts to have an article deleted for non-policy reasons may sometimes be considered abuse of process and/or disruptive, and the article may be speedy kept.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> As a phrase, it has been used, but it isn't notable, and has the added problem of being completely unreliable depending on your brand of Islamic paganism, your historical point (at one point, Mohammed had his followers bowing to Jerusalem instead of Mecca for example), and a host of other factors. Not worth having, and if any articles explicitly claim a location to be "the third holiest site in Islam", that is a factual inaccuracy that needs correcting too. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 19:17, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> to List of major Islamic holy sites. To me, there seems to be two seperate articles here trying to be born. The first article, which probably doesn't deserve to exist, is about the expression 'third holiest site' and its use and abuse, a bit like the expression 8th wonder of the world, which does not seem to have a page. The second article is the list of sites, with just one line of information about each site, and maybe a picture for some of the most important sites.

<li><b>Keep</b> Rightly or wrongly, controversial or not, the term is often used in the American media to describe the Al-Aqsa Mosque. If this assignation is not controversial, the phrase should a redirect to that Mosque -- it seems to be controversial, though, and thus the a full article is warranted. The reason that "first holiest" and "second holiest" do not merit full article is that those phrases are not commonplace in the media (at least AFAIK, if they are elsewhere, then we <i>should</i> have articles for them.) Mecca and Medina are the subject of less Western media coverage than Jerusalem, given the media's obsession with conflict. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:34, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, there is no question that anyone who is expert on Islamic subjects will find this article confusing. For every article, there should be some information that is conceived and passed. Based on my experience working on this article, and based on other comments made by other editors, I can give the following comments:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1- Some editors think that the message from this article, and they edit with this assumption in mind, that Mecca and Medina are not disputed, and that their place in Islam is not disputed. Well, I would like to see from them a proof that Mecca and Medina are not disputed particularly given that several of the citations included in this article here mentions Jerusalem as the second holiest for example. These editors who believe in this message are hunting for any mere mention of the word Third in Islam just to include it in this list of sites shown in this article. If the article is written to de-rank Jerusalem from its status in the religion of Islam like here, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88381656" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88381656" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=88066284&amp;oldid=88025948" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=88066284&amp;oldid=88025948" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=87879366&amp;oldid=87877008" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=87879366&amp;oldid=87877008" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> then this is called bad faith editing if indeed this is what is intended by these users. Certainly, If one is to exclude the scripture, Quran and Hadith, which is the reason this site is third Holiest for Muslims, then one may argue not only the status in Jerusalem, but also whether Mecca is the first holiest or whether Medina is the second holiest, and so forth. I believe that these issues should not be exposed to erroneous materials found on the web or misinterpreted by some writers. Instead people look for an Enclopedia to tell them the truth about something and not confuse them more. This is a topic that should be treated with more respect. Having what qualifies for WikiPedia as resources on the internet here and there is not enough for this Article to claim precedence on this issue. Finally, some one added that a city in Tunis was the third holiest sometime in the past <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=88209671&amp;oldid=88135314" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=88209671&amp;oldid=88135314" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Well, let me tell you that this is wrong again, and that the two references brought here are copy paste of each other, therefore passing the same mistake. To correct you, Kairouan was a notable Islamic city at the time with one of the oldest universities built in the Islamic history. The same can be said in regard to <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Azhar_ee7d.html" title="Al-Azhar">al-Azhar</a> in Egypt. These mosques were the main destination of scholars for them being centers of science and knowledge at the time. Actually al-Azhar continues to be so even today. However, saying that they are the third holiest is again a mistake which only shows the confusion by some who are not familiar with Islam or with its correct terminologies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2- Another message that might be conveyed through this article is whether the term Third Holiest is political or religious. This is of course a point raised by anti-Islamic editors like Daniel Pipes and Joseph Farah. Those editors, not only question the Holiness of this site to Muslims, they also question whether if this site was at all the one intended to be in the Quran. They also questioned whether there is anything holy for Muslims in Jerusalem. And finally, they questioned whether ‘Palestinians” ever existed at all. Some say what about Islam's holy sites? There are none in Jerusalem. See this <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15066" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15066" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28222" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28222" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15029" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15029" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. See these for denial pipes <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/490" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/490" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Well, of course these editors never discuss if the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_of_Holies_cc94.html" title="Holy of Holies">Holy of Holies</a> term used by Jews to refer to the same site is also political or religious, particularly that the oldest continuously existing Jewish community of Palestine refer to a place in Nablus as the Temple that is the one meant to be in the Bible and Torah <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan#Samaritan_Temple_on_Mount_Gerizim" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan#Samaritan_Temple_on_Mount_Gerizim" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. I do not see a discussion on whether the Holy of Holies is a political or religious one. I do not see an article therefore written to discuss the Disputes regarding the Holy of Holies. Also, I do not see any written articles to discuss First Holiest and Second Holiest in Islam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the second point or the second message is a valid one, and may easily go to the Aqsa mosque article. Of course, this should be done by deleting all the other sites mentioned in that section because most of them are based on erroneous reporting or wrongly perceived reporting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, it is wrong to conclude based on the material in this article that since the Ummayid Mosque is the third holiest by Syrians and since the Eyup Mosque is third holiest that this is the case for Sunnis given that Turkey and Syria are mostly so. The same can be said regarding the other sites attributed mainly to the Shiites. I see that this article is basically surviving by a material that at best can be described as erroneous and inaccurate reporting by some Journalists or visitors. This NOISE is only amplified by this WikiPedia article, and it is basically adding more confusion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally a remark by many Iranian newspapers confirming the confirmed: <a href="http://www.irib.com/worldservice/imam/palestin_E/default.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irib.com/worldservice/imam/palestin_E/default.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ahlulbayt14/khom-quds.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/ahlulbayt14/khom-quds.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ahlulbayt14/quds-grief.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/ahlulbayt14/quds-grief.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://www.iranmania.com/news/ArticleView/Default.asp?ArchiveNews=Yes&amp;NewsCode=46563&amp;NewsKind=CurrentAffairs" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranmania.com/news/ArticleView/Default.asp?ArchiveNews=Yes&amp;NewsCode=46563&amp;NewsKind=CurrentAffairs" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://www.irna.com/en/news/view/menu-236/0610198285132713.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irna.com/en/news/view/menu-236/0610198285132713.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <a href="http://english.irib.ir/political/palestine.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.irib.ir/political/palestine.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15343184/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15343184/" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> <a href="http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles_2000/july_2000/iran_peace_talks_28700.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles_2000/july_2000/iran_peace_talks_28700.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> <a href="http://www.iqna.ir/en/news_detail.php?ProdID=76022" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iqna.ir/en/news_detail.php?ProdID=76022" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Day" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Day" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></dd>
<dd>I appologise of course if some of these links included hateful language and were offending. The point here is that the official stand in Iran is that Jerusalem is the third Holiest.
<ul>

</dd>
<dd>Please note that most citations in the article are messed up and contradict each other which proves they are mostly erroneous reproting by non experts on the issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh by the way, the sites of the Mosque of Mecca and the one in Jerusalem were chosen and used so before birth of the prophet Muhammad. This is clear from <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/022.qmt.html#022.026" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/022.qmt.html#022.026" rel="nofollow">22:26</a>||}} and from <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Muslim_6c10.html" title="Sahih Muslim">Sahih Muslim</a> <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1056" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1056" rel="nofollow">4:1056</a>. I am saying this because I noticed those not familiar with the Islam do not understand this fundamental issue. It is only the Mosque in Medina which was estaablished by the Prophet Muhammad out of these three sites. This is really a reason why such things like Holiness are not going to be sufficiently addressed with out referencing Muslim authorities or scholars on the issue.

The expression is very correct in my understanding (and Islam is by definition not "Pagan", as someone posted over there, but a Judaism-derived religion like Christianity, I protest as Pagan myself) but the entry seems to have little merit by itself. It does not seem an ecyclopedic entry and its content should be in other articles (but I think the same of all those articles about videogames' or TV series' characters, you know). I think that Muslims' opinions should be considered primarily (as long as they are consistent) when making the decision, as other people may have some vested interest in negating the Muslim holiness of Jerusalem, which is beyond doubt. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 23:51, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see any "debate" there... Based upon what you are talking about Avraham we can conclude that this article is nothing more than <b>original research</b> in that the article <i>itself</i> is framing a debate. Now you and I both know that is totally against Wikipedia's policies. I'd be curious to see if you in fact could produce a preferrably scholarly theologian link or links that specifically expound upon the idea that this is some sort of a "debate" about the "third holiest". <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 02:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Well, Avi, I mainly meant western academic sources&#160;:) But I had a look at the link. It is not a *debate*: one that in which one scholar argues that for this and this reason X is the third holiest shrine and the other one contends... To shias, in practice the third holiest shrine is indeed Karbala; if you ask a shia where do you want to go: aqsa or karbala, I won't be surprised if he says karbala. But to be honest with you, I don't understand what is going on here. Honestly I don't understand why it matters to know which shrine is the third one. I have done some research on Islam and this question was by no means something important to be answered in academic papers. I feel there is something more to this and that academics are not concerned with that something. This is to the best of my knowledge, tomorrow it may turn out to be such a hot dispute... but then I'll ask what is it supposed to <b>mean</b> that "the third holiest shrine is X or Y". --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:13, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This started in the Al Aqsa Mosque - Ithink someone wrote a section in response to claims made there that AL Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest and he said that this view is not universal - it was them moved to a differnet article after claims this was undue weight on the al aqsa mosque article - so I don't see what the problem. If it's not for shia like you say it might not be and then Jerusalem too isn't 3rd holiest like claimed on other articles but it's rather KARBALA, then you can see why it's interesting to know and write about.

<li>Well, the more research I do does imply to me as well that the academic portion is rather weak, at least in English.

<dd><b>Reply to Comment'</b> There is certainly a need for new wiki policies to deal with this. But until such policies are developed, we should use the existing wiki procedures to improve articles and delete those articles that wikipedia cannot handle. We can handle genuine POV disputes that are about the content of the article itself. That is no reason to delete an article. What we cannot deal with are are articles that are created as "weapons" to fight a conflict. The edit wars that you then see are not driven by a genuine difference of opinion on the subject matter itself and therefore cannot be resolved (at least not before the underlying conflict is resolved, in this case the Israeli-Palestinian conflict).</dd>
<dd>Should we tolerate articles on wikipedia that are in a permanent "State of War"? My opinion is that we should not tolerate such articles, because they damage the reputation of wikipedia. We shpould, of course, give the article the benefit of the doubt when we first suspect this problem.

<dd><b>Reply to Reply</b> "Should we tolerate articles on wikipedia that are in a permanent state of war?" As I already argued, yes. There are actually many articles in Wikipedia which are heavily controversial. Some of them are IMO excellent (not this one, but that's just my POV). Controversy, even radical controversy, is an essential component of scholarship. Moreover, you may have noticed that, beside trading accusations and not-so-veiled insults, some of the participants to this debate are stating their methodological assumptions, raising issues and discussing the validity and admissibility of the sources presented. In other words, they are talking across the fence. That's a good thing, at least far better than other types of confrontation around <a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelia_Capitolina_8545.html" title="Aelia Capitolina">Aelia Capitolina</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 11:21, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have changed my mind to delete, after having actually read the article. The article gives an undue weight to random non-scholarly things. It would be comparable to having Bush is a fuckup (expresion). You will find <a href="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22Bush+is+a+fuckup%22&amp;btnG=Google-s%C3%B6kning&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22Bush+is+a+fuckup%22&amp;btnG=Google-s%C3%B6kning&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">some sources</a> for it, and maybe even some semi-important person, but as a whole, you wont find real high level scholars maintain such a view/expresion. For example, it uses one unsourced/unrated hadith from a non-Muslim scholar and some random quote from some guy in television and some random websites, and then proclaims proudly that <i>"With an estimated 130 to 200 million followers worldwide, this accounts for approximately 15% of all Muslims.[15] It is estimated that only Mecca and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims.</i>. Im sorry, but at the very best, this is missleading, my father who is well read confirmed to me that the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third post holy site among Shi'as, and i go by that over some random guy, random website and random scholar any day. Maybe if the article would be renamed to Ignorant claims about the third holiest site in Islam i would vote keep, but than we would have a notability issue. So, delete the article. If it gets delete, i truly feel sorry for the well intended guy who spent so many hours creating it, may it can be userfied? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Very good comments? Hmmm… “you wont find real high level scholars maintain such a view/expression” and he goes on to say his father “confirmed to me that the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the <i>third most holy site</i>” … so the expression is used! His father may not be a high level scholar but it’s good enough for him! This is not about high level scholars, but about what the world at large refers to as Islam third holiest site. Maybe your father disagrees, obviously a good enough reason for you delete the page. I’m just sorry that the only other expression you could come up with contains foul language. You state “undue weight to random non-scholarly things.” Well wikipedia provides for such pages, as it was considered Undue weight on the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Aqsa_Mosque_4de2.html" title="Al Aqsa Mosque">Al Aqsa Mosque</a> page where this info was originally posted and was therefore moved in accordance with <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">W:NPOV</a> where pages can be made to express minority held views. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 14:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>"so the expression is used"</i>, yes, just as most holiest site in Islam (expression) and second most holiest site in Islam (expression). Why don't we have article on them? <i>"This is not about high level scholars, but about what the world at large refers to as Islam third holiest site."</i>, ok then name it to Misconceptions regarding the third holiest site in Islam and i will vote Keep, just as we have <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_misconceptions_about_HIV_and_AIDS_98d6.html" title="Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS">Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS</a>. <i>"I’m just sorry that the only other expression you could come up with contains foul language."</i> most secure place in the world (expresion) <a href="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22most+secure+place+in+the+world+%22&amp;btnG=S%C3%B6k&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22most+secure+place+in+the+world+%22&amp;btnG=S%C3%B6k&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, were is that article? <i>"where pages can be made to express minority held views"</i>. That is the best argument so far. However, i have not been convinced that a notable minority view holds such a belief. As i have explained, you can take any expression and Google information regarding such a thing "<a href="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22best+president%22&amp;btnG=Google-s%C3%B6kning&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22best+president%22&amp;btnG=Google-s%C3%B6kning&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Best president</a>"?

The key is <b>scholarly</b>, you find a prominent scholar, knowing that he is talking about, that X is the third most sacred, and not the consensus one, then you have notability.

<li>Please explain to me on what basis your father believes it’s the third holiest. Is it based on that random verse in the Koran or other random Hadiths? Wikipedia is not only for including the majority held view but also other views. There is no compelling reason to subdue the contents of this article. Where do you think journalists and news websites get their information from? Maybe the attacks they report on are also unreliable? They usually glean information from the area of the attack interviewing the “natives” who will provide them with the details for their report, and if they say the site is third holiest, why should you dispute their beliefs? People have a right to know that the third holiest site in Islam is contested. With 1.6 billon Muslims, I’m sure there must be some dissention in this regard. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 14:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>He holds the view, referring to consensus. He is not aware of any controversy related to the term "3rd most sacred", he views that there is a consensus on this issue. <i>"Maybe the attacks they report on are also unreliable?"</i> Yes, even they are humans. And even humans are humans, maybe they interviewed some ignorant kid, or maybe his translator screwed up and was talking out of his hat? Maybe they want to boost the coolness of their tourist resort? Who cares, none of them were scholars, we are not talking about news and eyewitness credibility, rather on the "sacredness" of something according to Islam. You think you will be born with that knowledge, or empirically observe the "sacredness" with your own eyes in all three sites and conclude that "Oh yes yes, i now <b>see</b> clearly that X is most sacred"? This is a scholarly issue, not a "i'll ask some eyewitness about it" issue. With 1.6 billon Muslims, you will find enough ignorants to make any non-scholarly view as "relevant", you will even find ignorant Muslims that say they are not sure about the existence of God.

<p><b>Delete</b> or <b>Rename to <i>Third Holiest Site in Islam Controvery</i> and Rewrite</b>. This article has gone through several transformations.</p>
<ul>
<li>In it's original form, the <b>subject</b> of the article was the third holiest site in Islam. With that as the subject, it should be clear that the consensus of Islamic scholars would determine <i>which</i> site qualified. Giving significant weight to views which are not accepted by Islamic scholars would be giving undue weight and a violation of NPOV.</li>
<li>The article has been significantly revamped to remove some of the most dubious sources, such as travel sites. In its current form, the article is a <b>POV Fork</b> ostensensibly about an <i>expression</i>. However, the article does not clearly explain the notability of that expression. Instead, it pretends to present, in a pretended neutral fashion, some collection of statements about on an expression, without giving a clear explanation of why the expression is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">Notable</a>. Without such a clear exposition of the Notability of the phrase, the article qualifies for deletion as failing to properly assert notability. Also without a clear explanation that there exists an overwhelming consensus amongst Muslims regarding the third holiest site in Islam, and a clear explanation that the main proponents of the theory that the third holiest site in Islam is not in Jerusalem, then the article would not be an encyclopedic article about a controversy, but would be re-enacting that controversy in the guise of reporting objective facts. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 04:20, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The notability problem could be remedied. The phrase is in fact notable, because it is central to a controversy. The article could clearly explain the notability of the phrase, if the subject were about the controversy, rather than a pretense at an objective inquiry into which is the third most holy site in Islam. However, to cover the controversy in an encyclopedic fashion, the article would need to identify who are the main protagonists in the controversy. On one side of the controversy is the overwhelming consensus of Islamic scholars. On the other side is predominantly non-Muslims. The editors who have demonstrated <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">Ownership</a> of this article have yet to allow such an encyclopedic treatement of this controversy.

<li>The controversy is this. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Farah_7f95.html" title="Joseph Farah">Joseph Farah</a> wrote an article Myths of the Middle East, appearing in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldNetDaily_c1c3.html" title="WorldNetDaily">WorldNetDaily</a> on 11 October 2000, which claimed that Jerusalem is not the third most holy site in Islam, because, according to him:

<li>I don't think there is any significant controversy amongst <i>Muslims</i> regarding the third holiest site in Islam. However, there are <i>non-Muslims</i> who claim that the third holiest site in Islam is not in Jerusalem. I think it is appropriate to report on <i>that</i> fact. However, I think it is inappropriate to conceal the fact that it is non-Muslims who are primarily, and quite vocally, putting forward this claim. It is inappropriate to mix in a lot of non-notable opinions to conceal the fact that there is virtual consensus amongst Muslims regarding the third holiest site. It is inappropriate to conceal the historic record of this consensus. I hope this helps to explain my position. By the way, I am also for delete. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 04:11, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems from the above discussion and previous discussions that while Al-Aqsa is most commonly cited as the third holiest there are enough varying claims such that there is no undue weight issue with discussing them as long as the article makes clear that to the majority of Muslims, Al-Aqsa is considered to have that position. As observed by Theron above, at this point in the discussions there is no dispute that there are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that list locations other than Al-Aqsa and assertions that those are wrong are not relevant. Furthermore, as observed by others above the difficulty to make an NPOV stable article is not a reason for deletion - this applies to all Wikipedia topics that are controversial. The argument that other encyclopedia's don't have articles on the topics at hand also is not an argument for deletion- Wikipedia has and should have many more topics than a paper encyclopedia. I'm also troubled by the religious and ethnic tensions that this discussion has brought up. It is illogical to think that somehow whether Al-Aqsa is the third or the fourth or the oth or the [i]th most holy location changes anything in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in so far as no one would seriously argue against the statement that Al-Aqsa is one of the holiest locations in Islam. We should be able to make an NPOV article on this topic. This article needs careful discussion by a variety of other editors in a calm fashion without attempts to POV push, not deletion. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:28, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and/or Rename</b>. I see this kind of article--especially the form it is in now, where "competing claims", so to speaked are listed. Too many journalists and people with strong opinions will start state things as fact and/or assumption that are not leave folks wondering what the truth is--or worse, with the wrong impression. This kind of article can provide a detailed perspective on an issue like that. And that, IMHO, is what an encyclopedia's job is.<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer">--iFaqeer</a> 01:45, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>i held that view untill i reallized that the article is just a stich jobb of various "<b>look, my hood is the best!!! You NOOOB!</b>" kind of claim. Nothing really notable or scholarly. I would appreciate to be counterproven in this issue, bring me a notable Islamic scholar that contest Al-Aqsa is #3, and ill change back to keep. Untill then, it is just a collection of a bunch of ignorant and egoistic claims, OR'ed to give the impression of a controversy. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 02:31, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

So think about it, are all Shi'a ignorant and can't keep track on if it is Imam 1A, 1B, 3, 8, 10/11 or the other two random mosques that are 3# sacred, or is it just a "I have the cooooolest hoood!" that ignorant reporters could not sift out? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 02:39, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>iFaqeer , you are of course correct, and I appreciate your good faith in this especially since certain users tried to falsely claim that all muslims vote to delete. What's sad is that certain POV pushers not only they nominate the article for deletion every 2 seconds, they try to delete it in other ways or just to place a million tags on the article to make it unreadable and that's quite sad. We can't create articles on wikipedia like that, a shame. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=89331925&amp;oldid=89331424" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=89331925&amp;oldid=89331424" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></li>

<dd>Amoruso, my good will has its limits. My position is based on the principle that just because an article has bad content (indulge me here) does not mean it should not exist. However, the way to go, IMHO is that that if something is a controversy only in a few minds (justified or not; that's not the point), the article should say so: "A few people ..." or "Western media sometimes refers to...but almost all Muslims..." and so on.<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer">--iFaqeer</a> 11:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment: I'm still disappointed at some users saying this AfD is just a clever way of settling a content dispute. Take a look at the talk page, and especially the first AfD where a major contributor to the article and a staunch supporter to keep it went as far as referring to the situation as intimidation by a 'sect of Muslim fanatics'. This article screams "I am nothing but an attempt to make a mockery of Muslim beliefs" by citing the most obscure of sources and it's evident from statements like "According to Capt. Emma Schofield Rawze-e-Sharif is the third holiest site in Islam", just since when did OC-3 US military personnel become Islamic scholars. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">thestick</a> 16:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Al-Aqsa IS the third holiest site in Islam. It simply is. Every single reputable source says it is. And no, I am not Muslim. Why this article exists, and continues to exist, I have no idea.

<p><b>Delete</b> I don't know why should we put all of this sites in this article. As a Shi'a I believe that Al-Aqsa Mosque is the mosque which Allah has blessed according to Qur'an<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/017.qmt.html" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/017.qmt.html" rel="nofollow">17:01</a>. The other sites and shrines are respected by some of the Muslims but not all of them. So please delete the article or just maintain Al-Aqsa. Also we can move this article to The holiest sites in Islam which include whatever exists in List of holy cities#Islam . --<a href="../../../s/a/2E/User%7ESa.vakilian_5dc3.html" title="User:Sa.vakilian">Sa.vakilian</a> 06:41, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>but in your response you bring up that it is your belief. You discount the possibility that other Muslims may maintain another site as their third holiest. We're not going to delete the article on Al-Aqsa. This article just gives alternatives that are accepted by a number of Muslims. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValley2city_89ae.html" title="User:Valley2city">Valley2city</a> 08:00, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Valley2city, <a href="../../../s/a/2E/User%7ESa.vakilian_5dc3.html" title="User:Sa.vakilian">User:Sa.vakilian</a> was specifying his belief due to the fact that a number of folks have been trying to argue (falsely I might add) that the article should be kept because <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> Muslims don't view the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> as the third holiest.

<p><b>Comment:</b> It is again obvious that this article is just confusing the average reader with totally false statements. The latest invention we have here is that <b>"While Kairouan is considered today as Islam's fourth holiest city, some secular scholars have noted that during medieval times Kairouan was regarded as the third holiest city in Islam.[3][4]"</b> <a href="../../../s/f/r/Image%7ESFriendly.gif_0945.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/5/58/SFriendly.gif/18px-SFriendly.gif" alt="" width="18" height="18" longdesc="../../../s/f/r/Image%7ESFriendly.gif_0945.html" /></a>. This is a wrong statement even if one finds what supports it on the web. The matter is that we need to emphasize that this whole article neglects <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_source_43d0.html#Beware_false_authority" title="WP:Reliable source">Beware of False Authority</a>. It does not need a rocket scientist to realise that the article is totally confusing the average reader and gives the impression that Muslims do not know their religion and claim anything to be Holy based on the politics of the Day. Merge with <a href="../../../z/i/y/Ziyarat.html" title="Ziyarat">Ziyarat</a> and with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_holy_cities#Islam" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_holy_cities#Islam" rel="nofollow">Holy Cities in Islam</a>, and delete this article, and keep a small discussion at al-Aqsa mosque page to discuss whether the Third Holiest attributed to it is religious or political. That should be encyclopedic enough. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlmaqdisi_ed6a.html" title="User talk:Almaqdisi"><font color="DarkBlue">talk to me</font></a></small></sup> 09:37, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
