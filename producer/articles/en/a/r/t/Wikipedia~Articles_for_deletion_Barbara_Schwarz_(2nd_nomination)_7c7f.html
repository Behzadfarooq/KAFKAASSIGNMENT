<li><b>KEEP</b>. Originally, I just happened upon her while researching FOIA requests. Utah Court of Appeals ruled against her and evidence presented supports the Wikipedia article, here is a link to the article <a href="http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=15428" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=15428" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Barbara is a notable figure in various courts throughout the United States and her contibution should be noted here.

<p>My feeling is that the article <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> is being used to torment a mentally ill person and is an invasion of privacy. See for example this post on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.religion.scientology.html" title="Alt.religion.scientology">alt.religion.scientology</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/browse_frm/thread/29819a2958e485d3/776c1f248b2147c8#776c1f248b2147c8" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/browse_frm/thread/29819a2958e485d3/776c1f248b2147c8#776c1f248b2147c8" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which bears a subject line which insults Schwarz.

<dd>Note: 12.110.19.97 is an sockpuppet account of Barbara Schwarz. Reverse DNS leads straight to Salt Lake City, Utah a few blocks away from Barbara's favorite library. (see: <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=!NET-12-110-19-0-1&amp;server=whois.arin.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=!NET-12-110-19-0-1&amp;server=whois.arin.net" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>
<dd>It is obvious sockpuppetry anyway. Anyone that reads about her claims understands that she is alone in believing in her reality. There is no "A Mormon" or "Saint" from SLC that just happens to believe everything that Ms. Schwarz says. Also note the AHBL (Abusive Hosts Blocking List) has this IP in it with notes: "12.110.19.97 - Barbara Schwarz, alt.religion.scientology, usenet abuse/spam" <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> 06:53, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think tormenting a crazy person in the public square is unkind and an invasion of privacy. She is unable to control her behavior and our maintenance of a forum to torment her is inappropriate. She is barely a public figure. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 12:23, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think filing another RfD, 10 days after a massive debate was recorded on the same issue is unkind and an invasion of privacy. I think Fred Bauder is unable to control his behaviour and his use of RfD requests to remove an article already voted on 10 days ago with the same content is inappropriate and amounts to tormenting the people that disagree with him. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> 06:53, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Talking to yourself from sockpuppet accounts demonstrates schizophrenic tendencies. 12.110.19.97 leads to public terminal a few blocks away from Barbara's favorite public library in Salt Lake City. It is more than suspect that this person 1) claims to not personally know B.S. and 2) she believes every word that B.S. says and 3) she just happens to not have a computer at home like Barbara and must also use a public terminal in SLC, Utah. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> 06:53, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. (1) She is the US record holder for most FOIA requests. She made so damn many that a judge said she couldn't make any more without paying for them. And the ACLU <i>isn't</i> jumping up and down about it. There's no way that isn't noteworthy. (2) She was President of Scientology in Germany in the 1980s, which is a job involving being the public face - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 14:25, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b>. Why did you propose the article for deletion? This was already proposed two weeks ago, all the arguments - including yours - were made, and it was voted to <b>keep</b>. You should have read the discussion BEFORE starting all this again. About "privacy" - all the contents of the definition are based on public information, among them the writings of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> herself (click on the links inside the definition). No previously private information has been made public. The a.r.s. post you mention is by Garry Scarff, who has posted a similar text for years, even before the wikipedia definition, so deleting the definition won't stop him.<br />
<br />
Barbara Schwarz is a public figure - she is well known in the FOIA scene. Just search Barbara Schwarz FOIA in google. You're an attorney, so maybe read also this court decision. <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><br />
<br />
Finally, I doubt that Barbara Schwarz accepts being called "mentally ill" by you. By saying so, you've also made a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a> against her. It is also a poor idea to repost Scarff's disgusting usenet post in wikipedia, you are hurting Barbara even more. <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 14:53, 13 September 2005 (UTC)Tilman</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Barbara Schwarz posts her own history (in 92 shocking installments!) to Usenet. She's not shy about publicity. She has also made herself part of an extensive and ongoing libel campaign, both online and offline, against Scientology critics. I do think that namecalling and personal attacks should be kept out of the article (glad to see the Kook of the Month award deleted), and all efforts should be made to acknowledge her point of view. But the article should stay. --<a href="../../../t/o/u/User%7ETouretzky_3a3d.html" title="User:Touretzky">Touretzky</a> 16:06, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Unfortunately, neither Dave Touretzky nor his bullies of friends have a legal education</i> He is lying by claiming that I am a part of a libel campaign. I never said anything about him or others that I can't prove. He and his friends are persecuting Scientology. I got a porn letter as harassment that could have been just mailed by Dave Touretzky himself, and he and his friends remove any website from the net that is critical of him and show the facts of the harassment. Fine "free speech activitist" he is. He also can't see that bomb instuctions on the net available to any lunatic is not a sane idea. He keeps his up.</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. Schwarz is a public figure. There's an article in the Salt Lake Tribune about her. There's thousands of web documents discussing her. She broadcasts her opinion numerous times each day using her own name. There are numerous public court cases about her. This makes her a public figure worthy of inclusion. Just because some ass uses a Wikipedia article to torment her (if that is your argument), doesn't make it right that it should be removed. Our job is to determine if the article is worth keeping and to make it as NPOV as possible. Once we do that, its beyond our control how it is used by others. Many biographies here are less than flattering, see <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_Slatkin_2f72.html" title="Reed Slatkin">Reed Slatkin</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Miscavige_578d.html" title="David Miscavige">David Miscavige</a>. Each of these articles could be used to taunt their subjects, but that is of no concern to the encyclopedia how its articles are used. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> 18:40, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I question ever reopening an AfD that decided to keep. In any case, she's still a public figure in Salt Lake City, and she's clearly a public figure on the net.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Keep this, for many of the reasons listed above and others as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been watching (reading) the continuing saga of Barbara on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.religion.scientology.html" title="Alt.religion.scientology">alt.religion.scientology</a>. She often claims that her prolific posting there is to counter "lies" posted by others, but, in reality, she mostly does a cut-and-paste job reposting the same tripe (and personal attacks) over and over, and never commenting upon the "lies" as she claims. She also claims that she has to keep posting there as when she does not, the lies about here get out of control. I have noticed that, in reality, the exact opposite is true. If she does not post for more than two or three days, almost all mention of her disappears (with a few exceptions from specific people.)</p>
<p>In any case, Barbara has made herself a public figure by her actions. A FOIA Officer I knew had told me that Barbara was a lunch room topic a number of times when they would have lunch with fellow FOIA Officers. In addition to being cited in the official goverment FOIA Guide, Barbara is mentioned at FindLaw.com, the Department of Justice web site, and web sites of many other government agency. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper7_252b.html" title="User:Super7">Super7</a></p>

<dd>Where is the evidence? Mr. Barwell, you don't like Ms. Schwarz's religion and that is why you misinform about her. I think that Mr. Barwell is famous for that. Google his name. He defames any Scientologist. I hope he does not defame my religion too one day. Ms. Schwarz has a right for a fair portayal and not an article written by people who hate her religion and therefore hate her as Mr. Barwell. I am sorry, Wikipedia, but the people who defame Ms. Schwarz on Usenet are the same who defame her here. Mr. Barwell is one of them. You really should read her postings on alt.religion.scientology and how she is attacked and defamed by these people.
