<dd>Well I'm not an economist, but I thought it was improperly prodded. It seems like a concept that needs a explanation with examples, context in economic theory etc. It doesn't say on the prod page that you have to make an article perfect when you remove the tag and it seems there is something here that needs more than a dictionary definition. As a mere definition it is pretty useless to a layman, but properly expanded it might be a useful part of Wikipedia's coverage of economics. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalsicol_c774.html" title="User:Calsicol">Calsicol</a> 01:39, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Star Fox Armada was always going to be a GameCube game. Even the articles at the bottom of the page corroborate this. The article offers no proof that there was ever going to be a star fox AX arcade game. They created the name Star Fox AX by stealing it from F-Zero AX. The poster shown as game art was merely an early version of Star Fox Assault for the GameCube, formerly known as Star Fox Armada. The only warrant that this was a arcade game was that it was worked on by Nintendo and Namco, however, Namco's flight sim development team, famous for their work on the Ace Combat series, were always developing this as a GameCube title. Thus, Star Fox AX never existed except in the mind of the persyn who created this Wikipedia page. Some info may be merged with the Star Fox Assault page but it is likely to be redundant. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by SnowflakePillow (<a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowflakePillow_0f2e.html" title="User talk:SnowflakePillow">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SnowflakePillow_6d7e.html" title="Special:Contributions/SnowflakePillow">contribs</a>) 20:29, February 19, 2006.</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am a gigantic fan of the Star Fox series, but there is honestly no good proof that this game ever existed. The text of the entry is just generic stuff about the Triforce project. This game was, at best, thought about momentarily by Nintendo. It never got started; it is nowhere near Star Fox 2, and I remain convinced that it never existed. It should not be listed in the Triforce article either, because there is only one sentence anywhere on the entire internet to support its existence, and it was probably just a misunderstanding about Star Fox Assault (formerly Armada) for the GameCube.SnowflakePillow 04:20, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This IGN article cited seems to spring from a misunderstanding. Namco got the rights to Star Fox, but not for an arcade game. I can concede that perhaps the Star Fox Assault article could use a tiny footnote saying it may have begun as an arcade game on triforce hardware, but the name "Star Fox AX" certainly has no basis. Most of this article is mere summary discussing Triforce hardware, and there is only one sentence of "proof" from a conjecturing IGN article. There are a bunch more articles, but all that I found cited the IGN article as their basis for their outlandish extrapolations. I move that this article become a tiny footnote in Star Fox Assault so that true Star Fox fans like myself aren't worried that they somehow missed a game. Understand that my dislike for this article doesn't come from the fact that the game was never released; the problem is that unlike Star Fox 2 we have absolutely no information about it, so it just wastes space on Wikipedia.

<dd>Update. When I checked earlier this evening Wiktionary did, in fact, have an entry for community ownership. This entry does appear to have been deleted. Therefore my nomination as stated above is no longer valid. However, I will nominate on the grounds that this is a dictdef. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a>. For now I am remaining <b>neutral</b> on the subject. I would like to see if the article can be expanded to something besides the dictdef that it currently is. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames084_3305.html" title="User:James084">James084</a> 03:18, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> this article on a webcomic which does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines. Article was originally listed as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> for lack of reliable sources and failure to meet WP:WEB, but PROD tag was removed by an editor who "think[s] it is notable enough especially since it's recognized by a Wikiproject." However, being tagged by our webcomics wikiproject isn't a notability statement; unless they somehow fall through the cracks, all webcomics-related articles are part of our webcomics wikiproject. And the article still has no reliable sources (I've been unable to find any in google or nexis) and still does not appear to meet WP:WEB. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 03:28, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, and enter now one of the inconsistencies of Wikipedia. Marina Girl strikes me as an insufficiently notable <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> because it's colloquial and unlikely to spread -- ie, it loses meaning away from the marina &amp; SF. Also, I'm from SF, and have never heard it. That said, if this were an <i>Internet</i> colloqualism, we might elect to keep it, because terms on the net can be just as niche, but cross a broader strata of readers and users because of the noncentralized nature of such.

<li><b>Comment</b> (Not a WP member, not author, not affiliated, no vested interest) Anecdotal&#160;: This is a very common term with my social circle (No, not Mission District! Not even SF.). Unless it's being included in travel guides though, it will lose relevance beyond the SF Bay Area. I don't see a huge difference between Marina Girl and <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_Girl_1a54.html" title="Essex Girl">Essex Girl</a> wrt concept. <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_girl.html" title="Essex girl">Essex girl</a> (looks like this is an expansion on <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_Girl_1a54.html" title="Essex Girl">Essex Girl</a> - clearly one of these needs editing) is a specialization of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumb_blonde.html" title="Dumb blonde">Dumb blonde</a>, as Marina Girl is a specialization of <a href="../../../y/u/p/Yuppie.html" title="Yuppie">Yuppie</a>. The Chronicle or Examiner wouldn't dare address this phenomenon by name - their readership levels are already dangerously low, and that would probably lose them 10% of their readers. More references would better the article, I agree. Please, visit the Marina. It's funny.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - This explanation of Marina Girl holds true not just for SF, but any area near the water including westside areas of Los Angeles (Santa Monica, Venice, Manhattan and Hermosa Beach, Orange County in general) and San Diego. The writer of this article is so accurate it's scary. I wager that most of the people who want this removed is because it hits too close to the truth....and they can't handle the truth...or laugh at life.</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Short sightedness to Outsider Art is a common position that many easily take without starting to understand the first principle concept of its foundation. Far from non/notable Silvano has international acclaim from leading Jazz composers. Wikipedia is about knowledge of all for all.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Silvano Togneri is a musician of great distinction whose adroitness is held in high regard in the international music world. I am not aware of the measuring tools used to determine notability, but I was saddened to see that on Wikipedia, a site I hold in high regard, Togneri's article might be destined for deletion.

Yes, he is very outsider but the net is currently buzzing with thousands of remixes of his songs. It has become a sort of internet remix craze.

<li>Even the Google hits for "Moog records" - which is surely a biased sample - yields pages which seem to use the term interchangeably with "Moog music", "Moog albums" and many other near-synonyms. From which I conclude that this exact term isn't widely used. Contrast with a term like "synthpop" which is far more widespread than any near variant. — <a href="../../../c/i/p/User%7ECiphergoth_5225.html" title="User:Ciphergoth">ciphergoth</a> 03:37, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Apparently this article is "a candidate for speedy deletion" because it may be "an article about a real person or group of people that does not assert the importance or significance of the subject (CSD A7)". I don't know what that pseudolegalistic tripe is supposed to mean (and I don't much care), but Wikipedia cannot be only about things that "are important or significant", for two reasons: firstly, "importance or significance" is a subjective judgement which can't be legislated for in any sane system, and secondly if we still intend to create the greatest encyclopaedia there has ever been then we need articles about everything under the sun, and there are plenty of things under ther sun that aren't important or significant. But never mind that. The need for this article arises because several other articles link here, and the context of the links doesn't always make it clear what News Line actually is. The best way for a reader to find out what The News Line is, is to click on the link and read the stub. Also, this is a very remarkable publication. Not so much for what it says, but simply because it continues to come out, day after day and year after year. A teeny-tiny political sect produces a daily newspaper. A real one, with TV reviews and sports results and colour pictures and columnists and everything. How do they do it? Where does the money come from? Apparently, at one time there were two rival WRPs each producing its own rival daily News Line! It's a great subject for a wikipedia article.

<li><b>Khoo was an excellent student no doubt but he hasnt really acheived anything in the real world. Even if you do have excellent grades and do well in exams it doesnt mean you will be a success in the future. I disagree with every ones opinion of him. All the outstanding men and woman in the current world have their succeses based on luck and not acedemics... although it is helpful it will be chance and luck that will bring success. Dont worry the people who are not bright or acedemically inclined, you still have the same oppitunitys as Adrian Khoo. By the way HE MIGHT DO WELL. NOT WILL........ Summited by MMS</b></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> No part of Wikipedia needs to be 'mainstream' to be considered legitimate. It is clearly not a hoax, and even if you argued that it started as a hoax, it has gained a notable following at both the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. Wikipedia's goal is to be on top of these kinds of things. When I first saw the awkward turtle, the first thing I did was to check if Wikipedia knew of it before I believed that existed.</li>

<li>I hate to put a damper on the spirit of debate, but <b>why</b> do we think this band is non-notable? They satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> in at least three different ways; they have recorded several albums with a major record label; they have toured internationally; they have worked with major names in the music business. Everybody is entitled to their opinion but I'd really appreciate it if someone who said 'not notable' would say <i>why</i> they think that. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:52, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If the debate is re-framed and re-defined it's always easy to question what's been said in the past but your lobbying to keep the band appears to be sincere. I will take the position that the band may or may not be (barely) notable -- although the Let's Boogie For Jesus! article shows that a band member (Donnie Gossett) wrote most of the songs, produced the album, and the album's label was donniegossett.com (for authors in print media this looks and feels like vanity press) -- that notwithstanding, its members and its albums are not. Not every album issued by even an undisputedly notable group is worthy of an article: some major artists have no discography (e.g., <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Campbell_544b.html" title="Glen Campbell">Glen Campbell</a>) or where they do, see the discography section of many important artists and you'll see an absence of links (e.g., <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Cash_discography_fcd4.html" title="Johnny Cash discography">Johnny_Cash_discography</a>) or red ones. Now, perhaps some people think that Salvation is bigger than Campbell or Cash, but IMHO they're not. Moreover, members of notable groups are not inherently notable. For example, see, e.g., the article <a href="../../../a/2A/t/A_Teens_f253.html" title="A*Teens">A*Teens</a>; each member's name is a redirect to the group which says all that need be said about the members which in some cases (like birthdates and places) is more extensive than those of Salvation's member's long-winded articles. The A*Teens, regardless of what you may think of them, have sold 8 million albums -- the Salvation article provides no sales numbers, so no assertion of notability on that score. So, in short, the band may or may not be a vanity-press produced group either barely notable or just not notable. The band members and its albums are clearly not notable. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:02, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I wouldn't disagree that the articles on then individual albums need to go, but the early albums for this band were on <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrrh_Records_a086.html" title="Myrrh Records">Myrrh Records</a>, a division of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_Records_5fdc.html" title="Word Records">Word Records</a>, definitely not a small player, especially in the Christian music business. I'm not sure they've sold 8 million albums but this is definitely not vanity publishing. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 21:21, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have less problem with the group than with the albums and band members. It seems we're at least on accord there. But as I understand it Myrrh has gone through some change of control and that it's name was apparently detached from its legacy, but I'm not familiar with when that happened and it's not really worthwhile to figure that out -- others will do so. The named album that was the original title of the AfD is the one that appears to be vanity publishing and nothing you've said contradicts <i>that</i>. However, as the original nomination was for the albums and the band members, my vote on them remains <b>Delete</b>. As for the band itself, I'll take <b>no position</b> and let the consensus consense (nice made up verb?) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 04:40, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">User:Krash</a> also left some explanations on my talk page pointing out that the band gets no entry on allmusic or Amazon and only 400 or so Google hits, plus the article was written mostly by one person. Honestly I have to admit that those are very bad signs and I would be skeptical myself. All I could say was that the band was mainly active long before the internet, and (I would have to admit) not big enough that their back-catalogue is still on sale in anything except specialty used outlets. I don't know what happened to Myrhh later, but at the time they were owned by Word, and Word was unquestionably the biggest publisher of modern Christian music, in the days before it was fashionable.</dd>

<li>Urban Dictionary isn't genreally considered a reliable source, for example it doesn't have a peer-review mechanism. Print and large online sources (wired, salon, etc) are pretty solid ground. Oh, and try out the "reliable sources" link in my nomination, it's a better explanation than I can give.

<dd>You sure about that? I was under the impression that it was a north African term for broken, brought back to Australia and New Zealand by returned servicement after WWII. It's only in recent years that it's been taken over as drug-related slang.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> all losers. Actually, let me expand on that: these articles should <i>never have been created in the first place</i>. Reality show contestants are <i>not</i> notable: once the show is over, even the winner usually retreats to the obscurity form which they came. One or two, such as <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a>, become famous-for-being-famous, but the vast majority were never heard of before, and are never heard of after. I favour a minimum twelve month embargo on creation of <i>any</i> article on a reality show or contestant - it's not like we need to scoop anybody. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span></a> 23:39, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course if you did that, you'ld have to do it for most other types of articles. At which point, you would defeat the entire concept of a wiki, which allows for us to be vastly more up-to-date than most other publications. If we thought it was ok to be a year out-of-date, then we wouldn't have a system of instant publication. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 09:44, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, I don't think so. I don't believe more than a tiny minority of articles document current events. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, a pretty high perecentage of *new* articles, and recent edits to articles in general, relate to new events. That's a reason for having a wiki. If we didn't mind being out-of-date, then it would make far more sense for us to have a system where edits are reviewed, and not published to the public immedidately. Anyhow, an excellent example of us creating articles on the "recently notable" is our coverage of the Olympics. Every single day, many such bio articles are being made and/or substantially updated. I and many, other editors have made bio articles for people who weren't known widely until this month. Do you wish to impose a 12-month freeze on Olympic athletes as well? Perhaps, we shouldn't make bio articles on athletes, until they're proven to be famous long after the games are over? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:17, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

As in previous AfDs, I don't think notability attaches to non-winning contestants on such shows, and I question whether even the winners are notable unless they go on to sell records which are certified gold, sign major-label record contracts, get featured on TV appearances <i>other than promo appearances on the same network</i>, or otherwise generate evidence of meeting WP standards. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:45, 21 February 2006 (UTC) <i>(changed vote <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:16, 24 February 2006 (UTC))</i>

<li>Today we're talking about Survivor contestants, not Idol contestants.

Zero or one person, if I understand correctly, has become famous for being a <i>Survivor</i> winner. Clear outside notability can come from hosting a cable TV program, or <i>recording a chart-topping album</i>, or many other things that have nothing to do with whether their insufficiently-notable reality-show appearance was on <i>Survivor</i> or <i>Pop Idol</i> or some other.

<li>Look, we both know you mixed up different types of shows (I note, you have no explanation for the double-mention of music-specific criteria).

<li>This will sound strange: the fact each one is different, isn't a great reason to vote differently on each, in this case. It's a good reason to not have an AFD, and to just let individual editors do merge/redirects where appropriate, or improve individual articles where appropriate. I think a case could probably be made for redirecting all the articles, even Leitner in the *short* term. Once, they're in a better state, stand alone articles make sense for some (especially Leitner). Even Leitner is in a terrible undocumented/promo state at the moment. I think a basic issue with AFD, is we're voting based on one static point in time, but which articles should be stand-alone, and which should be merged/redirected is something subject to continuous/dynamic change. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> all per precedent for comparable people on national hit reality shows. Given the poor quality of these articles, a better approach is to put in a <b>redirect</b> for the time being, unless/untill somebody turns into a proper article. There's really no reason for deletion here. I judge contestants on shows, like I would lead actors on a hit drama. The fact they're on a reality show, doesn't make them less notable. This shouldn't be a vote on whether people thing reality shows should be deemed noteworthy. Its whether they've been widely found to be, by others. It seems people are voting to delete because they *wish* these people were not notable. The great advantage of a redirect, is it can be undone easily, when the article is improved (especially with new information about the person). That's a better approach, than people making new articles from scratch (with new AFDs), or going to DRV. This whole thing could be taken care of in five minutes, with one person doing some redirects. That seems much more efficient. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 09:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This one's pretty cut and dry if you ask me. Imagine, if you will, an actor who appears in one season of a hit television show. One of the top rated shows of that season. Would we allow an article on that actor? Of course we would. Well, <i>Survivor</i> is a top-rated show, and although it doesn't use actors, these folks are the "stars" of the show. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 15:02, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Reality show contestants aren't actors, but as particpants or contestants that undertake tasks (such as surviving or participating in activities) or answering questions. It's just like a game show, a large majority of those contestants fade back into obscurity once the show is over. Some may go on to be notable after the show such as <a href="../../../a/m/i/Ami_Cusack_17bb.html" title="Ami Cusack">Ami Cusack</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Hasselbeck_3176.html" title="Elizabeth Hasselbeck">Elizabeth Hasselbeck</a>. But the rest of them do not, thus not meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">-- Arnzy</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy">Talk</a> 15:22, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They are not just contestants, they are <i>personalities</i>. Many of these shows, <i>Survivor</i> included, has a full story arc based on the behavior of the contestants between tasks. It's a lot different than appearing on a game show for 30 minutes and answering quiz questions. Many actors fade into obscurity after their show goes off the air as well. Should we delete their articles? Assuming NPOV, we need to treat these contestants the same way we'd treat an actor on a similarly-rated show. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 15:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>About 75% of "celebrities" these days would not be picked out from a line-up containing them and five holes in the ground, but that's an aside. There was a debate on failed political candidates a while back, and many people expressed the view that (a) they weren't notable before; (b) the primary source of information on them during their period in the spotlight is <i>themselves</i>, therefore not neutrsal; (c) after falling back to obscurity no further verifiable data is available. So you have an article which says in essence: "in 2006 X said this about him/herself and did this. X is now believed to be selling insurance in Mudflat, Missouri". Why not just embargo the thing for a year, come back and see if any of them turn out to be <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a> (i.e. famous for being famous) and how many were merely data points for the Warhol hypothesis?

<ul>
<li>The "genuinely encyclopedic topics" is a non-argument if you ask me. It's not an either/or proposition. It's not as if the people editing articles about <i>Survivor</i> contestants are taking time that they might otherwise be using to write about Russian literature (or whatever topics you might find "worthy"). Really, this whole thing smacks of elitism to me...people who don't care for unscripted television deleting articles because they aren't personally interesting to <i>them</i>. I don't understand why a different standard is held for actors who appear on scripted series who get similar ratings...many of them are nobodies who become notable because of their appearance on those shows (for instance, <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangeline_Lily_d1e0.html" title="Evangeline Lily">Evangeline Lily</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 00:25, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Question: I understand the reasons for not wanting a stand-alone article on some of these people, given the poor state of content today. So, I would like to ask the delete voters (as opposed to merge/redirects) why they prefer deletion (with permanent removal of content) over merge/redirect. We'll continue to have content written about all of them in the Survivor/season article, so why not redirect readers to this content? I think the Emmy case highlights the danger of deletion, since we could have lost that information, if there'ld have been a delete (it wasn't in the surivior article, as it wasn't about the show specifically). A redirect doesn't destroy such information, and allows it to be used later in a spun-off article. It's worth noting, that we often do the merge/redirect for failed political candidates. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:26, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as neologism. There are two references, one does not seem to contain the word "quasi-gummi" at all, and the other has it on the sidebar with similar terms "Contempo-Gummis" and "Classic Euro-Gummis", which I think can be safely said to not be commonly-used terms for what they describe either. Try walking into a store and asking for "contempo-gummis" and see what they say.

<dd>OK, I see. What do you consider an appropriate time to wait for the author to address the issues raised? Frankly, I can't imagine some of the editors that create the sort of article that ends up on AfD to be eager to constructively discuss these articles' shortcomings - and wouldn't it save everyone's time to have this discussion directly here on AfD? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 13:52, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's no fixed time in my view, depends on many factors, contribution history (recent?/regular?) when article as last edited, has editor edited since message. BTW, assuming an editor won't be eager to discuss their article goes against AGF, in my view. They may be well meaning and simply unaware that it's not approppiate. Put yourself in the shoes of a well intentioned newbie, they create an article, come back a week later, and it's gone. Nothing, no message, nothing to show why their hard work was rejected (unless they figure out how to find the article discussion on afd). That would be harsh, and it should be avoided if possible. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 14:19, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would also be nice if the admin who deleted the page, informed the user with a link to the afd discussion, in case the reason the editor didn't show up was because they hadn't accessed wikipedia at all while the debate was going on.

<li><b>Comment (no vote)</b> as a former student at UCT (who never resided in Smuts) I'd like to say the following: if any UCT residence could quilify as notable, Smuts and Fuller (the female equivelant) would. Firstly, it is located right on upper campus (where space is extremely limited), secondly, admission is limited to top students and, thirdly, the building itself could be considered notable (architecturally, etc.). The key is of course the <b>if</b> part; and I'm not sure how I'd vote on that one. (Note: I predict repeated recreation - Smuts men have a reputation). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mi<font color="darkred">kk</font>er</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkerpikker_77de.html" title="User talk:Mikkerpikker"><sup>...</sup></a> 20:13, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, nothing wrong with it being named after Jan Smuts, he was after all one of SA's greatest statesmen. It's also the most famous residence at UCT, and it's certainly notable enough both for that and its architectural significance. — <i><a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi"><font color="darkblue">Imp</font></a><a href="../../../i/m/p/User_talk%7EImpi_3839.html" title="User talk:Impi"><font color="green">i</font></a></i> 08:44, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I commented earlier before it was relisted, so not sure whether I should comment again. This a great article about a prominant part of the university.

<p>I am a graduate of Hazelwood Central High. I attended the school for the fall of 1995 to the Summer of 1999. I have a lot of fond memories of the school. With that having been said, however, I feel there is no need fot this article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Consensus was never reached (and never will be reached IMO) but one of the things that in the past was generally agreed upon by quite a few people was that High Schools were notable. This was never accepted as a guideline for a variety of reasons and I'm not going to branch off on a rant about that. Suffice to say there is a strong enough school inclusionist movement that this will likely be kept. At least it isn't another Elementary or Middle school.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:20, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But there is no new information on this page that is not on the Hazelwood School District page. In fact that information and <i>wording</i> is the same. I would not object to a Hazelwood Central High Page that talked about Hazelwood sports, prinicplas and individual school history. However, this page is not any of those. This page could be renamed "The History of Hazelwood School Distict", but then this article is unnessacary since the district's history is on the District's main page.

<li><b>Response to Comments</b> I'm sorry, Guy. I do not understand what you just said. What possible way is deleting a page on a school a religious issue. As to thus who vote to keep the page: This issue is not reallly the deleteion of a High School Page. The issue is: "Do we really need a page that is merely a Xerox of another page. If you will read the history section of the <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazelwood_School_District_c95c.html" title="Hazelwood School District">Hazelwood School District</a> main page and then read the <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazelwood_Central_High_School_6c9e.html" title="Hazelwood Central High School">Hazelwood Central High School</a> page you will see that they are identical. This is why the Hazelwood Central High Page should be either written with material about the <i>school</i> or deleted entirely.

<dd>Long and detailed discussions were held to try to agree a protocol for merging minor and unremarkable schools into larger articles for the school district. A small number of people refused on principle to accept anything other than having a separate article for every school and absolutely would not countenance compromise. No article on a verifiable school, however poorly written, however trivial, however small the stub might be, <i>no</i> article on a verifiable middle school or above will ever achieve consensus for delete, because there will always be schools inclusionists who will vote keep. You have, in essence, poked the anthill with a sharp stick. On the plus side, having insisted on saving every single school article, they are also pretty good about cleaning up the abysmal ones and at least leaving only verifiable information, albeit this is often simply a stub.</dd>
<dd>Just as nominating any Southern Baptist preacher for deletion will have you castigated as an atheist who wants to expunge all Christianity from Wikipedia, nominating a school can attract unwelcome attention from those who assume you know the history and are nominating in contempt of what they see as consensus (actually the consensus was simply to stop arguing about it and get on with writing an encyclopaedia). There really ought to be a section in the guide to deletion warning people <i>never</i> to nominate schools, it only ever generates acrimony. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:16, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Alot of schools are on Wikipedia. Just because you don't like the format means you have to delete. It can quite simply be solved by editing. I don't see any reason why it should be deleted. Vain? Possibly, but that should be viewed as POV, and warrants edits. Schools are all over this website, they are institutions of education and hence should be on this site.

Maybe he meant only schools in the states or whatever, but that's irrelevant; most schools are probably not on wikipedia at all.

I hope this indicates to you the high regard with which others view his work. And I believe that it should satisfy your requirements.

<li><b>Keep revised</b> - He is not just another cryobiologist, he is a major name in the field. The original article did not make his importance clear, but it now surely does. If anyone who has voted for deletion truly thinks that being "co-developer with Greg Fahy [no less] of key technologies enabling cryopreservation of large and complex tissues, including the first successful vitrification and transplantation of a mammalian organ (kidney)" is not "notable", I would truly love to hear your reasons! While Ben Best's documenting of references to him in the media helps make the point, his work with Fahy on vitrification really does not need to be bolstered by "fame references"... anyone who knows the meaning of the words in the quote above (first paragraph in the article as of this writing) should be able to see why an article on Wowk in Wikipedia is completely appropriate. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllanR_2c75.html" title="User:AllanR">Allan Randall</a> 02:13, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let me clarify since you are apparently out to vilify me. The only requirements for running as a candidate are residency and some cash. I obviously don't feel that either of those warrant inclusion. Why don't you bother reading what I actually wrote instead of making random accusations.

<p>Okay, I will read what you wrote instead of making random accusations. You said that "mere" candidates for state office are not notable enough for inclusion as "anyone with a few hundred dollars may be become a candidate." How did I misconstrue that? You never once mentioned residency or any other requirement in your first posting. You simply said that anyone with a little bit of cash can run for office. By the way, do you consider yourself so important that I would just be out to vilify you? I have no idea who you are, are have absolutely no desire to find out. But if it makes you feel better, go ahead and tell yourself that I'm trying to stand up to your awesome power, and that I'm failing miserably because you have marked this article for deletion. I'll go along with it.--69.128.234.209 22:26, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So what makes something worth keeping on a free site that has no real merit to the actual opinion of a person. You may think it does not merit mention but who says I care what you have to say, and why should your pages be here either then we can save some cyberspace and remove wikpedia entirely. Just on your pronciple thought of what has merit and what does not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not out to get you and have no feelings about you positive or negative. Actually, I guess I am slightly leaning towards the dislike side as you called me a fascist. I don't claim to have awesome power. In fact, I have less power than others who have commented on this AFD as I am not a <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_f252.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator">Wikipedia:Administrator</a>. How did you misconstrue what I said? You implied that I had said that moneyed individuals were notable. I had in fact said the opposite. Our inclusion standards for biographies can be found at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If you feel that this article warrants inclusion given those guidelines, please say so. I am sorry that you took my nomination of this article as a personal affront; it was by no means meant to be. I am a new pages patroller and try to adhere to our policies regarding deletion and notability to the best of my ability.

To put it another way, if Buckminster Fuller privately used the term "slenge" to describe the runny white of a fried egg this would not be <i>notable</i>, (or, probably, verifiable) purely on the strength of Fuller himself having said it. "Hyperzine" isn't (or appears not to be) in any sort of wide use except by the proponents mentioned in your article. This isn't hard and fast, but the criterion is somewhat like a word getting into the OED; printed sources have to be cited (I'd expect that "printed" doesn't really imply "in ink") and self-referential sources aren't valid. There's nothing wrong with the word "Hyperzine" <i>per se</i>, but the article doesn't begin to explain why this word is of importance outside the community of three or four people who coined it. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small></dd>

<p>Thank you for the very complete and understandable explanation of the decision making process for entries such as hyperzine. I confess to being new to this, and I can now understand how the original entry was deficient. I have attempted to restate the explanation in a more acceptable manner. Am I on the right track? 216.49.220.19 17:58, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>'<b>KEEP'</b> The concept of interlinking virtual and literal media is well described by the word, hyperzine, as opposed to zine (which is slightly pejorative), and is closer to the magazine traditionally associated with poetry journals</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I would say a solid 50 of the "Cyber Girl" models in the category right now have other notable credits to their name, and the thing with these models is that many go on to become Playmates or go into some other form of valid showbiz/entertainment (wrestling, movie actresses, etc...). Cyber Girls are arguably just as popular as Playmates these days and all the Playmates are "allowed" to have their own entry. Maybe it's overkill to do a page for every one, but I think the ones created now should be let be (considering that it will be very hard to justly eliminate all the ones people feel are NN, since some may truly not be NN), and the standard should be set that in the future only those who go on to add more notable credits to their name can be given a seperate entry. Just my thought. <a href="../../../d/o/a/User%7EDOAsaturn_482a.html" title="User:DOAsaturn">DOAsaturn</a> 10:37, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

One of my authors, who has a wiki page <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navtej_Bharati_7b14.html" title="Navtej Bharati">Navtej Bharati</a>, said both his page and mine were up for deletion?? I looked on my publisher page HMS Press and it was only updated until 1995. Mr. Bharati (who incidently is one of London Ontario's largest book publishers) book came out in 2002 so therefore was not in my authors list. I had re-written HMS Press in accordance to one of Wiki's editors and the new layout was accepted in 2005, NOW you say it is up for deletion. You guys dont like Canadians?? I don't understand the logic. I can update the information and add the next 50 books I did and his name will be on the list for verification. Please explain. I have been publishing Canadian and American poets since 1982 and have about 150 publications.&#160;???</li>

<dd>I'm a bit confused about the use of the Google test, especially in cases of a group such as this whose activities slightly predate widespread internet use. Is that a good measure? On the subject of whether SHAMTA is a joke, or prank. Yes, I believe the group was manipulating the local media, but I haven't read anything in print to that effect. What is the Wikipedia policy on that? Can I put a Category Prankster tag without documentation?

If that is the case then those couple sentences can easily go someplace else. <a href="../../../j/t/r/User%7EJtrost_cae9.html" title="User:Jtrost">Jtrost</a> (<sup><a href="../../../j/t/r/User_talk%7EJtrost_b6ae.html" title="User talk:Jtrost">T</a></sup> | <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtrost_6c4f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtrost">C</a></small> | <sub><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?dbname=enwiki_p&amp;user=Jtrost" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?dbname=enwiki_p&amp;user=Jtrost" rel="nofollow">#</a></span></sub>) 13:37, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It has been cleared up now to hopefully meet the standards of Wikipedia. It is not to be found on amazon and it is indeed self published. At this time there aren't many followers. However, the Book reveals many new understandings that, in our opinion of course, the world should at least know about. We do wish to make the Mission known to the world but we also want to conform to the acceptable standards and keep the article as neutral as possible. BTW this Maitreya is actually present in the world and gives lectures and speeches in paltalk most Saturdays answering questions and giving views on various topics. People can reach him through email and ask questions. Brahmamurti 00:33 13 February 2006 (GMT+1)</p>

If someone would take the time to research the the company and cite <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources in the article for what the company does and the allegations above, that would probably push me to vote keep. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 13:47, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
