<dd>Wow, it's nice to see so many comments on here from people who are obviously lawyers specializing in copyright and trademark law. Hey here's an idea, why don't you send the URL for DH to Disney and Squaresoft's legal departments and see what what they think? --<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:12, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Just wanted to clarify myself, since I did not use copyright as a basis for my vote to delete (I modified my original comment a bit, since the opening wasn't particularly well-ewritten), and to provide some information. I am not a lawyer, but copyright with respect to machinima is a developing issue. I'm not sure what Disney and Squaresoft's stance on this is, but many game companies seem to be allowing, at least implicitly, non-profit machinima to thrive (see <a href="http://www.machinima.com/article.php?article=375" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.machinima.com/article.php?article=375" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - "Machinima.com has informal agreements with quite a few games companies on distribution"). I fully understand the need to protect Wikipedia from copyvios, but, given that machinima seems to have been accepted by Bungie/Microsoft and Electronic Arts (who have both commissioned machinima videos from <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rooster_Teeth_Productions_5d51.html" title="Rooster Teeth Productions">Rooster Teeth Productions</a>, the company that produces <i>Red vs Blue</i>), among possibly a few other companies, there is a certain legitimacy to machinima nowadays. On the other hand, to my knowledge, neither Disney nor Squaresoft has ever taken a stance one way or the other, and so I could see a strong argument for assuming that there would be a copyvio problem with <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> machinima, parodies-as-fair-use notwithstanding. However, with the lack of evidence that Disney/Squaresoft disapprove, and based on the claim that <i>DH</i> is a parody anyway, I formed a rationale based solely on notability. Not saying that copyvio isn't a possible reason to delete a machinima article, but the situation in general with respect to copyrights and machinima is <i>usually</i> not clear-cut. -- <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a> 02:43, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Copyvio was not the reason for my delete vote either. I'm not aware of any machinima copyright use cases ever being brought to court as most game companies do seem to allow this to happen. I'm just saying that in the absence of any settled case law pertaining to this, it may or may not fall under under fair use as parody. I voted delete on lack of notabilty. Copyright was just a passing comment.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:46, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's an incredibly funny work of comedy genuis with a large number of fans. Deleting it would be a pity.</p>
<p>Dramatic Hearts is a work of art and comedy, to remove this page would be a shame, I'm sure if any of you actually <i>watched</i> Dramatic Hearts you wouldn't delete it. Long Live DH! - Tom Seiniger</p>
<p>All of you bigots who believe Dramatic Hearts is dumb are the same people who hate the world and/or are easily offended. It uses the same sense of humor as other popular machinimas such as Red Vs. Blue... why not delete their article? You people make no sense... long live DH! - Deathspank</p>
<p>It's a work of comedy, and parody. An extremely well done one with a lot of effort put into it at that. If things like Red vs. Blue, 8-bit Theater, and PvP can all have Wiki pages, including that goofy Elemenstor saga or whatever it called, could justifably fall into the same catagory, and should be deleted as well.</p>
<p>Have any of you people even seen DH? If you have you'd know that there is no copyright infringment whatsoever.He's not selling it to anyone. It's a well done comedy series that deserves a page on Wikipedia. VIVA DH!- Joten9115</p>
<p>Dude oh my god, i love dramatic hearts. ya'll can't delete it if you watched it you would so how funny it was and how it has made me laugh time and time again. please don't take these memories and laughs away. This mini-series deserves a page on Wikipedia!!! Do not delete it would make me and many other wikipedia viewers very upset. please do not delete DH it makes the many laugh-needy people of this world not go hungry!!! Long Live DH!!! - James</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, somewhat reluctantly. Copyright is <i>often</i> not an issue with the game companies nowadays, with respect to non-commercial <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machinima.html" title="Machinima">machinima</a>; most machinima productions are <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodies</a> anyway and <i>may</i> fall under fair use. However, the big difference between this and, say, <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a></i>, is that the latter has been well-covered in the media (see the References section of the <i>Red vs Blue</i> article) and has won multiple awards within the machinima community. As another example, <i><a href="../../../8/-/b/8-Bit_Theater_2a8a.html" title="8-Bit Theater">8-Bit Theater</a></i> (a webcomic, not machinima) gets about 145,000 Google hits. One user, <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrat_53ce.html" title="User:Drat">Drat</a>, created, at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_machinima_series_8de6.html" title="Talk:List of machinima series">Talk:List of machinima series</a>, an informal list of criteria for inclusion of machinima on Wikipedia; see also <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The issue is not with machinima itself, but that the machinima has to be notable in some way. Personally, I would like to see an example of <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_afaf.html" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></i> machinima on Wikipedia, but there has to be some standard kept. This series has received very little mention outside of a few websites. So, unless someone can show verifiable information that this series is in fact notable in some way, I'm advocating deletion. Whether the series is actually funny or not (a subjective and POV matter, anyway) is irrelevant. -- <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a> 23:14, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well language wise I've already cleaned it up a bit, to my knowledge (aside from a few words which are in character names) there are no offensive words on the page, only semi-suggestive. I would like to know why I have to "clean" up the pages when nothing is overally offensive and when Wikipedia states that it is not censored. As for popularity, what determines what makes it popular? I would consider a few thosand hits a day to make something pretty popular, to my knowledge RVB had a Wikipage far before it became as well known as it is now, before all the awards and becoming a huge hit. It's proven to be atleast semi-popular, I mean if you think it deserves deletion, well, can't stop you. I wouldn't expect a 2-3 month old series to compete with other series that have been around a good 3-5 years. MyInnerFred</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Language was never the real issue for me. In fact, when people mention "clean up", it usually refers to article structure, tone, style, etc. As for <i>Red vs Blue</i>, the <i>Red vs Blue</i> article was created on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">23 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, after the series had won three machinima awards and had been covered in <i>BBC News Online</i>, <i>Village Voice</i>, and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. But it's not about <i>RvB</i> versus other machinima series as much as it is about asserting a series' own notability. Drat had mentioned popularity as a possible guideline, and this is fine as long as the popularity is <i>verifiable</i> (i.e., mentioned and preferably quantified in a reputable news source or online site or such). It's not the only criterion, however, and I would vote to keep if there were more third-party mention of this series — at least a few hundred Google hits, at any rate. It looks like the series has been around for some time (enough for 22 episodes), but I would have expected a series of that length to have garnered enough attention for other people to have written about it. -- <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a> 00:57, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah okay, well atleast we are going somewhere with this. I understand. I personally think it's pretty popular (and do note that while it has 22 episodes many were created before the actual series was produced, it's only been around for a little more then a month actually) considering the huge amount of hits on the main site. We've never really advertised but we've gotten some advertisement on other sites and hits from all over. I've never really advertised and the main reason I made this was I pretty much considered DH to have become popular enough to warrent a simple Wikipedia page. I wasn't really aware there was a need to be popular (of any kind) just figured it had to be atleast something out there, I figured 100,000 hits+ was a good start, heh-heh. The main problem with most people writting about the game is obviously that it's not out in America and many well known KH2 fan site staff members are very pro non-spoiler items. MyInnerFred</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b>. I appreciate the rationale. Popularity isn't a requirement of notability, but it generally would be sufficient if that popularity translated into other writers and sites reviewing the series, etc. I do think that the article content itself has some potential, but there simply isn't enough notability here, in my estimation. 100,000 hits (if those are total site hits in a month) isn't really that much in the grand scheme of things; sites can get a million hits and still be non-notable. -- <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a> 08:37, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
