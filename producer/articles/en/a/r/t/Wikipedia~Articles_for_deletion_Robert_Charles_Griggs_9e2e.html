<p>Musician who made one album in 1973 before dropping out. Only reference a recent local newspaper article about him, but seems to have made few -- if any -- ripples on the music world. The article's creator says <i>[t]he problem is that there simply aren't any other references aside from the one article...</i> making verification, well, difficult. I went so far as to e-mail rock-and-roll historian <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Ward_5a2f.html" title="Ed Ward">Ed Ward</a> for help, but he said that while the producer and session musicians were pretty well-known, he's never heard of this guy, either. I mean, good luck on the comeback, but let's wait until that happens or some verification that this made SOME impact on the music world. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:37, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What part of <i>Only reference a recent local newspaper article about him</i> in my nomination did you overlook? What section of my nomination having to do with "associations" did I overlook? What aspect of a single local newspaper article -- for which the subject was, no doubt, the source of the information in it -- counts as "multiple" coverage?

<li>I didn't overlook it at all. Taking the situation into consideration, coupled by the fact that all we're looking at right now is online sources, I'm not "dispensing" with any policies. I'm thinking this is one of those times where the "just because a person doesn't meet WP:BIO, they don't have to be deleted" clause comes into effect. This is a unique instance. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 10:39, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just want to point out that the information in the article is verified by the informational booklet published by Capitol Records for the release of the album, which I will remind you was a nationwide release on one of the biggest record labels in the music industry. This can be confirmed by Capitol Records. Also, I checked this with Gary Paxton, who confirmed it. And Gary no doubt knows more about such things than Ed Ward. In addition, a quick yahoo search will show that Griggs' songs appear on country music playlists for radio stations all across the country. I would also suggest that it is unneccessary to take this discusion and debate so personally. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinkrivers_93aa.html" title="User:Justinkrivers">Justinkrivers</a> 06:24, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I've gone the extra mile to help you: that you've done nothing to actually help yourself choosing instead to argue irrelevancies isn't my problem.</li>
<li>Once again, the question is NOT whether this guy and his album ever existed: I should point out that my mobile phone, my desk calendar, and my MUJI AT-DF09R2 Desk Fan in front of me all exist, and they're not getting articles, either.

<li>The problem with saying that this subject doesn't deserve an article simply because he hasn't done enough in your opinion to merit one is that since he is an artist it is impossible to gauge what merits his work will have to future critics. If Wikipedia existed in the 1860's and someone tried to post an article on Emily Dickinson, it could be deleted for the same reasons you are offering now. Because this man is an artist and because he is still living, and therefore able to offer future works, he deserves an article so that future researchers have a starting point.Skylark29 10:43, 25 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Skylark29 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Skylark29_0dda.html" title="Special:Contributions/Skylark29">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small> <small>Indeed, this was his first edit. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 11:47, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
