<dd>Fascinating. You do realise that even if this was just a section in a larger article, you do still have to back up the information with sources. So if you are done trying to build up some argument that I'm wrong for nominating this, or this nomination is invalid because I "created" the article, could you perhaps, just maybe, provide a "reliable source" to back this up.

<li><b>?</b> I apparently made a mistake by making this into an article because I think the subject is interesting. At least at first glance. I understand what you mean by trivial, but it does illustrate something about networks, and isn't it the just a matter of two words put together to describe a loop that can occur in a VNC, rather than a neologism. I don't know enough about the definitions so maybe I'm just ignorant, of course. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfero_8db0.html" title="User:Profero">Profero</a> 20:00, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's Wikipedia, every second one deals with software and they forget existence of the rest of humankind. My point, without the obscure terminology, is that the effect could be accomplished rather easily with at least one common tool. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/" rel="nofollow">Flickr</a>, SW means software and a zoom tool allows to magnify portion of the screen so people with weak or damaged sight could still use computer). <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 01:47, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, but I don't understand how simulating a VNC Loop effect means you shouldn't mention the real cause of it. Even if we link VNC&#160;Loop (since there are such links to the undesirable term on the web) to <a href="../../../v/n/c/VNC_c6a3.html" title="VNC">VNC</a> – and mention it there – we loose the appropriateness of the associative links under ==See also== in VNC&#160;Loop as it is now. It's not only the effect that's more or less interesting to different people, it's also the cause. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfero_8db0.html" title="User:Profero">Profero</a> 02:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You need a tool that zooms automatically and repeatedly the area around the mouse. This adds the feedback loop and allows to create (ugly) recursive effects. Similar (and much uglier) effect could be made when the mangnifier does magnify, one can make repeated pattern of larger and larger pixels from the small portion of the screen. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 17:17, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<b>I wonder</b> if this controversy <i>fundamentally</i> has anything to do at all with "notability", "trivial" or "unsourced". I have a feeling it is actually a collision of opinions between they who argue for deletion because their knowledge (of computing) is - or they consider it – more advanced than they who argue for keeping in value of (or just recognize) those who need finding interesting information easily (i.e. the 'uninformed' of a subject who perhaps need WP more than others, or even those who's perspective we know little about). To put it simply: what criteria can we fundamentally refer to when judging what <i>fact</i> should be defined trivial and withheld from 'a few' others. I really hope it's not arrogance. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfero_8db0.html" title="User:Profero">Profero</a> 21:09, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Damn, you are right. You caught me. Nominating this page for deletion is all part of my masterplan for global domination. By hiding information about this trivial, amusing for all of two minutes, with no useful purpose at all, side-effect of <b>some</b> VNC software from the general public, I hope to profit personally and one day rebuild the world as I see fit.</dd>
