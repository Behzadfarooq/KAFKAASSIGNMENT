<li><b>Question</b> -What particularly do you find about this place that makes it the wrong space to question the relative uses and abuses of Wikipedia? What makes this place the wrong place, and what makes your Vanity page Encyclopedic. If Wikipedia is going to delete this wonderful article because you demand a definition of encyclopedic well I have never seen an encyclopedia with administrators give each other metals, have links to their blogs, or post pictures of some houses they like. What makes you fit to judge the encyclopedic nature of a article when you abuse these values yourself. The article is excellent and should stay. To delete it would be an insult to the people who lived through that time. Especially since my wife just point out the idiotic Pamela Anderson article. This thing is becoming a joke. Also do you put your Wikipedia medals on when you go shopping?--<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhooker1236_22ef.html" title="User:Rhooker1236">Rhooker1236</a> 10:51, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I suppose it's partly because I grew up with people who had strong memories of the war, and the music of that time. Just as I have powerful memories associated with the music during the Vietnam War. So it's interesting to read about the music of the period and reflect on that time in history.

<li>Preserving the cultural experience of the most dramatic event of modern history is not sentimentality, it is humanity. Your sane, the one's who want to delete this have simply gone nuts with the role playing game Wikipedia has become. Anyone who knows anything about WWII understands the critical role music played and would appreciate this article. In fact this is the only article in Wikipedia that my father in law, a vet from the South Pacific, found interesting. But I guess we need to make room for more shots of Pamela Anderson, fan comments on Star Trek:Enterprise, more comments on Klingon Language, to date one small child might speak natively in 10 years, and the Star Wars movies. I guess Andrew Orlowski was right after all.--<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhooker1236_22ef.html" title="User:Rhooker1236">Rhooker1236</a> 10:55, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I would imagine that over the years such a page could contain a full list of the popular music of WWII, and would be an invaluage living reference for historians and artists looking at that period. It is Wikipedic because it strives to expand the overall knowledge construction, because Wikipedia is one of the few places where such knowledge can be held, and that over time it will grow to become a hub connectiong to information, say details and lyrics of the songs, references to the songs role in history (i.e. Favority with Americans in South Pacific). Excellent article and the very fact its up for deletion, and that someone has been asked to define encyclopedic to try and save it is rather sad. --<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhooker1236_22ef.html" title="User:Rhooker1236">Rhooker1236</a> 16:15, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, as it would probably be better off as a category, and as with all "List of [x] about [x] articles" the difficultiy in drawing boundries severly undermines it's usefullness.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is what categories are for. How much of the song has to refer to WWII to be on this list? There is no article on songs about World War II (nor is there a need for one), so this list is not necessary. It is not <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedic</a> and is listcruft.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The lack of criteria has already led to confusion about what can and can't go on the list (are we talking about "songs about the war" or "songs which were popular during the war"? Both appear to be listed and one of the rationales to keep above is also conflating the two together. Further, I'm not entirely convinced that everything on the list qualifies under either criterion). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:18, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="m:mergist">m:mergist</a> analysis seems to apply here. The problem with using a category is that it requires a separate article for each song. That is more <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>-y than a single-article list, almost by definition. The list can mention songs that are verifiable but don't rise to the level of needing their own articles. Using a category would result in a bunch of song articles being made all the time that are basically content-free.<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 09:48, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I don't completely object to the topic of this list, but this particular list is not worth keeping around. What are the criteria? For example, how is "I'll Get By (As Long As I Have You)" <i>about</i> World War II? As the entries on the list belie the idea that there's a clear topic, this is rendered useless.

<dd>Is it that admins are voting on this without knowing anything about WWII culture, or not caring, or they just love to delete?</dd>
<dd>There seems to be a clear failure on the part of many of the admins on this group to understand cultural studies and history, but sadly it does not stop the march to delete, which is now the admins favorite past time. Just an effort to make clear. WWII was a radio war, the first and only radio war. For most people the only connection they had to the mass media of that day was through radio, and radio generally plays a lot of music. Song were about the war itself, or about the strong emotional feelings that the war took place, or just pretty songs that people in the war felt. Some songs were big band songs without words, but were popular with the troops. But espeically for the American forces songs defined a time, a cause, a connection to home, a wall against fear, and a positive outlook which got the nation through. If you want to know whay the US won WWII and lost Vietnam and the Second Iraq War probably the place to look are the songs, WWII songs speak of motivation, hope, aspiration, unity; a sense of political purpose lacking in recent wars and significant. This type of page is one of the most significant types of entries that Wikipedia could have that a book can not, as more and more songs and composers, in theory, are added and not deleted (highly unlikely) this list of significant songs that define a period would grow. If there is a need to more clearly defined that types of music that goes in this list than that is NOT best done with a delete. In fact this list is probably a defining moment for Wikipedia. It is the kind of network information that a Wiki is best at capturing, in fact the only reason to have a wiki is to be able to produce these kinds of centre points. If Wikipedia can't keep a critical contribution to knowledge construction like this, while still having a massive Pamela Anderson article, a huge page on Jorn Barger who runs a blogs and is an anti-semite, and masses on the Klingon language, than it is clearly and "objectively" dead as a form of human knowledge collection. This article holds the entire soul of Wikipedia. Wikipedia could have been the only place to collect this historically critical information, and it looks to be deleted. Its sad to because a number of us would clearly like to make the case for why this is critical on the page, but one the Wiki admins get the smell of a delete they won't stop. I'm sure this article will be deleted and it will be a truely pathetic day for Wikipedia. Of course Jimbo "Ayn Rand contains all truth" Jones many enemies will be delighted, as will Britanica and Google and Microsoft, knowing they have little to fear from an "encyclopedia" which can't even understand how important mustic was to WWII. --<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhooker1236_22ef.html" title="User:Rhooker1236">Rhooker1236</a> 10:46, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>WRONG</b> An article called "The Role of Music in WWII" would be open to NOPV since there exists no semiotic or cultural study theory at this time as to what the role of music is? What is the role of Rock Music, of Jazz, of Kabuki? Such an article would be by its nature rather opionated and more on the level of theory rather then encyclopedic. An article outline the most popular songs from the war and about the war CAN be verified, the role of music in the war can not. I don't mean to be vitriol but that does not make sense at all. A list of songs is easier to approve as being from a time or of a content than a discourse on the function of that music.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm moved by Rhooker1236's remarks (I already voted keep though). I think Serpent's Choice suggestion of an article about the role of music in WW2 is also a good idea, but I'm still fine with the list for reasons stated earlier. Issues of verifiability can be handled the usual way--anyone wanting to challenge an entry can ask for a cite (but don't do that maliciously, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and challenge in cases where there's actual doubt). Replacing the list with a category does absolutely nothing to get rid of such doubts--instead of "why is this song on the list" it becomes "why is this song in the category". <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:16, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My problem regarding this topic really is in its titling. Rhooker1236 wants this entry to bring together "songs that define a period". And I will not argue; WWII is perhaps unique among major wars in that music, at home and abroad, played an important role in morale and even propoganda. The use of music in the period is verifiable. It is notable. It is encyclopediac. But that's not what this list is titled as, and so that's not what it would contain. Rhooker1236 writes how "[s]ong[s] were about the war itself, or about the strong emotional feelings that the war took place, or just pretty songs that people in the war felt." But a pretty song that was a morale motivator for soldiers or their families homeside is not, strictly speaking, a "song about World War II". Such songs should be pulled from this list. Any song written before WWII could not be <i>about</i> the war, and should be pulled from this list. And what about songs written 10, 20, 30 years after the war? How can we decide whether those songs are "about" the war? For many bands and many songs, meaning is left to the audience. For us as editors to determine which songs are meant to invoke the memory of WWII to an extent worthy of making this list is fundamentally incompatible with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (Another Brick in the Wall??). For what its worth, Rhooker, I'm on your side. What you are talking about is something that Wikipedia needs (and that, so far as I can tell, Wikipedia doesn't currently have). But <i>this list</i> is not going to produce the end you're looking for. Let this one go, and make a more appropriate home for the knowledge. It deserves better. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firstly it is not up to you to decide what should be in the songs, let some people who lived through the period ad.</dd>

<dd>I have just spent 3 hours of my employers time to fill it out to a proper stub, but I have not touched the surface. My research indicates that the differences between the music of different regims, and the way WWII has been expressed after the is fascinating.</dd>

I feel that Wikipedia's very soul is on the line here.

Partipants who proposed deletion early based on the old version and then didn't participate further should be downweighted for consensus purposes since they weren't referring to the same article. However, as someone said above, the new version should maybe have a different title. I don't see it as OR beyond other culture-related articles; it could use better sourcing, but it's still a work in progress. I think it's a promising article now.<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 14:40, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>References and sources</b> I have taken references for the work, but I have a full time job and I am in the process of changing jobs right now, so I can only do work in patches. If I am going to fill this out it will take a couple of weeks, if it is just going to be deleted I would like to know now so I don't waste any more time on it. The vote seems to be against it, but how decisions are made is never clear. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhooker1236_22ef.html" title="User:Rhooker1236">Rhooker1236</a> (<a href="../../../r/h/o/User_talk%7ERhooker1236_9d2d.html" title="User talk:Rhooker1236">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rhooker1236_17bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rhooker1236">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> after reviewing the updated content of the article (thanks for the note Phr), this is still a good use of a category. The non-list content of this article should be moved to a new article Role of music in WWII per Serpent's Choice above.&#160;— <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDolomite_0b0c.html" title="User:MrDolomite">MrDolomite</a> | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDolomite_8f87.html" title="User talk:MrDolomite">Talk</a> 12:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article is no longer a list at all, and at this point the article should simply be moved to a new title, since it's an entirely different article now. Issues of whether the article should then contain a list of songs are editorial questions belonging on the article's discussion page, not an afd (unless someone opens a separate afd for the new article). Unless someone objects (or does it first) I'm going to rename it to "Role of music in World War II". Also, kudos to Rhooker1236 for his work on this promising new article. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 20:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a great article for those of us whose parents fought in the war, or whose parents lost someone in the war. It can be improved. There were lots of articles about the music of the war. Broadcasts and records were so crucial to the war effort that vinyl Vdiscs of songs were created and shipped to the troops even while the musicians union was on strike and commercial recordings were not being made. Lots of emotion invested in some couple's special song. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (but retitle). I have rescinded my previous deletion endorsement in light of the current state of the article. It will need to be renamed; it no longer remotely meets the description of a list as Wikipedia knows them. Although edits to entries in AfD are permissible (and have likely saved this content), I am reticent to <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> enough to pagemove this during AfD, given its evolution during the process. Also the page will require substantially better sourcing in the near-term regardless of destination titling, but because the content <i>can be</i> verified, that is a matter for the page's talk and no longer for AfD. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 02:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Article is renamed</b> Per earlier comment, since no one objected I've moved the article to <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_music_in_World_War_II_84a1.html" title="Role of music in World War II">Role of music in World War II</a>. I left the AfD template in it but I think this AfD should be closed and the template removed. The article that was AfD'd and the present article have no resemblance to each other. Anyone still favoring deletion should open a new AfD. Discussion about the article content should go on the article talk page, not here. It's massively stressful to an article writer to have to make edits while an AfD is winding down. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 04:08, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
