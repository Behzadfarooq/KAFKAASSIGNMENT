<li><b>Delete</b> A blatant advert of no use to Wikipedia. Organisations like this should take the time to form their own page, not exploit the open nature of Wikipedia. Also, this is the 3rd or 4th article on schools forwarded to AfD.

<li><b>Delete</b> It has one team that won 2 state championships.And nothing else. There are always a number of school articles in AfD and there will be as long as we have no agreed-upon criteria for schools.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The school has been an athletic powerhouse that has been one of the few regularly covered on television at the high school level and has won multiple state championships in multiple sports, all of which has been covered by major media in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a>, clearly establishing <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> by any definition of the term. I invite those who have voted delete citing a failure to assert notability or to provide sources, to reread the article and reconsider their votes accordingly. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 00:37, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While I am opposed to the willy-nilly inclusion of schools that some seem to favor, this one has a nationally recognized basketball program and is therefore notable from an athletic standpoint. The major edits which improved the article were just made, so I would ask that the AfD be left open for a few more days so that others have an opportunity to review the improved version. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 01:09, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - DGG actually did not say that. He said "It has one team that won 2 state championships. And nothing else." This comment was entirely valid at the time that he made it and I agree that by itself it is not sufficient for notability. However, the sports section has now been expanded and referenced up and now indicates notability when coupled with the significant place this school has in the community. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 18:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It's comments by delete voters like these that amply demonstrate that some people just won't bother to read an article before voting. All of this on top of the fact that <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> seems to play little part in participating in Wikipedia other than as a critic, only further undermines the validity of this vote. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Gosh Alan, thanks so much for the love. Let me expand my comment (AfD is not a vote btw). The article is about a school. The school is unnotable. Pointless attempts (the teams' sponsor is Nike, eg) have been made to try to provide some grounds for notability in the ongoing and misguided belief that Wikipedia is a glorified Yellow Pages masquerading as an encyclopaedia on weekends. But the school remains unnotable. Why? It is a school &amp; schools are generally unnotable. Their sports teams are unnotable. Their mascots are unnotable as are their school colours, their motto, and the principal's name. How can I be clearer? I am serene that you disagree with me on this issue, but let's keep the commentary on the specific message and not impugn the opinions of those who don't happen to live in your sunshine-filled happy valley of server-wasting schoolcruft. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I prefer to deal with fellow editors, those of us who are working together to build an encyclopedia, not critics with an axe to grind. Above and beyond your clear deletionist bias and near-complete lack of contributions, you persist in pushing your agenda, rather than addressing the article in question. I still don't have the impression that you have bothered to read it. As such, your knee-jerk vote does not address the issues of notability for this article. The fact that you will not address this article makes yours a vote. That's not how we Wikipedia editors participate. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's nice that you're reading my comments, but the school is located in Florida, where the air is clear and the schools are notable. Have you actually read the article yet?

<li><b>Keep</b> Doesn't seem like much of an advert to me. School articles are important and schools are notable. Hence the hundreds of articles on schools. Don't complain about the content - make it better - that's the Wiki way <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 23:09, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Article has notable sports achievements supported by references. The content needs to be improved, but not AfD. <a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECocoma_a499.html" title="User:Cocoma">Cocoma</a> 23:12, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - for a small school those sporting achievements look pretty notable to me. The Academics section needs work but the article should be given time to acquire editors and grow. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridgeplayer_5ae5.html" title="User:Bridgeplayer">Bridgeplayer</a> 01:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Not all school articles are notable. This one, however, seems to be (following the addition of multiple sources to the article). One could argue that the basketball team is more notable than the school, but if for nothing else than proper organisation, content about school teams should be in a main school article (except for major college/university teams, of course). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
