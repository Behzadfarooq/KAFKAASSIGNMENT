<li><b>Keep</b> a notable topic for a notable game.

Battlefield is notable and it has an article. 98% of this list is NOT notable, and seeing as how nearly all of them are dead, they are unlikely to get notable either. 4 of the notable ones are different versions of the same mod, all done by the same company. I would <i>love</i> to hear why you think each and every game should be on this list, or why the list itself is notable enough for inclusion. Or were you not thinking in that much detail when you say it's a notable subject? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:09, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Linux_distributions_40d1.html" title="List of Linux distributions">List of Linux distributions</a> doesn't go into nearly as much detail as this article does. No big chart describing every function of every distribution. But that's basically just a <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">pokemon argument</a> anyway; just because the Linux page hasn't been deleted (though it is marked as needing cleanup and reading like an advertisement) doesn't mean this one can't be. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 16:18, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Commment</b> This list is also important in the historical sense, for some years now. Just like many 1980s era games are rarely played, but important part of computer history. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 20:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>keep</b> per previous failed nominations. "listcruft" is just as invalid a deletion criterion as <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> is for a keeping. Not indiscriminate information. List could be culled to remove non-notable entries (like probably the whole section on unreleased mods), but BF1942 is a huge game and that makes its modding scene important enough to me. Should be sourceable from primary sources (the mods themselves) and gaming literature. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 16:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Your right. It <i>should</i> be sourcable, but guess what, after TWO AfDs, there are still no sources to establish to notability of these mods. You'd have thought after two AfDs they might have considered it an important issue. What makes you think that this article being kept after a third AfD will make those sources appear? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:15, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is going to end up like the GNAA deletion. "It should be kept, because THIS AfD is going to produce sources, if you only let it be kept!" -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 16:21, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> Sources should be added, but AFD is not the proper venue for that. <i>Not currently having sources</i> (as opposed to being <i>unverifiable</i>) is not a deletion criterion. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 04:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If sources exist, then <i>why</i> have they not been added after two AfDs? -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 05:39, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because, like with any article, finding sources is a tedious process and there is a shortage of editors who go through Wikipedia and perform tedious tasks. Just see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_backlog_317c.html" title="Category:Wikipedia backlog">Category:Wikipedia backlog</a>! (Most Wikipedia articles are not currently sourced!) It is important that we find sources, but AFD is not cleanup, and the purpose of AFD is not "find sources now or delete." <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 15:45, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But people MUST have complained about lack of sources. It would be in the keep&#160;!voters' best interests to provide sources. Thus, I don't think there ARE any. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 15:49, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>- I'll repost this from further down the discussion because it's relevant here too: "And yet, it's been kept twice and completely failed to be cleaned up. Unless your goingh to do it yourself, it's not going to happen. You all say 'Keep and clean up' yet none of you ever have any intention of actually being one of the people to clean up the article. It hasn't been cleaned up after TWO AfDs. It had it's chance, now it should be got rid of." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:37, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I appreciate your position, but disagree with it. There is simply a shortage of people willing to do tedious cleanup work; just because something is not done now does not mean it will not or can not be done later. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 16:18, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The notable mods already have their own articles, and as it is currently, the article contains way too much speculation about "unreleased" mods.

<li><b>Comment</b> While every battle in say, world war 2 is not notable for a 'pedia' that limits its scope like wikipedia, a listing of all the battle could easily be. This allows the few battles which had articles to be put in perspective in the pedia. In the same way, while most of these mods may not have articles, they provide the encylopedic context for the ones that do. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 22:49, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>However, there isn't a list of battle avoided in WW2, nor is there a list of ww2 battles there are nearly done. Nor is there a list of ww2 battles that have been cancelled or could have happened if something had changed. Yet this list contains games that can be clumsely put into those groups (I say clumsily due to the poor comparison of WW2 and computer game mods). And before some smart-ass say 'well clean up all the dead/cnacelled etc mods' I'm going to say 'I'm not doing it' Polcies compel people wishing to see an article kept to clean it up. After 2 AfDs it wasn't cleaned up. We are what, 5-6 days, into this AfD and no-one has touched it. You (as in the people saying keep) aren't planning to do the work, so what the hell make you think anyone else will? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:26, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I could help clean it up, but seeing as I have no knowledge of Battlefield 1942, my cleanup would have to be the look of the article, not content. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Havok_0d4d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Havok">e</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 12:23, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Simple, I don't think the article should be kept. I'm not helping clean up an article I think should be deleted, and the policies compel people wishing to keep it to do so, not people who think it should be deleted. I stand by my statement that in six months time, this article wont have changed, save maybe more mods dying. It certainly hasn't changed significantly enough in the <i>last</i> six months since the previous AfD. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 12:34, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Numerous mods have been featured in industry magazines, and recieved awards. Unfortunely ref/sources to "real" articles for many of these mods were deleted when the individual articles were deleted of the wiki. If your familiar with gaming magazines you can find articles at the library, but they are not usually available to link to. Looking around I found this (<a href="http://www.wdwmod.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1540&amp;sid=aef3a8e3dbd37753b270bf5f2c6c88fd" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wdwmod.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1540&amp;sid=aef3a8e3dbd37753b270bf5f2c6c88fd" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) a PC Gamer magazine October 2005 review of a smaller 1942 mods.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but needs cleanup. The argument that "If a mod isn't notable enough to have it's own article on Wikipedia, then why is it notable enough to be included on a list in Wikipedia?" is flawed.

<li><b>Keep, but clean up.</b> I still feel that mod lists aren't directories, and usually are important to show impact or popularity of a game. As well, they are also useful.

<li><b>Keep</b> I wish people wouldn't keep renominating articles that have only had a thorough AfD a few months ago. An item does not need the same degree of notability to be included in a list as it does to merit its own article. It is the topic of the list that needs the notability, not all of the individual constituents. The individual items are not indiscriminate if it is decided that the subject is of worth. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:52, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although I cannot back it up with evidence, the mods as a whole have probably affected the real-world to a degree.

<li><b>Comment</b> Here's an idea: how about people get together and create a wiki specifically created for mods? I know that some people may argue that ModDB is already out there, but frankly ModDB is just not as user-friendly as wikis are, and often has pitifully little information about each mod. By making an openly editable wiki just for mods, both the PC gaming aficionados and the super-psycho-relevance-police (jk, guys) can be happy.
