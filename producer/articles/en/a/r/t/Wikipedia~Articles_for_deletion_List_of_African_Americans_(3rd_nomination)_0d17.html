<li><s><b>Delete</b> change to <b>Weak Delete</b>.</s> CHANGE TO <b>STRONG KEEP</b> (reasons in comment below labeled "Reasons") Way too broad a category. I'd vote to delete all the ethnic American lists, at least for major groups. Actually, Albanian Americans would probably be small enough. But for any major ethnic group in this country, the parameters of the list are simply too broad. I'd support splitting it up into various lists, but "List of African American Major League baseball players" would still be too large. I'm open to changing my vote if a case can be made that this list has an important use. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:39, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Very few of the longer ethnic lists are in alphabetical order like this one — those lists are usually ordered by job category, which might be somewhat useful and is certainly easier to browse through.

There is no good reason to delete here and keep in that discussion, and I hope any administrator who closes this debate takes that into consideration. At the very least, if the debates continue trending as they are, they should be combined and resubmitted as a unified deletion discussion. Again, NO good reason has been given to treat this decision differently from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Chinese_Americans_4f87.html" title="List of Chinese Americans">List of Chinese Americans</a>. The only responsible treatment of this decision is to consider everything at once or make Wikipedia look completely racist. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:38, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Racist? Racist?!?!?!? Since when is calling someone "African-American" an insult? Also, the Caucasian Americans list is not up for speedy deletion and is not comparable to this list in quality. Claims that this list is indiscriminate or overly broad are inaccurate.</li>

<li><i>Not indiscriminate</i>. How is race not a discriminating criterion? Moreover, this does not correspond with any of the 8 items listed at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>.</li>
<li><i>Not overly broad</i>. Firstly, the purpose of the list is not to include all African-Americans, but only the notable ones.

<li><b>Response</b> The problem, Black Falcon, is that limiting the list to "only the notable ones" would still leave a list of gargantuan proportions. There are a LOT of notable African Americans; far too many for a list like this to ever hope to compile. The fact of the matter is that notability simply does not narrow the spectrum sufficiently. For one obvious example: a significant majority of NBA players are African American (80% is one statistic I've seen). Furthermore, if I'm not mistaken, every NBA player is also considered "notable." Accordingly, wouldn't nearly all NBA players be appropriate candidates for this list? I would think not, as this would dilute the list to meaninglessness (a backup pointguard on the Knicks just isn't on the same level as Martin Luther King and Miles Davis). All the African American players in the NFL or Major League would also be appropriate for this list. Including these "notable" individuals would render any attempt to compile a list of truly "great" African Americans ineffectual. To have any meaning or utility, a list like this would necessarily have to introduce a higher standard (double secret notability anyone?). This leaves aside the question, of course, concerning whether or not a list of "great" African Americans would be overly subjective and not encyclopedic... <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicjm_5b6f.html" title="User:Vicjm">Vicjm</a> 23:18, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>True, it would be long, but the same problem applies to the category, and it's no easier to navigate a category with 1000s of entries than a list with same amount. Also, I believe Noroton's suggestion below is viable. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, the categories do not provide information as to birth/death dates and occupations at the same level of quality as this list does. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:52, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Black Falcon, how do we define notability for purposes of this list? Having a Wikipedia article or a good prospect of having one? If so, this list could get very, very long. If we set a higher standard, what is that standard? I'd be interested in what you think of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_American_Jews_106c.html" title="Lists of American Jews">Lists of American Jews</a> as an alternative way of organizing. I agree, lists are more helpful than categories. The birth/death date information and possibly other brief descriptions can help readers trying to find someone whose name they've forgotten. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:07, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Noroton, I think that method of proceeding (further subdividing by occupation) is ideal. However, that can only be achieved through a merge and not a delete. I'm all for splitting this article into component sections, but this cannot be done once the list is deleted. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Responding to Falcon's claim about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a></b> - clearly, there is nothing in the plain text of the policy that says the eight things listed there is or was ever intended to be an exhaustive list of the only things ever that could possibly be considered indiscriminate information. List of blue things is not barred but such a list would not pass <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. List of people by favorite ice cream would not stand under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> despiter there not being a specific "no listing people by ice cream" section in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Dozens of articles that do not exactly fit one of the eight specified items have been deleted as indiscriminate collections of information in the last couple of weeks and Falcon has participated in the debates for many of them so why there is this continued insistence that only things that exactly meet one of those eight criteria can possibly be considered indiscriminate information remains a mystery to me. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Otto, if it's not on the list, you can't say the policy supports you! How about if I suddenly feel that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> includies biographies on U.S. presidents? Sure, it's not on the list, but then again, if it's not exhaustive that doesn't matter. Of the dozens of articles that have been deleted, I have suggested to delete in probably over &gt;70% of cases. However, my reason for the suggestion has rarely been <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, as other criteria applied. Also, this list is nothing like the "in popular culture" articles, so the comparison cannot stand. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The notion of comparing a sourced verified biography of a president to a list of people who happen to share a common continent of origin is, to put it bluntly, amazingly stupid. There is no comparison between the two. The notion of asserting that a well-sourced verified biography might possibly run afoul of NOT#IINFO is similarly amazingly stupid. There is absolutely no support for your assertion that only the Big 8 can be considered indiscriminate by the simple fact that <i>other kinds of articles have been deleted as indiscriminate</i>. <a href="../../../r/e/s/Res_ipsa_loquitur.html" title="Res ipsa loquitur">Res ipsa loquitur</a>, to borrow a term of law. And whether or not you <i>agreed</i> with the deletions of those articles you've seen AFDed as indisciminate collections, the fact remains, as I said, that you've <i>seen</i> them deleted for being indiscriminate collections and it is your assertion of the Big 8 as exhaustive that cannot stand. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:15, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Let us, for a moment, put aside the issue of your incivility. You make two errors in your post above. First, the quality of sourcing of an article has no relevance as to how it stands in relation to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. Second, "African Americans" share more than a common continent of origin: they also share their nationality and their status as a minority in the U.S. Race is a major issue in the United States, and it would not be if classification by "continent of origin" was an indiscriminate criterion. Now with regard to my comment. The presidential biography was <i>an example</i> intended to demonstrate a general principle. That principle being: the Big 8 (as you've named them) are those types of articles for which a consensus exists. Sufficient consensus <i>does not</i> exist for other types of articles, just as sufficient consensus does not (will not, should not) exist for excluding the hypothetical example of presidential biographies. Dozens of articles were deleted, but you fail to mention that dozens were kept. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:21, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> If I could just sidestep the racism question for a moment, the number of notable African-Americans is pretty huge, and (hopefully!) will continue to grow to the point where this list would be just as ridiculous as the list of notable Caucasian-Americans.

<li><b>COMMENT BY NOMINATOR</b> My apologies but my sentiment 'racist' above was not meant in terms of this list itself, but the fact that the list of Caucasian Americans was undergoing speedy delete as being superfluous whilst this one was standing unchallenged, as though there was something inherently more notable about being a "notable African American" than being a "notable Caucasian American". For the person who asked if this nomination is racially motivated, I am neither African, African American, Caucasian, Caucasian American nor American, and really don't care overly about any of you at all (which, please note, should make me "indifferent" and not "un-American").<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarteck_a95b.html" title="User:Warteck">Warteck</a> 04:28, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In spite of Usedup's recent nomination, it seems that the concensus of those voting delete is that the list is too broad and too large. I agree, but as some have noted, these lists are terribly useful. Especially this one, as each entry includes a few words on who the person is. From the AfD of other lists, one commenter noted, "as the anonymous parent of two Puerto Rican schoolchildren, I can assure you that this list is a primary source of information that at least one of my kids will consult on a weekly basis to do school assignments. Administrators should take into account the users' needs and, as a user, this list is invaluable!" As such, I think that we should try sorting and any category that is overlarge we should send into a sublist. Even if this list is deleted in its current form, it will probably become a super-list of lists organized by occupation. If anyone is interested, stop by <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_List_of_African_Americans_6e35.html" title="User:Smmurphy/List of African Americans">User:Smmurphy/List of African Americans</a> and do some sorting. Once its sorted, we can create sublist articles for the larger lists, and put whats left back into this article.
