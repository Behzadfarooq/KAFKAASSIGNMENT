<p>The result of the debate was <b>well, bugger</b>. Okay. Deep breaths.

<p>Although there is a strong contingent of people arguing for deletion, there is no <i>consensus</i> to do so. Also, in all the arguing for deletion, there aren't really that many persuasive points towards deleting the <i>content</i> – it's all about deleting the page, because we don't like what the creator's about. Okay. My personal sympathies, after reading around a bit, lie towards merging into <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">Motorized bicycle</a> and leaving a redirect at <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Motorized_bicycle_history_a8e0.html" title="Timeline of Motorized bicycle history">Timeline of Motorized bicycle history</a>. But there doesn't seem to be a consensus to do that, based on this AfD, and you don't need the help of AfD or admins to do it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 18:07, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm going to agree that this article has <i>huge</i> prospect for expansion, and should be a very useful article in its own right with just a little more info. There is a wealth of info available on the subject, and there's NO REASON this timeline should not contain 20+ events, keep it and watch. <b>EDIT</b> I must add that this page...</li>
<li>Does not contain original research, everything here has sources, or is common knowledge, if does not have a link to an outside source, you can google it and you will find the information to back up these points.</li>

<dd>I am not "attacking" anyone. It is common on Wikipedia to point out information such as this, to help the closing administrator, who must decide which votes will be considered valid and which won't for the purposes of evaluating a deletion vote.

<dd>So a vote from anybody who's opinion on the subject differs from your own is considered invalid? Or?... Taking the page for what it is, it's pretty obvious the consideration for deletion has little if anything to do with the page itself.

<dd>Your comment above is unseemly and insulting. I never made any such suggestions. Generally, a user with less than 100 edits under its belt doesn't get counted as part of an AFD, because of the potential for gaming the system. As I said before, it is common practice to point out when a very new editor is voting in an AFD, since the closing administrator must make a call as to what votes get counted. Note that I said <b>the closing administrator</b> -- which will not be me. So your comment above is not only insulting, it's just plain wrong. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 03:44, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry if my comment seemed directed at you, I was commenting on the whole deletion process for the motorized bicycle timeline in general, regardless of your opinion on whether or not it should be kept, you can surely see that at this point the discussion of deletion is wholly silly. As for discounting of one's opinion on such, your initial response to my vote seemed to have no other purpose than to attempt and write me off as some sort of lackey for cyclepat - whereas you could have simply pointed out that I was a newly registered member. I'm sorry if my pointing this out has offended you, but maybe a more careful choice of words on your part could have prevented me from taking it in that light.

<dd>I only registered so I could comment in here without being a stranger. I've been writing for this site for a long time, I wrote the original stub for the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subaru_360.html" title="Subaru 360">Subaru 360</a> amongst other things primarily automotive in nature. I will reiterate that this article should not be deleted. If that means it has to be merged with another article, fine, but it will grow and and eventually will just clutter up whatever article it is attached to.

<dd>To answer your question, K-111, the reason for deleting it is that it was created by CyclePat against consensus. It is one of three articles he's created, each one apparently attempting to get his <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> across.</dd>
<dd>Now, do you mean keep <i>this</i> article, a <b>timeline of the motorized bicycle</b>, defined as a bicycle which has a motor but is rideable without use of the motor, or do you mean keep <i>a timeline</i> for the powered two-wheeler, including motorised bikes, autocycles, mopeds, scooters and motorcycles (which this is not)? Or do you mean keep <i>a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_transportation_technology.html" title="Timeline of transportation technology">timeline of transportation technology</a></i>, which will also include these milestones? Or do you mean keep <i>an article</i> on the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and its history - from your comments it seems that CyclePat forgot to tell you that this already exists, and that most of the delete voters here are actively engaged in expanding that article and adding history, something with which your help would be most welcome (and in the related <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">moped</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycle</a> articles, I'm guessing). - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 11:49, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am aware of the motorized bicycle page, and I have already done work on the moped page in the past. While this timeline could be merged with the motorized bicycle page, I feel that eventually it will become too bulky as more events are added. Perhaps it could be merged now, and then moved back to a seperate page when that happens? Either way I don't see any good reason to delete it. I don't see any need for a war against two pages that complement each other very nicely.<a href="../../../k/-/1/User%7EK-111_51fb.html" title="User:K-111">User:K-111</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The page title is incorrectly capitalized. There are many Wikipedia formatting errors and there are also spelling and punctuation errors. There are insufficient wikilinks, and those that are included haven't been checked, because two of them need disambiguating. There is a reliance on in-line external links, which are generally frowned on, but aren't actually against policy.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The items in the timeline are generally trivial, and not the sort of significant events that are usually recorded in timelines. Of itself, this isn't necessarily of concern because there are no hard and fast rules.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The general style of the timeline is out of keeping with (some/most) other timelines (that I've seen) in that it builds sentences for the items, rather than providing wikilinks to articles that expand on the event in question.</dd>

<dd>I've reviewed the discussions here and elsewhere – <i>please note: discussions would be better off on the talk page so that the admin who decides doesn't have a hard time untangling the voting</i> – and my conclusion is that this information would be far better off as prose style in the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> article. I don't have the background (or, sadly, the inclination) to tidy up the errors.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> No grounds for deletion. As an active author on <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">Motorized bicycle</a> I think <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a> wants to do a merger/delete. This article is a stub. Wiki policy state that a stub should be <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_improving_articles_602d.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to improving articles">expanded</a>. Someone once said "the wise man recognizes that he doesn't necessarily have knowledge about everything." This article does have "prospect for expansion." I hope you may understand that this article was created for that reason. Some users, such as <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a>, comes in and immediately censors everything (both here and in the article) (*definitely* relevant to the dispute), and the existing conflict is much broader. For example, the history of this article has been in dispute ever since its merger from <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycle.html" title="Electric bicycle">electric bicycle</a>. But back to the main issue at hand, some want to have the article completed before its even started. ("Don't put the horses before the buggy") This article is new. Please allow some time for other users to include their knowledge, facts and sources. The article is a branch of the transportation time-line. It appears that "time-lines", in general on wikipedia, unavoidably repeat most of its information in their sister related articles, hence, a merge/delete is totally inappropriate. Also, as suggested, adding all the information pertinent only to "motorized bicycles" (that will eventually be in the time-line) would drastically bog down the main transportation time-line and is much more inappropriate. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 01:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><s><b>Delete</b>, then</s>. Note that the above is the author. I think it's generally bad form for authors and nominators to vote, but to balance the author vote I add one delete. The article as it stands is negligble, and much of what needs to go in there has yet to be sourced. What there is is small and will easily fit in the main article. This article as it stands contains three events, <i>none of which has any demonstrated significance</i> in the history of the motorised bicycle. Your assertion that I am "censoring" the article is ludicrous. All you have to do is provide some independently verifiable evidence that the events you keep banging on about are significant tot he global development of the motorised bicycle, and in they go. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 11:43, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> for other AfD watchers: the timeline currently has exactly three items: invention of the wheel (3500 BC), speculation re the first ever (unmotorized) bicycle in 1816, and the author's pet firm, a small Canadian manufacturer of no discernible wider importance, adding a commercial aftermarket motor to a delivery bike in the 1940s (or 1930s, the author doesn't seem too clear on that). If the article stays:
<ul>
<li>invention of the wheel gets removed, as pointless and irrelevant to the development of the motorised bicycle</li>
<li>speculation re the first <i>unmotorised</i> bicycle gets deleted as irrelevant to the history of the <i>motorised</i> bicycle</li>
<li>addition of a motor to a delivery bike made by a small Canadian manufacturer gets deleted as unverified since despite numerous requests the person who added it has failed to cite any authority to show that this event had any influence beyond the company itself (in whose article it can undoubtedly be covered), precisely the reason it was removed from the parent article in the first place.</li>
<li>other events have yet to be referenced, since neither the author of the timeline article nor any of the authors of the main article have yet succeeded in getting authoritative documentation on this - it is a sideline to the bicycle and the motorcycle, so has not been studied in any great detail.</li>
</ul>

It doesn't have its place because I have no points to make. I simply want to have a nice timeline article. Again, I am being labeled by "jus zis guy". He's attempting to colour my character as if it was all my fault, because I start an article. "Rock the boat." Really, I think he has jumped the gun on this one. As soon as the article was started he decided it needed deleting. It now appears that for Katefan, Woohookity, and jus zis guy, every article edit or creation I try to do, related to motorized bicycle, is grounds for deletion just because its me. Eventually it is then put back in anyway, sometimes right away, sometimes 2 months later (and by them). Crazy arguments like this for every single subject edit! This is turning into harrasement. (But, I guess that normal practice according to these editors and I've not seem the the rest of it (in the context of people wanting to destroy recent edits and articles, according to the way I do it)) I think we're lacking a little faith here.

<dd><b>comment</b>: If there is not a timeline for automobiles or motorcycles, then that is more of an argument for making timelines for those subjects, rather than for deleting this timeline. As for the idea that timelines are only good for broad subjects - we have a quite a comprehensive timeline devoted to <i>electromagnetism</i> and another one devoted to artificial satellites, both of those subjects are highly specialized, but that does not mean that they are not useful in their own right. Also, I don't care about cyclepat, his past history here, or any of that garbage.

<dd>(somone might recognize this from his/her user page)(I think it's actually a good mediation) A timeline is defined as: a) "chronology"... but it may also be b) "representation or exhibit of key events within a particular historical period, often consisting of illustrative visual material accompanied by written commentary, arranged chronologically."<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=timeline" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=timeline" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I think that's where we where differing in opinion. If we take your interpretation of the definition, then you would are possibly correct in saying CCM bicycle doesn't deserve a spot. However, what is a key event? (I think you said the answer to that somewhere else, already) I've indicated elsewhere, that it feels almost like original research or (bias selections) being able to pick and chose. (devils advocat here!) What make you able to discern what information is worthy of notation. As you have said you don't have enough information on the subject. (I don't either, which is why I didn't want to try and speculate if that information was worthy of inclusion). I put the information in as per the a) definition. (and good faith, assuming this information must have some type of influence on the motorized bicycle since it is from a notable source such as the Museum of science and tech of Canada). Chronology could have 3 meaning according to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chronology" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chronology" rel="nofollow">this dictionary</a>. The 3rd one says: "A chronological list or table." (Which make me think... perhaps the name should be Chronological list of motorized bicycles&#160;?) And we know what chronological means right?<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chronological" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chronological" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> So please don't consider this me trying to prove a point, I was trully trying to get some usuful information into an appropriat article.

<dd>I must disagree with your judgement of "trivial milestone" - each thing in the timeline is worth noting and was chosen to give a well rounded representation of bike motor technology over the decades. Both historical significance and technological innovation were considered. The mechanical design as well was significant in the selection of machines listed here, as I tried to include motors that featured roller drive, belt drive, or were sold as complete motor wheels, giving good representation of all the most <i>important</i> motors that have ever been produced. If we wanted to include "trivial milestones" we could easily have over 100 of them listed on this timeline. But as creating as large a list as possible is not the point, the list is tidy and trim. <a href="../../../k/-/1/User%7EK-111_51fb.html" title="User:K-111">User:K-111</a></dd>

I believe it is likely that this "timeline" article will be moved to a new title and focus, and widened to include a cross-linked history of the development of at least motorised bicycles, mopeds and scooters, and probably motorcycles as well since the distinction is in many cases arbitrary.
