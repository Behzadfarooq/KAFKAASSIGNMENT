<li>Everyone agerees with this, i think. But what constitutes "notability". Is there such a thing as a real school that is not notable? <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 04:55, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, this school exists, it is a real school. It is even a fairly good school. It is also completely non-notable outside the local area. Not even everyone who lives in the school district knows of its existance. It happens that I live near this achool, and I assure you, the only notability it has is strictly local. It is also an <b>Elementary</b> school, with no students over 10 years of age. If we say that this school should pass VfD, we are in effect approving a policy that: <i>Any and every school the actual existance of which can be verified is notable enough for a Wikipedia article.</i> That isn't what our policy says now, at elast not in theory. Is that now our policy in practice? I think it shouldn't be. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 04:52, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per DES. To quote from the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a> article, "[t]he program has recognized more than 3,000 schools since its inception." I highly doubt that 3,000 schools deserve their own articles. I'm sure this is a great school, but I think it would be best suited as a (sub)section of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Windsor_Township%2C_New_Jersey_6119.html" title="West Windsor Township, New Jersey">West Windsor Township, New Jersey</a> article; perhaps as part of the education section. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity"><b>my</b></a><a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysekurity_22b6.html" title="User talk:Mysekurity">sekurity</a> 05:09, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia has thousands and thousands of articles about ships. Most ships are less notable than any school, but those articles never get nominated.

<li><b>Keep</b>, there should be a policy that schools are notable. Just like we'll add infinitely many towns, villages, etc. There might be information that someone would care to look up.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> if they are so notable, then editors would express more interest in them and be able to at least provide noteable alumni. I don't consider work to prevent a VfD removing the article as interest in the article. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 06:40, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not easy to find alumni of primary schools. Work to prevent Vfds removing articles is work to defend wikipedia users against editors who don't seem to have their interests at heart. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:02, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right on one point - the lack of alumni lists show that no-one cares. The cabal for unconditional keeps on the other hand is subversion of the vfd process through highly organised voting and intimidation of people with sense. It is therefore against wiki principles. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 17:12, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The principal of this wiki is that material should not be deleted without consensus. Although there is obviously no consensus to delete schools, unfortunately it is necessary to demonstrate that fact to the "people with sense" on a daily basis. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:22, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
