<li><b>Delete</b> Notability of high schools has long been a contentious subject. I reside in the camp that believes they are not inherently notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> per the consensus that has emerged every time someone tries to start another 'schools war' - that high schools are inherently notable due to their size. Plus the fact that the strong possibility that a POTUS went there means that (regardless of whether you agree that high schools are notable or not) it is imperative we keep it until this can be verified or disproved. <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynical_3d57.html" title="User:Cynical">Cynical</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: William McKinley, did apparently <i>not</i> go to this High School, so this can be struck (he was born in Niles, but moved at an early age to Poland (the city in Ohio, that is&#160;:-) ) <a href="http://www.mckinley.lib.oh.us/mckidley/homeworkhelp/Historyinourbackyard.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mckinley.lib.oh.us/mckidley/homeworkhelp/Historyinourbackyard.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:03, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, it is never imperative that anything be kept while awaiting verification. That is, in fact, a vioation of one of Wikipedia's core policies.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: I have the (minority) opinion that high schools aren't automatically notable, but I agree that the chance that they are notable is much higher than for primary schools (for starters, there are fewer high schools). If some more interesting info can be found, i would not strongly oppose keeping it.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- William McKinley actually moved out of Niles because his family wanted to be in a community where there was more than an elementary school. His father, William McKinley Sr., by the way, was on the equivalent of the board of education in Niles. WP:SCHOOLS is not a policy as has been said and high schools are inherently important. That crazy poet in Niles apparently grew up there and may have gone to the school, but I couldn't find anything on that on the Web.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:54, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>The article does not present evidence of notability, although it sounds like an ok school. I do not subscribe to the notion that all high schools are notable, any more than all elementary schools, all churches, all supermarkets, or all post offices are. The information here could just as well be presented in an article about the town. Come back and insert an article when there is an article with important verifiable facts leading us to the conclusion that the school is notable. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
