<p>Another user - User:Dustinroolez - added a prod tag to this article and listed it on AFD, without creating the AFD discussion page. I switched the prod to an afd and created this discussion page as a procedural nomination so that the AFD would be properly formed. As for my opinion on the matter, the only hits are from Wikipedia ... so this may be a hoax ... I vote <b>delete</b> unless someone can show that it isn't. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:15, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not believe this article was intended as a hoax, however it is in my opinion a non-notable neologism and one that really is not in common use. Acting roles are played by multiple actors all the time, it has been common for decades, and most audiences can cope with it without too much trouble. I can see this article becoming another horrible list type article where, because the inclusion criteria is vague and cannot be verified, people go in add all their favourite pop-culture items which can then never be deleted because who can say with any authority what should and shouldn't be allowed? User:Dustinroolez created the article himself so if the deletion procedure wasn't properly followed that's probably just an honest mistake. <b>No vote</b>. Format 23:40, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe this is a valid subject, whether it be named "Sargent York Syndrome" or something else. I've heard it referred to as "Darrin Syndrome" or as something similar. Bear in mind, people on the 'net who are probably likely to use the term are not likely to spell the names correctly (users on movie forums are not exaclty known for great spelling; just a side note), ie: "Darren" is a more common spelling of the name; also "Sargent" is more than likely to be spelled "Sergeant," so a Google search may not be decisive at first glance. Anyway, his college professor taught it, so it must be somewhat verifiable. Just my "two cents." <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 03:29, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable neologism in danger of becoming a pointless list-cruft article. The same character being played by different actors in different series/films is not notable, unusal, or interesting. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Johnson_fe0a.html" title="User:Robin Johnson">Robin Johnson</a> 11:02, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think the situation is certainly notable and discussable, but the term looks to be less well known than I thought. How about changing it to "Darrin Syndrome?" Dustin 22:51, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you get rid of the Lazarus one, someone will add every bit of that back into the original Chuck Cunningham Syndrome article. The Lazarus thing broke off as a separate article to help make the Chuck article better organized. That Chuck article, although it has obviously appealed to a lot of contributors, is an ever-growing mess.

<li><b>Rename</b>. It should be Darrin Syndrome. People talk about Darrin Syndrome. Recasts on other shows constantly get compared to the Darrin recast. In fact, there are plenty of cultural references to it, like when Becky got recast on <i>Roseanne</i> and the characters talked about the Darrin recast. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 20:07, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Does not need a specific article. If the article remains we will forever be trimming down an ever-growing list of multiple and only vaguely relevant examples, like what constantly happens on <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_Shark_a9f8.html" title="Jumping the Shark">Jumping the Shark</a>; or merely a vague list like Lazarus Cunningham. The recast of Darrin on <i><a href="../../../b/e/w/Bewitched.html" title="Bewitched">Bewitched</a></i> was itself notable, and that can be, and is, mentioned and discussed on the <i>Bewitched</i> page.
