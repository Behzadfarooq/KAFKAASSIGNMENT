<dd>It's got nothing to do with 9/11 happening in America. It just happened to be a very well-known and larger terrorist attack. If we have a separate wiki for those victims (all 2000-3000 of them), I don't see why we should mention the victims of the Madrid bombings in Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:12, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I found it useful when checking to see if any if my Spanish aquaintances had died</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; I am the person who made this article. I just want to explain why I think the English Wikipedia should have such an article. However, of course, if you think that this page should be deleted, go on. (Interested people can check this information in the Spanish version, if they understand Spanish.)
<ul>
<li>1) Most people argues that <i>"Wikipedia is not a memorial"</i>. Well, <b>this article should not be considered as a memorial page</b>, but as a page with additional information about the Madrid bombings. If you consider that the names of the people who died in Madrid are not relevant for Wikipedia, you can delete these names, but at least keep the information about the victims (for instance, why does usually appear the name of Francisco Javier Torrenteras between the people who died, although he did not die in the bombings; or why at first officially the media spoke about 202 casualties, instead of the real number, 190; or the fact that died people of 17 nationalities... etc). If this page is deleted, I think that this information should be added to the <a href="../../../1/1/_/11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings_1d6c.html" title="11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings">Madrid bombings article</a>, but, in order not to excede the amount of information that appears there, I think that the better solution is a page about the persons who dead there.
<p>I understand that, as the names of the victims takes up most of the article, many people could think that it is a memorial, but if you read it, you will see that there is more information (that has to be emproved and expanded, I know).</p>
</li>
<li>2) Before I made this article, I saw that someone (I don't know who), added in the <a href="../../../1/1/_/11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings_1d6c.html" title="11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings">Madrid bombings article</a>, in the "See also" section, this hidden line:
<p>&lt;!-- * [[Casualties of the 11 March 2004 Madrid bombings]] --&gt;</p>
(as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=33405611" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=33405611" rel="nofollow">you can see in this edition of an <b>old version</b> of the article</a>), <b>claiming for such an article</b>.</li>
<li>3) <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_7486.html" title="User:Pádraic MacUidhir">P.MacUidhir</a> argues that <i>"Bombings are not unusual, and certainly not usually notable"</i>. I agree, bombings are not notable. But not all bombings are the same! Sadly, <a href="../../../e/t/a/ETA_5e56.html" title="ETA">ETA</a> is responsible for most bombings in Spain, but <b>the Madrid March 11 bombings were not at all usual</b>. It was the worse Al-Qaida attack in Europe. There died almost four times more people than in the <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_July_2005_London_bombings_2280.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">7 July London bombings</a>. Millions of persons took part in the demonstrations against terrorism the day after (more or less the 28% of the Spanish population). Many poeple think that there was a political change in Spain because of these bombings (they happened three days before the March 14 general elections), and that the authors aimed this change; other people think that the former goverment lied supporting that ETA was the author of the attacks until the last moment, as they could lose the elections because of their support to the Bush' invasion of Iraq (it is still a very hot subject, and I don't want to give my opinion here, I just speak about the opinion of many people). I only want to say that obviously the Madrid bombings are, sadly, once again, a historical event, not only in Spain, but worldwide, such as the London bombings, the 9/11 or the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_U.S._embassy_bombings_9e25.html" title="1998 U.S. embassy bombings">1998 U.S. embassy bombings</a> in Kenya and Tanzania. I am not speaking in this point about the number of persons who died, but just about the importance and consequences of the event.</li>
<li>4) I saw that there was an article about the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casualties_of_the_7_July_2005_London_bombings_233a.html" title="Casualties of the 7 July 2005 London bombings">casualties of the 7 July 2005 London bombings</a>, with the names of all the victims, and I thought that <b>there should be an equivalent article with the Madrid victims</b>. I don't want to think that nationalism should be so important in Wikipedia (when we speak about worldwide events), and the terrorism victims in England should not be more or less important than those who died in Spain. I saw too that there is an <a href="../../../../es/v/%C3%AD/c/V%C3%ADctimas_de_los_atentados_del_7_de_julio_de_2005_en_Londres_579e.html" class="extiw" title="es:Víctimas_de_los_atentados_del_7_de_julio_de_2005_en_Londres">article about the London victims in the Spanish wikipedia</a>, without the names (in my opinion this article lacks those names). Nevertheless, in the 9/11 died thousands of men and women, and I think that it is better there an external link, not because those persons were less important, but just because it would be too large; but maybe some persons who died in the 9/11 should appear in wikipedia (the many firefighters who died there? People who saved other people? For instance, William Rodríguez became famous, but he didn't die there). I think that the queston is not as simple as "there should appear all victims of terrorist attacks or none of them".</li>
<li>5) I made the article, as every article, thinking about it as a starting point. So, it should be extended and improved by other wikipedians. For example (as in the July London attacks), who died in each place (the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atocha.html" title="Atocha">Atocha Station</a>, or El Pozo, or Santa Eugenia, or the Téllez Street)? How many? Where were first carried? What does <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilar_Manj%C3%B3n_1578.html" title="Pilar Manjón">Pilar Manjón</a> (president of the Association for the victims of 11-M) think about the political reactions? These questions maybe could be too much for the principal article, but not for an article about victims, and it could contain interesting information for wikipedia. I think that <b>there should be a page of the same quality as that one about the London attacks</b>, and I hope that it will be so. I only contribute with my knowledge. I don't know many things about the London attacks, so I can't speak about them.</li>

<li>On re-reading the article's actual content, <b>keep</b> the article but the list/memorial/whatever you want to call it should be deleted. Keeping it would lead us to assume that you can't have a list of victims if the death toll is too small to be 'notable', and you can't have it if it's too big to include without disrupting the article. That would be bizarre logic to say the least. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 17:41, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per the precedent cited by Ecemaml, however I <i><b>strongly recommend</b></i> that a policy be developed to create a criteria for this sort of thing otherwise anytime an event like this happens -- major or minor -- someone will want to do a list article.
