<li><b>Comment</b>. User:Mutai's only edits have been on Poosa, Sewer baby, Mike Etoll, and Image:Lunginsewer.jpg, and the delete discussions for the three articles.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Dalbury, what's your point? Mutai edits and comments on what's important instead of spending his time as a professional critic. The Lunginsewer image is mine and I gave permission for its use. - User:Poosa 16:55, 4 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I did not mark the Lunginsewer image as a copyright violation. Someone else did that. Wikipedia has strict rules on the use of images. If you are the photographer who took this photo, you must release it into one of the available licenses, preferably the GFDL, and show that in the Image:Lunginsewer.jpg page. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> 08:20, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A D Monroe III states that there is "No verifiable claim to notability" in reference to my artical. What constitutes notability? Is my popularity strictly determined by how often my name appears on a google search? A D Monroe makes an absolute claim with this statement, a claim that <b>is</b> unverifiable and meaningless due to the simple fact that it is not true. -Mike Etoll</p>

<dd>Welcome to Wikipedia, Mike Etoll. Have you read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia's policy on Verifiability</a>? Your notability is determined by neither me nor you; by definition, it's determined by the public at large. If you can provide links or references to public acknowledgements of your accomplishments, then your notability is verifiable, and I'll change my vote. Without those references, it's unverifiable. It's that simple. (Note that acknowledgements made by you or on your behalf don't count as "public at large".) --<a href="../../../a/_/d/User%7EA_D_Monroe_III_2a7e.html" title="User:A D Monroe III">A D Monroe III</a> 21:49, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Hey AD,</b> As far as I am concerned, we are both part of the "public at large". Is this statement untrue? Mike Etoll 14:55, 8 November 2005 (UTC) I can provide verification of my accomplishments for you, or else you can do a search on my name. For example,I created illustrations for the book <i>Six Galleons for the King of Spain: Imperial Defense in the Early Seventeenth Century</i> By Carla Rahn Phillips 1987, wrote an icon in '94 for an Orthodox church to work off my community service hours for breaking the law (I am now reformed). Things like this are hard to prove through internet searches, and may also seem insignificant but not only are they true, they are also uncommon accomplishments. The public at large will determine if things like this merit fame. All you are asking for is verification of my accomplishments, and this evidence exists even if it is not fully recorded on the internet. Mike Etoll 14:55, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It may <i>appear</i> as though all of the users posting and editing here are the same, but this claim is not true. I have not deleted one post, or altered any of the comments here illlegally. Please trace my IP from this posted comment (if you wish) and in the future, please do a more thorough job investigating your subjects before you make claims concerning their validity. It is unwise to state something as fact unless you know that your statement is 100% true, and in this case Dalbury, you are wrong. -Mike Etoll
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for pointing that out. My apologies for the error. You are posting from IP address 65.25.215.205, as have persons signing as User:blorch, User:Tom Paulson and User:Samuel Payne. I recommend that you sign in to Wikipedia before editing, and then sign comments in these dicussions by typing four consecutive tildes (~~~~). Among other things, doing both steps will hide your IP address. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> 22:42, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
