<li><b>keep</b> This isn't just a random small town racecourse. I agree with the premise if it WAS, but this raceway does receive some independant press.

<li><b>Delete</b> two factors which would have convinced me on possible notiablity even though it lacks substancial media coverage. 1. Geographic connection it location Akela Flats, New Mexico is a red link so no article about there. The two towns its <i>roughly between</i> have articles yet neither mention the Raceway. 2. IMHO the best of the references is about a track record yet that person, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Chandler_e0a3.html" title="Doug Chandler">Doug Chandler</a> doesnt have an article either.

<li><b>reply</b> notability cannot be established or refuted inside the context of Wikipedia. Wikipedia isn't exhaustive on any subject.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It is mentioned in several independent publications, even as the site of a race.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Merely being the site of notable races does not automatically confer notability -- it's the races which are notable, not the racecourse. An article on the racecourse itself should ideally be supported by sources that are about the racecourse itself, not the races that take place there. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:14, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It is notable because the races are notable. A race course article is mostly about the races held there. This article needs to be improved with the history of series racing and other notable races there. If you look at <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway_deed.html" title="Indianapolis Motor Speedway">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a>, arguably the most notable race course in the US, for example, and cut out all of the parts pertaining to the races run there, it won't be that much bigger than this article.

<li><b>reply</b> Regardless of the specifics in the individual notability criteria like WP:CRIC, we should NOT delete any article that we can find substantive information on in reliable sources. Regardless of his level of play, this cricketer shows up in MANY sources with non-trivial coverage. While every List A player from an Affiliate nation <i>may not</i> be notable, this one clearly is. Notability should never be based on a a strictly binary arguement (such as "all articles that meet this one criteria are ALL notable/any that do not are NEVER notable). While such guidelines help point us towards <i>further investigation</i> we should not make such claims when further investigation bears out notability. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 06:17, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b>. <s>Why is Nate Ilaoa not an article? NCAA football coaches have considered him important and "prominent" in the UH offense.

He is a "prominent" figure in UH football.</s> Although team prominence is important, player prominence is important as well. Thus my decision. Also, WP:BIO mentions requirement "tests".

<li>Why is Nate Ilaoa not an article, you ask? The answer appears to be "because nobody has written an article about him". One might suggest that the fact that people care enough about Adnan Ilyas to write an article about him, but don't care enough about Nate Ilaoa to write an article about <i>him</i>, is an adequate indication of relative notability. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the point here is that these are two entirely separate questions. Whether Adnan Ilyas is deserving of an article should be decided on its own merits (I am not voting, but I will commend the research Jayron did here); if Nate Ilaoa is deserving of an article, start one. If you don't have time to really do it up right, create a stub. But "X doesn't deserve an article because Y doesn't have one" is not the right way to look at it. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 01:53, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I'm not entirely happy that a player who's appeared at no higher level than the ICC Trophy (which is, after all, very much a second-string international competition) is going to be notable.

However, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cricket_Council_b676.html" title="International Cricket Council">ICC</a> have deemed the 2005 (and onward) ICC Trophy to be worthy of List A status, and given that fact I think on balance he should stay. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 02:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

My understanding of Immanion: it was originally a vehicle to keep a particular SF/Fantasy author's books in print (Her name escapes me at the moment.)

<li>You mean: "Founded in 1959 by Thomas D. Clareson, Extrapolation was published at the College of Wooster until 1979 when it moved to the Kent State University Press. A decade later, Clareson stepped down as editor and was succeeded by Donald M. Hassler of the KSU English Department. In 2002 it moved to the University of Texas at Brownsville in Brownsville, Texas. At that time Donald M. Hassler became executive editor, and the position of editor was filled by Javier A. Martinez of UTB's English Department. The journal was the first to publish academic work on science fiction and fantasy and continues to be a leader in that specialized genre in the literature of popular culture." "Extrapolation is published quarterly by University of Texas, Brownsville. Subscription Rates: $18 one year, $34 two years individual; $28 one year, $54 two years institutional" What is your point??

<p>Taylor Ellwood contacted me today and requested that I disclose that a group I am part of declined his offer to publish one of our projects on Immanion. Though I thought I made it clear to him in our brief exchange that the reason for our declining his offer was the details I give above (plus other shortcomings of the press I did not detail) he seems to believe this is a personal issue. He says he and I know each other. However, AFAIK, our contact was limited to two e-mails, IIRC, where he laid out details of the offer, my colleagues and I asked him questions about the press, and after research and discussion among ourselves, we decided to decline. Mr. Ellwood and I do know a few people in common, as is common in the small pond of the Pagan community, but we have never met and I really know very little about him beyond those brief e-mails. You can see our recent exchange <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html#Taylor_Ellwood_AfD" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">here</a> on my talk page. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna">Kathryn NicDhàna</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a>♦<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a> 22:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As another note of disclosure, I was part of the group (eight co-authors) Kathryn mentioned above that declined Taylor (as editor) and Immanion's offer to publish our project. I had no interchange with Taylor except for reading a couple of e-mails that were forwarded to the whole group. I did much of the research into Immanion which informed our group's decision to decline Taylor's offer. The information I found at that time is why I'm not inclined to view it as a significant press. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b>Pigman</b></a> (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Pigman_6033.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Pigman">contribs</a>) 22:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's not the quality of the article that's in question (it certainly isn't as bad as the UK AA). It's the notability of the organisation. On that question: exactly 4 google hits from less than 4 different sites, even counting very similar results as separate; no apparent third-party coverage.

<li><b>Comment</b>. 1. Please sign your posts using four tildes. 2. 80 ghits doesn't add up to notability either. 3. 'Astrological association is astrological asociacition, no matter where it is' is not an argument for keeping the article, or even a reply to anything I or anyone has said. The issues are <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. I'm sure the organisation is a fine one, but that doesn't have anything to do with whether it should have a wikipedia article. 4. You're quite right that I speak no Bulgarian, but that isn't an argument for keeping this article. 5. Am I right that your username indicates a connection with the organisation? If so, that also raises the problem of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>.

<li>thanks for your comment. yes, I am from Bulgaria, and that is why I know something about this organization. In Wiki has an article <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrological_associations.html" title="Astrological associations">Astrological associations</a> and there was only one link who redirect to UK Astrological asociaction. Now there is two articles. And must have many more. And I dont understand why someone want in this article <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrological_associations.html" title="Astrological associations">Astrological associations</a> to have only ONE organization - UK. And I think that this is not right. Astrologbg 21:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)Astrologbg</li>

<li><b>reply to Astrologbg</b> 1) before you assume people are descriminating against you, please read the following policy: <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Do so by clicking on the blue link. Understand that we are discussing this deletion proposal <i>dispassionately</i> and <i>without prejudice</i>. 2) At issue is not the existance of the association, its nature, why it exists, or even what it does. None of those are criteria for the <i>worthiness</i> of the article. We need <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">references</a> in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to show that the article contains information that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and that the subject matter is <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notable</a>. I have linked words in this reply to specific wikipedia policies by which we are judging this article. If you wish to keep the article, improve it, and I and probably many others would be willing to change our vote. 3) The existance of other deletable articles at wikipedia do NOT mean that this one should be kept. If, in your exploration of wikipedia, you have found other articles YOU think are unworthy, please nominate them for deletion. But the existance of such articles has no bearing on this one. Bring it up to standard as is spelled out in the above policies, or let it go. 4) The existance of other articles about similar associations articles here means nothing. They may also be deletable, or they may have reliable references to the information they contain. Understand that deleting an article has NOTHING to do with what the article is about, only with whether the information contained therin is notable, verifiable, and reliable. Please click the polices I have linked to learn more so you can make the article better. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 21:29, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Parliament_election%2C_2007_af84.html" title="Scottish Parliament election, 2007">2007 election</a> has not even taken place yet. This article has no content and nothing can be added but speculation until the 2007 election occurs. The article really serves no purpose until that election occurs.

<dd>A party will win? Nonsense. The planned elections will be disrupted by the Scottish War of Independence (June 2009 - September 2012).

<li><s><b>Delete</b> all per nom</s> except <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammy_Plante_0f04.html" title="Tammy Plante">Tammy Plante</a>; posing nude for any of the multitudes of <i>Playboy</i> publications does not bestow notability (and Plante is the only one to have accomplished something more). Being the centerfold brings notability, but that's because those women are the central focus of an entire issue, the role of the centerfold and of <i>Playboy</i> Playmates has immense pop culture significance, and the magazine focuses on the identity of the Playmates (and on remembering their identity even years later) in a manner not true of the legions of comparably anonymous women who pose for the "special editions." <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 23:12, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's no article to explain "Coed of the Month" but based on the Coed of the Week category description it appears to me that it doesn't qualify as an "award" as defined by the WP:PORNBIO criteria. It seems more like a bunch of women are presented each week on the Playboy Cyber Club website and the users pick one for the week and then the month. Someone with more familiarity than I with the website may have more insight but I don't believe that being named Coed of the Week or Month establishes notability in and of itself. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:32, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jaime_Hammer_6244.html" title="Jaime Hammer">Jaime Hammer</a>, <b>neutral</b> on the others. Hammer has appeared on the cover (either alone or as one of three models) of Playboy Special Editions magazines three times between 2004 and 2006. All three times she was identified by name (full name twice, first name once) on the cover itself. This implies that she has some name recognition and celebrity at least within the context of the Playboy magazine readership, as opposed to being some fly-by-night model who is never heard from again. Although she is not an actress or television personality, her repeated appearances on magazine covers should be considered "multiple features in popular culture publications" which would qualify an actress for an article under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<p>I wrote a wikipedia article today on York Rainbow Peace Camp, which I consider to have been the indicator of an astonishingly rapid rise in the amount and depth of anti-capitalist militancy in York, England in the year 2003. Prior to this, York could be considered somewhat politically apathetic, especially in terms of direct action and popular engagement in politics outside of the big 3 political parties.</p>
<p>The article is already being considered for deletion. I hope to defend its inclusion in wikipedia, as follows:</p>
<p>It is unsurprising that York Rainbow Peace Camp is not mentioned in the online media searches which have been conducted, as the "official" name of the camp was "York Rainbow Village Peace Camp" (I omitted the word "Village" in the title by accident), but the name never quite caught on anyway, and it was usually referred to locally as "the peace camp", since there was no other peace camp nearby.</p>
<p>Also, we at the camp scarcely saw it as a priority to woo the corporate-owned mass media. However, York's dominant local paper, "The Evening Press" did give us a surprising amount of coverage, and a search for peace camp in their archive ( <a href="http://www.thisisyork.co.uk/archive/" class="external free" title="http://www.thisisyork.co.uk/archive/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisisyork.co.uk/archive/</a> ) brought up 9 relevant hits;</p>

<p>There was also a hit about a more recent peace camp in York, when Archbishop John Sentamu held a marathon prayer vigil in a blue tent inside York Minster, at the time of the Israel-Lebanon conflict. This is dated 15th Aug 2006. No evidence has been found that he was directly inspired by the events of 2003, but it could be postulated that a tradition may be emerging in the city.</p>
<p>Also, plugging a search for "peace hotel" into the same archive search engine will bring up more articles from the newspaper, as will searches for the names "Lara Saunders", "Ruby Robinson" and "Sky Sunshine Robinson", 3 activists who died tragically during the period in which the peace camp was active.</p>
<p>If my article is allowed to remain on wikipedia, I hope that I might be permitted to dedicate it to them.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks to whoever suggested the deletion, as having to support my article's inclusion has inspired me to find additional sources which can be used to bring the article up to scratch.</p>

<p>i was at the York Peace Camp and the article is accurate. The local newspaper references should support this. i have some photos of the Peace hotel i would like to put on the page, so would like it to remain. i do not think that because this was a real event with real people and not televised or in a previous book it should be deleted. it is more valid than much of the stuff on wicipedia which is pretty irrelevant and petty.</p>
<p>i think the author has overemphasised the role of people with mental health problems, as only a few people at the camp and hotel were such. so i would only recomend a little editiing.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Database and search engine hits while often very helpful are NOT the ultimate test. Also this is an example where entering only a few specific search terms creates a misleading result, try "York Peace Camp" and you will find more sources, a little creativity goes a long way. Furthermore the sources provided of articles written by the York Press are valid sources. Therefore this article meets the WP:V requirements. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 19:20, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did try "York Peace Camp". It's in my original nomination with an assessment of the hits produced (a little creativity didn't go very far in this case). The York Press is a local city newspaper. Factiva doesn't include this but does include the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Post_68dc.html" title="Yorkshire Post">Yorkshire Post</a> and the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Evening_Post_23db.html" title="Yorkshire Evening Post">Yorkshire Evening Post</a>, the local <i>regional or county</i> newspapers, as well as the Press Association Regional Newswire for Yorkshire and Humberside. No hits for the search terms from these sources showed up (there are hits for protests and peace camps against US activities at military bases <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Menwith_Hill_1c56.html" title="RAF Menwith Hill">RAF Menwith Hill</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Fylingdales_e6d6.html" title="RAF Fylingdales">RAF Fylingdales</a> but none for the subject of the article). I don't think coverage by the local city newspaper is sufficient for encyclopedic notability. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize I did not see the "York Peace Camp" search reference before, I still maintain that the Google search is not the definative test of either verifiability or notability. However your opinion that local city newspapers are insufficient is not supported by Wikipedia policies. Under WP:V the requirements for sources are that they are preferably in English, that they are not of dubious reliability and they are not self-published. Under WP: N, "what constitutes "published works" is <i>intentionally broad</i>, including published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, published reports by consumer watchdog organizations and government agencies." The York Press meets these requirements. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 21:15, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My understanding of the articles for deletion process is the look at the arguments rather than the votes, to make sure that the WP:ORG reason for deletion is addressed, the proposed policy states "Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source. Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable <i>unless</i> verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found." and "Notability can be asserted for organizations through: Inclusion in third party published materials. A significant amount of media coverage that is not trivial in nature and that deals specifically with the organization as the primary subject" Here the York Press articles provide the reliable third party source which is verification and notability. Just in case this debate starts to turn to the ad hoc arguments I have seen in the past I would like to state my independence, this was my first exposure to York Peace camp. I participate in the articles for deletion debates which I think provide illustrative examples of the application of WP policies. Also those that support my philosophy that the purpose of an encyclopedia is to provide references for research, so if the article would be useful for research than I generally vote to Keep.

<p>May I thank icathryn (who was at the peace camp doing daily news flyers (only hardcopy, I think), and Ratherhaveaheart for their support and for recognising that this is important to me, and to hundreds of people I don't even know how to contact any more. I would also put to Bwithh that it is not only the bigshot national media who can validly document an event.

<p>Stuart Ewen recently wrote articles for himself and his wife, Elizabeth Ewen. He looks to be maybe notable; she doesn't. Self-written (or, in this case, spouse-written) articles are a red flag, for starters. She doesn't seem to pass <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Two of her four books are collaborations with her husband. The one book she wrote alone, "Life and Culture on the Lower East Side, l890-1930" looks like your typical academic tome. For an academic with a 30-year career her publishing record looks average at best. Ewens's claim to have "significantly defined the fields of American Studies" is unsourced and seems unlikely given her publication record. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Her position of "Distinguished Teaching Professor" at a major university university establishes notability in the academic world. She has written numerous scholarly books which have received lengthy and favorable reviews in scholarly journals and the New York Times. She has also published numerous articles in scholarly journals. <b>Edit boldly</b> and do any needed rewrites. How on earth does the fact that she and her husband co-authored books make him notable but not her? The book with several reviews ( I only added a few of them to demonstrate notability) was not co-written with hubby. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did edit the page a lot. I moved stuff around and made the Publications section. But all I could do was re-arrange; I can't pull notable achievements for her out of the air. I would dispute that we ought to have articles on Distinguished Teaching Professors as a default, and more than on every lawyer who made partner at a major law firm or whatever. And SUNY is <i>large</i> but it's not CalTech or Harvard either. Her husband is notable (maybe) because he has other accomplishments of his own, writing several books on his own including one that apparently made a little noise and doing a bunch of other stuff on his own, thus garnering a few interviews in third-party publications. As far as I can tell, she's written exactly one book on her own: <i>Immigrant Women in the Land of Dollars: Life and Culture on the Lower East Side 1890-1925</i>, which is published by the New Feminist Library, and that sure sounds like the kind of dry academic research made into a book that all tenured professors are expected to write as a matter of course. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:38, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Articles written with an apparent of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> should be slashed back to a stub in any case. However, I think there might be enough third-party sources to build a small article. I don't mind putting the article on the clock and revisiting an AfD in a few months if these references don't materialize and if the article is as poor as it currently is. Also, the innuendo that co-authoring a book with one's husband is essentially enjoying a free ride is shameful. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 05:03, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are two questions to answer: Is this <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>? It's original research if it is a concept invented by Adams that has not been acknowledged by anyone else other than its inventor and not become a part of the general corpus of human knowledge. To demonstrate that it's not original research, we need sources by people <i>other than</i> Adams discussing this concept. If it's not original research, is this a <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate article</a>? It's a duplicate article if it's just a different name for the same concept. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:45, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Now I'm confused. I thought <b>Original Research</b> in the WP context refered to that done by a Wikipedian for the article, which is prohibited by WP policy. This is contradicted by your assertion that it is "original research if it is a concept invented by Adams that has not been acknowledged by anyone else...." I think in such a case as you describe, it still may be prohibited, however due to notability. --<a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhuston_3e3b.html" title="User:Bhuston">Bhuston</a> 16:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, in particular the parts relating to ideas held by an "extremely small minority", which in this case would be a minority of 1 if no-one other than Adams has acknowledged the concept. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_sources_and_content_98bf.html" title="User:Uncle G/On sources and content">Everything in Wikipedia must have been through a processs of fact checking, peer review, publication, and acceptance into the general corpus of human knowledge</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:56, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am fairly certain that the phrase was current in deconstructionist literary jargon before it was appropriated by Adams for the idiosyncratic use described here. It comes from the truism that all symbolic discourse includes a sign, a signifier (person using the sign) and a referent. Here it's used as rhetorical dressing for the slight insight that people don't think about live chickens when they eat their McNuggets. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>reply to comment</b> This is quite interesting! It also reminds me of how certain sects of Judiasm use the symbol (sign) G*D to refer to the divine mover, or the sybmol "{}" as the empty set in mathematics.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Granted, the site has a number of media mentions, but these seem due more to the publicity-savviness of the site's creators than to any actual newsworthiness of the site itself. There really is nothing whatsoever to the article so far that wouldn't apply to just about every other moderately-sophisticated web-forum out there. Also, the original wording of the article (plus the username of the creator) suggests that it was planted in WP by one of the site-founders as a means of boosting their search profile. I don't want to reward that. --Arvedui</li>

<dd>Like I mentioned above, if I could find a single thing worth writing about this website, I would agree and vote Keep. But once you take away all the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertorial.html" title="Advertorial">advertorial</a> aspects (seriously, go read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=College_Tonight&amp;oldid=86993860" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=College_Tonight&amp;oldid=86993860" rel="nofollow">the revision before mine</a>), basically you've got an article that says "Here is a social-networking website that focuses on colleges and universities. It's been up since September. Check out all our media coverage!" That's not an article, and I don't see any prospect of that changing over anything like a reasonable timeframe. Once there's actually something there to write about, we can gladly accept it, but until then, it's an ad and has no place here. --Arvedui 00:17, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Like with all these kinds of articles, they need to be written in an objective <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> manner. It's currently not, I agree. I just added an advertising tag, which I'm surprised nobody did when this article first appeared. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 06:46, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think anybody expected it to survive this long.&#160;;-) The fact it was Speedy-deleted twice may have had something to do with the lack of tag as well. (I'm not clear how it got itself restored, let alone more than once.) As for the content itself--once you strip away the adcruft, what exactly is there left to be NPOV about? I'm just not seeing it. And I say that as someone who tends towards inclusionism. I'm all for an article on the site, <i>once it's actually done something worth writing about</i> (not just gotten a mention on a morning show). Thanks for tagging, tho. --Arvedui 06:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, advertising for new social network. The fact that it has succeeded in getting a few media mentions does not make it notable: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news site dedicated to regurgitating press releases and hyping the latest Web 3.0 buzz. If this social network actually succeeds, Wikipedia will still be here to receive an article about it, but right now? Too soon. Delete now without prejudice to recreation if the subject turns out <i>in retrospect</i> to be a notable one. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>How, exactly? "Here is a social-networking website that focuses on colleges and universities. It was founded by two guys and has been up since September. Check out all its media coverage!" That's an article? There's nothing else to say. Anyway, it meets the relevant <i>guideline</i> while contradicting the no-ad <i>policy</i>. I think the latter obviously trumps the former. --Arvedui 20:44, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The media mentions make it meet WP:WEB. I don't think the article <i>has</i> to contradict our "no ad policy," which is the point - it's easily possible to make an article that meets the notability standards, so that's why I say keep it. If it reads spammy, edit those parts out, and voila. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:49, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It was created by a single-purpose user account under a name that suggests it was one of the site-founders themselves putting it in for the express purpose of advertising their (then-nationally-nonexistant) website. It's an ad by definition, and always has been. Cut that out and there's nothing left. --Arvedui 21:03, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, whether the account that made it is here for a single purpose or not is irrelevant. The article should exist or not based on its merits as a subject, nothing more and nothing less, and we have various notability standards to help with that. If we cut the advertising and replace it with neutral language about the site, and we have at least a viable, verifiable stub. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:09, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Is a fluff-piece interview on the Today Show *really* so authoritative that it grants a license to spam, even if in watered-down NPOV language? WP's value to article-spammers as a source of high Google pagerank should not go unconsidered, NPOV wording or not. If we keep this one, we only encourage more of the same. --Arvedui 07:13, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zizmor is a NN dermatologist.

<li>Although I would argue the subject easily passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and the published works are not trivial, your opinion of the subject being trivial might not be contended, actually, and alot of people might find something like this <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">interesting</a>. Even "trivial" subjects have a home in WP (<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelyne.html" title="Angelyne">Angelyne</a> cited above is an excellent example).

<li><b>Keep</b>. He's indeed not notable in the field of dermatology.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Zizmor is famous. It's for something tacky--relentless self-promotion--but I think the argument is being made here that "tacky" equals "trivial to the point of irrelevance". It's very clear the "non-trivial" part of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> refers to the depth of content written in articles about the subject, not any editor's opinion about the importance of subject, and that's being ignored here. The <i>New Yorker</i> piece shows his cultural notability--as soon as I saw this AfD I remembered that piece. If you search nytimes.com for "Zizmor" you get 23 hits, 20 of which are about him. In an <i>NYT</i> article about <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshivat_Chovevei_Torah_7052.html" title="Yeshivat Chovevei Torah">Yeshivat Chovevei Torah</a>, which you can read on their <a href="http://www.yctorah.org/content/view/32/11/" class="external text" title="http://www.yctorah.org/content/view/32/11/" rel="nofollow">website</a>, the fact that Zizmor's on the board of the school is worthy of mentioning, and not just in a list.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> He could be referring to the 18 million in the New York metro area, but i think he was commenting that there are still 282 million that probably haven't heard of him. He spent loads of money on advertising. Does that mean we are now going to say that every guy that has funny car dealership commercials gets to have an article? <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/v/User_talk%7EMovementarian_393b.html" title="User talk:Movementarian">Talk</a>) 08:46, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I wonder how many funny used-car dealers have <i>New Yorker</i> articles written about them, have <i>New York Times</i> features written about them? I feel like there are three camps of people arguing this AfD. One group says, he meets the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, it is impossible to deny the cultural relevance of America's newspaper of record and, arguably, most award-winning magazine, so the rules are the rules and he passes. Another group says, weak or very weak keep. The article passes, but.... And the last group wants to delete the article, so they ignore the notability rules, or interpret them with a usage of the word "trivial" that ignores <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a>'s very clearly stated definition of the word (<i>Non-triviality is a measure of the depth of content of a published work, and how far removed that content is from a simple directory entry or a mention in passing that does not discuss the subject in detail.</i>) I think that there is an inherent bias in most serious Wikipedians--we don't like self-promotion. If you hang around here, and work on deletion work in particular, you see a slew of folks that want to use WP to promote themselves or their product in an inappropriate fashion. This guy <b>isn't one of those people</b>. He paid cash for his self-promotion, both in money and, more importantly, in dignity. He's a huckster, a snake-oil salesman, a medical doctor who flogs a vastly over-hyped product (fruit-acid peels) to the gullible segment of the middle class, with an affordable payment plan. He's an American archetype, an embarrassment, a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine_show.html" title="Medicine show">medicine show</a> of the late twentieth century. He's been advertising on the train since the 70s, before HMOs got big, when doctors still were looked up to, still got respect just for being doctors. He's an embarrassment to some people in the medical community, an embarrassment to some Jewish people, a creepy airbrushed face grinning down at you with the smugness of the flip side of the American Dream. And he's done it all in New York City, the advertising capital of North America, and is the most notable face of the cheapening of respect for medical doctors in this city. I've got no sources to back me up, but this guy is one of the people who were in the right place at the right time to set the example to the people who design the medical advertising for the entire country, to push its tone in a more commercial direction. No, you don't necessarily know who <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Zizmor_0810.html" title="Jonathan Zizmor">Jonathan Zizmor</a> is, but you've seen advertising for medical doctors that has been influenced by the man. And that's why he gets the coverage in national cultural publications that he most undeniably has received, and also why you don't like him very much. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 20:44, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am skeptical that this concept really existed in communist regimes as claimed, at least by this name. I'm familiar with another use of the term Aesthetic realism, and when I researched it on the net I never came across this other alleged communist use. The article certainly provides zero references to support its claim. If the existence of this concept can be established and is notable, then of course I have no objection to keeping the article. Otherwise I suggest it be deleted. -09:26, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not notable <i>enough</i> to deserve its own article, I suggest a merge with <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_kernel.html" title="Linux kernel">Linux kernel</a> and redirect. I wasn't satisfied with the keep arguments from the last debate. Everyone demanded expansion of the article but no-one pointed out what it could be expanded with.

<li><b>Keep and remove nomination</b>: The other <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tanenbaum-Torvalds_debate_4f06.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate">AFD</a> finished just over 12 hours ago and was a definite keep. Far too soon to nominate for AFD again, a decision was made. Also note the OP's only posts so far are the previous AfD, this AfD and talks regarding the AfD. I think this is bad faith and someone wants to make a point. The OP points out that they "wasn't satisfied with the keep arguments from the last debate", well the closing admin was as was everyone else. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 09:59, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> - ignoring for a minute that it survived an AFD just a few hours ago, this is easily a very notable debate for Wikipedia to cover. It can be expanded with both views, that of the microkernel and the monolithic kernel, as well as an observation of currently existing kernels and thus the practical use of both design philosophies. The debate was revisited at a later date; we can cover that as well. I don't see how this cannot be expanded. Just give it eternity, and this article will eventually write itself, like every other article on Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../m/s/i/User%7EMsikma_222d.html" title="User:Msikma">msikma</a> &lt;<a href="../../../m/s/i/User_talk%7EMsikma_e16b.html" title="User talk:Msikma">user_talk:msikma</a>&gt; 13:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the issue is just whether the guy is notable, I'd say <b>Keep</b>. The guy's book <i>PR!: A Social History of Spin</i> did garner him a couple of interviews -- granted, one is just a website, and one appears to be a D-list magazine. But websites that are effectively on-line magazines, we'd better get use to considering them as equal to small magazines, <i>pace</i> <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate.html" title="Slate">Slate</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.html" title="Salon">Salon</a>, granting that committment.com is not in the same league. There's also quite a long a review at PR Watch, an arm of the Center for Media and Democracy, which is real and somewhat significant organization, the interview being reprinted from <i>The Progressive</i>, which appears to be a real magazine that publishes work from people you've actually heard of (Barbara Ehrenreich, Molly Ivins, Howard Zinn). So with this book he's perhaps broken out a tad from being a strictly academic author and garnered a small slice of real-world buzz. I also see on Amazon that the book was reviewed by <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>; whether that means anything I don't know. And he does have a few other books out, some with Basic Books which if I recall correctly is a real publisher that places books in general-interest bookstores. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 14:29, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No problem, it happens all the time. Nothing wrong with adding the guy's name, either, especially if he's notable, but this looks like a vanity namecheck (even if it isn't) because it appears to be the one thing which has existed in all incarnations. You can tell if it's been deleted by looking at the logs, which should be linked from the "no article exists" page. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:00, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have a connection with Chainki, so the "Keep" is perhaps biased, but I am also therefore in a position to bring some facts. It's worth perhaps comparing this RfD with the previous one. In the previous one Chainki had 689 hits in Google; today it has 25200. In the previous one, Chainki did not even appear on Alexa; today it has an Alexa rank of 328,297 - but particularly since this is a new site, the rank (which is 3-month) is inevitably out of date, so also relevant is that all the figues on Alexa are strongly upwards - the 1 week average is 238,086, and at one point the site was in the top 100,000. It's perhaps a sign of some notability that three separate users have created it. As long as Chainki keeps growing strongly (which it has according to Alexa) I'm sure it will come back again and again. Save a lot of work and keep; I don't much care, because I know it will keep coming back as more and more notable and one day it will stay. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrusselsshrek_6689.html" title="User:Brusselsshrek">Brusselsshrek</a> 09:26, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. If GoGuides and Skaffe aren't considered notable enough for an entry in the Wikipedia, then Chainki certainly isn't notable enough.

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b> I have no connection with Chainki - indeed I had never heard of it before today - but having seen a reference to it I looked on Wikipedia and found the article a useful explanation. If there are things in the article that don't meet your standards, fix it, don't delete it. Yes, it's based on DMOZ data run on Wikipedia's software, but that's why both made their data/code respectively open. And it DOES add value to those things: it answers the question of "what would happen if you let anyone edit DMOZ Open Directory using the Wiki model?". Personally I expect it to fail due to link spamming - but then many people expect Wikipedia to fail and so far it's surviving pretty well! If I'm proved right it will serve as a lesson to the net, and if I'm wrong that will be even better as it will be a useful resource. [Note: I <b>do</b> have a connection with DMOZ, as a volunteer editor there (editor name dww), and I see Chainki has incorporated all my work without thanking me in any way. But that's fine by me; if I didn't want it to be shared I wouldn't work on an open system.] 86.9.147.50 13:06, 26 November 2006 (UTC) dww</li>

<li><b>Rewrite</b> I too am a volunteer editor with DMOZ with no connection to Chainki. I’m somewhat ambivalent about Chainki’s future and tend to share dww’s view on the matter. However when adding to this article I sought to approach the task with good faith and expand the stub based on whatever research I could scratch up on the topic. With the benefit of re-reading the article a week later, I can now see how the different portions added throughout 20 November by different people do not always gel with other portions. On some points the article hedges bets, yet at other times throughout the article the same points are expressed as fact. In trying to be even-handed, I have probably kept too large a percentage of the previous portions rather than rewrite them to a consistent style. If someone were to straighten out the misfits and trim the duplications, then I think this article would be worth saving. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirDoc_e9d3.html" title="User:MirDoc">MirDoc</a> 08:04, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b> I also agree with dww. When I submitted the short Nov. 18 version of this article I considered Chainki noteworthy because it is the only attempt to convert dmoz to a wiki that anyone can modify. In my opinion this is important because dmoz's editor tools have been down for over a month with no end in sight. If there were several such projects I would agree that none of them belong in Wikipedia just yet. (And yes, I use both dmoz and Chainki.) Tut21 18:18, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> but ambivalent. (Full disclosure: I own a "competing" website, Wikidweb the article of which was been deleted for notability concerns [No, I did not write the article - I don't spam to promote my sites]). The point I want to make is this: 1) We have an objective criteria for article inclusion, in the interests of fairness and avoiding chaos. 2) If we are to really apply "Noteworthy" as an objective criteria, it should be applied uniformly. Now, <i>I</i> think Chainki is noteworthy, and I also think Wikidweb is noteworthy - they both have a degree of popularity and have some neat, unique features - but that does NOT satisfy the notability criteria for websites (sorry Hugh). --<a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerik_bb21.html" title="User:Aerik">Aerik</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/e/r/User_talk%7EAerik_0e4d.html" title="User talk:Aerik">talk</a></small>)</li>

<p>From the people who brought you Footbasket and the life story of Theodore Macus comes this charming anon-removed Prod. Once again, we're dealing with a hoax. That Jimmy Barnes <i>appeared</i> on Rove is proven (there was a source provided which tried to show that this entire thing was true, but all it showed was Barnes' appearance), but nothing else is. Given the "facts" being asserted here, one would think that one of the two TV shows would have made a big deal about it, but strangely enough they didn't. As a side-note, since anecdotal evidence doesn't really count, a friend who watches Rove religiously tells me that none of this happened either. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> An illegible fax in Spanish is not "multiple independent reliable and verifiable sources". A government post might be an unimportant or honorary one. We have no obvious way of knowing that the site is in fact a government site there, since a foreign language Wikipedia might link to www.whitehouse.org or www.theonion.com for humor posing as official looking information. If the person is a high government official, there should be lots of articles in major newspapers of that country. If some of them were in an English language paper of that country (most countries have at least one) so much the better, but we probably could find an editor of English language Wikipedia able to check out foreign languages refs. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:00, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete without prejudice</b> The main reason that I want this page to be deleted isn't that she's non-noteable, but that the page history exposes wikipedia to liability. The previous versions of this page show a reckless disregard for the truth and are extremely defamatory. They say that she was a member of a Peruvian terrorist group in the 1960s despite the fact that she is not Peruvian and that the group metioned didn't exist in the 1960s. They also say that she was part of some urban guerrilla outfit in Venezuela, but there's no verifiable information that she was. Basically, this page was the definition of libel, and I have no doubt that the Chavez administration would delight in suing Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 20:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> As it stands she does not appear to meet the criteria in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, as merely being a politician does not merit an entry. If one of our spanish speaking Wikipedians can provide more detail, then I'd be happy to change my opinion. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/v/User_talk%7EMovementarian_393b.html" title="User talk:Movementarian">Talk</a>) 20:47, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No vote.</b> She certainly holds that position (which really tells us nothing); I've seen some pages talking about her from the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_of_American_States_a97a.html" title="Organization of American States">Organization of American States</a>, a couple of news conferences and quotes from her, several press releases talking about her being named to that position, but nothing that seems to shout at me of the importance of her position. If anything, it seems like she may function as something of public relations..

<li>I have no problem with losing the history; any deletion should be without prejudice to future recreation. I suspect she does merit an article, but there is no great loss in losing this sub-stub. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:21, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with that; further information makes it seem she is fairly notable, and articles like this help counter systemic bias; but the history in this case isn't helpful. Perhaps this article should be deleted and have the stub recreated in its place sans history? -<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 21:49, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>My main concern is the use of the article as an attack page. Although I still think subject is NN, I would not object the re-creation of a NPOV stub. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSP_1360.html" title="User:JRSP">JRSP</a> 22:44, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> First, no references to show it is notable or that it existed. Second, why is a "long running course" notable? Should we have article saying that "Torts 1" is the oldest course taught by the Yale Law School, etc for every college in the world? I don't think so. But isf the fact that something is "the oldest course," "the biggest ball of twine," "the smartest parrot" or whatever and there are lots of news articles, TV documentaries, and scholarly articles about it over a long period of time, then by all means create an article, since it is notable. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm nominating this article for deletion. Here's why:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Not all the shows are notable enough to be included on the list. Some of the shows enjoyed short runs and, in all likelihood, are no longer remembered by some Filipinos.</li>
<li>Biased in favor of two channels. Taking a look at the list, it's obvious that this was written by someone who is a <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kapuso.html" title="Kapuso">Kapuso</a> or a <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kapamilya.html" title="Kapamilya">Kapamilya</a> (or a little of both), and then again there are very, very few shows from the other mainstream channels (<a href="../../../n/b/n/NBN-4_b68f.html" title="NBN-4">NBN-4</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC-5_68be.html" title="ABC-5">ABC-5</a>, <a href="../../../r/p/n/RPN-9_ede8.html" title="RPN-9">RPN-9</a> and <a href="../../../i/b/c/IBC-13_7f1a.html" title="IBC-13">IBC-13</a>)</li>
<li><i>(Corollary to the previous item)</i> If we have to make a list of <i>all</i> Philippine TV shows from <i>all</i> channels, this list will be too long. Listcruft.</li>
<li><i>(Corollary to the last two items)</i> most of the TV shows are/were broadcast in recent times (as early as the 80's). Since this list does not define a specific time window to the shows that can be listed here, it would be logical to include shows that were shown way, way back when the first Philippine TV broadcasts went live...and this means the 1950s. This would make the list even longer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> because it's highly useful. Though, I believe that it could use improvement. I would like to see it done à la <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_American_television_programs_by_date_f0ba.html" title="List of American television programs by date">List of American television programs by date</a> which goes back to 1940. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Sundita_7a61.html" title="User:Christopher Sundita">Chris S.</a> 01:27, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> remove the foreign shows if you're worried about it being too long, their inclusion is dubious anyway. Notability of individual shows and bias are arguments for cleaning it up, not for deleting it. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 15:05, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> You may have problems with the content, in which case you can delete them. It probably should be divided among shows on the major Phillipine Networks, but doing that should happen first, and this page should disambig from there. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:29, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Probably a very incomplete list. How long, for example would "List of U.S. television show" be? or same for British, French, etc. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, since you asked, try looking at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_television_programs.html" title="List of television programs">List of television programs</a> for all sorts of lists. Why should the Phillipines be excluded? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:54, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One could also ask, "Why shouldn't most of the other incomplete and arbitrary lists be deleted? The list implies there were only 2 new shows on US tv in 1956, showing the arbitrariness of such lists. (Except for "shows deleted after one episode" and such defined and maintainable lists.) <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 03:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why should they not be deleted? Because they are useful and informative lists, that's why. That some of them are incomplete, especially back in the 50s does not surprise me. It's not arbitrary when someone doesn't know something, just ignorance. That happens. If you see any errors or incomplete information, go ahead and fix them! Wikipedia is not built in a day, and it's not built by deletions. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:13, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Adequacy's infamous "Computer Hacker" article was featured on the TechTV program "The Screen Savers", and in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the "serious" satire piece "Why The Bombings Mean We Must Support My Politics" was actually syndicated by AlterNet. This should be more than enough to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but the problem is that given the amount of time that has passed, it is difficult to document these references (I found AlterNet's copy of the Adequacy article <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/11623/" class="external text" title="http://www.alternet.org/story/11623/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and will add it to the article page later, but "The Screen Savers" has been off the air for some time). Though this page could use some work, deleting it seems ridiculous to me, particularly when there are articles like the one for <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segfault_%28website%29.html" title="Segfault (website)">Segfault (website)</a> that contain no more claims of notability and yet are (apparently) perfectly acceptable. 152.61.42.109 16:31, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Who said that page was acceptable? You do know that people can create pages whenever they want, don't you? That's kind of the point of this site. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 16:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that the Segfault page has been around for two and a half years and that it has (apparently) never been nominated for deletion is a pretty good indicator that it is acceptable. For the record, I'm not suggesting that the article be deleted -- as somebody who fondly remembers Segfault, I would consider deleting its article to be as ludicrous as deleting Adequacy's.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 152.61.42.109 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.61.42.109_79bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.61.42.109">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Most of the sources you cite are either blog posts or message board threads of some sort. Several of them don't even mention Adequacy.org.

<li>Not all of the sources I added were intended to establish Adequacy's notability. I listed some of them to document the background information that I was providing (i.e., Eric S. Raymond's post-9/11 comments and the reaction to them, the specifics of the Koleen Brooks story, etc.) Were I reviewing this article, I would certainly expect this information to be documented, so I documented it. I can appreciate your opinion that the Screen Savers appearance was unimpressive, but one of the goals of having subjective guidelines such as <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is (hopefully) to remove individual opinion from the process. A segment on an internationally-broadcast television program may not be impressive, but it is also not trivial. You did not comment on the AlterNet syndication; while I suspect that you would also find this unimpressive, the fact remains that Adequacy was paid a monetary fee for the rights to an article by a syndication service that receives millions of visitors per month. (Incidentally, this could arguably fit either the first or the third criteria for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the third being "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.") The bottom line here is that I believe the concerns cited in the deletion notice for this article were entirely legitimate; as such, I spent many hours poring through Google (and G4TV.com's excruciatingly slow Web site) and augmenting the content, and based on my reading of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, I believe that the concerns have been adequately (if you'll pardon the pun) addressed. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventypercent_9424.html" title="User:Seventypercent">Seventypercent</a> 05:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I do believe that Christian Forums constitutes a notable topic. It has over 150,000 members and is generally recognized as the largest Christianity-related internet forum in existence (or at the very least, I've yet to see another Christianity-related forum that had as many members or that contested that claim). I also frequently see links to it on other Christian websites. However, I agree that it has serious problems with original research and verifiability (and probably NPOV as well). —<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 16:14, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is far more benificial to the health of Wikipedia to remove unsourced articles if they can't be fixed within the 5 day period. If you have sources, you should feel free to post them here if you are too busy - I'm sure somebody would be happy to write them into the article for you. If you can't post them now, then there should be no prejudice against re-creating a properly sourced article later when you do have the time. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 05:09, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Excuse me</b>, but <u>from where are you pulling out this <b>5 days</b> stuff</u>? The only reference I find to it is that AfD discussions should go on for 5 days. That time period is irrelevant to how much time a page with problems should be allowed to get fixed before AfDing it.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but I just did not see a good faith effort by <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> to first do any of these less drastic things.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the co-founder, Ryan Swift. What information do you need? How can anything in the history be verified at this point? Well, nothing is published, and many of the historical posts related to the history of Christian Forums is blocked because I'm blocked as a user, and any post I was in is subsequently blocked from public viewing (it's a long story)...so, I have private emails from 2002 between Erwin and myself that I have archived, proving much of the information that is "unsourced." Anyone is welcome to view them or have me email them. Unfortunately, being the co-founder with Erwin, I'm not sure my input now would still qualify to meet wikipedia standards because... heh, my stuff IS original research! So who wants it? Anyone want to care to interview me and publish on a website so that a third party source can be shared on the page? Kingdomgospel.com did exist at one time verifying some of the claims made in the history section. CF is notable, and I would ask any admin reviewing this AfD to consider to KEEP this speedily, and end debate on a ridiculous AfD. If someone wants sources, they can ask me. They can interview me. They can interview Erwin - the current leader of CF. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 05:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The economic aspects of the subjects cited in the nom seem too long to include all the content of this article in those specific articles. There's an enormous amount of sources cited that deal with the specifics of economies and economic techniques in historic fascist societies. Might not be likable, but still important to study. Unlike communism, fascism in itself is not an economic philosophy, but a method of governance, frequently characterized by an "iron fist" method of control of a populace using techniques such as <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackshirts.html" title="Blackshirts">blackshirts</a> in order to gain population submission.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Because it is unclear if this article is about the economics of generic fascism or economics of Fascist Italy / Nazi Germany.

<li><b>Keep</b> Please keep this article! It has an excellent start. If it needs some cleanup the author can probably do so, or link it to other topical articles. This needs to be seperate so as not to require a prolonged hunt through the expansive articles on Fascism for the economics aspects thereof. If you put too much into an Article (Like Fascism) it can become too unwieldly and too broad in scope. Please at least keep the article on file somewhere.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.224.105.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.224.105.69_41b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.224.105.69">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree there is valuable information in this article that needs to be preserverd. However, the problem with this article lies in its mixing of generic fascism with that of the (fascist) economic policies of Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. This mixing makes it hard to improve this article at all! It would be better to separate this stuff in say Economic policies of Fascist Italy or Economic policies of Nazi Germany.

<li><b>Keep</b> I do take offense to this. Schoolwork this week has prevented me from further completing the article, but I assure you I will. As a president of what US News and World Reports considers a top tier school, he certainly passes the "average college professor test". He is very respected in his field on bioethics and has appeared on important shows such as Meet the Press and Larry King Live to give the church's perspective on issues like Terri Schivo and partial birth abortion, his opinions have been featured in the New York Times' op-ed section. Am I not neutral? Have I missed sources? Is your only basis for this that I used information from another article?--<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickneil_a049.html" title="User:Patrickneil">Patrickneil</a> 19:52, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>This article appears to be little more than self-promotion, I have been researching OBE and related areas for many years and have never heard of this individual. His books are no doubt self-published (and I note all this year) and contain characteristic poor grammar. Interestingly, his reviews on Amazon all contain the same poor grammar; I only mention this as the reviews have been cited to backup notability on the article's talk page. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 16:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not notable. In fact it doesn't even exist yet, and hasn't been published by the author's own admission. An "Importance to the [sic] Society" section has been added to the bottom since I added the proposed deletion template to the article before (which was then deleted by someone not signed in). However, even if it was a book of tremendous importance to society, it hasn't been published, it hasn't been reviewed by anyone (as far as I know), and I think that is article is merely a the author's attempt at publicity (it appears to be the sole reference to this book on the entire web). Therefore, I suggest deletion.<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurby100_f8d4.html" title="User:Furby100">Furby100</a> 17:13, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No independent, reliable sources verify any of the assertions in the article except that Mitchell is the CEO of Think Partnership - which is adequately covered in <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_Partnership_41d9.html" title="Think Partnership">Think's article</a>. Despite months of editors attempting to make this article worthy of inclusion, appropriate sources for information have not been found.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I would almost think of this as an ego-boosting self-advertisement. It is not sourced well and there are no independent sources. Authors of this article spammed other articles to link to this one including changing links on the Scott Mitchell footballer page to point to here. Scott Mitchell's son even created a wiki page for himself at one point which was speedily deleted. Even the Think Partnership wiki seems to have been created just to list his name. Does not meet criteria.<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedBirdI55_41b8.html" title="User:RedBirdI55">RedBirdI55</a> 17:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I think Forbes is a reliable source who has verified the information. Also, almost all the information was verified in SEC filings. My read of this situation is that RedBird (the name of the mascot for Illinois State University) was offended when someone tried to add Mitchel; and several other CEO's listed on ISU's own noteable alumni business page, to the notable alumni list. He constantly removed Mitchell and all Alumni despite the fact that arean football quarterbacks were left on. I think that this whole thing is quite rediculous. When I look back at the history, I see many reliable sources were removed. This is not what Wikipedia is supposed to be about!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.83.78.67_173a.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.83.78.67">213.83.78.67</a> (talk)</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Your "READ" of the situation is wrong and doesn't go with AGF. My reasons for wanting the deletion are stated above. There are others who would like this deleted as well if you look at the discussion of the main article. Once again I think this article is self-promotional and the Think article covers all that is needed. ISU was just one of the many articles that were spammed to promote this one. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedBirdI55_41b8.html" title="User:RedBirdI55">RedBirdI55</a> 19:26, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I've looked back at the deleted references and I do think that (1) sources like Forbes, Bloomberg, and the United States Security and Exchange Commission are all very valid sources and (2) the CEO of a large public company traded on the American Stock Exchange and the founder of several businesses in the United States worth hundreds of millions of dollars is notable. I strongly believe that this article should be cleaned up, proper references added back, and should not be deleted. There does seem to be some evidence that this article was vandalized. There are many other biographies on Wikipedia of much less notable people that should be looked into. This vandalism is quite preposterous. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.172.203.235_03be.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.172.203.235">198.172.203.235</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/User_talk%7E198.172.203.235.html" title="User talk:198.172.203.235">talk</a>)</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> the deleted references have not been to appropriate content for the assertions they are backing up - the forbes link was to a profile which contained a part of a press release from Think Partnership and some financial details on the company. It was not a non-trivial piece written by someone independent of the subject. So far, despite months of requests, no sources have been found that meet this standard (which is our regular standard for inclusion). The SEC link may be useful, but at the moment it's just a link to a list of dozens of financial statements. It's not clear what facts it backs up. This has been detailed on the article talk page, but no response there from anyone who thinks this article is worth keeping. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 23:14, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b>&#160;::This is quite ridiculous. I did research on this before and his name is all over the place. In the world of online advertising and internet businesses, he is very notable. This article should be cleaned up and not removed. This is vandalism and I'm definitely going to complain about it. Here are some links from some very simple research. They back up all of the information in this article and are from very reputable, independent sources like Reuters, Barons, Microsoft, and the SEC. This is the most blatant display of this I have ever seen. Why don't you guys go after the actors that have had one extra spot on one commercial ten years ago on here? Why do you have anything against businesses? Certainly, they can be notable enough for inclusion?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just as a side note I think that some of these "don't deletes" are from this small circle of friends who promote this article or maybe just 2 people in general. I agree with Wahkeenah in that some of these accounts are used solely to promote this article. Not sure if the person who redirected a link for the quarter back Scott Mitchell in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bowl_II_8c19.html" title="World Bowl II">World Bowl II</a> to point to this page but I think things like that show self-promotion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bowl_II&amp;diff=87285347&amp;oldid=84928818" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bowl_II&amp;diff=87285347&amp;oldid=84928818" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> I don't know what the rules are for situations like this but I thought it might be worth a mention since I find it strange that they used similar prose such as "Don't Delete" instead of the usual "Keep".

<li><b>Contested</b> I feel that this deletion is unfounded and potentially vandalistic. The sources are from very reliable sources. The two people contending that this page is advertising assert that the sources are unreliable and not independent although I think the United States Security and Exchange Commission is a much more reliable source and has a much higher burden of proof to do fact checking than most sources on Wikipedia. I also think that this person is notable because of the size of businesses he has started, the significance he has in his field of online advertising, and the young age of his accomplishments. I firmly believe that much of the history of this page was “staged” or set up by one individual that doesn’t want this page included. Please carefully consider all of the facts before making your decision. I trust that an careful but informed independent third party evaluation of the facts will bring the right decision to effect. 213.83.78.67 09:57, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This has looked like blatant advertising from Day 1. I believe I am the one who first challenged it, when it showed up on the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_State_University_2991.html" title="Illinois State University">Illinois State University</a> page in "Notable alumni". And when at least one editor pushing for retaining this article admits that Scott Mitchell is his former employer, it reinforces that viewpoint: "I just want to know what in the world you have against Scott Mitchell. He is my former employer of whom I have a tremendous amount of respect for. You keep removing him from the Notable Alumni section of the Illinois State University entry yet he is listed on by their cited website as a notable alumni. I would simply like an explaination." [sic] That was unsigned on my talk page, but it was posted by the red-linked User:Gregcox at 06:51, 15 November 2006. That user's sole purpose as a user seemed to be to add to the Scott Mitchell page as well as the page of the business he operates, called <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_Partnership_41d9.html" title="Think Partnership">Think Partnership</a>, on the 15th and 16th. You can read into that what you will. Also, it is worth pointing out that the likewise-red-linked User:Staceywhite's work since coming on board in September has been focused solely on this small set of articles, along with <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orland_Park%2C_Illinois_30a5.html" title="Orland Park, Illinois">Orland Park, Illinois</a>, for the purpose of listing Mitchell as a notable native. In looking back, this apparently started in April, with another single-purpose User:Greggborne. Entries in the interim were from various IP addresses. As I said elsewhere, I don't have anything specifically against Mr. Mitchell, I don't know who he is.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> this is a simple biography of a person has obviously made a significant contribution to his field. WIth all due respect to Edward B. Rust, Jr. and State Farm, he is not the founder and State Farm is a $2B business in a $4 TRILLION industry. I think this guy seems much more notable than most athletes and actors on Wikipedia as many of them have been in one season or in one movie. 207.145.28.2 04:33, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not at all obvious, beyond the company's own self-promotion statements. Meanwhile, one writeup said Mitchell had fewer than 100 employees in 1999. How many does he have now? What is his company's annual revenue at present? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:08, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Don't Delete To answer your question, according to SEC filings (which I do find reliable actually and feel the burden and standard for proof is much higher than reporters and media) the company has over 300 employees and will do over $100 million in revenue. His most recent previous company now has 28,000 employees.</li>

<li>Don't Delete - Notable</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>However, the more significant test is whether Mitchell is notable. Given the series of interviews with him, the purchasing of almost $100 million of companies in 18 months in one reasonably small business segment, at a reasonably young age makes him notable especially to the industry that he is contributing to. I would agree with the fact that he is at least as notable as most of the athletes, actors, and authors on here. For businessmen, their companies are their contribution. In fact, many of the few businessmen that are on Wikipedia have almost all of their information that related to filings and press releases made by their company - see State Farm's Edward B. Rust, Jr as mentioned by a previous poster who has no references, no external links, resources, or news. At the end of the day, this is a well backed up article, with facts that are clearly backed up by valid SEC filings which have a very high burden of proof. Finally, there is independent literature on the subject in the case of several audio and reporter interviews as listed on resources.</dd>

There is actually no advertising at all and the article must be dealt with as a BLP (Biography of a Living Person). There are only facts stated in the biography article, these facts are all backed up by reliable independent sources (yes, I agree that the company submitted information to the SEC but the SEC just doesn't publish gibberish to the world investment community but are bound by a very high standard of accuracy and fact checking and people submit facts to reporters as well and reporters have a lower burden of proof for what they publish then the SEC), and this person is notable to his area.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I wonder how many of the sites about Mitchell used wikipedia as their source? In regard to Ed Rust, it looks to me like whoever wrote the article lifted a lot of it directly from the State Farm Insurance website, whose main page is <a href="http://www.statefarm.com/about/about.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statefarm.com/about/about.asp" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> and whose page on Rust is <a href="http://www.statefarm.com/about/media/edrustjr.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statefarm.com/about/media/edrustjr.asp" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. State Farm is America's largest auto insurer and its largest Fire and Casualty insurer, and does a fair business in other areas such as Life Insurance. The price they pay for their size, of course, is that they get whacked pretty hard when hurricanes come along. The company has many thousands of employees across the nation, and it's clear Rust is a mover-and-shaker nationally. Whether Rust merits a page separate from the State Farm page, though, may be questionable... but if he doesn't deserve one, Mitchell certainly wouldn't. It also wouldn't be my place to write about Rust, since I come from a biased viewpoint. My complaint about Mitchell is not with him as such, it's that this article and several articles connected to it are vanity entries written either by him or by people who work or have worked for him, for the likely purpose of trying to expand his business, which is not the mission of wikipedia, as I understand it. What made it stand out, amongst the many one-time vanity entries that people have tried to post on the ISU page, is that it kept coming back, so I figured something was afoot with this one, and I was right. Oh, and by the way, to correct a slight mistake by one of Mitchell's proponents somewhere up the page, State Farm is not a TWO billion dollar business, it is a FIFTY billion dollar business, so it's a bit more of a dent in the insurance industry than that user thought. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:34, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment and Note to Closing Admin</b> Please consider that many or most of the keep or "Don't Delete's" were from IPs who's only or first edits appear to be for this debate. There are many many many CEOs of much larger companies who do not have entries.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've read all of the policies and all of the information on this page. I am still unclear on what criteria this page should be deleted for. If there is a notable argument, I have yet to hear a compelling one and in fact this article's subject certainly meets the search engine test. If it is a source argument, I have found many substantive sources already listed in the article. If it is an original research argument, I do not see where the original research is. If there is an advertising or self promotion concern, I just do not see any advertising or self promotion, blatant or otherwise, anywhere in this article. I think that this article should fit into the guidelines and be subject to the requirements of any Biography of Living Persons as per Wikipedia standards and guidelines and as such meet all those criteria. <a href="../../../2/1/0/User%7E210.11.188.11.html" title="User:210.11.188.11">210.11.188.11</a> 06:37, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's plenty of precedent for documenting the recipients of various countries' top military awards: there's the Medal of Honor list Demiurge cites, and we have biographies of every recipient of the Victoria Cross. The mere fact that this award was handed out by the Nazis hardly disqualifies it. (Indeed, deleting this list merely because of the Nazi association would be a flagrant violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, which - believe it or not - forbids us to condemn the Nazis!)<br />
Note that, as I observe above, this is just one part of what appears to be an ongoing project to document the Knight's Cross recipients in a series of separate lists. To delete one and leave the others would be rather strange. But as there seems to be no actual reason to delete this, I guess the problem doesn't arise. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:50, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as an inherently manageable list of recipients of a notable award (and not exactly one which is likely to keep expanding, unlike many other military awards). Attempting to censor things because of their association with nasty people isn't a useful argument. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:57, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>No source is cited. The editor may be typing them in from a book or from an archive somewhere. If that is public domain, it could be put on Wikisource. If they are getting it from an online source, it would be better to have an article about the award (when created, its history, its purpose, number of recipients, etc) and a link to the online source. If it is a copyrighted book then it is a copyvio. There is no need to list each recipient in such a cumbersome list as this. I hope the next step isn't to start creating an individual article for each recipient. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 03:32, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A list of game show episodes isn't needed. Look at the detail of each episode: it just describes what the models wear, guest stars (which is only once in a while), and what the contestant won. Purely fancruft. If we had an article for each season of a long running game show such as Price as Right, Wikipedia would be flooded with useless information such as Bob Barker wore a brown suit and so on. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 18:22, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> — I have one of two suggestions here. Either:
<ul>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> and edit it down to the basic information (e.g., who won what and a brief summation of the game). Agree that there is no need to write down such minute details as what the models wore (unless it particularly stands out); the summaries themselves are too long.

<p>An episode guide for a game show isn't needed. Not much room for expansion here. What the contestant won, and a few other notes for each episode isn't much.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> and edit it down to the basic information (e.g., who won what and a brief summation of the game).

<li>All that said, RobJ1981 has a very good suggestion - creating a game show Wiki and placing all relavent game show-related material (as well as creating other game show-type pages) there.

<li>Uncle G — tape the episode and watch it. That said, I see where the "tape it and watch it to see if it's true," while it seemingly is an acceptable for verification, isn't, so rather than get into an exhaustive debate about this episode's merits — personally, I could have cared less whether it existed in the first place — I'll change my vote to <b>delete</b> (but keept the <b>move</b> with editing to [tviv.com TVIV], because it <i>may</i> be acceptable as an article on that wikispace).

<p>I want to add the above to this AfD, they have all been tagged as hoaxes a by a Filipino editor. Editors familiar with Filipino TV may want to take a look at contribs of User:Tonyboy092392 and User:Booze broads and bullets one of who may be a <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppet</a> of the other, nearly all edits for both are on Filipino TV articles and it looks like Humalik Ka Sa Lupa had pagemove vandalism. The reference for <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_GMA_a6d0.html" title="Central GMA">Central GMA</a>'s "website" points to a blog, googling doesn't seem to come up with anything on this "network" or the Filipino <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy.html" title="Jeopardy">Jeopardy</a> program described in the article. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 00:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

This show and the others on the Central GMA network may be someone's fantasy, and as such would be completely unverifiable.

<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. Sheer numbers, ignoring anonymous and new voters would be "no consensus", but I hope I'm not risking my reasonably new and recallable adminship by marking it Keep from reading the arguments instead of counting votes here. There seems to be a cult following from the sheer number of Google hits, a sixth of a documentary film, and a few articles from reliable sources, such as the Washington Times, and an NBC station. (It would be nice if the Washington Times ref were added to the article.) True, the articles are primarily about the doll, but only by a narrow margin; he's the sole creator, and the articles don't just mention him in passing, they devote a noticeable part of their length to interviewing him. That's not worldwide fame, but it's enough for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 17:43, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Bob Smith is indeed a controversial figure. However, he is also a culturally relevant person, and so his article should be kept. This has been the accepted method taken with other internet personalities. For example, Sean Riley and George Ouzanian, AKA Seanbaby and Maddox, respectively, have Wikipedia pages. Bob Smith is as famous as either of these two. This article should not have been deleted in the first place.--Juppongatana 18:08, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So the main reason for deleting this article now is not for lack of relevance but because is was deleted before. According to the rules it can't be simply recreated. The deletion can be reviewed and if there is support the admins can undelete the original article. I think this is a good point. My question for the experienced editors: can we ask for a review of the deletion and does support from ASP's for undeletion count? --Djudge 13:07, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can request a deletion review at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. Whether new users are in good faith or single purpose accounts has to be determined case by case. Whether their opinions are counted (AfD is not a vote) has to be determined by the closing admin.

<li><b>Keep</b> Normal Bob Smith has made the news on a few occasions now. He made it when he was dealing with Urban Outfitters and his magnet set, he made it when his website was shut down by religious organizations, he made it when he did some work for Heavy.com and the Mel Gibson Dress-Up - how many times must someone be news before they become noteworthy? He's a major player in the atheist community and has been a topic speaker at atheist conventions. He's been part of a documentary. Controversy and infamy should be sufficient for a Wikipedia article. More specifically, the article doesn't violate any of the Wikipedia rules featured at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (Specifically point 5 of "Indiscriminate collection of information"), since the article addresses the cultural impact of Bob's website projects, not the websites themselves. I wholeheartedly think that this article has the notability and verifiability that Wikipedia demands of its articles. As for the implied <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">WP:SPA</a>, the SPA also advises "to assume good faith" - this is the case where I think good faith is in order.

<li><b>Reply</b> - ghits are a rule-of-thumb tool, and there is no hard and fast threshhold either way. However, the cites indicate that he was the proximate cause of multiple organized protests which were themselves newsworthy events. In other words, he generated enough controversy that independent groups around the country staged protests against him. I gave more weight to that than the ghits alone, since that level of controversy and coverage certainly seems notable. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 05:10, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes Derek and Swoopy rule but their main audience is the skeptic community (myself included) whereas Normal Bob Smith causes controversy in the general public. The reason for not deleting skepticality: STRONG KEEP: 110,000 google hits. Let's again compare, Skepticality now gets 204,000 hits but with doubles omitted this results in 171 links, Normal Bob Smith (with parentheses) gets 38,100 hits but doubles omitted results in 257 links. This points to a much more divers coverage. Anyway, if 110,000 gets a STRONG KEEP, 38,100 must at least be a KEEP. --Djudge 10:30, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As Doc Tropic and others have found, he is the primary subject of multiple, non-trivial references at reliable sources. I could care less why he is notable, but there it is. He is notable. Now, just rewrite the article useing only facts found in those sources, and you would have a good article! --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 06:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Honestly I am not sure why there is so much controversy here. I had never heard of this guy, but after reading the article (which admittedly needs work) I am thoroughly convinced that he is notable and it seems that the reasons for deletion are getting thinner and thinner (why is the fact that a previous article about him was deleted, in and of itself, necessarily a criteria for deleting this one?) I have always found wikipedia's criteria for notability to be extremely lax anyway, so it seems like this guy makes it in by a wide margin. <a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 02:33, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I know that's not reflected in the article at the moment, but I think it could become a nice, interesting article in time.

Since some people are particularly sceptical of this I'll be explicit: <a href="http://westfield.com/glenfield/" class="external autonumber" title="http://westfield.com/glenfield/" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> is acceptable as a RS, if we watch for NPOV, and no other sources are available (which they are). --<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomster_cf17.html" title="User:Domster">Dom</a> 02:17, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't see what the problem is. I feel that people are uncomfortable with antisemitism and want this article deleted. I looked at the page for antisemitism and found that the word "Judeophobia" appeared six times, including a book published by Harvard University and a link to the Zionism and Israel Information Center. The book is subtitled, "Attitudes Toward the Jews in the Ancient World." So the word is not a neologism. But if it were, that is in itself not grounds for deletion. Otherwise nothing new would occur in Wikipedia. The page for antisemitism also contains a section defining the word, so Wikipedia serves as a dictionary as well.</p>
<p>I was glad to have run across this page Having its own page with the banner headline helps make it more prominent. It gets people thinking about the matter.</p>
<p>This article can be designated a stub. But I'm afraid that it will be deleted because people are uncomfortable with the subject.</p>
<p>I was very glad to find this page, as I'm writing a paper that involves this topic, and I found that this term worked perfectly in this context. It might make sense to move it to Wiktionary, but the page should definetely be kept up in some form. --renaissanceboy 23:49, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - 1) a term that survived for 120+ years is not a neologism. 2) <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a> is already overloaded and I think Pinsker's quotation is important to understand his reasoning for the term he offered. Therefore if the decision is to merge, let's indeed <i>merge</i> and retain the quote. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">?</a></sup> 00:42, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have been stressing over this particular AfD since I nominated it. And the more I'm watching it and digging into web-based sources, the more I am leaning toward thinking this article should be kept. Primarily because I think that there is something notable here, not long after I nominated this article the original writer made an edit at 01:08, 20 November 2006. This edit concerned gang violence and was almost immediate removed by the writer stating "Taken out 'Gang Violence' Para, Staff requested removal." I am thinking that I would like to revert this article to the edit listed above, and give this article some more time to declare itself notable, time to dig into this subject a little bit more and research the gang violence problem this school has. That being said, I am changing my opinion on this article to a weak <b>keep</b>. Should research fail to pan out any useful claim to notability, there is plenty of time to revisit deletion later. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrusilver_ae53.html" title="User:Trusilver">Trusilver</a> 07:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, the get regular coverage, i.e. routine and and trivial coverage with minimal editorial oversight or anything else. Indeed, it is often difficult to tell when such coverage is even independent and even when it is its very regular nature makes it trivial. We don't have articles about every single murderer even if the local papers will cover each one in depth. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>If you think this is about whether the school has an article or not you are abusing the deletion system and wasting our time, something I am very bitter about. You may equate "routine" with "trivial" but there is not particular reason anyone else should; yes many trivial events are covered but so are important ones. It adds up to proof that the school is important in the community and that there is potential for separate article if enough research is done. A one-off murder is usually a news event, not a enduring institution. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 03:02, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tayuke, you can't "own" facts as you claim that the school does, and wants to have the information deleted. Sure, we can't just copy the information from the school's website, but that hasn't been done here. All the article is is just a factual information article on a school. The school has no rights over the information at all, and where the information is copyrighted, it would be easily covered by a fair use or fair dealing provision under Copyright law - it is for research purposes. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 01:18, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's not "too bad"... it doesn't matter what your school told you about copyright, but you need to realise that we will remove copyright violations, but we will not delete articles just because you ask. You should know something hopefully about fair dealing provisions under Copyright law, which exist in Australia and are even broader under US Law as far as I know. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and there are clearly allowed exceptions for fair dealing where a small amount of the work is used and cited properly for the purposes of research or study law as well (see s. 40 of the Copyright Act 1968 in Australia). While your school may "own" the work, unless there is wholesale copying of the text (which I don't think there is), I doubt this would ever constitute a copyright violation, either under Australian or US Law, which is more applicable. And despite the school's objections, there's still nothing to stop us putting up things like "Macgregor State High School is a high school in the suburb of Macgregor, Queensland." That's a fact- it's not owned by anyone. Wikipedia does not delete articles because someone asks for them to be deleted. If you want to edit here you have to follow the policy, of which that is a part. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 07:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, let’s say MSHS have realized that I have broken copyright. What if I got a letter, signe by the principal herself, telling you all, that I did the wrong thing, and although I was intending to do the right thing, by making a page for MSHS on the school itself, and its awards, its achievements, and that this whole page should be removed. Yes, there are few things that that can’t be copyrighted, but I sure we can take away the History of the school, which at the moment is th only major part of the Page. <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETayuke_e361.html" title="User:Tayuke">Tayuke</a> 00:15, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>yea, well as you may recall from the lengthy debate about schools way back when, there are plenty of us who simply disagree <i>in toto</i> with the School "policy," which I take to be a proposal anyway. We can disagree, but citing faux-statute like this will not change my mind and editors like myself who generally favor deletion have advanced every argument under the sun in explication, so consult the archives if you need further elucidation. I might note that very few school AfDs ended in keep; they ended in no consensus b/c the divisions were so deep. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 00:34, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have video evidence of students engaging in fights, however I will not post these videos up without permission of those involved, this will provide hard evidence of the "Gang Violence" Paragraph. You can also contact Garden City Management on what some students at Macgregor State High School have done. Also there has been posts of youtube.com which showed evidence of students punching and kicking other students in the "Alley Way". The principal of Macgregor State high School found out about this and ordered students that posted up the videos remove them or face suspension. Contact the principal herself for confirmation of my accusation, there are plenty of people which would back what I have accused. There was a whole assembly over the issue of youtube.com and myspace.com pictures/videos being posted up.

<p>This concept of mindless eating has struck a chord with an international public.</p>
<p>In the past 6 weeks, both the New York Times and USA Today have mentioned in in major feature articles. In the past month, 20/20, Good Morning America have featured it. On Sunday 11/19, CBS Weekend will have a feature by Emmy Award-winning Teichner and CBS News with Katie Couric will have a feature on it Monday 11/20.</p>
<p>It has also been the subject of a recent book, "Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think," which was #11 on the NYTimes Bestseller list last week. This is also of international resonance: The book has been licensed for publication in Japan, Brazil, Russia, in Hebrew, Danish, and Korean.</p>
<p>Academic references to the topic have been provided in the updated entry. In addition, Mindless Eating is mentioned throughout the two following articles:</p>
<p>"Seduced By Snacks? No, Not You" by Kim Severson New York Times, 10-11-06, pp. D1+. "Just Put Your Mind to It" by Nanci Hellmich USA Today, 10-11-06, p. 5D.</p>
<p>The one in the NYTimes was among the five most emailed articles for the week in which it was published.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jychao (<a href="../../../j/y/c/User_talk%7EJychao_a367.html" title="User talk:Jychao">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jychao_f0ff.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jychao">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Neologism. Does appear to have attracted some attention, but no indication that that will translate into lasting notability. Additionally, the article as it stands treads close to being an ad.

<li><b>Retain</b>. Many of the changes have been made that were suggested earlier. One of the misunderstood take-aways of this concept is that it connotes an out-of-control, hopeless relationship with food. What needs to be underscored, and I think this has been done is that there is a silver lining here, that mindless eating can also be used to eat better.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it would be advised to directly link this concept to the book, that would clarify the concept in similar manner. Jychao 01:18, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't care all that much whether this particular article stays or not, but the default option on AFD is to keep -- it is only really necessary to cite what part of policy/guidelines support the deletion of an article.

<p>This page is entirely composed of false/unverifiable information about a game that is not known to be planned, and was only shown at <a href="../../../e/3/_/E3.html" title="E3">E3</a> 2006 - one time. The name <i>Wii Motor Sports</i> was stated to only be temporary. The only game composing <i>Wii Motor Sports</i> is said to be this airplane game - but the airplane demo is nowhere to be seen. An old quote in the article taks about how it could be included in <i><a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_Sports_01f2.html" title="Wii Sports">Wii Sports</a></i>, but this has been contradicted since the released product contains no such ariplane demo. <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7EScepia_1657.html" title="User:Scepia">Scepia</a> 07:54, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Is this another "the ends justify the means" excuse? Prod'ding the article would have allowed editors to identify the issue before an AfD was created. The failure to follow process and allow for the improvement of an article created by a brand new user is an egregious show of bad faith. Deletionists demand that we follow their own distorted set of rules but refuse to follow the ones we all agree on. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Excuse me, but that's a terribly biased, poorly-based, and personally offensive statement. I was simply pointing out that every school article which gets a prod tag has that tag quickly removed, which is true. Since you justified why you would've preferred the article was prod'd, I completely agree with your statement- it would allow for improvement before a possible AfD. However, your blanket statement after this rationale is rather awful. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Completely disagree. There is an argument, well established, that schools are inherently unnotable and there are plenty of editors who reject out of hand the so-called compromise represented by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> which does an end-run around issues of notability. Asking those of us who disagree with the ridiculous standards laid out at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> to justify our rationale within the terms it sets out (which is how I read your comment) is therefore not germane. A shorthand for the well-established arguments for why schools are unnotable is thus to say <b>schoolcruft</b>, even if it is perhaps dismissive. But since the body of AfD debates on schools has been the subject of hundreds of thousands of words back and forth, by this point I think informed editors are justified in implicitly referencing those arguments with whatever short form they wish, to wit: <b>Delete</b> as nn school. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 12:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. The argument that an actor whose biggest role is "...playing one of the 4 thugs..." is probably not very notable is a strong one.

<p>Non notable website about cricket. Claims in article very misleading Leg before Wiki 22:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I dont think you can claim this website is not a notible website about cricket gaming. It is the only active website which is updated regually about cricket games. Which claims are miss leading? Boulet 22:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You misunderstand. The onus is not on me to prove that this article should be deleted. It is upon you to prove that it should be kept. Leg before Wiki 22:50, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The onus is surely on you to explain which claims are misleading? You are of course welcome to clean up the article and remove these claims. You claim it should be deleted as it is not a notible cricket website but it is a notible cricket gaming website wouldn't you agree? Many cricket games have their own articles and mention most of the playabilty and lastivity of these games come from community made patches. These patches exclusivly come from PlanetCricket and this has been mentioned in several articles.Boulet 22:54, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the onus is on me, why are you trying to justify the article's existence? You would better serve wikipedia by trying to cleanup articles that are in need of it. I know you as a person, I know that you're a sockpuppet of the creator, and I'm sure that many other mysterious users will appear on this page before long. You <i>disgust</i> me.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have attempted to clean up the article and I disagree with DixiePixie about it being a commercial as it contains information and cricket games patches which are vital to the playablity of the games (have you even played any?? Try EA's games and you will know what I mean). It also has information about a new community cricket game which perhaps does not warrent its only article as yet but at a later date could be split off from the PlanetCricket article.

<li>The problem is a lot of us are very busy, and don't have time to waste finding thse sources (this is probably the reason that there's so much cruft on wikipedia, as anime fans and the like tend to be either teenagers or unemployed so can easily keep their crap on). Anyway, according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>... Doesn't meet sections 1, 2, 3. Leg before Wiki 12:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that there are good reasons which show its important mentioned on the actual article e.g <a href="http://www.codemasters.co.uk/press/?showarticle=8841" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.codemasters.co.uk/press/?showarticle=8841" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> and the fact that the producer of EA's latest cricket game chose to do his only interview with the site. To be honest if Leg Before Wikie cant be bothered to research and find sources he shouldnt really be putting sites up for deletion. Boulet 15:09, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's quite obvious from reading the artitcle. And I know exactly who you are and what you've done, it's only the fact that I can't prove it that's stopping me mentioning it. Leg before Wiki 15:22, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I dont really think that it is a valid reason for article deletion then? This seems to be a personal vendetta of some sort against the person who you believe I am (whoever that maybe)!Boulet 15:27, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Many game fansites get given tickets to things, beta slots, and all that... in itself, it doesn't make a site notable. Nor does being a big site. I tried to find some magazine/newspaper items, but failed to find any. Given the number of links to this site, I don't want to totally dismiss the chance that there are some articles out there somewhere, hence being a weak delete. It'd be easy to change my mind with a few good references. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolenth_1692.html" title="User:Polenth">Polenth</a> 07:43, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Intro does need to be rewritten to establish notability better. LARP GoH at Origins. On the DRV discussion it was argued this was a minor award - maybe compared to other gaming awards, but within the LARPing community it's pretty huge as it's the only LARP award available that isn't publisher specific. Also designed award winning board game Hamlet (Polycon independant game design contest, which had a $1000 prize attached to it).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Theatre-Style LARP is a notable form of LARP with its own key entries. While the form is generally credited with having been invented by Walt Frietag, Mike Young has been one of the principal developers since 1989. He has presented material at very nearly every one of the Live Action Roleplaying Association's 2-3 annual conventions, and presented numerous talks. Theatre Style is not as popular a form in the U.S. as in Europe where it is state funded, however comparable European Designer Mike Pohjola has an entry at fi.wikipedia.org. While Mike did not invent the four hour format of Theatre Style LARP which is common at conventions such as Origins, Gencon, etc., his popularization of the form led to his being selected as one of two judges for LARPA's Small Gamewriting Competition for 2006. This is a growing field. I'd also argue a strong inequity here. Live Combat LARP is characterized by strong group identities, and nearly every small group, no matter how relatively unspectacular is accorded a Wikipedia Entry. Theatre Style LARP is heavily characterized by individual designers - Mike Young is as notable in the Theatre Style Field as <a href="../../../i/f/g/IFGS_a6f8.html" title="IFGS">IFGS</a> in the Live Combat discipline, and significantly moreso than <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight_Realms_337f.html" title="Knight Realms">Knight Realms</a> which is also accorded a listing. I would submit that none of the editors favoring deletion have shown a strong familiarity with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre_Style_0910.html" title="Theatre Style">Theatre Style</a>, and that within that arguably significant community, Mike Young is considered to be a designer of considerable historical and contemporary significance.

<li><b>Probable cleanup and keep</b> Of course it would be nonsense to say these are standard words, but as I read the article, it doesn't make that claim. I've seen them around enough that I would expect the claims the article does make, can be sourced, or at least that enough of them can be sourced to leave enough for an article. As for Pete Fenelon's remarks -- it's not relevant to this discussion whether the adoption of these words would be <i>a good idea</i>. I don't think the article <i>advocates</i> for the words; if it did, that should be cleaned up, but is not grounds to delete. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 05:03, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an unaccredited school which has been described as a diploma mill. It was started as a rather more flattering article by <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrGladwin_3f33.html" title="User:DrGladwin">User:DrGladwin</a>, a student there. Apparently it has been vandalised by students numerous times, and Dr Gladwin has asked for help in bringing it to AfD. The more cynical among you may feel that this has more to do with the cited facts regarding its academic status than with the actual vandalism. Maybe, maybe not.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Well, my reason for having this article deleted is very well put by Guy. There is more to arguments than just proving facts by copying and pasting links from other websites. That only works in some cases, specifically not in this one. This article has been the center of edit wars and bitterness, which will never end. Personally, I feel working on this article is a waste of time for everyone. There are other important articles where we can contribute our time. The sprotect message on the article header doesn't look pretty either. It was all my fault to start this article; I didn't know it would lead to this. So please, I humbly request it to be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b> Viridae, you make a good point, but the thing is, this school is no longer a diplima mill, it was once in the late 80s and early 90s. Most of the websites that claim to prove it a diploma mill are "correct," but technically, they are outdated. People are treating those websites as reliable sources, which apparently, is absurd. This is 2006 and I'm a student here, and things have changed a lot. My point is, this article is has nothing meaningful to contribute. If you still want to look at it the way it was in the 80s and 90s, go ahead, keep the article. The only problem is, there are no websites that look at present day UHSA. As a side note, there are numerous other medical schools in the region, and none of them have Wiki articles. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrGladwin_3f33.html" title="User:DrGladwin">DrGladwin</a> 00:16, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>:Leuko, the state websites are true, but from their experience with UHSA in the 80s and 90s. And when you say, "UHSA is not accredited by any recognised accreditation body. As such, its degrees may not be acceptable to employers or other institutions, and use of degree titles may be restricted or illegal in some jurisdictions. It is blacklisted by some US states," that is totally false. For example, UHSA is fully recognized in Georgia, Arizona, etc., provided that students have received their degree through traditional classroom instruction - like I'm doing. My point is, this article has nothing meaningful to contribute. People who wish to know about UHSA can call the school and talk to its students. I don't understand the point of posting info that is inaccurate and only instigates people. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrGladwin_3f33.html" title="User:DrGladwin">DrGladwin</a> 00:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There seems to be a train of thought that unaccredited schools / diploma mills do not merit articles. Unfortunately there is not a single shred to stand on that makes accredited schools OK and unaccredited schools forbidden. Either they meet the necessary qualifications, or they don't. The school has been repeatedly covered in the media -- mostly in an unflattering light -- and many of these articles are referenced here from sources that fulfill <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Alansohn and JJay, while I agree with your point, you're relying too much on other outdated websites. UHSA sure has had it's bad years, and all this article is doing is scraping those wounds open. Presently, UHSA staff and students (like me) are working very hard improve our reputation. I agree with Rob's point: "accredited insitutions have more verifiable info available, and unaccredited less." Here's where the problem lies - there isn't much info about UHSA. I must tell you it has had graduates that were blacklisted and banned from practicing in some states, on the other hand, it has had grads doing residency at the University of Chicago Hospitals (best in the country). Presently, we have a team of grads getting into the best residencies across the US, and trust me, I'm headed into that direction. It would be best to wait till ~2010 and see where UHSA is headed; as for now, it would be best to delete this article. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrGladwin_3f33.html" title="User:DrGladwin">DrGladwin</a> 05:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dr. Gladwin, I sympathize with your position and the last thing I want to see is a school be unfairly stigmatized on wikipedia by a bunch of POV warriors who have some hate filled agenda to push. But why can't we do a balanced article on this medical school? If its grads are doing residencies in major teaching hospitals, and thus hold roles of authority in local communities in numerous countries, I think the institution merits inclusion in wikipedia. The accreditation issue - past and present - need to be clarified. You have raised substantive concerns in that regard. But I think editing and more sources will lead to a more balanced and updated overview. In the meantime, I don't see any grounds for deletion. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:30, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> By nature accredited insitutions have more verifiable info available, and unaccredited less. What we need is *substantial* quality and quanity of external coverage. A lot of refs are listed, but going through them, I don't see the meat. If this place is notable, we should be able to get a better/clearer picture of its current state of affairs. JJay, I'm not clear on your point with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unaccredited_institutions_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning">List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning</a>. That list is a shameful violation of our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a> (virtually every entry is "verified" by its <i>absence</i> from a reliable source). It was created as part of a crusade to save the world from "unaccredited institutions", by those who want Wikipedia to cover comprehensively what no mainstream media has been willing to cover sufficiently. The claim above, that we don't delete articles due ot edit wars, and using <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> as an example, is misleading. Edit wars in <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> are settled by an appeal to countless reliable sources (which give not only facts but *analysis* and summary of those facts). There really isn't a great source to settle disputes in this article. Also, this simply isn't an encylopedic article. It is a consumer protection alert. For instance "<i>...so it is important to double check the licensing policy of any state you might be interested...</i>". A fine piece of advice to be sure, but hardly to purpose of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:43, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
