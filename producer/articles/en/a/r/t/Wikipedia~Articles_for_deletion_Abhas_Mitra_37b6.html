<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I'm not sure where the notability issue arises. Mitra created an <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetospheric_eternally_collapsing_object.html" title="Magnetospheric eternally collapsing object">entirely novel theory</a> for explaining the objects we commonly call <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">black holes</a>. He has published numerous items on the subject (see the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetospheric_eternally_collapsing_object.html" title="Magnetospheric eternally collapsing object">MECO page</a> for most of them) and has been featured in several articles. He should definitely have his own page. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 19:42, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s> The question is whether he meets <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Robert seems to be claiming that he meets it MECO and criterion 5. I haev not however seen any evidence that MECO is a signficiant or well-known concept in the field. While he has papers published in respectabe journals, most of the articles about him (such as <a href="http://us.rediff.com/news/2004/aug/03hole.htm" class="external text" title="http://us.rediff.com/news/2004/aug/03hole.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a>) make clear that he has gotten little or no attention from the mainstream astrophysics community. This position would be subject to change if someone can convince me otherwise or so that he meets another criterion of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:48, 3 November 2006 (UTC) Changing to <b>Delete</b> given that what's below is apparently the best argument for keeping. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:12, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I would argue that it is a significant concept in the field of astrophysics because it proposes an alternative to black holes. This is significant just as alternative theories for the big bang are significant. Until someone can come out and prove one way or another that one theory is <i>absolutely</i> correct, any plausible hypothesis (which MECO certainly is) deserves to be debated. Combine this rationale with the numerous articles published on the subject (found on the MECO page, some of which review Mitra's work) and we are left with a clear candidate for crit 5 of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EProf_bc6c.html" title="WP:Prof">WP:Prof</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 20:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Absolutely not. The standard for whether something is significant in a field is whether people in the field have found it significant. The above claim is particularly hard to swallow given the standard of having to "prove one way or another that one theory is <i>absolutely</i> correct" since this never happens in science by definition. We need evidence astrophysicists find the idea notable, not that you or some random individual or even a few astrophysicists find it "plausible" Furthermore, I fail to see "numerous" articles about the subject. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:12, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - A few astrophysicists finding it plausible constitute "multiple independent" sources and hence satisfies the notability crit. As such, "people in the field" have found it significant satisfying your criterion. As long as plausible alternatives to describing so called black holes exist, and until we eliminate them as possible theories, they are notable and worthy of inclusion so that researchers and anybody else who is curious can get a sense for all theories proposed and not just the most popular one (quick note so I don't get pegged for this: I'm not suggesting that alternate theories presented on wikipedia should be taken as fact; I'm just saying it's a good place to get a general sense about a field before doing some solid research within a good library). I don't understand your comment about absolute certainty "never happens in science by definition". I have never seen a definition of science which does not allow for certainty. I am certain, for example, that the moon revolves around the earth, and the earth around the sun. This was not always widely believed, and at one point this theory would have been considered absurd. As we expand the limits of the known, things that once seemed like pipe dreams become very plausible, and can (in time) become certainties. I'm not sure quite where I'm going with this, but I'm also not sure what your objection to MECO is. I am admittedly not into astrophysics (math is my comfort zone) and perhaps you are better versed in this issue than I. However, from what I've read, Mitra's theory is notable enough to warrent its own wikipedia page, which seems to indicate that Mitra deserves one as well (not an acid test, but I've already cited a crit which I believe is met and maybe this line of reasoning works better for you). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 21:56, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep —</b> A quick google search reveals that many sources feel this work to be an important new concept (point 5) and (b), along with Mitra's previous concept - that of <a href="../../../m/e/c/MECO_470b.html" title="MECO">MECOs</a>. I'm going to mention this in the article, and add a source. As we have an article on MECOs, it seems only right that we have an article on the person who decided they existed. Should the sicentist himself fail the notability test, but the concept pass, then I'd suggest merge and redirect to <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetospheric_eternally_collapsing_object.html" title="Magnetospheric eternally collapsing object">Magnetospheric eternally collapsing object</a>. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 23:01, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - <b>The issue is the notability of Dr. Mitra, not the notablity of the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetospheric_eternally_collapsing_object.html" title="Magnetospheric eternally collapsing object">MECO</a> theory.</b> First of all, the MECO theory is not extraordinary, but instead is one of many theories that seek to explain how <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> really does not permit <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">black holes</a> to exist. I personally have reason to believe that all such theories are mistaken, but will not contest the MECO as an encyclopedic subject due to the attention that it has garnered. My issue instead is one of whether Dr. Mitra is automatically becomes encyclopedic because he has contributed to the MECO concept. I really fail to see that. Instead I see an article about a relatively minor scientist that is very unlikely to ever be more than a stub. Even now it says little more than that Dr. Mitra is a contributor to the MECO concept, somcething that can already be inferred from the MECO article.

So the article being linked to speaks more of a fringe scientist trying to make himself look good than a notable scientist talking about his work. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>- Well my point is that the largest Indian newspaper and website have found the scientist notable enough to write an article about him. Even if it is the same article, it features in both the sites making him notable outside of the scientific community. -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush"><font color="olive"><b>Lost</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Being noted does not make you notable. That article fails to give Mitra a standing beyond being one of the main contributors to the MECO, and while notable the MECO remains a fairly obscure theory. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 15:49, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I can live with a merge/redirect per <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">User:Martinp23</a>. However, the notability of Mitra seems to be tied to the idea that the MECO concept may become popular.

<ul>
<li>Taking a second look at the article, I also think a <b>Merge/Redirect</b> will be better. The article doesn't have much content except his association with MECO theory. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 12:18, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
