<li>This is analogus to something like "Web 2.0" - Game 3.0 is not a generation of hardware, software or any particular technology stack. Game 3.0 is the new era of thought surrounding a collection of proven industry concepts that have become a percieved standard. All of the current console and game console software creators efforts have contributed to what the industry has come to expect from game 3.0. Jmcdaniel3 04:35, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would also like to point out that the users who marked this for delete while tagging it as marketing material are doing so based on a personal agenda, and not for the concern of Wikipedia article content quality. You can examine the users 'talk' pages and clearly see that the users calling this marketing and spam have their own strong opinions about the industry in question that this movement doesnt mesh with.</p>
<p>At the end of the day - wether they personally like this or not, it is a phrase coined by SCE and any press resource can validate that.</p>

<dd>No offence intended - but I think you need to go take some business classes and then come back and try to have this debate. Being a market leader is not defined by near-term sales. TD there are over 190,000,000 SCE platforms sold worldwide. No other console manufacturer in the history of the business has sold as much. This entire debate about this article being deleted really concerns me about Wikipedia's ability to maintain accurate content. When you recommended this article for deletion upon personal agenda (which can be proven in the article edit history where you edited the article text to reflect your personal bias the same time you recommended it for deletion) you did not take the time to understand basic concepts - for example, here you demonstrate that you have no idea what being the market leader means. If these kinds of antics carry on, and over long term people can delete and modify factualy content on Wikipedia to reflect their personal biases, the content on Wikipedia will become more and more worthless and only reflect the concensus of the users who remain and enjoy this kind of sophmoric information control (example: the act of you suggesting this article be deleted because of your personal biases) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jmcdaniel3 (<a href="../../../j/m/c/User_talk%7EJmcdaniel3_d846.html" title="User talk:Jmcdaniel3">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmcdaniel3_e4ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmcdaniel3">contribs</a>) 13:46, 10 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li>ok so now that you have signed-in - how does that page prove a bias? Game 3.0 is not about SCE digital entertainment content platforms. Where is the bias? and bias twoards what? I will agree that "4D" is total marketing speak. Again Game 3.0 is analogus to things like "Web 2.0". It isnt really a consumer level topic but rather a software design/project management centric topic. A term does not have to be a consumer friendly bit of info for it to be Wikipedia worthy. I can clearly understand the reaction by consumers. Game 3.0 has been present in the industry since Microsoft standardized the XBOX Live! service across its software library via developer/publisher design ethics discipline. Now that the market leader has coined the phrase - it can be considered notable, and not just casual speak used by developers/designers behind the scenes. Jmcdaniel3 00:46, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually Game 3.0 was in use since about spring 2006 - and not even within SONY but at Microsoft when considering next gen Windows game experiences. I tried to research that for wikipedia to help the cause of this article, but there is nothing publically available. Oh well - I suspect the Wiki community will delete this and we will just re-create it when more uses become public. No matter when the article is re-created tho, SCE was the first to publically and in the eyes of the world media coin the phrase. (that fact seems to be what has caused such a retailiation against the article by SCE haters). I guess Wikipedia also doesnt have many members from the game development community voting here otherwise we would see far less deletes and more strong keeps. I still think that the article is based on the FACT that SCE coined the phrase - again SCE is the global market leader and I would think that what they do/say is notable. Especially when the phrase was born at the largest software company in the world (Microsoft). Jmcdaniel3 14:48, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Whoever Jmcdaniel3 is he is completey dead on with the article and his statements on the origins of the term. Sony did beat Microsoft to the punch when it comes to using this term in the public eye. The term has been used within Microsoft and MS Game Studios since early Q1 2006. It is all over internal meeting minutes and discussion records that will never be released for public consumption. Since this page looks to be made up of Sony haters, I will poke fun and say that if Sony is going to say Game 3.0 when positioning their products, they need to actually release software that can be considered Game 3.0. 66.193.54.250 16:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>"I've seen secret records of it being used by Microsoft, but I can't show them to you." Come on, "secret sources" aren't gonna fly on Wiki. This is getting ridiculous.Kzer-za 17:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are no secret sources referenced in the article. Are there any facts in the article that you can dispute or disprove? Jmcdaniel3 22:00, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Could you convert your references to an inline format, per <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>? It would help me figure out the specific problems that may be fixable, and whether or not to recommend a "keep and cleanup" or a deletion. I've only done a quick look-through, as my web connection is spotty at the moment. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 03:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Kzer-za has a point. If the primary sources (the Microsoft internal meeting minutes and discussion records) aren't accessible, and no reliable sources attest to the claim, there's no way for users to judge the veracity of such information. Wikipedia is ill-equipped to handle those sorts of claims, which is why there is an <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">attribution policy</a> that discourages them. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 03:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> It's nothing more than a Sony marketing buzzword right now. In the very unlikely event that it becomes a widely used industry term, then a Wiki article will make sense.Kzer-za 01:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
