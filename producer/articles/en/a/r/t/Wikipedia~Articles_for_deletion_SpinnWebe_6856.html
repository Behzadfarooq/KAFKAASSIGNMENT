<li><b>Keep</b>. <i>I'm</i> not a meatpuppet, and I think we should toss that accusation around less casually. There have been a number of recent AfD nominations of sites that were once extremely notable, but less so lately—this is one, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirsky%27s_Worst_of_the_Web_f5b0.html" title="Mirsky's Worst of the Web">Mirsky's Worst of the Web</a> is another. These are historically important sites for the web, and I think they deserve keeping on those grounds—otherwise, as sites slip into the past, we'll be deleting our communal memory too. There's a difference netween brand-new sites no one's heard of—the situations <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is really designed for—and once-notable sites that are now history. What's <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suck.com.html" title="Suck.com">suck.com</a>'s Alexa rating nowadays? What will it be in five years? It doesn't matter, it's significant as an important aspect of the web's development. <a href="../../../s/p/i/SpinnWebe_f730.html" title="SpinnWebe">SpinnWebe</a> was once very well-known and even got some mainstream press, but its notoriety was largely in pre-google days and it isn't very well-known now except for the <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysfunctional_Family_Circus_6214.html" title="Dysfunctional Family Circus">Dysfunctional Family Circus</a> flap. Admittedly, it never had the following of Suck, and the suggestion to merge it into the <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysfunctional_Family_Circus_6214.html" title="Dysfunctional Family Circus">Dysfunctional Family Circus</a> isn't totally off-base, but on balance I say keep. —<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 03:51, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps you should add my name to the list as well, since this page was brought to my attention through a discussion concerning the deletion. Of course, since <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> does not know me, nor zompist or notmydesk, personally, the accusation of script-use is pretty serious especially when it can be easily disproven. Having an active community, especially consisting of people who have their own extensive entries in Wikipedia, should not count as evidence of untoward behavior, but actually gives credence to the argument that the site does in fact hold relevance. I find it even more ironic that two people involved in this discussion are people who at one point or another had personal run-ins with spinn, yet one of them wrote the article and the other voted for the original deletion. Personally, I see this article not necessarily simply falling under web content, but rather a description of the history of an influential and active home site of an active, influential web personality. While spinn may be no Lawrence Lessig in his Alexa ratings or Technorati listing, his influence on many other personalities like Lore Sjoberg, Zompist, and notmydesk should not be discounted. Maybe it should just be rewritten to be about him instead of referencing his through his home website. --Leth</dd>
<dd>I'd consider "meat-puppetry" as untoward, if I understand the term. I'm interpreting it as your being under the impression I'm just telling my friends to post in the article's defense. It's especially ironic, since Schumin is specifically <i>not</i> a friend, given the amount of abuse I've heaped on him in the past. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 05:13, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Per <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html#Spinnwebe" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">this discussion</a>, I wasn't eligible to vote on the first AfD anyway, since I'm biased.

<li><b>Keep</b>. SpinnWebe's notability under [WP:WEB], footnote 5, might be secured alone by the loving review in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a> (June 10, 1996)— a review of the whole site, note, not just the DFC.

<dl>
<dd>The original Afd was rushed through on 5 delete votes (including Elkman who, though having a perfect right to vote, did not disclose his personal interest), and was based on a misstatement (that Spinn wrote the Wikipedia article). This is not a shining moment in Wikipedia consensus. Instead of defending this rush job, calling names, and relying on inappropriate criteria, I'd love to see the Delete people acting like encyclopedia editors and making an actual case.<a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">Zompist</a> 05:06, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I'm obviously a bit biased, but I think my logic is sound. For each point:
<ul>
<li><i>Criteria for inclusion.</i> It meets #1 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Discussion should really be over at this point. I don't understand why it isn't. (By the way, Bobby1011 said it meets #3 as well, but to my knowledge it doesn't.) Yes, it's because of the <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysfunctional_Family_Circus_6214.html" title="Dysfunctional Family Circus">Dysfunctional Family Circus</a>, but the articles and interviews aren't about the DFC concept in general, but the SpinnWebe version. When asked in an online chat about "internet parodies", Bil Keane talked about the SpinnWebe version specifically. These are not simple site listings or trivial coverage. These were people from Associated Press and <i>Wired</i> calling me and asking me for quotes. And yes, that's SW's one claim to fame, but there's no requirement that all aspects of the web site be publicized to confer notability.</li>
<li><i>Alexa ranking.</i> Immaterial. Alexa is a research tool, it's not a stated standard for inclusion in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It's a means to determine if it meets the guidelines, but it doesn't matter, the previous point already established it. Besides, what about ground-breaking web sites that no longer exist? They have an Alexa ranking of nothing, should we delete those, too? What's <a href="../../../x/o/o/XOOM_2df0.html" title="XOOM">XOOM</a>'s Alexa rating? What's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spot_15a4.html" title="The Spot">The Spot</a>'s Alexa rating?</li>
<li><i>Speedy deletion</i>. Yes, the article was deleted, and I understand that. As it stood, a neutral third party could not immediately see the article met <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Yes, it was reinstated with identical information--it probably shouldn't have been. However, having been alerted to the issue, I added the detail that brought it under inclusion guidelines. This is all in line with <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#If_you_disagree_with_the_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Guide to deletion: If you disagree with the consensus</a> (third paragraph). This article is no longer a candidate for speedy deletion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So, yes, the site is a shadow of its former glory. But Wikipedia is not a popularity contest. It <i>had</i> glory, with ample (and provided) evidence to support it, and thus clearly meets Wikipedia inclusion criteria. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 05:26, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - per Spinn above, and if you don't think he's a fair witness, pretend I said it. The site was highly notable in my rememberance of the web nearly 10 years ago (my god it's been that long). If notability is measured substantially against current Alexa rankings and other subjective and moving criteria, then every site will eventually be NN and deletable (save a lot of disk space.).

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This page was already listed for deletion, the vote was to delete. The webmaster (Spinn) and others associated with the site rallied people to recreate the article (see the number of blank red lines voting in the speedy delete page and this guy apparently just registered to vote in that page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:TreyVanRiper&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:TreyVanRiper&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). It was recreated almost exactly as it was <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/spinnwebe" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/spinnwebe" rel="nofollow">you can see a copy of the old page here</a> and because it was created almost exactly as it was before it did not have significant improvement and thus qualified for a speedy deletion. I put a speedy delete template and that as well was removed by <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">User:Schuminweb</a> (as Ruby pointed out, that user also participated in Vote Stacking and many of those voting keep here got his messages see his page history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Schuminweb" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Schuminweb" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

I did not want to have a revert war so I just left it like that and advised the admin who closed the previous afd about the situation. They also rallied around another page I put up for afd (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mirsky%27s_Worst_of_the_Web_9dd8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mirsky's Worst of the Web">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mirsky's Worst of the Web</a>) and <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmydesk_b639.html" title="User:Notmydesk">User:Notmydesk</a> made a snide remark "kids these days..." along with a remark by <a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">User:Zompist</a> "According to your user page, you were eight years old when Mirsky created his page.

Wikipedia is not for ads for websites and trying to break with wikipedia policy to perserve this article is ludicrous.

<li>You're not helping your case by mistating things that are easily checked. I didn't create (or in any way affect) the article about my site. And of course it’s no coincidence that people will look at other Afds you are doing. I have nothing to do with Mirsky’s. The comment about your age is a reminder that many of us were around on the web in that period, when you could have no personal experience of what was notable or not. Do you have some other reason that your opinion about the noteworthiness of 1995 websites is worth listening to? As for Spinnwebe's notability, see my points above. <a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">Zompist</a> 08:33, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>First of all, if you're going to argue about whether or not to take down a page, shouldn't you argue based on the merits of the page itself, and less on the people placing votes, or resurrecting a page? You're guilty of argument ad hominem, an obvious logical fallacy. Secondly, I take offense that you claimed I joined Wikipedia only to vote to keep Spinnwebe. You might have noticed <a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreyVanRiper_7a6d.html" title="User talk:TreyVanRiper">my talk page</a> where someone thanked me for my participation in a discussion regarding Citadel BBSes.

<li>JD, perhaps the reason people "rallied" against your suggested deletion of Mirsky's page is that you were off-base in suggesting it be deleted, based as it was on a simple counting of yahoo hits and not taking into account anything regarding the history and notability of the site itself -- much as you're doing with spinn's page. And, frankly, if you're going to take me to task for me "snidely" saying "kids these days..." you might want to take a number of others here to task for snidely calling myself and others "meat-puppets."--<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmydesk_b639.html" title="User:Notmydesk">Notmydesk</a> 16:05, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's a shame, I could recreate all this fairly easily, but I think it's bad form if I do it myself.". So it is infact confirmed that they just c&amp;ped back the same old page that was deleted (many sites make copies of old wikipedia pages).

<li><b>Comment</b>. I won't keep commenting here, but I do want to note a few things: (a) I can't speak for anyone else I resent the implication that I'm here because Schumin "recruited" me. I have zero interest or involvement in SpinnWebe; I read AfD and comment where I have something to contribute—I didn't see Schumin's note until after I commented here. But informing people who have spoken up in a debate that it's continuing in another forum <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">could be seen</a> as a courtesy instead of a conspiracy. (b) Wikipedians have a right to comment, even if they have some involvement in the issue being discussed. Please note that the alleged meatpuppets actually made arguments and didn't just do the usual newbie "<b>Dont Delete our Board you fuckers!</b>" kind of nonsense we often see on AfD. (c) The Mirsky nom is a separate issue, but "kids these days" sounds funny rather than snide to me. Maybe you have to be old to get it. (d) Most importantly, if you read the page JerseyDevil so triumphantly adduces, instead of just his cherrypicked examples, in my opinion you'll see Spinn working fairly respectfully <i>within</i> the Wikipedia process to get his page reinstated. To hold up that page as some kind of evidence of bad faith is just not appropriate. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 13:10, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, I had no idea that Schumin has attempted to 'recruit' me. Frankly, this is argumentum ad hominem, and shouldn't influence one's vote. There's a difficult problem here; Wikipedia would want to avoid having a bunch of fanboys jumping on the bandwagon and defending the honor of some po-dunk nothing web site that some idiot posted, but doesn't really belong on the Wikipedia. On the other hand, I would think that the Wikipedia would want to know about an influential web site from the early days, and would want people who are informed about that site (who, most likely, would be that site's fans) to provide credible information about it. This is why I urgently ask the voters to consider the merits of the page based on the page's merits, and not the merits of the people voting for it. Otherwise, you risk turning the Wikipedia into something less than useful. -- <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyVanRiper_bafb.html" title="User:TreyVanRiper">TreyVanRiper</a> 14:38, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You voted delete on the original article on the basis I wrote it, yet I did not.</li>
<li>You're suggesting Zompist should be looked at suspiciously because he wrote his own article, yet he did not.</li>
<li>Multiple articles in independent reputable sources make it notable. If you have a band that's a <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-hit_wonder.html#Lists_of_greatest_one-hit_wonders" title="One-hit wonder">one-hit wonder</a>, do you make an entry for the song, or for the band?</li>
<li>A conversation among friends does not indicate a conspiracy against you. Nyder's comment on my forum is immaterial (she hasn't even been involved in any of this on Wikipedia to my knowledge).</li>
<li>I edited Mirsky's entry in Sept 2005 so it was on my watchlist; seeing your name come up on my watchlist in another article is also not proof of a conspiracy against you.</li>
<li>You are taking all of this too personally. I feel anything I say is going to be viewed through a lens of suspicion, not because it's my site, but because you think I'm orchestrating something.

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b> or <b>Speedy Delete</b>. Hey, I <i>wrote</i> the original article (actually, expanded it from a stub). It was a decent article on a marginal-but-probably-acceptable web site. I voted to keep it on the original AfD, which was not heavily populated -- 4-1 against, IIRC, including the nominator. I think its too bad it was deleted. BUT. It was deleted properly in-process, and I think we need to respect that. Whether AfD might need reform (e.g., at least <i>n</i> total responses are required, where <i>n</i>=8 or whatever) is an interesting question but not germane to to <i>this</i> case. We need to stand by the principle of <i>stare decicis</i> or we'll never get anything done. In fact, per the nominator, I don't think this should even be here. <i><b>It is NOT acceptable for Wikipedia to be bullied into revoking a properly placed speedy by out-of-process deletion of properly formed and placed speedy tags</b></i>, period. The only correct recourse is <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> (although technically that is only for correction of out-of-process deletions, and this deletion was done properly).

<li><b>Comment</b> It's true, I think, that the page was legally deleted. But at least one or two of the delete votes were ill-informed, and some folks knowlegeable about the subject had no idea that there was a vote for its deletion until sometime after the vote had finished. Suppose, for example, that a group of people on Wikipedia decided to choose some obscure topic (e.g. Fugue, the musical form), set up a vote for its deletion, and cause the page to get removed. Because few people knowing anything about Fugues would have noticed, the page would get deleted, perhaps for no good reason. Then, if someone said, "Wait a tic... that isn't right..." and put the page back up, would you still feel that it should remain deleted? - <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyVanRiper_bafb.html" title="User:TreyVanRiper">TreyVanRiper</a> 14:28, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just to play devil's advocate for a moment (since I'm not arguing deletion based on traffic rankings etc); your argument is apples and oranges. Avril Lavigne warrents an article regardless of Alexa rankings (et al) because she is notable independant of her website (and would be considered under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

If SpinnWebe were an entity outside of a website, you could apply criteria to that entity that were completely independent of web rankings and other criteria that are traditionally applied to websites. Your point about applying current Alexa rankings in the context of a discussion about the historical value of a site has some validity though, but in that case I would recommend better demonstrating the historical context and value of SpinnWebe in the article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:44, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just mean the one that was c&amp;ped, before you made the new changes. The references make the article look better, the Wired article mentions you and the site but solely in the context of the DFC. It seems that the only notablity that the website really has is regarding the DFC, so why not just merge this article with the DFC article? Or just make Spinnwebe redirect to the DFC page as it already has a lot of info about Spinnwebe's relationship with it. Also, it would help the argument to have a link to the New Yorker piece (though, I understand that since it was created so long ago it would be difficult to find). Simply stating that it was cited in the New Yorker doesn't help because we can not verify it.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 20:23, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>"the one...before you made the new changes."</i> Then you are arguing a previous version should be deleted, not the current one. Even if I find my old copy of this magazine, I am at a loss how I can present it to you, since scanning it and uploading it to Wikipedia would most probably violate copyright. I (and others) tell you it is there, and <i>if you assume bad faith</i>, then yes, you can't accept it as a reference. Even if I scanned it and mailed it to you personally to satisfy your doubt, then the reference would still hold the same weight for another editor two years from now. I am not sure, then, how any printed, offline material can be taken as a reference. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 20:45, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The New Yorker is readily available on a complete DVD set; I have it, and checked the issue in question. It's a short article; but 1. it's the New Yorker, man; how much coverage has <i>Wikipedia</i> gotten in the New Yorker? 2. it's not like it's one entry in a long list; the magazine at that time singled out one website every two weeks for notice. In effect, it's a judgment that it's one of the two dozen notable websites for that year. <a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">Zompist</a> 22:05, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Cdcon got it exactly right. As I stated, the Wired article mentions Spinnwebe solely in the context of the DFC. The role of Spinnwebe on DFC is already mentioned in the DFC article. On it's own merits, Spinnwebe alone does not warrant an article.

Maybe have a section on the DFC page on other works by the same author? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 16:12, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'll propose this as a possible way forward here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone calm down&#160;:)</li>
<li>We acknowledge that process was, if not outright violated, at least a little bit bent by the recreation of the article</li>
<li>We acknowledge that there is at least an <i>argument</i> to be made for the notability of this site</li>
<li>The article be deleted without prejudice, and that interested parties be allowed to create a spanky new article (or merge the information into the DFS article if they choose)</li>
<li>If the article is recreated, it should be judged on its own merits and not on the history of the current article or the personalities involved</li>
</ol>
<p>Does that seem feasible? That way the process is respected, but separated from concerns about the encyclopedicity of the information. I realize it's a pain in the ass for those who don't think it should have been nominated in the first place, but it's an attempt to find some common ground. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 16:28, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would resist this, only because essentially the same information would be added and the same discussion would ensue. What you're essentially saying is that "let's consider if the article should be written better." --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 16:44, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Spinn's concern but I don't think it's reason to resist. Rodii has accurately noticed that the complaint of the deletionists is primarily "abuse of process" (AfD double-jeopardy, Meatpuppets, etc.); very few have made arguments against its notability. This needs a substantially clean slate. I don't usually hang out at AfD but when I saw this article and deletion debate mentioned on some user page it brought me to the realization that Wikipedia fails to impart much of the richness of the early history of the Web, which I think is a form of <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">systemic bias</a> based on the fact that web content is so ephemeral (and possibly the rise of a younger userbase, which is making me feel old). IMHO DFC, 1-900-ZWEBLÖ and IADL were some of the earliest examples of participatory humorous sites in the vein of <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.html" title="Fark">Fark</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/SomethingAwful_0538.html" title="SomethingAwful">SomethingAwful</a>, etc. SpinnWebe is right there in my own memory with <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Hall_5b6f.html" title="Justin Hall">Justin Hall</a>'s links.net. (And I'm also amazed to find that so little is written in that article on the "founding father of personal blogging".) As such, Spinn - I think if you check your notes and ask some of your oldest fans to reminisce a bit I think we can find some additional facts and citations which can accurately portray the historicity and notability of this site in a new article. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 18:29, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I take that back.

<dd>Hmmm. Interesting case. Several people, from Jimbo on down, have noted at times that AfD has problems, and this case is a good a example. It is, however, understandable. There is a <i>lot</i> of Wikipedia:vanispamcruftisment produced every day, and people are busy. I second the suggestion the simply delete without prejudice and <i>list on deletion review</i>. Yes that's a pain in the butt and seems like beauracratic niggling. But the thing is, precedent. There are <i>lots</i> of entries of the my web site/my 8-person company/my and my buddies garage band/our 6-member games forum/my boyfriend etc. variety deleted <i>every single day</i>. The last thing anyone wants is for anyone to get the idea that they have some basis for recreating these without going thru deletion review because, hey, SpinnWebe. There is a marginal but valid case for taking this to deletion review. In fact, why wait -- why don't you take the <i>original</i> article to deletion review <i>now</i>? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 14:09, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because deletion review is for procedural errors in deletion, and I don't see any. It was originally deleted according to Wikipedia procedure, and again, it was reinstated according to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#If_you_disagree_with_the_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia procedure</a>.</dd>
<dd>I see no risk of creating precedent, either. If My And My Buddies Garage Band was deleted, and then later reinstated with references to its <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a> review, then I see no problem with that. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 15:45, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, see my comments above. Leth</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Changing my vote to Keep.
<ol>
<li>OK OK OK. This <i>was</i> deleted in-process but I think that it would be valid to list on deletion review, on the grounds that <i>none of the delete votes refuted or even made reference to the Keep arguments</i>, and the Delete <i>arguments</i> consisted mainly of "non-notable, delete". Remember, <i>AfD is <b>not a vote</b>, it is supposed to be a discussion</i>, and the Keep side "won" the discussion, therefore a case could be made that the closing admin erred in not relisting or keeping the AfD open. Even if one holds that only the votes made after the Keep side had completed its arguments could be expected to address those arguments, that brings the "vote" down to 3-1 against at best (including the nominator), and it could be argued that that is not a quorum.</li>
<li>If this were to be listed on deletion review, I think the "keep" arguments would win the day, as (IMO) they have done here. So why go through all that -- let's just consider this thread to be a deletion review, and let the closing admin treat it as such.</li>
<li>OK, yes, the article <i>was</i> deleted in-process (marginally), and yes the speedy-delete tags <i>shouldn't</i> have been removed, and yes this discussion <i>should</i> be taking place at deletion review, and yes this <i>would</i> be a bad precedent. But let's not be total process geeks here, the bottom line is that the article was deleted too quickly more-or-less by mistake and should be kept. As to setting precedent, people are not gonna remember this thread a week from now let alone point to it as a precedent. I think that <i><b>just this once</b></i> it would make sense to make an exception.

<dd><i>The "Nipple Server" sounds like something that should be banned by the Communications Decency Act, but this curious exercise in Web creativity is much weirder than anything our congressbeings could imagine. Every weekday morning, page author Greg Galcik has been aiming a Casio digital camera at his left breast, firing and uploading the image to his site. Viewers are then requested to rate the day's specimen from 0 to 10 on "Color," "Perkiness," "Panache" and the vague category "Overall nipplish quality." (Fortunately -- or unfortunately -- there's nothing that special to see. No wacky piercings or anything.) Galcik explained earlier this year that the site's no big deal to his parents or his wife, as "they know what kind of weirdo I am."</i></dd>

<dd><i>"Family Circus" creator Bil Keane is worried about a less-than- wholesome parody of his kid-friendly comic on the Web. Keane said last week he was mildly amused by the "Dysfunctional Family Circus" when it began five years ago, but then his readers started to complain. The Web site - SpinnWebe, maintained by Greg Galcik - uses Keane's cartoons while allowing site visitors to make up the captions. The results are often sarcastic or dark humor and, predictably, sometimes obscene and pornographic, Keane said. King Features, which syndicates Keane's comic, and Keane's attorney sent Galcik a letter last week threatening legal action unless he removed references to Keane's work.</i></dd>
