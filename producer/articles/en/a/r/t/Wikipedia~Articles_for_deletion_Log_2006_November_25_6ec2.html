<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree. Harlamon took over the reigns of a key Connecticut city during the height of racial strife. He was a major player in Waterbury, CT history. It should be noted that Wikipedia cites numerous Waterbury Ct mayors when went to jail.

<li><b>Keep</b> article needs cleanup, but is clearly notable.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> So, suddenly Wikipedia is all about "notability"...or maybe it's just a kind of high-tech, open-source popularity contest? Not that many people in the obscure-est reaches of Arkansas or Mt Everest know who Einstein was (or what he did) yet Einstein is in Wikipedia. There are thousands of entries in Wikipedia that ARE NOT of a "notable" nature. How unfair is it to discredit a simple entry on the basis of "notability" - this type of "notability-based" stamp-of-approvalocity is unfair and narrow-minded and should not be tolerated. It's interesting to see that four or five guys (always guys...) with little sense of the "real" world can make or break a Wikipedia entry. All the negative criticism of this entry is based on spurious INTERNET data. Has anyone called The Swedenborg Society or East Village Arts District for verification of these Benbenek entry claims? Nah, I doubt it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Otis Fodder (<a href="../../../o/t/i/User_talk%7EOtis_Fodder_15b5.html" title="User talk:Otis Fodder">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Otis_Fodder_6518.html" title="Special:Contributions/Otis Fodder">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Benbenek does not appear to live up to Wikipedia's standards of notability:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>His name gets just over 500 hits on Google, not a good start.</li>
<li>His personal website, <a href="http://www.houseplantpicturestudio.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.houseplantpicturestudio.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, has an Alexa ranking of over 1.6 million. Thus, the claim "<i>Over the past 10 years, Benbenek has posted literally hundreds of unique and artistic web pages, making Houseplant Picture Studio one of the most popular arts-oriented sites on the internet.</i>" a total falsehood.</li>
<li>"<i>In the early 1990s,Benbenek was a member of the rock band The Shatners</i>"; the band's website is hosted on Geocities, not good. Also, in the less than 1,000 google hits for this band, I cannot find a relevant and reliable source that mentions Benbenek's name. Moreover, the band's albums are on Archive.org, so they appear to be unsigned.</li>
<li>"<i>In 1996, Benbenek relocated to London, England where he was Assistant Secretary at The Swedenborg Society</i>" - the only sources I can find to verify this claim are from Wikipedia and the Answers.com and About.com mirrors of this page, and his Blogspot page.</li>
<li>"<i>Between 1997 and 2005 Benbenek collaborated with and produced five albums for the Woolwich punk band The Plumstead Common</i>" - this band gets even fewer hits than Benbenek's own name (164 according to Google), has not been signed, and so on, and so forth.</li>
<li>"<i>In 2005, Benbenek also co-produced the critically acclaimed album Haymarket Revival by The Magnesium Pie</i> " - this would be easier to believe if the review that was added to support this claim actually loaded, but the site appears to be down. Of course, it doesn't help that the band's name only gets 95 hits on Google, and no verifiable sources among them.</li>
<li>His solo album, "Third Toga Party from the Sun", gets only 179 google hits and no credible or reliable sources/reviews/mentions that I can find.</li>
</ul>

Does anyone (ie; freelance and unpaid Wikipedia editors) access knowledge bases beyond the internet around here? A few well-placed REAL WORLD phone calls might change a few minds concerning BENBENEK and his lengthy and very notable list of artistic and musical accomplishments.

<li>As the dissenter, isn't the onus at least partially on you to point everyone to some of these "knowledge bases beyond the internet"? Also, since a substantial portion of the subject's claims to notability are based on his Web site, using Web-based research techniques isn't entirely out of place. I tend to agree that WP is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">somewhat biased toward first-world Google-at-my-fingertips research methods</a>, but it's not like the subject in question works entirely outside of that realm, so it's reasonable to expect him to have left a mark there.

<p>The problem with Wikipedia and it's users is that it (and they) assume everything of importance is web-based and can be found through Google, etc. It isn't and never will be. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Otis Fodder (<a href="../../../o/t/i/User_talk%7EOtis_Fodder_15b5.html" title="User talk:Otis Fodder">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Otis_Fodder_6518.html" title="Special:Contributions/Otis Fodder">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The Internet is kind of like a meta-resource. If something is picked up by any medium (books, magazines, news reports, etc.), it will show up on the Internet. Almost every newspaper in the country is indexed by Google news, for instance. I'm trying to think of a possible exception to all of this, but I'm having trouble.

<p><b>COMMENT</b> - - I don't know what you mean by "meta-resource" - sounds like questionable and vague Wikipedia-speak to me. Just because some cultural thing is "on the internet" (or can be quantified via often shady and/or meaningless internet statistics) doesn't mean it's "notable" (whatever "notable" means!) - some of the least notable things in the world started and died quick deaths on the internet. Where EXACTLY is it written that Google statistics are absolute LAW? For example, how is a website's (or person's or thing's) popularity or "success" or "notability" calculated on the internet?

<li><b>reply to User:Otis Fodder.</b> At issue here is that any information we put into an article about Kurt Benbenek must be cross-referenced to a print or internet source outside of wikipedia, and also not written by Kurt Benbenek. It is real simple. If you can provide print or internet references, not written by Kurt Benbenek or anyone connected to him, that appear in any source that undergoes editorial process (newspapers(like New York Times), magazines(like Rolling Stone), edited websites(Like Salon.com), trade journals(like Variety), books, etc.) the article gets kept. Its that simple. This isn't a popularity contest, and it isn;t biased. Your calling it so does not make it so. Let me repeat what I said before. PROVIDE REFERENCES THAT TALK ABOUT KURT BENBENEK AND YOU KEEP THE ARTICLE. No one has done that yet. We don't want blogs, we don't want chat forums, we don't want phone numbers. We want references that someone has written, an editor has reviewed, and a publisher has published. Such requirements are for every article, and the standard is applied here and everywhere else without prejudice. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 05:04, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>COMMENT</b> - When you say "we" ("We don't want blogs, we don't want chat forums.."), do you mean that you're paid by Wikipedia and you speak for them and all involved with Wikipedia? If you're NOT being paid to debate and investigate articles (such as this BENBENEK article), why do you do it and why do you use the word "we"? Are you speaking for Wikipedia as a thing or as an internet corporate entity? Or is the "we" referring to only you? This will help me respond to your immediately-previous comment...because I worry when single individuals start throwing the "we" word around. Plus I'm a little new to Wikipedia as an open-source text phenomenon. Plus I'm too lazy to hunt down your "Wikipedia User Profile" and see if you're part of official Wikapedia management. I figure you're probably just eager to respond to just about anything any body throws on these ever-changing and well-formatted pages. My other guess is that you're a BOT, but Wikipedia BOTs are probably out on Thanksgiving weekend vacation.</p>

<dd>Otis Fodder, I think we can say that the authority of Wikipedia editors or the Internet isn't up for review here. All that's needed is for you or someone else to provide some real and accessible sources to back up the notability of Mr. Benbenek. That's all! And in response to your above question, a "meta-resource" is by definition a resource of resources. -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 06:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This one cannot, so it must go. If another minor league ball player meets this threshold, it stays. It has no bearing on what the article is ACTUALLY about, only if it can be populated with notable, verifiable facts that appear in other reliable sources, independant from either wikipedia or the subject itself. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 05:11, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> OK, so I'm going to eat crow on this.
<ul>
<li>1) it turns out my revisions (An + B where A &amp; B are <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coprime.html" title="Coprime">coprime</a>) introduced Dirichlet's theory well enough (a worthy article). That's why my math professor friend keyed on the name Dirichlet. But this expression includes the set of all prime numbers, and I find it hard to believe that every prime is a Dirichlet Prime. I reverted my work back to the original (minus a "see also" and someone else's reference improvement.</li>
<li>2) I did find a few references to "Dirichlet's primes" in common use (see the article's talk page), but nothing that equated the term with the function 3n-1. As this term is used in these links, it may have been simply a reference to his prime number theory.</li>
<li>3) Likewise, none of the references thoughtfully provided above equated the term with the function, either.</li>
<li>4) I also read through two of the leading, general number theory books (Ireland &amp; Rosen, and Niven, Zuckerman, &amp; Montgomery), and while they had a lot to say about Dirichlet, they never once used the term "Dirichlet prime" or described 3n+1 as a "Dirichlet Prime." Without a reference stating that primes as a function of 3n+1 are specifically named "Dirichlet Primes" - I can't support keeping this article. I apologize for jumping the gun on this one. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 04:44, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>reply</b>However, Dirichlet appears to have really worked on prime numbers, and his work really was novel. Some of the citations I foudn above refer to Dirichlet's Theorm or something similar. We could move this article to a new name, and then rewrite it from the sources I found to be accurate. I am not a mathematician, I cannot even pretend to be able to work this article out anymore than I have done in finding sources. However, I do believe that this is a rescuable article that a real mathematician could work out. Maybe just a move and rewrite?

<li><b>Comment</b>. Appreciate the draconity test! It would appear that I am, in fact, not dragon deep down inside or any other place for that matter (good to know). Yes, there are some people running around on the internet claiming that they dragons to varying degrees of manifestation but a solely internet based, argubaly delusional, group of people that find they have some metaphyscial relation to a mythical creature after a Mountain Dew and D&amp;D overload does not automatically provide for notability. Just for the sake of argument, even if they did that doesn't remedy the unsolvable issues of soapbox-ish-ness, vanity, neologism, sub-culture forking or original research and reliable sources, esp the last as it will never exist for this "community". This material is best left where it belongs, on personal webpages devoted to the art of "being a dragon". <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 05:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I pretty much agree with everything you're saying. I think you could come up with plenty of other examples of weird subculture stuff (and other things) where the same problems would apply, too. However, those are <i>content</i> problems, notability isn't affected by how difficult a subject is to source references or write objectively about, notability is about whether the subject affects or affected enough people substantially enough to be notable. In this case it's an open question and drumming up reliable statistics on the number of people involved is difficult, but when I pop a weird word like this in Google and out pops 10,000 hits, it occurs to me that <i>something</i> notable might be going on. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 07:59, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Keeping in mind you only raised the issue notability and that is the only issue that I'm responding too. Consider the fact that the word "Draconity" can refer to the simple "being of a dragon" which this article is not about and therefore any Ghit count is going to be horribly misrepresentative of what you are trying to establish. Again, for the sake of debate, even if this article were to prove some kind of notability (which it has not as it must in order to justify its existence) there is still a host of other rules it fails namely <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and more than a few aspects of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You bring up a valid point about the ghit count possibly being bloated by other articles regarding dragons that have nothing to do with the topic of the article.

<dd>I want to grant this article every benefit of the doubt I can. I recognize that there are people who identify as dragons, and as far as I am concerned, there's nothing wrong with that. Many consider this as a subset of <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_Fandom_e746.html" title="Furry Fandom">Furry Fandom</a> or <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>, and logically a well rounded encyclopedia that covers those topics should cover Draconity as well. The problem with the article is that there is not nearly enough written about this particular subset, apart from personally published pages, <a href="../../../u/s/e/USENET_f12a.html" title="USENET">USENET</a> and message boards. (Compare the references and external links on Furry Fandom and Otherkin to Draconity, and you'll see what I mean.) Therefore it cannot be included into Wikipedia at this time. You can always come back and recreate it when there is more written on it by independent sources.</dd>

<li>Keep, and clean up. While the article itself makes a few assertions that seem rather unplausible, I think that it could be cleaaned to the point that finding sources would not be completely out of the question.

However, it is definitely closely related to <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">otherkin</a>, and may not be notable enough to merit a seperate article. I think the only real solution is to merge to <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">otherkin</a> and give it a subsection in that article, which has been recently gutted due to complaints about the lack of reliable sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> - When I looked for google hits, all I could find were multiple message boards relating to the subject, and message boards are not sources for establishing notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The problem is notability and lack of sources, which is why I think it should be merged with the otherkin article with very little of its text - though they make up an important subset of the community, they aren't notable in and of themselves, but their existence is mentioned (but not gone into in any detail) by several publications cited by the <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">otherkin</a> article (that is to say, dragons are mentioned along with others, but only briefly). So. really, I guess its really not much of a merging at all so much as "mention them in otherkin briefly". <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 11:44, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - It's a fair point, but it would probably be better to mention this on the otherkin talk page instead of here, especially seeing as how the emerging consensus seems to be that there is very little, if anything, in this article that is worth salvaging and moving across to the other article. Also, a good point made earlier in this debate was to have Draconity redirect to otherkin as well. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 11:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge to <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a></b>, with caveats from discussion in previous thread. I.e., I agree with Titanium Dragon. I feel having a WP article on draconity has been valuable, I've contributed to it when I could, and I've been meaning to add better sources for a while. But many good points have been made on this page. I'd love to argue the article needs cleanup, not removal, but I just don't see enough verifiable sources right now for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. The best solution is to fold this back into <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>, which does at least pass that threshold, and then bring Draconity back if it ever starts getting attention on its own merits. <a href="../../../b/a/x/User%7EBaxil_3188.html" title="User:Baxil">Baxil</a> 00:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Darn. I thought this would be an obvious decision, but a bit of research changes my mind. The article as it stands is too much like original research, so I'm going with <b>Delete</b> for the moment. However, if the article returns with better references I'll be inclined to vote the other way: the phenomenon is real and though I've not met anyone who believes he's a dragon I have met some <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>, and believe that some of them are sincere. ( They may be wrong or loopy, but that doesn't stop them being sincere, and having a state of mind that should be covered here. ) <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The core problem is that the neologism Draconity is not, as far as I can find, a recognized term for a demographic by any creditable academic or journalistic sources as this article asserts.

<p>This was prodded as "Book synopsis, no encyclopaedic content, little context". A user placed a {{hangon}} tag on the article. I take that to mean the user doesn't want the article deleted but didn't know that they were supposed to take off the prod to contest it. In any rate, I've brought it here as a contested prod. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 01:50, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My guess is that while we call these things "votes," they're not really in a strict sense of the word. A "!" in the computer world is often used as a symbol for "not"...so "!vote" is a way of referring to this as a vote without really calling it a vote. -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 01:55, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is it really surprising that a list of 50 well-known people (notable enough to have wiki pages) is linked from about 50 wiki pages? And even if it were 10K pages, WP isn't just a self-referential asylum. The article itself really needs an explicit explanation of the selection and why it's notable, not just a listing with some un-explained refs. If it's cast as a list of people selected by peers, it might be notable enough and distanced enough from "some TV show" to survive.<a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 02:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I remembered a docudrama about the channel islands and WW2 on PBS - I'm not sure if this guy was featured in it but I was curious enough to do a search on LexisNexis (probably not the best source for old UK news). Anyway, I came up with 15 hits, including a 1240 word profile in The Guardian (2004) and a 714 word profile in the Daily Mail (1999) as well as about a dozen other much briefer articles. I can send copies to someone working on the article. This is an old and obscure story but not a non-notable one. Besides, the article is pretty good and I really can't see the harm in keeping it. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 06:24, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also, WP:DP explicitly states that an article being a stub is not, in and of itself, reason for deletion. Finally, at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> there is a proposed policy in development--I would suggest we hold off on this (and any other school articles anyone may wish to nominate) until that policy is finalized and adopted, unless there is a policy specifically requiring the deletion of the given school--otherwise, we risk removing content that may turn out to be explicitly acceptable according to a broader community consensus. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 15:24, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It certainly is not massive; don't be disingenuous. Moreover you are conflating keep with no consensus, which is the principal outcome of many of those debates. It was massively agreed that the bitter disputes and name calling was getting out of hand in school AfDs (or VfDs as they were). But as you know, the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> compromise is not much liked by anyone - neither those who feel schools are notable sui generis, nor those (like myself) who feel they are simply not notable in and of themselves. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 19:09, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I always love it when people say we should keep a school because there is a consensus to keep them (which is both clearly incorrect and circular reasoning), and because being a stub is no reason to delete (which is a strawman, since none of the supporters of deletion did so because it is a stub, but because the school is non notable). If this was an article about a band instead of a school, it would be speedyable...

<li><b>Delete</b> Consensus does not exist, as the previous posters point out; rather, many afd's on schools result in 'no consensus' which is an automatic keep. Many of us do not understand why schools are supposedly inherently notable while hospitals, for instance, are not. Furthermore, while I'll admit precedent seems to indicate that <i>high schools</i> should typically be kept (no matter how much I disagree), there does not seem to be a similar precedent for middle schools or elementary schools; indeed, if my memory serves me, most middle and elementary schools do get deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:35, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The site is not open to public editing, so the reliability is sound.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Alexa rank has been falling heavily since September when the site changed to a wiki as all the pages changed entirely and thus the page rankings went down dramatically, this will pick back up in time. Also, as the site is a MediaWiki it promotes the use of the technology. If the page is to go, I suggest keeping the template as it provides a neat way of doing the external links - there are plenty of other sites with external links with far more dubious content, including videos which that site doesn't do, removing the template will just result in the links being entered manually which is less tidy. Any copyright issues on the site could easily be covered as easily as the show logos are handled on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbling_64f2.html" title="User:Orbling">Orbling</a> 12:06, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm trying to figure out what needs to change in order to avoid deletion. Can anyone help me here? Or perhaps suggest a page to merge it into? I feel the band is worthy of an entry here and am a little concerned that the article was deemed "blatant advertising" as it was not meant as such, nor am I in any place to do any advertising for the band. I am not a band member or anything like that, just someone who likes their shows. Perhaps I should remove the CD track listing?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/b/k/User%7EHBKFan75_a44a.html" title="User:HBKFan75">HBKFan75</a> (<a href="../../../h/b/k/User_talk%7EHBKFan75_f703.html" title="User talk:HBKFan75">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HBKFan75_ce58.html" title="Special:Contributions/HBKFan75">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The suggestion above was implemented. Thanks. Any other ideas? I guess there is supposedly some sort of objective standard by which one can judge notoriety, but certainly there's something subjective in it. What makes Epcot band Off Kilter worthy of a page, but not Mulch, Sweat, and Shears? They've been around longer, I guess. But for the record, I'd say "extremely non notable" is an odd description of a band whose shows a minimum of 10,000 people a day at least catch a portion of. They do play in the world's fourth most visited them park, after all. And a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22mulch+sweat+and+shears%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22mulch+sweat+and+shears%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Google Search</a> turns up plenty of results from people who obviously consider them worth mentioning. Anyway, I suppose that's the case I have to make for them having an entry here. Looks like a losing battle, but I ought to make it in full nonetheless.--<a href="../../../h/b/k/User%7EHBKFan75_a44a.html" title="User:HBKFan75">HBKFan75</a> 05:26, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> it's not just a numbers game. If Disney were to replace, one or all of the band would anyone (apart from the band) care? They need to be notable in their own right, otherwise they are just the band at the Disney resort. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 09:38, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as nn group, per Ryulong. The Google hits don't impress me, there's little there but evidence someone has been very busy submitting lyrics to numerous song lyric sites and pr audition notices to various music sites. In addition, neither band name gets any hits on Factiva. Also, the website listed in the article doesn't work for me. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 06:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not going to make a statement for delete or keep since I was involved in the speedy delete edit war on this article originally. I would like to say that if the first two sections of this article were the only ones that existed I probably wouldn't have a problem with this article staying on Wikipedia. The problem is that the article right now is really two articles. One about the Disney band, which probably has enough notability to stay, and a second article about a different band with the same members that does not have enough notability to stay. Lose the parts about the second band, add some references (if they exist), and the article would probably measure up.--<a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHatch68_1537.html" title="User:Hatch68">Hatch68</a> 07:22, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - My quick take after some time in some library databases is this is for real. See Patrick J. Carnes article titled "The Case for Sexual Anorexia: An Interim Report on 144 Patients with Sexual Disorders" in the December 1998 issue of the journal <i>Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity</i>. The abstract says the term "sexual anorexia" is used to describe "sexual aversion disorder." Another source in the June 2003 issue of the same journal is by Laura Nelson and titled "Sexual Addiction versus Sexual Anorexia and the Church's Impact." According to the Academic Search Premier database, this is a peer reviewed journal published in the UK. Please let me know if more information is required. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 02:05, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> While it's a cool building, I agree it's not particularly notable beyond RPI. I was surprised to see even a page on it.

<dd><b>Comment</b> These buildings, both today and in the past, are host to symposiums and other academic meetings which are attended by people from around the world. I would agree that an entry on a dormitory is worthless in the context of WP, but these buildings are of interest to those outside the school's community.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> this is a vanity page made by the owner/former owner of the company. It violates the WP:COMPANY with flying colours ("1.The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself."). Its products also fail the following requirement: "1. The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." The subject does not package its products, so they are only available locally (two locations near each other). Having a page for this company is no different than having a page for a local bakery. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 17:51, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, this place didn't win "national brewery of the year" either. I accept your point about the original author. The fact that it is basically local and does not distribute its products outside of a very limited geographic area would, if it were truly notable, not diminish it. However, since this place is not notable, it just makes it even worse. And my personal involvement: I am trying to improve the beer articles here. This, in my view, detracts from them by telling users: hey, we don't really have any standards here -- we'll write up anybody, whether they have contributed something meaningful to beer or brewing or not. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 18:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

"Being noticed" for good <i>or for ill</i> is another way. Google results are plentiful, the local profile seems high.

<dd>OK, I did a Google on "Triumph Brewery". I came up with 774 hits. In the first three pages, most were announcements by bands that they are playing there or announcements by local groups that they are having a meeting there. I also found this "unbiased" review of it by a civilian: <a href="http://www.chowhound.com/topics/337750" class="external free" title="http://www.chowhound.com/topics/337750" rel="nofollow">http://www.chowhound.com/topics/337750</a>. For comparison, I would recommend that you do the same thing for "Gordon Biersch", another brewpub. I came up with 299,000 hits. So, 775 vs. 299,000 -- doesn't that say something? You might also want to look at <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Biersch_d732.html" title="Gordon Biersch">Gordon_Biersch</a> here. Please notice that in "References" they have four <b>articles</b> and zero reviews. That is what I (and Wikipedia?) mean by "multiple non-trivial published works".</dd>

<dd>Well, I thought this process was to discuss whether the article was worth keeping, not how to improve it. As is probably pretty obvious, I am pretty new to Wikipedia (and pretty shocked at how bad many of the beer articles are!) and the article was clearly in violation of NPOV when I first read it. OK. Now I understand a little more. Now I know about the WG:COMPANY policy. As I said below, adding links to restaurant reviews of a restaurant does not in any way that I understand full-fill the requirement of "multiple non-trivial published works." The fact that there are three reviews in 11 years and that two of the three are less than positive in their opinion also speaks against the notability. Or is just the fact that a restaurant is reviewed enough to meet that requirement? I certainly hope not! <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 18:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An article is brought to AFD because an editor has a question about whether it fits. There is no requirement that the article be frozen forever -- in fact, an article being improved by its time on AFD is a very common consequence. In either case, by removal or improvement, Wikipedia benefits. Don't get overly concerned with process. As for "reviewed enough", yes, that is the requirement. We don't do it on the basis of whether the reviews were positive or negative. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:07, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you don't mind, I will answer you here. The award they "won" are from the Great American Beer Festival. If you look at their site (GABF), you will see that Anheuser-Busch, Coors, Miller, etc. win silver and gold medals almost every year -- far more, in fact, than Triumph brewpub. In only 2005, for example, Anheuser-Busch "won" three golds, one silver and one bronze. If you know beer, you know that these companies produce what is essentially industrial swill. OK, maybe others may think it is just "bad", but the point is how can they win so many medals? I have heard from multiple American beer lovers that it is because they "sponsor" the festival and/or the organisation and the medals are awarded to them as a quid pro quo. After "buying" these medals they proudly proclaim on their site that they have won "prestigous" awards: <a href="http://www.anheuser-busch.com/press_room/2005/A-B_Honored_GABF100305.html" class="external free" title="http://www.anheuser-busch.com/press_room/2005/A-B_Honored_GABF100305.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anheuser-busch.com/press_room/2005/A-B_Honored_GABF100305.html</a>.

And, it's not just them -- the awards mean income to quite a few companies and it just doesn't seem to be in anyone's interest to publish openly what I've written. But, you only have to look at the facts: an organisation founded to benefit craft brewers is now awarding more medals to Anheuser-Busch than to any of the craft brewers!

<dd>What I think you are all overlooking here is that this is a brewpub/restaurant. It is in the nature of restaurants that they will be reviewed by local media -- virtually without exception. So, showing that a particular restaurant has been reviewed is pretty meaningless -- getting bad reviews, OTOH, would be meaningful, but in a different way. What would show notability is that an <b>article</b> has been written about the restaurant -- that they have taken a new and/or different approach or that that they have done something that is perhaps in another way meaningful. There is still not a single article that provides this brewpub with "notability" -- a requirement at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 18:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>There are two subjects to the article, an Australian TV show and a direct-to-video documentary from the band <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estradasphere.html" title="Estradasphere">Estradasphere</a>. The television show appears to be a hoax. I can find no reference to it on Google or IMDB and somehow I think one or the other of those would mention a five-season series that starred Catherine Zeta Jones and Michelle Pfeiffer. The documentary does not appear to be particularly notable and its mention on the band's own page is sufficient without a separate article (assuming the band is itself notable, which isn't immediately clear from its article). <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 07:56, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The TV show is most decidedly a hoax (Zeta Jones would have been 15 at the time it began, additionally there's a probably anachronistic reference to an "emo" character in what would have been 1985, the article also seems to contradict itself regarding the filming of the show and even the question of whether the characters are real people). At best, the information on the band's documentary could be merged to the main article, but even then I wonder if that's entirely worth it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:04, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Remove TV show section; keep the part about the documentary</b>. Note that the section about the documentary has been around for over a year while the hoax TV series was added just a few weeks ago. The original article most certainly is real and concerns a band that has an article here on Wikipedia, so I see no reason to delete it. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 03:38, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nobody's doubting the existence of the original article subject. The question is one of the usefulness of this specific article by itself, bearing in mind that it basically just explains that the DVD exists. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:08, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's not a wonderful article, but I don't see it as needing deletion. I could be wrong, but it does look to me like most other contributors to this discussion haven't taken this section into account (note that the reasons given seem to apply only to the hoax section). <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 05:32, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may well be right about the other contributors (hoaxes tend to bring out the best in people, and an article like this is kind of a weird case). Basically, as far as the DVD part of the article goes, I'm not totally convinced that existence alone confers notability. Of course, the fairest possible option would be to delete the hoax and then talk about the DVD later, although that could take a while. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:29, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be fairer, I think, if we handled the discussions of the two parts of this article separately. Mind you, I won't feel bad if both parts are deleted. I just think the earlier part is worth keeping (albeit barely). <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 05:39, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I quite agree, for what its worth. The only way I can think of would be to delete the hoaxiness of the TV show, close the AfD accordingly and then re-open it if people felt that the DVD was perhaps worth another go-round. It mightn't be strictly according to process, since we'd technically be having another AfD just after the first one closed, but it's probably the kind of thing which would be allowed under the circumstances. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:48, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just telling us would not be good enough, since it has to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. I haven't yet dug through the Fellowship's website beyond seeing no mention of the icons on the front page. They should post some notice of endorsement on their website and probably should distribute a press release so other publications (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, not just blogs and forums) will provide third-party independent coverage. That would lead us to choose between "keep" and "merge" based on editors' judgment of the topic's significance, rather than having us forced by policy to "delete as unverifiable". When a source is available, it should be added to the article (or to the content merged into <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenDocument_02ec.html" title="OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a>) so future editors won't delete the information. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:16, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete all</b>. Although on individual opinions it was 3 to 6, two of the "keep" opinions were not well argued, as were two "deletes", and one "keep" was "very weak", so it's more like 0.5 to 4. I don't believe a relist would have brought many new arguments, but the generally high level of discussion in this AfD is commendable. The articles can be recreated, of course, if these people do get to play at a more professional level or become otherwise more notable. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 13:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Contrary to the beliefs of the article creator, these footballers do <i>not play in a fully professional league</i>. In other words they don't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines for sportspeople. I would clean up the articles of the team players who actually have played professionally, and whose professional league appearances are <i>verifiable</i> - alas I could see only one notable player in their squad. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 09:43, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Are Skeid really an amateur team? They played in the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeccoligaen.html" title="Adeccoligaen">Norweigian First Division</a> (the second level) until 2005, and will do so again from 2007. I find it rather hard to believe that they are not a professional club; at the very least, some of their best players could be contracted a professional basis. The <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeid_Fotball_5b4e.html" title="Skeid Fotball">Skeid</a> article does not make this clear. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 10:01, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The guidelines state, though, that a player must play in a fully professional league. So even if some of these players have pro contracts with Skeid, they don't meet the guidelines unless the league Skeid are in is confirmed as fully professional. It's the same situation as Conference players in the UK - some are full-time professionals but the league is not <i>fully</i> professional so they don't qualify unless they have experience at a higher level..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:14, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Until I can make any sort of decision I need to know which leagues in Norway are professional. I am assuming the <i>Adeccoligaen</i> (First Division) is fully professional - can anyone confirm this?

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> at the moment, since it seems that the Adeccoligaen is professional.

<li><s><b>Weakest of all possible keeps</b> until we have clarified the notability guidelines for footballers. The term "fully professional" is flawed IMHO, as for example the Swedish <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allsvenskan.html" title="Allsvenskan">top league</a> team <a href="../../../g/e/f/Gefle_IF_89d7.html" title="Gefle IF">Gefle IF</a> has a few semi-professional players, which would make the top league not "fully professional" and thus deem a lot of players in other teams not notable when in reality they are very notable indeed. Generally, I am of the opinion that most players who has played regularly for at least a season in any of the top two divisions of countries the size (in terms of football interrest and level of football played) of Norway or larger have established notability. Weak keep only as the articles in question are sub-stubs at most. – <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a> <small>• <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a> •</small> 15:40, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li><b>Comment</b> Even without getting into a debate about the pros and cons of conferring inherent notability on the thousands of semi-pro footballers in the UK alone, the simple fact is that the guidelines clearly state that a player must play in a fully professional league to be notable, and therefore non-professional players by definition cannot be considered to pass the guidelines! <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 00:26, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom. I would much prefer an unambiguous report that these players meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> rather than a string of "um, maybe" reports.

<li><s><b>Keep all</b></s> (or redirect to <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeid_Fotball_5b4e.html" title="Skeid Fotball">Skeid Fotball</a>); <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> actually says:
<blockquote>
<p>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable</p>
</blockquote>
Since the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeccoligaen.html" title="Adeccoligaen">Adeccoligaen</a> is the second highest league in Norwegian footy, which seems to me to fall within the sense of "the highest level", I would think that these would merit inclusion. Semi-professional footballers, just like professional ones, may or may not be notable depending on the circumstances. Norway, India, Iceland, &amp;c, &amp;c, rely mainly on semi-pro or amateur players for even senior leagues and sometimes for their international teams. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 15:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two mistakes here. The point about "highest level" pertains to non-league sports. For league sports which are mainly professional, such as football, we have the guideline "fully professional". These players fail this guideline. And why group Norway with C-class leagues like Iceland and D-class leagues like India? The Premier League and national team in Norway are composed of fully professional players, right there is more than enough for Wikipedia to cover with the current guidelines. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 21:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>The author of this proposed calendar reform, Dr. Irv Bomberg, requested that this article be deleted as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original, unpublished, research</a> in Talk:Modern Lunisolar Calendar, where discussion from the original <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion</a> resides. The prod was contested by the anonymous editor <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.200.190.7_4694.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.200.190.7">172.200.190.7</a> who did not give a reason for his objection. When he removed the prod, he made minor edits, citing another discussion in the same e-mail list where Bomberg's original proposal first appeared (also cited in the article). This article still constitutes original research as discussed in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipeda is not</a>. Citing an e-mail list does not satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia's verifiability policy</a>.

<li>I removed the speedy tag because this <s>is at least semi-scholarly crap, instead of outright crap. It also</s> falls short of the hurdle set forward in the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a> for patent nonsense, in that there is salvageable text in the article, and it presents a cohesive argument—and specifically, "[CSD G1] does not include...implausible theories." Yes, this is the least useful of the articles in the sequence of them on the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symmetry454.html" title="Symmetry454">Symmetry454</a> calendar and related proposals, yes, but I still think it deserves a full discussion. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 16:38, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> OK. I won't get into a discussion on how to value exactly how crappy an argument/discussion is so I'll accept that.

<li><b>Comment</b>. On the one hand, I think an argument can be made under <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> to go ahead and speedily delete the article. On the other, I see the speedy delete criteria of G1 as being intended for articles where no content can be salvaged at all from them: in other words, if it reads like the string of nonsense in a spam email, it's G1 and speedyable. If you can at least make out what the author is saying, then it goes the Prod/AfD route. So, using G1 here to speedy the article would be bad precedent. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 17:09, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am posting this for deletion at the request of <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">User:DGG</a>.

<li><b>Move</b> to <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_journal.html" title="Electronic journal">Electronic journal</a>.

<p>I apologize if I appeared to act in a proprietary manner. I was somewhat surprised that the article was converted into a redirect without any preliminary discussion on the article's talk page. I asked <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> to instead propose it for deletion in the customary manner if he thought that was appropriate so it could be discussed properly, and he quite correctly did so. Would anyone care to comment on the protocol &amp; courtesy for replacing an article with a redirect?</p>
<p>And it was not I who was involved in the 2004 discussion--I had not yet started at WP</p>
<p>There are also a number of ways to remind people who have neglected to insert sources that they should do so, including a comment on the article talk page, which is there for such purposes.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a recommendation at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_Deletion_f620.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion</a> that an article should be improved, or improvements suggested as an alternative. A simple Google search would show that the term is standard in a library context: the first page alone has 4 relevant hits, so it is clearly not a personal neologism. .</p>
<p>As an example of what can &amp; should have been done, I have edited the article to put in a few of the many references at the bottom. Not having an article I've been interested in go through this process before, I am unsure about the etiquette and have therefor put them in a separate section at the end, not inline, I appreciate the effort made to induce me to do this, but going directly to AfD seems somewhat drastic.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 23:58, 26 November 2006 (UTC) I have now done so. There are 3 refs, 2 general external links, and 7 links to notable specific services, many of which already have WP articles. I think that shows notability, specific meaning, and sources.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I apologise for being a bit fast in sending it to AfD instead of asking you to justify your stance, but AfD is only a debate. Please refer to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> for editing protocol. After looking at the references supplied as well as of my own searches, I'm still unsure about the specificity of the term "electronic article" because of its generic use. Although you have clearly demonstrated that it has been employed to refer to a library for scientific articles <a href="http://www.arl.org/scomm/near.html" class="external text" title="http://www.arl.org/scomm/near.html" rel="nofollow">NEAR</a><a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/alpsp/lp/2001/00000014/00000003/art00010" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/alpsp/lp/2001/00000014/00000003/art00010" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, but AFAICT it also covers other non-scientific journals. Less specific uses I have found on searches include <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/bears/homepage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/bears/homepage.html" rel="nofollow">BEARS</a> at Brown University uses it to refer to catalogue of articles on Moral and political philosophy, whereas the Columbia Law review <a href="http://www.columbialawreview.org/information/onlinearticlesubmit.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.columbialawreview.org/information/onlinearticlesubmit.cfm" rel="nofollow">invites</a> contributors to submit their articles electronically for publication, and other prominent hits refer to the <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=33" class="external text" title="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=33" rel="nofollow">electronic article surveillance</a> - protection afforded to shops agains shoplifting. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:38, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to clarify, the use for <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_article_surveillance.html" title="Electronic article surveillance">Electronic article surveillance</a> is a different use in a different field, since 2005 a separate WP article &amp; I'm adding a disambig. note on both pages. -- I never knew about it till it came up on Google. As for <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_article.html" title="Electronic article">Electronic article</a>, is does indeed refer to articles in any and all subjects, which is why it doesn't fit well under <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_paper.html" title="Scientific paper">scientific paper</a>.

<li><b>Retain</b>. Even though this is actually a redundant term because the essence of Conservatism includes a belief in strict adherence to the U.S. Constitution, it should be retained. In fact, this article should be expanded because the aspect of "Constitutionalism" in Conservatism is often taken for granted. Since the underlying principles upon which Conservatives base their belief system is the U.S. Constitution, and the current article on "Conservatism" lacks a detailed analysis of this aspect of Conservatism, this article should not only be retained but also should be expanded upon. Either that, or someone needs to undertake the task of adding a "Constitutional" description to the article on "Conservatism". Anyone who has read the "Federalist Papers" and related documents will easily find that the Founding Fathers were in fact, pro-States Rights, pro-religious freedom, pro-free market, pro-private property ownership, pro-Second Amendment to the extent that this included private ownership of weapons deemed basic to a people's-based militia, and the argument can be made that the Founding Fathers left matters like "abortion" as a matter for the States to determine legality. Since true "Constitutional Conservativism" is not something that is supported by true liberalism, it is a belief system that needs better clarification either as a stand-alone article or incorporated strongly into the article of "Conservatism". Even a small yet well-defined political party in the U.S. exists that is almost a perfect adherent to "Constitutional Conservatism". Check out: <a href="http://www.constitutionparty.com/party_platform.php" class="external free" title="http://www.constitutionparty.com/party_platform.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.constitutionparty.com/party_platform.php</a>. The "U.S. Constitution Party" prides itself on following the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. So, in summary, this topic, whether it remains a separate article or is incorporated into Conservatism must be included as a basis for Conservatism. <a href="../../../j/t/p/User%7EJtpaladin_87ec.html" title="User:Jtpaladin">Jtpaladin</a> 18:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please remember that our articles must be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">written from a neutral point of view</a>, and not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. This means we can't just have an article say, "this is constitutional conservativism because that's how one should read the Federalist Papers". Rather, an article on this topic would be along the lines of "Constitutional Conservatism in the U.S. is understood by a) this notable organisation to mean its political position, which is XYZ, as reported by this <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, b) a term used by notable theorist J. Doe to mean ABC, as reported by this <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, etc." Do you see what I mean?

<dd>Jtpaladin and Neofreak, as noted above, I recognize that the term is used in political discourse, and the term is a broad generalization about Conservatives' views of the Constitution. Well, being so, there's not enough to say about that to maintain an article. The entire article, if properly sourced, would contain one sentence only: "Conservatives in America tend to assert a belief in textualism, as a basis for their beliefs." Not exactly a lot of content. Also, as I also said, the term is ambiguous because there are people who agree the Constitution should be upheld literally as the text plainly says, yet share liberal views. And so, the article on <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textualism.html" title="Textualism">textualism</a> is sufficient, covering the topic in a politically neutral manner. In fact, in hindsight, I think it would've been better to simply edit the article and send a re-direct to <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textualism.html" title="Textualism">textualism</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocracy_2cef.html" title="User:Robocracy">Robocracy</a> 21:25, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

How, then, could we justify deleting this? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:13, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The famous <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">Pokemon</a> fallacy. X stays so Y gets to stay too. It is that exact fallacy that makes people say Wikipedia is an indiscriminate endless list of unreviewed original research. Sorry but we have to draw the line somewhere.

<ul>
<li>Ridiculous. I point out that this is <i>more notable</i> than something that is a FA and you call it a "fallacy". Yes, we have to draw the line somewhere, I suppose: we could draw the line at, let's say, the many, many performances at MTV awards shows that nobody cared much about. We certainly should not draw the line at something that got this level of attention. Dismissing it as "a kiss on TV" misrepresents the argument; the argument is not based on what it was, but on what people made of it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:37, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> leaning toward delete. For a subject that got so much attention, the article cites just one source, a celebrity interview of the other person invoved which mentions the incident only in passing with no real journalistic coverage. Already mentioned sufficiently in the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a> article; if it weren't, I would suggest merge. As Demiurge mentioned, the incident didn't have any lasting effects such as FCC rule changes or a wave of lesbian on-air kissing. Everyking, if people made so much of the incident, you should be able to add several reliable-source citations. Prove it rather than asserting it. Frankly, the media that covered it would all fail my interpretation of "non-trivial", although I'm sure there was some that met WP consensus standards. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:05, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It seems silly to have to prove this, but I did a Google news search you can look at <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=madonna+britney+kiss+mtv+awards&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=madonna+britney+kiss+mtv+awards&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<ul>
<li>If a former administrator could figure out how to talk decently to people rather than resort to words like silly and ridiculous when defending your arguments I'll tell you why I think this article should be deleted. It had no lasting impact. It created some attention especially around people who think two girls kissing was a national sensation. The Aniston/Pitt breakup created headlines as well. Do you want an article full of speculation and redundant details on that too? This is an encyclopedia, not a teen magazine or a gossip magazine. It is this kind of article that makes people ridicule Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 07:37, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are trying to extend the definition of notability to mean things of long-term importance. It's a big leap. According to this definition, apparently, <i>no amount</i> of press coverage, no amount of public attention is sufficient to warrant keeping it, because it did not have what you consider a long-term impact. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Excellent! You just found the core of the problem. How do you define notable news? Is it the murder case with the missing child that is all over the news for about a week until the body is found and the press moves on to other stories because news like this sadly happens so often? Or is it the "accident" involving two of music's biggest stars and one of if not the biggest tv event of the year? Not as easy a call as it may sound like. That is why I think the criteria should be long term effects. Whatever stories don't have long term effects should be handled inside the relevant biography articles just like this one already is. If someone had suggested that this should not even be mentioned in the Madonna article I would have protested. We need some kind of criteria here. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 13:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh and about the article you mentioned above have you read this <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Stephen_Colbert_at_the_2006_White_House_Correspondents.27_Association_Dinner" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard#Stephen_Colbert_at_the_2006_White_House_Correspondents.27_Association_Dinner</a>?

Another question is, under which name? <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> clearly supports <a href="../../../o/l/p/User%7EOLP1999_8f98.html" title="User:OLP1999">user:OLP1999</a>’s argument for "Christmas season": "Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize".

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia does not imply that it is a politically correct organisation, nor should it. If the term "Winter holiday season" is actually used by people to mean the set of western christian holidays, then it is fine.

<li>That was during a few edit wars concerning the text "In the Northern Hemisphere" versus "In the United States". Since this PC terminology doesn't exist in any other area of the Northern Hemisphere other than the United States (including my country, Canada), I found it offensive to suggest this term is in usage in any other country. Yes, I'm biased against the usage of this term, but clearly <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> suggest this article should be merged (it already has prominent display in the article "<a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday.html" title="Holiday">Holiday</a>")— <a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_Lady_Peace_c943.html" title="Our Lady Peace">OL</a><a href="../../../r/a/i/Raine_Maida_5d24.html" title="Raine Maida">P</a> <i><a href="../../../o/l/p/User_talk%7EOLP1999_3f52.html" title="User talk:OLP1999">1999</a></i> 17:35, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The concept of a Winter Holiday season is certainly valid, even if not a widely used phrase, people do recognize and understand it. I don't think anybody here is arguing this doesn't exist. If they are then enjoy <a href="http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/tfrs/v3i2.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/tfrs/v3i2.pdf" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/dailyautoinsider/12027/lots-of-stranded-vehicles-expected-this-winter-holiday-season.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.caranddriver.com/dailyautoinsider/12027/lots-of-stranded-vehicles-expected-this-winter-holiday-season.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> and <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/10/enjoying-the-winter-holiday-season/" class="external autonumber" title="http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/10/enjoying-the-winter-holiday-season/" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. So far as it goes, I don't see that we should merge Christmas season and Winter holiday season. The Christmas aspects are a seperate part, and if anything, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> should be merged to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>. However, there are several aspects of the Holiday season that should be broken off from an article about Christmas. I might be convinced that <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday_season.html" title="Holiday season">holiday season</a> (currently a redirect to WHS) should be the name of the main article, if only because there should be content on this time of year in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is summer. However, I am deeply troubled by the arguments that this is "PC Garbage". That is uncivil, and borderline ad homineum, so it should be avoided. Since I don't want to endorse taking actions for such reasons, I'm going to oppose deletion and say keep. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:27, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Note</b>: Please don't dismiss an option because of the way it has been put forward. Before this (second) request was written, the article already was tagged with a merge request, added by someone else (me), for quite different reasons. As far as I'm concerned, while I appreciate your three helpful exhibits, I'm not convinced that they describe something different from what has been traditionally called Christmas season. Please therefore consider allowing a merge.

<li>No, I'm afraid I can't support a deletion with even the suspicion of misconduct on it. Being above reproach is highly important, especially here, where in my experience, there is a great deal of contention. For me to even consider this article, it would have to be propsed by someone who is neutral on the subject. In any case, I think a merge to Christmas season would actually be disadvantegous. If anything, I would say <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> should be merged to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> instead, and this article kept to reflect that the holidays at this particular time of year are about more than just Christmas. But I would the Christmas season has enough potential for content as a seperate subject in itself that I don't feel it needs to be merged or deleted. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:33, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a case of one editor's personal bias disagreeing with what a large swathe of sources actually say. Wikipedia should go with what the sources say, not with what <a href="../../../o/l/p/User%7EOLP1999_8f98.html" title="User:OLP1999">OLP1999</a> (repeatedly) wants Wikipedia not to mention solely because of xyr personal bias. As for merger: As <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday.html#The_American_winter_holiday_season" title="Holiday">Holiday#The_American_winter_holiday_season</a> (which is mis-named, note) clearly states, this is a main article and that is a <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> summary. This should not be merged there. Nor should it be merged to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a>, which is part of the Christian <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgical_year.html" title="Liturgical year">liturgical year</a>. The Winter holiday season is, as the sources clearly say, <i>not</i> specific to Christianity, and <i>not a liturgical concept</i> at all. As per the last discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Winter_holiday_season_d036.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winter holiday season">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winter holiday season</a>, all of the citations given above, and the references section of the article, <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:11, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, thank you, that was an eye opener! We're actually talking about two entirely different things here.
<ul>
<li>The <b>Holiday (shopping) season</b> from around Thanksgiving to December 24</li>
<li><b>Christmastide</b>, which runs from December 25 to January 6.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>We should keep these apart, and I am therefore changing my vote to <b>keep</b>. As a consequence, I also think we should:
<ul>
<li>change "Christmas season" into a disambiguation between the two meanings (and <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advent.html" title="Advent">Advent</a>),</li>
<li>make "Christmastide" the title for the page on the liturgical meaning, and</li>
<li>move the first half of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_holiday_season.html" title="Winter holiday season">Winter holiday season</a>. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> <a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastianHelm_c25a.html" title="User talk:SebastianHelm">(talk)</a> 21:43, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree with the assertion that Americans don't actually use this term. I live and work in an incredibly religiously diverse area and use the term all the time (in addition to being inundated by it in the media).I also use "holiday season" and "the winter holidays". It's not PC, it is an accurate description of reality (ie. many people celebrating holidays during the winter are not, in fact, celebrating Christmas.) I concur that a better name for the article might be "holiday season". But if anything <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> should either be merged into <i>this</i> article, or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>. To merge an article with information about <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah.html" title="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> and <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwanzaa.html" title="Kwanzaa">Kwanzaa</a> <i>into</i> one called <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> would be misleading &amp; unencyclopedic, regardless of one's personal opinions. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 14:28, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with the above statements. If anything, all high schools should be given an article, especially high schools with data and well-sourced information. Nominations of deletions should occur, if at all, first with high school articles with poorly written prose and/or no citations before getting to ones like these.

<li><b>Another comment</b>: note that at the time of deletion, the article had only one citation, which did not give any notability / importance: good sources were only added after the AfD started.

<li>Sorry, but an award given to around 5% of all schools in the state <i>every year</i>, and awarded for 4 years, meaning some 20% of schools have the award at any one time, is hardly an indicator of excellence. The two news articles cites don't appear to be non-trivial, since they seem to be short-ish, and of primarily local interest. Notable alumni are pretty worthless too, since the school had no part in the process that got them their own articles. There's still nothing in this article which sets it apart from any other similar school. The references are all trivial mentions and purely local interest stories. Doesn't quite pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> still. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 08:52, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Going by the discussion on the Colbert character talk page, people seem to think that Colbert's character merits an article as he's the main character on a tv show (rather than say, a collection of recurring gags bound up in a persona). I've no opinion on this, but I guess its safe to say that Kazakhstan (fictional) can't use this argument <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:29, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That Colbert article would seem to be more the equivalent of the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borat.html" title="Borat">Borat</a> article — it's an article about the fictional character split off from the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Borat%7E_Cultural_Learnings_of_America_for_Make_Benefit_Glorious_Nation_of_Kazakhstan_f8b8.html" title="Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan">film</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/_/Da_Ali_G_Show_5726.html" title="Da Ali G Show">TV show</a> it appears in, complicated slightly by the fact that the fictional character has the same identity as the actor who plays him. The equivalent of the article in this AfD would be creating an article about "Bears (fictional)" debunking the Colbert character's fear of bears and arguing that they're just cuddly nice creatures. Still, it's kind of borderline fancruft. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 10:19, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Indiana Gregg was an Indie artist on our site Artistopia.com for a good while and recently asked for her indie profile to be closed as it conflicted with her management, pending new material to be released. She has moved far beyond "undiscovered talent". Thus for us, it moves her into Pro account status. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtistopia_22eb.html" title="User:Artistopia">Yippee</a> 20:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are no reliable sources--in fact, half the article is copied verbatim <i>from</i> a message board post and the rest of it looks like it might be copied from Myspace or somewhere. In fact, with the links scattered throughout it looks like an advertisement. The article was started more than a year by an IP stating "Does anyone know anything about Indiana Gregg" and now it has reached its ultimate evolution of a copy-paste unwikified vanity piece. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 19:57, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Looks almost like spam for this website. I was tempted to delete it for being a non-notable website, but the assertion that it was featured on a TV show could provide some notability for it.

<li><b>Keep</b> This Article is in it's early stages. I'm still working on creating more content which will link it to it's sources better aswell as adding a more in-depth history section among controversy, and the social experiment that has been based off this website. This is only a day old and i would very much appreciate a chance to prove this can be a suitable article. I still have to change the context to be in the Third Person. The article will also be mentioning the use of BT for therapeutic uses (but also mention that this is a claim by users, which has *yet* to undergo scientific review). BT may be the base for a Standford social experiment on the effects of expressive writing. I think this wiki is worth while and will expand and prove itself. Thank You.

<li><b>Delete</b> UE Main Library and <b>Weak Keep</b> <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_the_East_Library_e7d5.html" title="University of the East Library">University of the East Library</a>. Given the size of the main article, a merge doesn't seem like a good option, and I'm willing to buy that the library is important enough to the university to deserve some coverage (although I do think that the library article is rather bloated, as it stands, and it needs independent sources to fully establish notability). However, the nominator is correct in that there's no reason for two articles to exist here, especially since UE Main is basically cut and pasted from the other article. I would recommend a severe edit of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_the_East_Library_e7d5.html" title="University of the East Library">University of the East Library</a> article, but that falls under cleanup. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:38, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> UE Main Library and <b>Conditional Keep</b> <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_the_East_Library_e7d5.html" title="University of the East Library">University of the East Library</a> as per Shimeru. Wikipedia is not a campus information directory - besides the duplication issue that Shimeru raises, I also agree with the need for a severe cutting down of the University of the East Library article, which has much unencyclopedic and redundantly obvious content e.g.<i>"The primary mission of the University Library is to support the teaching, research, learning, extension service, and cultural endeavors of the University community. The general objective is to provide adequate, timely, and relevant information resources and innovative services that support the full spectrum of teaching, learning and research needs of the University."</i>;<i>"The Computer Science Library allows students access to the growing collection of computer science materials, at the same time allowing them to charge out materials for home use."</i>;<i>"Another special feature is a browsing area where clients can relax on comfortable seats with any of a large collection of well-selected and attractive books."</i>. Most of the article has this content style/tone. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:45, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> both. Come on now, they're just university libraries. Are we going to have articles on every college library? They have books and other academic materials for students to use for research. They probably are partially funded by endowments. This is common sense and does not require an article. What's next, articles for each dormitory of every college? These libraries don't appear to be notable as far as libraries are concerned. They function like any other college library, therefore they don't need to have an article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:52, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree that it is very likely KOTOR III will indeed be released, however there has been no official announcement (that I am aware of), aside from the constantly <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/28/kotor-franchise-to-continue/" class="external text" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/28/kotor-franchise-to-continue/" rel="nofollow">reiterated</a> comment from Nancy MacIntyre which has spawned what is still in essence just a rumor. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecperkins_1de1.html" title="User:Alecperkins">Alec</a> 22:36, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How is that <i>not</i> an official announcement? It is not a formal announcement. But it is straight from the mouth of someone from Lucasarts. It is considered to be highly unlikely that the game will not be made and it has had an announcement of sorts. I think that's grounds for this article to be kept. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 22:49, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>She didn't say that KOTOR III was in the works, only that they want to continue the franchise. A simple statement on the KOTOR/KOTOR II pages about the probability of a sequel is sufficient for now, since there is no information publicly known about the game. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecperkins_1de1.html" title="User:Alecperkins">Alec</a> 04:15, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It makes sense to have a lower quantitative threshold for things like sales for poets writing in small languages, but for academics there is a given hierarchy and career which is similar all over the world, even though the titles may vary. Åkerberg is not a professor, not even a <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Docent.html" title="Docent">docent</a></i> yet, and her main work so far, her dissertation, is published in English on an English and general historical topic, so there is no reason to include her on some kind of "national" quota, as might be done for scholars whose research may be of importance despite little international recognition. (Her page at the university is nothing special; a lot of junior academics, including graduate students, have pages like that presenting their research.) And this comes from someone who usually defends notable but little known academics on AFD. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Upp◦land</a> 22:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Keep</b> for a number of reasons. Firstly the nomination is incorrect, the sees don't have their own individual entries, they are recently created redirects to the general region. Even if they did the dioceses could be seperately noted from the towns. Secondly dioceses (IMO) have inherent notability, and this goes double for dioceses that are not <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_See_18b5.html" title="Titular See">titular</a>. Finally, they are listed in the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Encyclopedia_7d0b.html" title="Catholic Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a> which gives them notability even if it isn't accepted that dioceses have.

Essentially, it is questionable whether anyone has actually read this book besides the author, and its inclusion here is basically for advertising and was posted by the author himself, Patrick S. Johnston. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 22:49, 25 November 2006 (UTC) I am also nominating the following related page for deletion because it is the author's page and this book is his only claim to notability:</p>

<li><a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a>'s post was subjective and therefore irrelevant as far as notability is concerned. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User: Zoe</a>'s "self-promotion, puffery", ok, but so is every one of you all's user pages. Dog Ear is a self-publishing company and an actual publishing company, they have buildings and employees and everything. I would be willing to see the author page go for the time being, but I want to discuss the book page. So it doesn't show up on worldcat, if it did like Jesse Izzard's <i>Mission Accomplished!</i> by Athena Press, which isn't an "actual" publishing company, could the book page stay then? What if other users posted details about the book, would that suffice the idea that no one has read the book but the author standard? Basically, what is the minimum standard here for posting an article about a novel? Can the article be reposted if after deletion it clears notability hurdles? pjohn13 13:00, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An article and user page are not the same thing. Your book was published because you paid Dog Ear to publish it (it's <s>usually</s> the other way around for notable books - buildings and employees are irrelevant). Other users haven't posted anything about the book, which is the point, and no it doesn't count if you get your roomate or mom to say something nice, or "forget" to log in so it looks like a different user is saying something nice. Good luck to you on your book, but right now, it's not notable and Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">not for advertising</a>, period, which most Wikipedians feel strongly about. Try MySpace or Blogspot instead of trying to negotiate your way to success here - that's exactly what those websites are for. If the book becomes notable in the future, someone else will gladly do up an article here about it without being asked, prompted, paid, related to you or an acquaintance of yours.<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 17:08, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a reliable nor acceptable academic resource unlike an actual encyclopedia. It will remain this way as long as unqualified persons are allowed to post on the site and manage it. Which is fine if that is the route you all are interested in, but any kind of claims to integrity are ridiculous when one looks up other articles for so-called notable novels that give away the plot and gives lazy people an opportunity to speak about the book as if they read it. If you want to do something commendable, go delete all the spoilers that exist. Also, do not pretend for an instant that an article about a form of entertainment does not contribute to commerce. Wikipedia is a form of advertising. It matters very little whom posts on the site about it, if the consumer can find more information on this site than on a commercial site, it may influence the sale. And please don't pretend that notability is anything more than subjectivity. As you yourself suggest, someone will post an article if the novel becomes notable, as in if they read it and LIKE it and take the time to post the article. I would hope they would not ruin or cheapen the story by putting it on this site where anyone can look at it and judge a book they have not read by information that could be inaccurate. So you want to remove this article, fine, just make sure you go around the site and take down the spoilers that contribute to intellectual laziness (you have plenty of work to do). If you do not, then you have no reason to take down the article about my novel which gives away nothing. If my novel fit your norm of notability, which is skewed toward big corporations in this case, we would not be having this dialogue. Which is certainly reasonable, it is not as if they publish things like the OJ book. Oh wait, they did. With the enforcement of norms comes power and responsibility, so use it. Not to mention there are articles that show their bias toward the book they read, here's an article for you to start on: <a href="../../../w/h/e/When_Patty_Went_to_College_8339.html" title="When Patty Went to College">When Patty Went to College</a>, Which contains this gem: "<i>Dear Enemy</i> is an excellent read." pjohn13 21:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have read the spoiler warning and I am well aware of pages that fulfill the letter of the idea of spreading information, but are totally disrespectful of the author and their work. Take the page on Vonnegut's <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaughterhouse-Five_0f78.html" title="Slaughterhouse-Five">Slaughterhouse-Five</a> for example, if not for the spoilers, the page would have no more information than is needed for someone to decide if they want to read the book or not while giving that person reading the article a sense of what the novel is about. If Vonnegut wanted to write down everything someone needed to know about the novel without having to read the novel, he would not have written a novel. It would be impossible. Vonnegut would be instead writing a study guide. This is because a study guide is not a narrative. A study guide is thought to be authoritative, as giving one the "facts" so one can say that one knows what is important about that work. When an author writes a novel to tell us something through the use of narrative, the reader brings their subjectivity to the reading and will interpret what is important. The spoiler, one who posts their interpretation as fact, has not done anyone a service by providing information, but has colonized the process of critical reading. One can choose to avoid the "information" of the spoiler, but not everyone will. A narrative is not created to be static and closed to thoughts about meaning and allowing anyone to impose a particular meaning on a narrative is dangerous because it can make thought become dogmatic instead of dynamic. pjohn13 8:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
