<li><b>Delete</b>. Garbage. An article of legislation passed by a <i>student organization</i> is hardly notable, unless it serves as the springboard for significant legal case, or has achieved a kind of notoriety that is highly doubtful for something just enacted this year. For the sake of good taste, I deleted the final paragraph of this article, which read, in full:</li>

<dd>I'd like to add that for what it's worth, the author of the comic has been remarkably understanding and cooperative. This one clearly does <i>not</i> meet the Alexa requirements suggested at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_dc06.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines</a>.

<li>By the same token, since they were propsed, the alternate guidelines have been used at least as often as the original guidelines (which makes sense to me, since the original guidelines do not, IMHO, map very well onto the information space of web comics). If I had to guess, I'd guess that more than half of the currently existing webcomic articles would fail an Alexa test. Of course, if the article remains as stubby as it currently is, it doesn't much matter; but this <i>is</i> a comic which has been repeatedly Snarked; which has been discussed (maybe reviewed?) at Sequential Tart; and appears to have well over a thousand unique Google hits (there's almost 3,000 hits on "Casey and Andy", of which roughly half seem to be references to the webcomic). If it weren't for the fact that this is more like a hiccup than an article, I can't see it even being an issue. --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERay_Radlein_ee87.html" title="User:Ray Radlein">Ray Radlein</a> 21:13, Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I deleted the overcompact character listing stub and replaced it with an actual description of each of the characters. The first four descriptions are directly from the comic's cast page (two with slight additions), the others were written by me. I did not add anything other than the character listing and I hold no delusion that my descriptions are particularly well-written, but I hope that they elevate the article beyond "stub" status and make it worth keeping and spending more work on. -- Milo, a fan of C&amp;A.
<ul>
<li><i>Comment:</i> Direct quotations from the website are copyright violations (as each of those descriptions is aparently the full text of each page that they appear on) and therefore it is not legal to add them in their entirety to a Wikipedia article unless the copyright holder releases them. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 21:46, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I remember him well here in Palm Springs! My jaw about hit the ground when I saw the name. The San Luis Obispo radio market is roughly the same size or slightly smaller than Palm Springs, which comes in as market number 151 out of 600 total. However, a 25kw Class A FM in SLO would have quite a reach along the entire Central Coast. KZOZ comes in crystal clear well past Atascadero almost to Salinas and, if memory serves, inland as far as Fresno. That's a reach, friends.

<p>This article is problematic in many superficial ways and in one deep way.</p>
<p>The superficial failings of this article could be corrected. The very name of the article, "vanavsos", is incorrect -- the Greek term has a standard English equivalent, "banausic" (see OED). The meaning given for the term is incorrect -- in fact, inconsistent with the quotes the article itself gives. The transliterations and etymology aren't quite right. The discussion of the sense-development in Greek isn't quite right. There are anachronistic references to modern fields, which could be removed. There is a connection to the constitutions of the Doric states which is not justified in the article, which could be removed. Etc. etc.</p>
<p>If those were the only problems, the solution would be to either edit the article, or to list it in <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_needing_attention_a7b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages needing attention">Wikipedia:Pages_needing_attention</a>.</p>
<p>But there is a more basic problem: it is not about an important, recognized concept. It is taking a common Ancient Greek word which Aristotle uses in its ordinary meaning and elevating it into some sort of technical term in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_philosophy.html" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a>. At best, this constitutes <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, an essay on the relationship of the Greek concepts of virtue (arete) and how it is incompatible with banausic occupation.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 05:49, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">Wikipedia:WikiLove</a>, I'm ignoring some of the provocative things that have been said, and will try for a constructive, positive, egoless resolution, taking advantage of everyone's contributions.</p>
<p>The core of this article as it currently stands seems to be the political role of the artisan class in ancient greece (the <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">βάναυσοι</span>). That is an encyclopedic subject, there is accepted non-original research on the topic (which it would be nice to cite at some point), and in fact it's not a bad name for it.</p>
<p>That seems like an awfully specialized subject, though, and I'd hope that we could come up with a more general article on the <b>Artisan Class in Ancient Greece</b>, with more content on its economic role, its relations with other parts of the population (<a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen.html" title="Citizen">citizens</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metic.html" title="Metic">metics</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douloi.html" title="Douloi">slaves</a>, etc.), well-known members (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Phidias.html" title="Phidias">Phidias</a>?, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>?), patron gods/demigods (<a href="../../../d/a/e/Daedalus.html" title="Daedalus">Daedalus</a>?), and all that.</p>
<p>As for the name of the article: In the academic literature on this class, it is referred to either using the English term 'artisan', or with the Greek name in Greek letters, or the Greek name transliterated as 'banausoi' (the plural of 'banausos'). Liddell &amp; Scott (the standard dictionary of Ancient Greek) translates it as 'artisan' (noun); as an adjective, it started out as the adjective 'of the class of handicraftsmen or artisans' and later developed into 'vulgar' etc. (in Modern Greek, it means something like 'uncouth', but that is not really relevant here). Of course, it doesn't have precisely the same denotation or connotations as the English word 'artisan', but there doesn't seem to be any danger of confusion by using that term. The printed index of the 1911 Britannica doesn't use the term banausos/banausic, and, to the extent one can trust the scanned version at 1911encyclopedia.org, they don't appear in its text, either (even though it <i>does</i> use the term 'metic'). Hence the recommendation to use the term 'artisan class'. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:06, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is the importance of the term: <b>This ancient Greek term delineates the ethos of the commercial class from the ethos of the warrior class. It shows the bias of the warrior ethos and established, in the Greek republics, a <u>"psycological distance"</u> between the citizens and the traders.</b> "Artisans" in the Greek language is "texnitai". This word "vanavsos" is to show that they created a term to describe their "bias" against the trader classes and to seperate the warrior ethos from the commercial ethos.

<dd>Aristotle is pretty clear on this in Politics 1277a/b: <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">ὧν ἓν μέρος κατέχουσιν οἱ χερνῆτες: οὗτοι δ' εἰσίν, ὥσπερ σημαίνει καὶ τοὔνομ' αὐτούς, οἱ ζῶντες ἀπὸ τῶν χειρῶν, ἐν οἷς ὁ βάναυσος τεχνίτης ἐστίν. διὸ παρ' ἐνίοις οὐ μετεῖχον οἱ δημιουργοὶ τὸ παλαιὸν ἀρχῶν, πρὶν δῆμον γενέσθαι τὸν ἔσχατον.</span> That is: “One department [of slave/bondsman] belongs to the handicraftsmen (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">χερνῆτες</span>), who as their name implies are the persons that live by their hands (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">χειρῶν</span>), a class that includes the mechanic (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">βάναυσος</span>) artisan (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">τεχνίτης</span>).

<dd>I think it's pretty clear from this passage that "banausos" is <i>not</i> the term of art in political philosophy that you're making it out to be, at least in Aristotle—in fact, he uses the word <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">δημιουργοὶ</span> to refer to the manual workers who were not admitted to office, not <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">βαναυσοι</span>. Your own quotes demonstrate that banausic does not refer to the <i>commercial</i> or <i>agricultural</i> sector, and your quotes about the love of money don't refer to banausoi at all. So where does that leave this article? Is a common Ancient Greek word for a kind of artisan worth a Wikipedia article? That said, as I suggested above, I <i>do</i> think it is worthwhile to have an serious article on the social/economic/cultural position of artisans in Greek society in the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 18:50, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Nixon said, "Let me make this perfectly clear"---This is not about the "artisan class" it is about the ancient Greek warrior clan using a word to seperate their "*culture*" from the commercial culture. First, It is a word that describes the "prejudice" of the warrior class for the "values" of the commercial class. Moreover, it was a psycological device to train their people to turn away from the commercial fields of endeavor. To label this as the "Artisan class" is to destroy the fundamental meaning that this article is trying to portray.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:21, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I have read Werner Jaeger, Kitto, Hamilton, Muller and others.

<p>On the title, the title needs to capture the essence of the material in question. I am all up for a better title, but "Artisan Class in Ancient Greece" is not one of them. This title is misleading because it is not about the "Artisan Class".

<dd>My point on presenting my culture and my ethos is that I see what they see. The Spartans are a strange people, Rousseau commented on this, Paul Cartledge commented on this and many others. Why? Because they are namby-pambies. They are academics, soft and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_definition_of_effeminacy.html" title="Classical definition of effeminacy">effeminate</a>. How can soft and effeminate, lovers of themselves and lovers of money, understand a warrior culture. They can not. The Spartans are a "strange people". They don't understand and so they can not "correctly" speak of them. What they conjecture is misleading because they miss to catch salient points. Culture is very important. If <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_determinism.html" title="Cultural determinism">cultural determinism</a> is important to understanding people's actions And that culture impacts politics, Then Culture also impacts knowledge! What do the proverbs say, "It takes one to know one"; "Unless you have walked in a mile in the moccasins of the other, then you can't understand". Understanding is the key to knowledge. How can academics that have spent their whole life in a classroom have any understanding and/or sympathy (therefore "knowledge") for a warrior culture and ethos in which they <b>despise</b>.

<dd>I think Macrakis you are turning this into something which is not intended in the article. you state that "this is an essay on the relationship of the Greek concepts of virtue and how it in incompatible with banausic occupation". This article only presents the concept current in Greek philosophy, and the language of the aristocratic classes. This article JUST presents the concept. In the minds of the Spartans, Kretans, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch, there was <u>already</u> a concept of incompatiblity. It was a given. Why do you think that in <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_%28Plato%29_ef8e.html" title="Republic (Plato)">Republic (Plato)</a> that Plato doesn't give any room for the vanavsos. In order to understand Platonic and Aristotelian political philosophy and the actions of Thebes and of the Doric Greeks in this regard, this concept is necessary. Your attempt to slight and construe this into original research is an attempt at censorship. I agree that 30% of the [classical definition of republic] was original. But the vanavsos article is not original research at all. You are sliding the facts to get this deleted.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 17:57, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In the article, you state (as an example) "Plato and Aristotle teach that the highest thing in man is reason and therefore, the purpose of human perfection lies with the activity of reason; i.e. the 'theoretic' or contemplative life. Trade, industry and mechanical labour prevent this idea.". Well, you may think trade, industry and mechanical labour prevent activity of reason, but playing the devil's advocate, I'd be perfectly prepared to refute that claim (I am, of course, assuming that the "therefore" is your own thoughts and ideas, and not Plato's or Aritotle's.

<dd>Your comment, <u>"The conclusion that "Plato and Aristotle teach" <i>anything at all</i> about "modern fields such as lawyering and journalism" is inappropriate on Wikipedia"</u> is very impertinent. You may not take any teaching from the Classics, but all of Roman Catholic philosophy, theology and ethics comes from Plato and Aristotle. You and your people may not like this information and refuse to read anything classical because they are "DWEM" and you despise classical learning and philosophy doesn't mean that you can delete information based on these grounds and your prejudices. What about the rest of us that have a love of the classical world? What about the Roman Catholic philosophers and students who love to have this information?

And yet, and yet... the only genuine English word that corresponds to the Greek is an adjective — and it seems odd to have an encyclopædia article with an adjective as a title (banausic <i>what</i>?); we do seem to be dealing more with a dictionary article.

Discussion of the concept doubtless has a place somewhere (in a discussion of Aristotle, in a discussion of ancient Greek class-consciousness, etc.), but there's just no reason to think that the Greeks (who, aside from Aristotle, seem not even to have used the noun to refer to people, according to my <i>Liddle &amp; Scott</i>) recognised the concept concerned.

<dd>I'm unfamiliar with 'deadjectival noun'; how do they differ from ordinary nouns?

<p>To Theo, we just start a new line. Look, the word in Greek is a noun not an adjective. It may be an adjective in English, but it is a noun in Greek. One just says "vanavsos" and one means the working class. One can say of the perioci of Lacedæmonia, that they are vanavsos. The vanavsoi don't have political rights. The vanavsoi are in rebellion. The vanavsoi are not literate enough to do politics. It is a noun in Greek texts. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 21:24, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, no, it's a noun in modern Greek, we're agreed — it's just that there's no noun in English that's derived from it, only an adjective. I'm a little surprised that you say that it means the working class, though; isn't that a figurative, not a literal use? In modern Greek, I thought that <i>vanavsos</i> meant literally 'crude', 'coarse', 'rough', 'vulgar', even 'obscene'. In ancient Greek, though, it was an adjective, surely; I can't find a mention of it as a noun except in Aristotle, and he seems to be creating a noun for his own purposes. Do you have any other references for it as a noun? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:48, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, the transliteration is fine for modern Greek (and modern Greeks pronounce ancient Greek as if it were modern).

<dd>The "b" in Greek is pronounced as a "v" sound. If the "B" is used then English speakers would say the term with a "b" sound. I don't think that would sound right. And i would like to add that in understanding freedom and liberty, the Greeks did not consider the vanavsos as participants in a city's political life. Aristotle, and Plato did not include the vanavsoi in the political franchise. This word and concept are important to understanding the Greek mentality.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 21:42, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Neither Plato nor Aristotle were democrats, so I'm not clear what you mean by 'franchise' here — and they were surely included in the franchise in the Athenian democracy at the time (given that the term itself was only used as a noun describing a class of person by Aristotle, so far as I can tell). But that's a discussion that should really take place elsewhere. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:59, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, β in Modern Greek is certainly pronounced like English 'v', and it would be completely appropriate to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription.html" title="Transcription">transcribe</a> a Modern Greek word that way. However, the term in question is being cited from <i>classical</i> sources (as I mentioned in the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Talk%7EVanavsos_3f21.html" title="Talk:Vanavsos">Talk:Vanavsos</a> page). The conventional <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a> of β in the Latin alphabet is 'b' -- we don't even need to worry about what the actual pronunciation was in classical times, just know that this is the standard convention. Surely it doesn't make sense to re-write all Greek words borrowed into English following the Modern Greek pronunciation?: 'violoyia' (not biology), 'taftoloyia' (not tautology), etc. Moreover, there is an <i>existing</i>, <i>established</i> English version of this term: banausic. And what's wrong with saying 'the franchise was not extended to banausics'; anyway, the WikiPedia is not about introducing new terms like 'vanavsos'. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:07, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You're confusing two things here: English words with Greek roots, and transliterations of Greek words. 'Biology' is no more a transliteration of the Greek than would be 'viologhia' or 'violoyia'; it's an English word whose etymology is Greek.</li>
<li>What's wrong with the sentence you suggest is that 'banausics' isn't an English word.</li>
<li>In so far as Wikipedia delas with concepts that have only non-English names in non-Roman alphabets or other symbol-systems, then transliteration is necessary, and doesn't constitute the introduction of new words.

“But there is a more basic problem: it is not about an important, recognized concept. It is taking a common Ancient Greek word which Aristotle uses in its ordinary meaning and elevating it into some sort of technical term in political philosophy.”<br />
All the research that I've done supports this; the ancient Greeks simply didn't use the term in a way that warrants an article. Aristotle himself didn't use it in the way that the article states. Some of the quotations offered below <i>could</i> be taken to support WHEELER's contentions, but are more naturally read otherwise (references to 'the corrupting influence of the marketplace' just don't naturally refer to the supposed concept of 'vanavsos'). I do agree that some of the material would probably fit somewhere, so WHEELER's undoubted hard work needn't be completely wasted. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:27, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ad hominem arguments. What is the major flaw in the system (as opposed to the people who run it), apart from the fact that some articles which you like are being deleted? I understand your desire to defend them tooth and nail, but you need to pick your fights and decide which things to compromise on (easy for me to say I know), rather than to make enemies with anyone who disagrees with you. Personally, I think that your articles (the ones I have looked at) are good writing about things which deserve to be included in Wikipedia and do not constitute 'original research', but probably should be parts of a larger article on Ancient Greek society as it impacted philosophy, rather than separate articles.

All I am saying, is that the "Vanavsos" Article be judged by people who are classicists! Why should people ignorant of the subject matter be voting about something they have no clue on what they are saying?

<p>I've started this in order to avoid cluttering up the voting any further. I'm not arguing for the retention of this article (my vote, above, stands), but a number of people have raised and argued about an issue that's of more general importance.</p>
<p>An article on, for example, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grave_%28burial%29.html" title="Grave (burial)">graves</a> should start with the origins of the term and associated concept (in fact the Wikipedia article is a stub, but the principle holds); nevertheless, the article is given the modern English spelling, not 'græf', and the modern spelling is used when talking about ancient grave mounds, etc. Why then, when we're talking about a word that exists and is used in modern Greek should we use a transliteration alien to the modern pronunciation? It's not even as if such transliterations are accurate representations of how Aristotle or Euripedes, for example, would have pronounced the language. Is it, at least in part, that non-Greek Westerners feel that <i>they</i> own the ancient language and culture, and that modern Greeks are merely its degraded descendants who can be ignored? I'm sure that such an approach is usually unconscious, but I suspect that it's widely prevalent. (There's a <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._K._Chesterton_dbf7.html" title="G. K. Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> essay on this sort of topic, but I don't have the reference to hand.)</p>
<p>If there's an English word <i>derived from</i> the Greek, then of course it should be used in an English-language encyclopædia, but where the word is solely Greek, then surely good practice (not to mention good manners) dictates that the Greek pronunciation be used to transliterate it — not a transliteration of the conjectural (at best) pronunciation of people dead for 2,500 years, but of the pronunciation of the living, breathing users of the language. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:03, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is, Modern English has borrowed this word from Ancient Greek, not from Modern Greek. Using a transliteration reflecting Modern Greek pronunciation would be like borrowing a word from Latin and using modern Italian pronunciation for it, or borrowing a word from Sanskrit and using modern Hindi pronunciation and transliteration for it. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 14:14, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But, first, this word doesn't <i>exist</i> in modern English — that's the point (as has been pointed out a number of times above); English has the adjective 'banausic', but no noun, so it hasn't borrowed it from anywahere. Secondly (and less importantly), the relationship between Latin and Italian is very different from that between Ancient and modern Greek, nor is transliteration an issue in the former case (besides, Latin is pronounced in many ways; being brought up a Catholic, I was taught to speak Latin in a much more Italian way than my current colleagues in Classics in Oxford — and you should hear the Latin grace as spoken in Pembroke College, Oxford; I'm told that it's the northern European style, <i>very</i> Italian, much more so than my early training). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:50, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's get this right: we're transliterating an <b>ancient</b> Greek word into English, right? That word currently does not exist in English. Modern Greek ࣔ Ancient Greek. We do not know exectly how people spoke in Ancient Greece. We should use the system used by the greatest number of people, particularly scholars. While some scholars would pronounce Ancient Greek with a level of the modern style coming in, they would not read the one as the other. The normal way of transliterating β into English is as "b". The way to obtain a "v" would be to use the pre-Classical digamma (Ϝ). If we were expecting the French Wikipedia to transliterate a modern English word, we would like them to use a modern system, not Chaucer's pronounciation. Mel's point about his pronounciation (and Pembroke College's) is about a modern dialect of Latin, not of the original language. It would also make most sense to someone who is not <i>au fait</i> with Greek tradition or pronounciation to comprehend. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">(t)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Smoddy_689b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Smoddy">(e)</a> 15:21, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, we're transliterating a Greek word into English; it existed in Ancient Greek, it still exists in modern Greek — it's just Greek</li>
<li>The normal way of transliterating 'β' varies according to context; when dealing with modern Greek, the normal way is to use a 'v'. Modern scholars, especially when writing in more popular contexts, often use old-style transliterations (such as 'Euripedes' rather than 'Evripidis' or even 'Evripithis') when dealing with familiar names and words, and more accurate modern transliterations otherwise.</li>
<li>Transliterating isn't an issue from English to French.</li>
<li>You seem to have missed my point about Latin — and no, it has nothing to do with <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a>, modern or otherwise.</li>

<li>But the article is about the ancient word.</li>
<li>I am currently studying classical Greek. I have recently been to Greece. I do know quite a bit about transliteration. If I could pick you up on one thing: <i>writing in more popular contexts</i>. Are we not trying to make an encyclopedia understandable to the average man-on-the-street? I would also say that the concept is classical, ergo the transliteration should be by normal standards for classical work. If someone said to me, "Who wrote <i>Iphigenia in Aulis</i>" (for example), I would say Euripides, not something along the other lines. I realise that is, to an extent, your point. However, it is highly inconsistent. This encyclopeda should be clearly understandable to someone approaching the concepts for the first time. This inconsistency isn't.</li>
<li>Point conceded. It was the nearest comparison I could draw.</li>

<li>My point is that there isn't an ancient word and a modern word; there's a Greek word. Besides, I'm not talking about this article (which I think, on balance, should be deleted as non-encyclopædic).</li>
<li>The point about popular writing is precisely that; as we're involved in popular writing, we might think of following the lead that I cite. (Also, however it's <i>transliterated</i>, I'd say <i>Evripidis</i> (the 'd' being more of a 'th'), as would most Greeks.)</li>
<li>&#160;</li>
<li>My Latin comment was a response to yours; you then treated it as a separate point in itself.</li>
<li>The consistency can be found if one treats well-known names to be English borrowings (as in the 'biology' example used at one point above); then borrowed words, being English, are spelt as the English spell them, but transliterations conform to the Greek pronunciation.</li>

Oh, and I think Wikipedia should respond to trends, not try to set them. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">(t)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Smoddy_689b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Smoddy">(e)</a> 18:05, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>“I'm studying for my GCSE” — that's good to hear; there's still someone out there doing it.

<dd>After considerable thinking... for the Greek word Barbarian we use the English word "b". I am all for changing the title of the article to "banausic" or something similar. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 18:49, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have sitting in front of me the OED and the word is used in English language as an idea from the Greek classical world. So the "idea" was transported to English culture. The word may be dead now but in Victorian England it was real. As for transliteration, we can keep that in the body of the article but for the title of it, maybe we go with banavsos, banausos as with like "Euripedes". The word was used as late as 1957.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 19:26, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a page about a character from the <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runaways_%28comics%29.html" title="Runaways (comics)">Runaways comic book series</a>. However, the information on the Sister Grimm page is duplicated from her entry in the Runaways page.

<li><i>Above edit by 203.200.201.2, with a total of less than 25 edits, several of them to the Ganesh Krishnan article.</i> <b>Comment</b> to the above: Thanks for contributing this information to the Ganesh Krishnan article. Please note, however, that this is an encyclopedia, and that appeals to "give somebody a chance" will not be considered a reason to include someone. Also, being a "network Specialist for TCP/IP &amp; Security" is not notable in itself, in the sense Wikipedia defines the word. Being the person behind an important invention, a much used computer programme or a published book might help. Also, any such claims should include sources, so the information can be verified. The same goes for being a "well known photographer". Can you provide any information (e.g. a link to an article in a major newspaper or magazine, or to a photographic gallery) to back this up? / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 13:33, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

Oh, and if you should happen to be the same person as the other two anonymous users above, please note that this is a voting page, and that you're only allowed to vote once.

<li><b>Keep</b> As the article states, a glasspack is a popular type of <a href="../../../m/u/f/Muffler.html" title="Muffler">muffler</a> among certain (young male?) automobile owners—distinctive enough from OEM and other aftermarket mufflers to deserve its own article. Should be titled in the singular, however. But it's not made of glass, (it uses fiberglass for sound-deadening), nor does it amplify sound (as anyone who's ever had a set of lake pipes can attest). The fact that a company and a band took its name is another indication that it needs its own article. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 17:23, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. They're filled with fiberglass as DialUp pointed out. My brother had a set on his old '67 Mustang. Ah, memories. Even with "freeway gears" that car was a holy terror and the 'packs were a major reason why. Correct errors and remove the "ricer" POV comment. - Lucky 6.9 20:33, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> OK stub. Mark for cleanup, though, as I don't think the information is very accurate. I was never part of the hotrod culture but even I heard about them. Good chance that someone wise in the ways of J. C. Whitney will expand it into a real article someday. They didn't <i>amplify</i> the sound though surely they were louder than the standard article. I wonder what the deal was? Perhaps they deadened the sound <i>just exactly enough</i> to make the car <i>barely legal</i> while providing the minimum back pressure? Presumably the ostensible purpose was to increase the engine's power, not its sound. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:29, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Now I've gotten interested... I like this: <a href="http://www.v6z24.com/howto/glasscat" class="external free" title="http://www.v6z24.com/howto/glasscat" rel="nofollow">http://www.v6z24.com/howto/glasscat</a> says "How to install a Glasspack in Place of Your Cat: If your cat has gone bad, and you want a simple fix without making the car sound too loud and possibly like crap, you can reaplace the cat with a glasspack muffler. Keep in mind that this is illegal, and will be noticed if inspections are done in your area. It is also not the greatest for the environment, but do as you wish...&#160;;-)"</dd>

<ul>
<li>Weak <b>keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>, including making title singular. Glasspacks are the most well-known generic type of aftermarket exhaust, and maybe the most well-known term for aftermarket equipment of any sort. Dpbsmith's guesses were correct: The purpose was a modicum of sound-deadening with a minimum of backpressure. In the fifties and sixties, most hotrodders didn't understand the effects of exhaust-pipe diameter, stepping, and length that affect resonance and thus affect evacuation of burnt gasses from the cylinder. So they often used the biggest available headers dumping into big glasspacks, which sounded testosteronous but resulted in less than optimal torque and power. When I was the sort of teenager who valued power over handling, I had them on a 1972 Pontiac GTO with a 400-cubic-inch engine, and it scared neighborhood pets. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:20, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I made a hasty attempt to fix the article, which actually had <i>lots</i> of problems (it didn't not make it clear that the "glass" was <b>fiber</b>glass, and it implied that these devices actually <i>amplified</i> engine noise), but if you actually know something about them I'd appreciate it if you would take a quick pass over it yourself. <i>Something</i> ought to be said about the cultural context (teenagers, testosteronosity, etc.) but it should be carefully NPOV... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:51, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. It's certainly hard to tell what's fanfic, what's official, what's neither. Very badly written article all round. Even if Gray Fox is notable (like you, I've no idea, and the article doesn't help) it'd still be easier to delete this article and start again, rather than try to edit this mess!

<p>I count 4 clear "deletes", 2 clear "keeps" (one from a user who created an account the day this VfD opened) and 3 "redirects" (none of which really argued for an actual merge). When investigating the article myself, I found that there was an unresolved copyright violation still in the history.

<li>I need to check with my PR-fan friends, but I suspect this is a big ol' <s><b>Delete</b></s> -- the <i>real</i> Green Ranger would be just as important as any of the other lead characters of the series -- he wasn't a "lesser-known" enemy; he was a major enemy who then became the sixth member of the team. <i>However</i>, a Google search on "Rudy Gomez" and "Green Ranger" together gets zippo hits, so I suspect this is fanfic. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:41, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC) <i>Update</i>: All my PR-fan friends agree this is completely non-canon; one phrases it as "<a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow_dung.html" title="Cow dung">b---s---</a> on an insane degree." But as Aranel points out, a <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Rangers_5c57.html" title="Power Rangers">Power Rangers</a> is a more useful fate than deletion, so that's what I'm changing my vote to. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:14, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Green Ranger had 7 episodes as an enemy (where he was under control of the bad guy), if I remember correctly from my childhood days. He became a good guy when the mind control had been worn off somehow, and became a regular on the show afterwards (so I think the article is fairly significant... <s><b>if not keep, then redirect</b></s>). I don't remember how he was under control though (might have to do with the coins the article mentioned, but I'm not sure). The Dragonzord and Dragon-dagger flute I remember vividly though. The character's name however, was not Rudy Gomez... it was Tommy. I don't know his last name though. This might be a cross between a fanfic and the actual info of the character. For sure though- this article is not complete in information, so it could also be regarded as stubbed (if this gets moved or so). <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 10:26, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh, so there's already an article on the Green Ranger, hehe. Then this one is pretty unnecessary.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 5 clear "delete" votes and 7 clear "keep" votes (but 2 of them were from anon or very new users and are discounted). Even after discounting the anon votes, this discussion fails to reach a clear concensus to delete.

<p>Keep. The author clearly states that the subject of the article is mythological and openly acknowledges that many sources have it to be pure legend. While wikipedia may have no room for a man who was never born, we certainly do record myths and folklore that achieve particular popularity. This one has obviously circulated for hundreds of years (see, Eyre Empire). Also, keep in mind, while there is no clear historical precedent to prove his existence, there is also nothing with which to disprove it. No premise for deletion. Maybe relist as, "Legend of Truelove Eyre." History 21</p>

<p>Nick04, google has no hits for Truelove Eyre, but yahoo does (quite a few actually). You should always try BOTH engines when doing a search, especially if you can't find anything on google at first. Secondly, Truelove Eyre's existence or nonexistence is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. Only the legend ITSELF is relevant, as it is widely well known tale in Britain. If there was a widely known "Legend of the Bat Boy," I expect that wikipedia would have an article on it. "In 19th Century Romania, a false but highly believable story circulated...blah blah blah...this folklore has become a part of Romanian history and lives on to this day." You get the picture. The story itself is famous, that's what matters. But just as an aside, the Gaelic name for Ireland is, "Eire." That's no coincidence. Go to yahoo. History21</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> thank you, Nick04, but I'm serious about what I said.</p>

<p>I know that I don't get to vote twice, I was just emphasizing what I had said before. You all don't seem to understand what I'm saying here: nothing about Truelove Eyre is verifiable. But the fact that a legend surrounds him IS verifiable. It is the LEGEND that we are reporting. For all I know, William the Conqueror could have falled from his horse because he saw a shiny coin on the ground--I DON'T CARE. The story, however, is a significant part of folklore and should be shown on wikipedia. It is made perfectly clear in the article that the story is largely thought to be myth. <b>History21</b></p>

<dd>Yes, I am changing my vote one more time due to a simple fact: this article is a legend, yes. But WHO SAYS legends are not Wikipedia material? I have seen such ridiculous articles get away from VfD's axe... so even whitout full knowledge of this article's subject, I can't let it be deleted. Do you all remember that rule? Yeah, that one... assume the best? It's part of the Wikipedia's utopia, and it's one that we should take into consideration here. I hereby change my vote to Keep and it will stay that way.

<dd>Nobody says that legends are not Wikipedia material. Hell, many of the pages I work on here are about legends. But this particular alleged legend, strongly linked to hoax articles whose only claims to verification are on non-authoritative web pages that could very well be passing off fake lore as folklore, isn't notable and is very likely to be completely bogus. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 19:28, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just read <a href="http://www.england-genealogy.net/history.html" class="external text" title="http://www.england-genealogy.net/history.html" rel="nofollow">the link</a> provided by 168.184.90.11, and i'm starting to think it sounds like Truelove was the man's old surname, i.e. his name was Bob Truelove, and he was rechristened Bob Eyre. This would explain why "Truelove Eyre" gets no Google hits. Does this sound reasonable to anyone else? <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoobaz_6eee.html" title="User:Foobaz"><font color="green">Foobaz</font></a>·<a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoobaz_50d5.html" title="User talk:Foobaz"><font color="brown">✐</font></a> 06:05, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In medieval Europe people didn't really have surnames. They were indentified by their occupation (e.g. "John the Smith"), their location (e.g. "John of York") or their nickname (e.g. "Edmund Ironsides"). "Eyre" was just a nickname. "Truelove" may have been another nickname: it certainly sounds like one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 21:36, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One cannot verify the Truelove Eyre legend without thus verifying the Eyre Empire itself, as it is said to have stemmed from him. Therefore, I counsel patience and caution before recklessly acquiescing to the validity of either article. 168.184.90.11 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.184.90.11.html" title="User talk:168.184.90.11">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.184.90.11_1928.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.184.90.11">contributions</a>)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Obviously, this is at best a legend, and it doesn't seem to be a notable legend at that, as a google search reveals. Furthermore, a legend which people insist 'may be true' is what is generally called a hoax or, when pressed, a conspiracy theory. There is no verifiable fact at all in the article as it stands, even after the edits. This Truelove is <i>not</i> mentioned by anyone (that I was able to find) as the founder of the Ayre or Eyre families, and the <a href="http://www.allfamilycrests.com/e/eyre-family-crest-coat-of-arms.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.allfamilycrests.com/e/eyre-family-crest-coat-of-arms.shtml" rel="nofollow">Eyre family crest</a> does <i>not</i> feature a leg in armor. Finally, to say that 'historians cannot definitively confirm whether or not Truelove actually existed' gives his legend far too much credit; historians actually appear not to care at all. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquibix_398c.html" title="User:Squibix">Squibix</a> 19:08, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have rephrased these statement to better reflect the references.

If it is a hoax or a conspiracy, then it's a very old one, and certainly nothing to do with the Eyre Empire nonsense (although it has been a bit of a job removing that author's ludicrous inventions). I urge you to take a look at the references, and reconsider your position. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 03:18, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

THAT is why people want this nonsense deleted. The whole thing is of a piece. It's all a hoax.

<li>Those links you gave above are personal pages and sites that allow the gneral public to add info about their families. There's nothing authoritative about them that would make them reliable sources, and they seem like a relatively easy way to slip bogus family history out onto the web. But even if this were true, it's not encyclopedic material. It's completely and utterly nonnotable, and even if you give it the benefit of the doubt there, it's fringe nature added to the very real likelihood that someone is out there pulling your leg and we have an article that needs to be removed. Sorry you took time rewriting something so insignificant, but that was your choice and I don't think editors here should vote to keep it just because you trust those Internet sites you went to and rewrote something that undeniably started as a hoax article. The submitter wants you to believe that Ireland was named after his ancestor for crying out loud... can you say "untrustworthy source"? And is it really so hard for you to believe that if that person took the time to post the hoax articles here that he didn;t do the same on those personal pages and geneology sites that let people claim whatever they want about their families?

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>

<li>Comment. Frankly, the merger of this with our neoconservatism article would achieve nothing but ruining that article. The claim that Bushists supposedly encourage Christianisation of America (whatever that means) would be nonsense in an article about neoconservatism which predates President George W. Bush's presidency by at least 30 years. Very few if any of the President's supporters identify themselves as Bushists unlike Reaganites which was a common term. Frankly, I can think of few Republicans or conservatives whose opinions do not waver in any way from President Bush's although most generally support the administration. No change of vote. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 17:20, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Delete. It's definitely copyrighted. theAtlantic.com owns it, I think, or perhaps Rolling Stone. theAltantic.com now charges for admission to read it, though those other sites linked to appear to be fine with hosting it. Either way, it doesn't belong here. I posted to a talk page, then immediately deleted, then posted a link to the talk page's history/version that had it in there, and that needed to be taken down even (I think, as far as I can tell), so this should almost certainly be removed. Now, (and if a seasoned Wikipedian perchances upon this voting place) I'm curious: Can one link to the history/version of a page that gets deleted? Just curious. -209.6.22.123 02:47, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: There's no reason to delete this. The objections seem to be that the term is a novelty. It was made up to address a novel issue. There is no suitable alternative word that captures the meaning. Definitions are all made up somewhere along the lines, folks--just deal with it.

<li>Being quite familiar with Ben Taub General Hospital, I wouldn't at all be surprised if this term were used there or even if it originated there, since that by the time most tumors are seen at "the Tub," they're far advanced enough to be easily seen and smelled.
