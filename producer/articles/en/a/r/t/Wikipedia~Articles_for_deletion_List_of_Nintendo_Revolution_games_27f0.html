<p>Far too much crystal ball and reliance on rumors and speculation. "Revolution" is a code name not the actual name of the system. See <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Revolution_dcb8.html" title="Nintendo Revolution">Nintendo Revolution</a> for an actual list of games that have been aknowledged or confirmed by Nintendo. This page is no where near ready and far too soon for a system that won't be released till 2006. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 04:39, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The press is using the name Nintendo Revolution consistently, and once the actual name of the system is known, we can just move it to the correct name. Additionally, the page is only three days old, and vandals have been blanking the page. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 07:27, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>. It seems to me that a more appropriate place to put a list of rumored games at this early stage of development would be the main Nintendo Revolution article. Once the system is released, this article can be recreated. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKairos_73c0.html" title="User:Kairos">Kairos</a> 09:12, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It'll just be remade as soon as more info comes out, and it's nice to have a list of <i>confirmed</i> games. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 01:09, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, note that in regards to WarioWare and Camelot RPG, the two games were confirmed by NGCFrance, but did not have an announcement from Nintendo or Camelot. Delete them if you want, or put a notice that it is confirmed by NGCFrance, who did not list their sources on the matter. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 01:34, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, I vote <b>Strong Keep</b>. For one, there is NO SPECULATION IN THE ARTICLE. Hell, there are links on Nintendo Revolution's page confirming each of the games. For another, this article will be expanded upon, so why is it causing problem? If it were a larger list, it wouldn't be a problem. It's not an ideal VfD nomination, because it will, no doubt, be a noteworthy article. It wastes no bandwith because it is small, and when it begins to waste bandwith, it will be notable enough to warrant a place. There is no Crystal Ball, Hocus Pocus magic involved in this list; only the words from the horses' mouths. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 04:50, July 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daikatana.html" title="Daikatana">Daikatana</a> was confirmed as coming out in late 1997. <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_Forever_0d65.html" title="Duke Nukem Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a> was planned for release in 1998. <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a> was scheduled for September of 2003. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_%28game_system%29_b5ef.html" title="The Phantom (game system)">The Phantom game system</a> was scheduled for Christmas of 2004, then March of 2005. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 06:10, 16 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, what you're telling me then is if we have this article with these games confirmed and at an early development, they will forever be there. Wikipedia is written on the internet, not stone tablets. We don't need to wait until it becomes impossible for the games to be cancelled. As of now, there's little reason to believe they'll be cancelled, and even then, if they're cancelled, <b>change it</b>. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 06:16, July 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And yet this page still breaks the rule of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Most of the games listed are all "Untitled" and <b>all of them</b> are already listed at <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Revolution_dcb8.html" title="Nintendo Revolution">Nintendo Revolution</a>. There is no point to this article. It should be deleted and recreated at a later time (in the correct name) when a proper list can actually be made. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, it is policy. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 06:35, July 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is what they are. If you say they don't exist, then you'd be a liar. They are in development, that is not even arguable. And if this applies to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, then Twilight Princess does. AND, I fail to see the reasoning in deleting a harmless article that will return at a later date. There is no speculation on if these games exist, since they are confirmed by people with the authority to confirm it, so they are Revolution games. We should assume they're coming, like we do with Twilight Princess, Super Mario Strikers and Katamari Damacy DS. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 06:44, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And on another note, if you're arguing this, then I dare you to go to each and every page for an unreleased game (like, Twilight Princess), and delete any mention of a release date. You're assuming that these games won't come out just because we haven't seen pictures, so logically, you must assume that game won't come out, right? -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 06:19, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Ordinarily, I'm soft on "crystal ball" policy, and support keeping items that will soon be valid topics; here, though, "Revolution" isn't even the name of the system. The title is inappropriate, and the verified content exists at the system's parent article. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:24, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: All items mentioned here have been externally confirmed.

<li><b>Keep</b> Usefull. Can be moved to correct name when it comes out. Is anything being hurt by having this article there? (sorry forgot to login) <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> 20:17, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Upon further consideration, I'm changing my vote to <b>Keep</b>. While I would greatly prefer that game lists of this type distinguished between released games and upcoming games, that it not how they work. Given that, my biggest problem with the list is probably that the games on it don't actually have titles, and it seems to me like that's not a very good reason to vote to delete. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKairos_73c0.html" title="User:Kairos">Kairos</a> 20:36, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I will concede that this may no longer be crystalballing; however, I still believe that this is an unencyclopedic topic and does not even constitute an article. My vote remains to delete. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 00:59, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, it turns out that there are five more games announced. This article is no longer speculation, if it ever was. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 21:48, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
