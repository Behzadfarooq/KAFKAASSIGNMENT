<p>The result was <b>KEEP</b>. This was just nominated in October and shouldn't have been nominated again, but it passes again anyway.

<li><b>Delete</b>. In the previous discussion, the issue of being a restatement of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">List of airports</a> never came up, and the arguments for keeping were mostly "Look at these other things!"

<li>Actually it did come up. It is not a restatement of the list of airports, since that list (supposedly) has every airport in the world. This is intended to show only those which have commercial service, and it serves both as a list and as a guideline for how to list airports in other destination lists. There is a discussion on moving it to project namespace. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 20:01, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Fails to point out the policy it does not follow which is requried as a second nomination. Also the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">List of airports</a> was disucssed in the previous nomination. Anyone voting delete should first read the previous discussion and address the keep reasons there before voting delete. From my first comments <i>A category is not a list and a list is not a category. The article serves several purposes. One is a list of airports that have had commerical service and not all airports. This is covered in the intro. The other is a source for listing an airport in other articles. Because of location and naming issues, it is not possible to create a guideline that covers this. So this list functions a source for this information. It also serves as a common point on the location of an airport in other destination articles. The order in this article is still being adjusted after several months of discussion as consensus is achieved. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 06:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC).</i> Issues raised during the first discussion about size are being worked on but it takes time to set this up and achieve consensus. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 20:14, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>; this was just proposed and rejected <i>two weeks ago</i>, and pretty much every substantive issue came up in that AfD. Again, I'd urge renaming to List of cities with commercial airline service or List of airports with commercial airline service, probably the former. This is not at all synonymous with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">List of airports</a>; only a small subset of airports have airline service. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 21:54, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - a meaningless list, and one which is unmaintainable. It's hard enough to keep per-airport and per-airline lists up-to-date.

<dd>As I mentioned in the first discussion, it's easy to maintain, since airports aren't constantly shifting back-and-forth from having and not having commercial service. It's much more difficult to maintain the individual lists within the airports, but few have argued that those should be removed. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 00:48, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> per VegasWikikian, this was only afd'ed a few weeks ago. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">Arnzy</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arnzy_0c85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arnzy">contribs</a>) 00:51, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep... pretty weak, but still a KEEP</b> -- There's a few concerns I have about this article, now that i look through it, but both Vegaswikian's arguments and a few things stated in the last afd have convinced me to keep it. I'm mostly concerned with the accuracy of the article. It's really a very difficult subject to really keep track of, and it will be very challenging for whomever moderates it to keep it accurate considering destinations are dropped left and right in the worldwide airline industry and in some low profile countries/airflines this may not be known for weeks. Also, the article's a bit large to scan through and comes off as disorganized, but that part can be fixed easily with some work. Still, I do see people coming on here to look for this information... the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">list of airports</a> category and article contains every airport, commercial or not, while this list contains airports with commercial service, something I know is of interest to regular joes, and that itself makes it worth a keep; it's weak one on my part, but I may not change my vote unless something drastic happens. -- <a href="../../../s/m/t/User%7ESmthManly_78cd.html" title="User:SmthManly"><font color="black">SmthManly</font></a> / <sup><a href="../../../s/m/t/User_talk%7ESmthManly_fa27.html" title="User talk:SmthManly"><font color="blue">ManlyTalk</font></a></sup> / <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SmthManly_7bda.html" title="Special:Contributions/SmthManly"><font color="blue">ManlyContribs</font></a></sup> 03:19, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>heh, ironically, firefox froze on me and had a shutdown error when I pressed the back button after posting my vote here because the list was that much of a burden on it.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, wasn't it just a few weeks ago when I saw this on AFD? Useful and encyclopedic list, lists are not categories and vice versa.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This <i>was</i> on AfD recently and the result as of 3-Nov-2006 was to keep it (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Airline_destinations_d0a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Airline destinations">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Airline destinations</a>). As for the argument that it is a "restatement" of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">List of airports</a>: First, that isn't a list at all, it just contains links to other lists such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports_by_IATA_code_f126.html" title="List of airports by IATA code">List of airports by IATA code</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports_by_ICAO_code_7878.html" title="List of airports by ICAO code">List of airports by ICAO code</a> and categories such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_airports_0979.html" title="Category:Lists of airports">Category:Lists of airports</a>. Secondly, many countries do not yet have their own list of airports and the existing lists don't always indicate which airports have scheduled commercial airline service. I might support deleting this at some future date when every country has its own list of airports and those lists indicate which airports have scheduled airline service, but we're not there yet. I agree with the comments about the list being too large - it should be split into smaller lists, probably by continent. - <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxw_6d94.html" title="User:Zyxw">Zyxw</a> 12:46, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
