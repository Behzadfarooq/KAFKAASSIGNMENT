<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. A sentence or two in the campus (or equivalent) article would probably be fine. (Which I have just discocvered is something it already has. Given MediaWiki's case sensitivity problems, I don't think the redirect would be a good idea.) -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:54, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I honestly have no idea how I'm supposed to add to the discussion, so if jsut editing this page was the wrong way, I'd like someone to tell me the right way. It it means anything, receSs is an actual student organization at GWU, as can be seen <a href="http://studentorgs.gwu.edu/merlin-cgi/p/so_printRegisteredOrgDetail/d/462" class="external text" title="http://studentorgs.gwu.edu/merlin-cgi/p/so_printRegisteredOrgDetail/d/462" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The entry in question was written by members of the troupe, so there's no need to fear us accusing wikipedia of slander or spreading false information. At the very least, please wait until after the weekend to decide anything for the page. Because all the members of the troupe are students, we have schoolwork to do during the week, and cannot devote too much time to improving this entry before the weekend.

<li>This is absolutely the right way to add to the discussion. Unfortunately, ReceSs does not seem to have achieved the notoriety necessary for an encyclopedic article that adheres to our policies on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. See also <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> for an idea of how high the bar is set. I assure you that we don't delete articles for being too short or needing improvement, so you don't need to spend so much effort here. If you can think of something that makes ReceSs more notable, such as a national award or media coverage, just add it to the article. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 22:52, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whoa whoa whoa, receSs is one of the oldest college comedy groups in the country. Our alum have gone on to do such things as moving back in with their parents, starring in FedEx commercials, and getting normal jobs with a wife and kids. I think you people are mean.
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry you feel that way. Sometimes in life, you're not going to get what you want; presumably that's one of the lessons you learn in college anyway. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 02:33, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not that the age itself is an issue regarding deletion, of course, but there are certainly older college comedy troupes; offhand I can think of several at my former school, including <a href="http://www.exitplayers.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.exitplayers.com/" rel="nofollow">The Exit Players</a> (1984), <a href="http://www.yale.edu/vq/" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/vq/" rel="nofollow">The Viola Question</a> (1985), <a href="http://www.yale.edu/crayon/" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/crayon/" rel="nofollow">The Purple Crayon</a> (1985), and <a href="http://www.yale.edu/justaddwater/" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/justaddwater/" rel="nofollow">Just Add Water</a> (1986). While they are relatively popular in the amateur comedy scene and have notable alumni, none have Wikipedia articles, and rightfully so, I feel. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 21:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If it makes any difference, I can vouch for receSs' notability. I am a GW student and can say that receSs is a driving force on campus. They consistently make positive contributions to not only the GW community, but the comedy community as a whole on a national level. ReceSs is one of the oldest and most historically rich college comedy groups in the country. It would be a shame to see this article deleted because of lack of notability or importance. They make GW and America laugh, and laughter is the most important thing in life. <small>â€”<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 128.164.102.27 (talk&#160;â€¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.164.102.27_0e88.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.164.102.27">contribs</a>) 23:51, 27 February 2006.</small></li>
<li>In all reality, this group has had several members move on to create their own performance groups, such as the No Time Players, Gibney and Gore, and TJ Miller, all with respective amounts of fame and fortune. However, on the basis of your own guidlines, the sheer volume of shows Recess itself has performed on and off campus greatly exceeds the minimum of "5,000 albums, CDs, or similar recordings (see WikiProject Music's Notability and Music Guidelines)" for musicians. Perhaps if we had each played an instrument during our show we wouldn't be being deleted? At approximately 150 people per Recess show, plus one show each semester at a new Comedy Festival (averaging 300 attendees), plus our current rate of three charity shows per semester (averaging 100 attendees), and seeing as how this marks the fifteenth year Recess has been on campus, this would say that Recess has performed for well over 15000 people. These numbers do not even include the fact that originally Recess performed weekly shows rather than monthly. But if you hold comedy groups to a different standard than such "notable" musicians as Racey, Maldita Vecindad y los Hijos del Quinto Patio, or The Arrows. Haven't heard of them? Me neither. <small>â€”<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Csingel (talk&#160;â€¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csingel_5a43.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csingel">contribs</a>) 12:24, 1 March 2006.</small>
<ul>
<li>1) I don't see Wikipedia articles on No Time Players, Gibney and Gore, or TJ Miller. 2) <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> refers to purchases of released, published material, not exposure at performances. 3) You say "we wouldn't be being deleted". Indeed, you aren't being deleted. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 20:45, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
