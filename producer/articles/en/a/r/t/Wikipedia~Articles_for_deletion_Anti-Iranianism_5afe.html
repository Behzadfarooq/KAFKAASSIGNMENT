<p>This article is, first and foremost, Original Research. It compiles a list of harsh words or negative actions taken towards Persians, the nation of Persia before it became Iran, and the Iranian government and defines them as "anti-Iranianism." There is no question that racial prejudice against Persians or other Iranians exists, and it deserves an article. The problem is that this article lumps several different topics (anti-Persian sentiments in the ancient world, actions taken by governments against historical Persia, disputes between the US and Iran, anti-Persianism in the Arab world) and lumps them under the heading "anti-Iranianism." The term "anti-Iranianism" is a neologism. If you exclude wikipedia forks and websites referencing wikipedia there are only 365 google hits on the phrase "anti-Iranianism" of which only 150 are unique. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=anti-Iranianism+-wikipedia+-site:answers.com+-site:wikipedia.org&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=anti-Iranianism+-wikipedia+-site:answers.com+-site:wikipedia.org&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Anti-Persianism only gets about 200 ghits without wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=KXJ&amp;q=%22anti-persianism%22++-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=KXJ&amp;q=%22anti-persianism%22++-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and "anti-Persian sentiment" only about 40 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22anti-persian+sentiment%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22anti-persian+sentiment%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Only six books in the Google books database contain the words "anti-Iranianism" <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22anti-iranianism%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22anti-iranianism%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and only two scholarly articles use the term. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22anti-iranianism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22anti-iranianism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. By comparison, a well-established concept such as anti-semitism gets over 2 million google results. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Japanese_sentiment_ca49.html" title="Anti-Japanese sentiment">Anti-Japanese sentiment</a> gets 55,000 google hits and 650 google book hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=4ii&amp;q=%22anti-Japanese+sentiment%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=4ii&amp;q=%22anti-Japanese+sentiment%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>Furthermore, the article itself is highly POV. The section on the united states, for example, defines diplomatic actions such as denying visas as anti-Iranianism without any kind of sourcing to suggest that they are. (Not to mention the fact that the content is almost exactly duplicated at <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States-Iran_relations_7086.html" title="United States-Iran relations">United States-Iran relations</a>. It is also highly-POV to lump actions taken against a government together with racism towards an ethnic group (Persians), but this article makes absolutely no distinction between the two. I recently removed a photograph of a US Army poster with the words "IRAN... you're next" and a picture of Uncle Sam holding a wrench from the article. Although presented as an official US Army poster, the image was, of course, ripped off from a WW2 <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Montgomery_Flagg_a87c.html" title="James Montgomery Flagg">James Montgomery Flagg</a> poster which originally referred to Japan. This kind of flagrant POV violation is rampant in this article. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 18:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Only the first of your three links works for me. Yes, there are books that use the phrase "anti-Iranian", but is it "anti-Iranian" in the sense described in this article? If the government of Azerbaijan is politically opposed to the government of Iran is that the same thing as racism against Persians? It is OR to link the two together without a scholarly work doing so. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 18:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To respond to your claim that the article is well-referenced: Yes, there are references that specific events happened. That's irrelevant. There are no references that justify lumping together separate topics (racism towards persians in antiquity, historical disputes between Persia and other countries, disputes between the government of Iran and other countries, anti-Persian sentiment in the Arab world) under the heading of anti-Iranianism. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 21:16, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To respond to your claim that we should keep this article because we have other articles on anti-ethnic terms: This is irrelevant, we are not debating the validity of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Italianism_6e78.html" title="Anti-Italianism">Anti-Italianism</a>. Some of the other anti-ethnic or anti-national articles may be deserving of deletion as well. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 21:16, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep, possibly rename, cleanup</b> - First, a clarification, the term "anti-Iranianism" would refer to the actions taken against the country of Iran or persons of Iranian nationality, but not persons of Persian descent (that's anti-Persianism). I do agree, however, that lumping anti-Iranianism and anti-Persianism together is inappropriate. In response to your criticisms:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> - how so? Please explain (the article provides a great many sources).</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">Non-notability</a> - I don't think the comparison with anti-Semitism is appropriate as I'm sure its use exceeds all other forms of anti-"Group"ism (with the possibly exception of anti-Americanism).</li>
<li>Violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - Even if the article is kept, the section on the US should probably be removed in its entirety and replaced with a brief summary and a link to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States-Iran_relations_7086.html" title="United States-Iran relations">United States-Iran relations</a> article. Moreover, much of the article (excluding the US section) is about anti-Persianism. Perhaps the article would benefit from being renamed to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persianism_890e.html" title="Anti-Persianism">anti-Persianism</a> and edited to reflect this new title. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>OR</b> - The OR comes from taking many separate concepts (anti-Persian sentiments in the ancient world, actions taken against Persia by various governments, actions taken against Iran by various governments, anti-Persian sentiment in the Arab world) and lumping them together under a new concept that is not used by scholars. I agree that an article about racism against Persians is acceptable and I agree that an article on US-Iran relations is acceptable, but putting them all together under what is essentially a neologism is not acceptable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 19:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>So, then, we are (essentially) in agreement (with the possible exception that I still think the article ought to be worked on and not deleted). I think the OR element would be removed if a distinction was drawn between anti-Persianism in reference to the Persian people, anti-Persianism in reference to the Persian government, anti-Iranianism in reference to the Iranian people, and anti-Iranianism in reference to the Iranian government. In order to fit with the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Turkism_482a.html" title="Anti-Turkism">Anti-Turkism</a>, etc. articles, the article should include only anti-Persianism and anti-Iranianism against the Persian and Iranian peoples, respectively. Although the two groups are not the same, I think the fact that many (including most Westerners) equate the two groups justifies their inclusion in one article at least for now (ideally, they would be separate articles about hostility to Persian ethnics and Iranian nationals). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:17, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think I could support keeping parts of the article if it was called something like Racial prejudice against Persians and Iranians and only dealt with that topic. The problem is that the events and quotes in this article are generally cited, but I don't see a source that really defines the concept of anti-Iranianism or anti-Persianism and gives its history. In the case of prejudice against minorities in the west and even in the ancient world, there are many notable historical works that identify what the prejudice is, how it is defined, what its history is, etc. Those works can then be debated by other scholars. In this case we're doing that work ourselves and that is OR. If the article is rewritten so that it is based on scholarly work about anti-Persianism and not an original synthesis of historical events that identifies people as anti-Persian than the article is okay. Otherwise, I think we're outside the domain of an encyclopedia. Regardless, the political stuff (Bush Sr. not apologizing for shooting down a plane, the US denying visas, a legal dispute about Persian antiquities, etc. etc.) must be removed from this article. It is highly, highly POV. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 19:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I posted in response to your unrevised comment. I do agree that most of the political section should be removed (in fact, I will take a look right after I submit this comment). I am not really familiar with the scholarly dialogue and can therefore suggest this: <i>Delete the blatantly POV sections and cleanup the remainder of the article through a discussion on the talk page. If after some time these issues have not been resolved <b>and constructive dialogue on the talk page has ceased</b>, nominate the article for AfD once more.</i> What do you think? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This would be an acceptable solution for me. Particularly controversial cases could be discussed on the article's talk page. However, the cleanup needs to be done carefully. For example, Russian occupation of Persian territories is really not anti-Persianism. However, other cases should be kept (or at least discussed). For example, the photo with the poster stating "Deport all Iranians" or a statement like "Nuke Iran" are aimed at both the state and the people. I think such cases should be included (but again, this is a matter for the talk page). So, (assuming, of course, you and the remaining contributors to this AfD agree) how do we go about doing this? I don't know if it's proper Wikiquette to rename/hugely modify a page during an AfD (although if it survives completely unchanged, I will be <a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7EBe_bold_9c56.html" title="WP:Be bold">bold</a> and do it myself). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:48, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, maybe the current title should be kept and a statement added at the beginning about what the article will and will not include. I'm not opposed to renaming if a good (and ideally 'shortish') title can be found. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:48, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Notability</b> Even without the comparison to anti-semitism, you would expect that the topic of a wikipedia article would be, especially one as controversial as this, would generate some scholarly interest and discussion.

<li>By the way, by cleanup I mean deleting at least 2/3 of the article.

<li>I realize that every action has not been listed; I was trying to make a point. I do agree that anti-Iranianism and anti-Persianism exists (see my comments above, including the example on "Nuke Iran"), but think the article should address them in the context of hostility to the Iranian and Persian peoples, and not the Iranian and Persian governments. Also, whereas "Fuck the Jews" is anti-Semitic, "fuck Israel" is not (at least not necessarily). Likewise, "fuck Iranians" is anti-Iranian (people) whereas "fuck Iran" is not (at least not necessarily). I still favor <i>keep and cleanup</i>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:57, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I disagree with your second point that any criticism of Jews would be included on wikipedia. We do have notability standards and I would be absolutely opposed to including a discussion of non-notable idiot attack websites on wikipedia. Notable anti-semitism should be discussed, but nukeiran.com has an alexa rank of about 3,000,000. Perhaps there's a larger point here. If the best examples of anti-Iranianism you can come up with are a couple of non-notable webpostings, should we really have a 90k article on the topic? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 20:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also note that while I do think the topic is encyclopedia-worthy (and should be kept), much of it currently reads like History of hostile interactions between Iran and other states. Anti-Iranianism against the Iranian state is <i>also</i> very real, but that should belong in the individual country relations articles (US-Iran, Iraq-Iran, Russia-Iran, etc.). I don't believe the content of the article is useless or bad (in fact, I think they are quite well-sourced and should be available on other pages on WP); just that it is inappropriate to put it all together and <i>especially</i> to put it under this title. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:28, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong and Speedy keep</b>. First, I think the proposing of deletion of this article is highly politically motivated. Secondly, <u>"Persia" IS Iran</u>: It is the official name of the country prior to 1935. Thirdly, calling the article things like "POV fork", "soapbox", or "neogism" is completely unfounded; that's the very reason why nearly <b>100</b> sources are given to back up every inch of the article. And finally, <b>Google is not a scholarly or scientific measure of what does and what does not exist, by any means</b>. Google only quantifies the number of links to a page by other <u>ranked</u> websites, mostly commercial. Take for example the article <a href="../../../z/a/y/Zayandeh_Rud_civilization_5403.html" title="Zayandeh Rud civilization">Zayandeh Rud civilization</a>. It exists NOWHERE on google, except for WP and the links given there. So does it not exist? In fact it does. Similar here.

<dd>My point is that nobody is saying that there is no animosity towards Iranians in the world.

<dd><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a>, I do not think this was a bad-faith nomination or constitutes "bigoted attacks towards our ethnic and national background". It has been noted many times above that Iranians and Persians are distinct groups (including by the nominator--see the first thread I started). I do not perceive <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a>'s concern with the article to be that it is about a non-existent topic, but rather that it conflates hostility against the Persian/Iranian states with hostility against the Persian/Iranian peoples. I believe the article should be <b>kept</b> and anything addressing only anti-state sentiments removed (not discarded; possibly merged to individual Country-Iran relations pages). Anti-Iranianism, as it refers to the state, <i>is</i> a real phenomenon, but it can be convered in the articles for US-Iran, Iraq-Iran, Israel-Iran, Turkey-Iran, etc. relations.

<dd>I've addressed that argument above. Yes, the actual incidents in the article are referenced, what is not referenced is a reliable source that defines those incidents as anti-iranianism, or a source that defines anti-iranianism in the first place. Wikipedia cannot combine racist quotes about Persians with political statements by world leaders about Iran's actions under the heading of "anti-Iranianism" without a source that identifies that action as equivalent to racism against Iranians. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 21:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree with you in spirit, but in action sorting out the bit about neg sentiments against the peoples vs gov'ts would be very difficult if not impossible and would involve a lot of OR. The first photo (70's us protestor), for instance, where would that fall? I'd wager many would say it was evidence of anti-Iranian-people sentiment in the US, but I think it was more of a protest (albiet a ridiculoulsy stupid one) against the Iranian gov't actions against Americans in that country. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 22:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, I think that that is something that could be resolved on the talk page. I personally favor including it due to the text of the poster: "Deport all <i>Iranians</i>", even though I completely agree with you as to its actual sentiment. True, the problem is compounded by the fact that sentiments often transfer from a regime to its people, but again I think that a solution could be reached on the article's talk page. As for the remainder of the article, I believe the <i>absolute majority</i> does not belong -- I have said above that it reads like a political history of Iran's negative interactions with other states. I have made the following suggestion to the nominator and he has said he is thinking it over: <i>Delete the blatantly POV and other irrelevant sections and cleanup the remainder of the article through a discussion on the talk page.

<li>I agree that the current article is POV, but only because it conflates hostility against the Iranian people with hostility against the Iranian government--this can be removed from the article. Also, while I support creating two separate pages for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persianism_890e.html" title="Anti-Persianism">Anti-Persianism</a>, I don't think that is practical at this time. I see nothing wrong with including them in the same article, as long as they are treated separately in the article (and this separation is explicit), especially since many (in Europe and North America, at least) fail to realize there is a difference between the two groups. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To respond to your comment that "though I do agree with your criticism of the article and the need to drastically change it, I would also like to note that it's going to be rather hard to improve if it's gone." There's no reason to assume that just because an article is deleted through AfD the topic won't be covered by wikipedia. To give a recent example, after I nominated [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_killed%2C_threatened_or_kidnapped_Iraqi_academics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_killed%2C_threatened_or_kidnapped_Iraqi_academics" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>] I created a short article to deal with the topic at <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence_against_academics_in_post-invasion_Iraq_7d72.html" title="Violence against academics in post-invasion Iraq">Violence against academics in post-invasion Iraq</a>. I would advise waiting a couple of days before doing that in this case because this debate has really just begun. I would also advise basing a new article on works by professional historians rather than just copying the current original synthesis. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 23:41, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Don't you think it would be simpler working with this (well-referenced) article as a starting point? People know where it is, it has (if not before then now for sure) attracted a great deal of attention and potential contributors, etc. And yes, I do intend to wait at least until this AfD is closed before I seriously think about starting a new article (e.g., by researching the topic). Essentially, I do think that this current version of the article should go, but I don't think all of the content should be lost. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Here are the sections I propose to delete in their entirety:
<ol>
<li>"The Mongolian era" – the Mongolians treated everybody horribly (no special sentiments proven/sourced)</li>
<li>"By colonial powers" – purely political history (no hostile sentiments proven/sourced)</li>
<li>"By the United States" – same as above</li>
<li>"By the media" – single quote, probably applies to Iranian regime</li>
<li>"Against Iranian scientists" - mostly political actions against Iran itself</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>What is left is the section on the ancient Greeks, (possibly, as I haven’t read the external article) the Turks, and the Arabs. These sections do, of course, need to be revised, but at least all of them directly address hostile sentiments held against Persian and Iranian peoples. The missing US section is significant, but it can be added from scratch (encompassing present anti-Iranianism and such sentiments during the hostage crisis).

One of Saddam's ministor and former government of Baghdad said: <i>Ajam (Iranians/Persians) are animals that God created in the shape of Humans</i>. Also he further said: <i>Jews are a</i> mixture of the dirt and leftover of diverse people<i>. If anyone is offended, I apologize, but I wanted to mention the seriousness of the issue. Note just like the idiot Ahmadinezhad recently made some anti-semitic statements which have been condemned by Iranian intellectuals, there have been people and dynasties (like the Ummayads) who actively discriminated against Iranians. Note the chemical use of weapons by Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war against Iranian civilians. And here is a source from Cambridge university which is legitimate and uses the term:</i> The Barkamids probably favoured some Zoroastrian officials like Banu Sahl and opposed anti-Iranian officials like Muhammad b.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I read the comments. All questions have been answered properly. The article has to be kept obviously and improved further. It is neither OR nor POV fork. It is not "Neologism" either. Calling this, neologism is itself POV fork. Wikipedia is not a dictionary of English language. Many of the titles that we have in wikipedia have no equivalent in non-western languages, simply because the issues are not relevant to those cultures. The reverse is also true. Anti-Iranism and other recisms like anti-arabs, anti-armenians etc exist both in real life and in the literature of those involved. Let me inform you that the word Holocaust did not exist in Persian literature until one and a half years ago (before the new president got the office). Do you think we should not have a page on holocaust in Persian wikipedia? Are persian wikipedians allowed to call it Neologism? I have noticed that some voted for "delete" arguing that they are against all "Anti-X'ism" articles. This argument is practically useless and irrelevant to our discussion here on this particular page. About anti-Iranianism in the US, the subject will be improved as time passes.

<li><b>Delete</b> First, the article muddles two things: international relations (political actions against the Iranian state) and racism. Personally, I think either one could be an appropriate topic for an article or part of an article, but not in this totally muddled form. Second, the article seems to me to be entirely original research. It might be interesting to have an article on divisions in Islam, whcih could include not only conflicts between Sunni and Shi'a, but also conflicts between competing national centers of power, and then, in another article on Iranian history, discuss Iran's conflicts with its historical neighbors as well as conflicts arising from European colonialism and then the Cold War ... I suspect much of what people wish were of value in this article could be accommodated by those two articles, each of which would provide more clarity and effective contextualization. Even so, contributors woul dhave to be more familiar with our NPOV and especially NOR policies. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:36, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> "Being original research or not" has nothing to do with our personal opinion. If some thing have been researched before it is no longer an original research. This article is not about Iran-US relations and the conflicts between these two countries. There are other articles covering it. If US president insult Iranian president, we will not cover it here. If US wants to attack a nuclear site in Iran, we will not cover it here. But when it comes to "prejustice" and "insulting" and "treating all Iranians the same way" then this article is a place for that. Racism and politics are not separate from eachother. There were lots of politics around Holocaust, Armenian genocide, and anti-Iranianism by Arabs. It is meaningless to separate policical manifestaion of racism from racism. I have to emphasize that Iran-Setizi or whatever you want to call it, has more 1000 years of continuous history. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 13:01, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why does it violate NOR, when there are review articles on the subject in Persian? One can not say some thing is not OR because there is no proper review article on the subject in X-language.

<dd>First of all, you are wrong about the article not being muddled, not muddling international relations with racism. The article is muddled. It does include much material on foreign relations anti-Iranianism, which is not racism. For example, contrary to your initial comment, the first quote (which comes from an apparently authorless and unpublished paper which may or may not constitute a valid source) refers not to racism but to US foreign policy - precisely what you said the article is <i>not</i> about. The anti-Iranianism in Vali Nasr's article is about Iraqui foreign policy - again, international relations, not racism. The section on the Greeks and Romans makes irrelevant remarks (th eentire last paragraph) and has no citations. I am not going to go on - virtually the entire article is about international relations and not racism, despite your protestations, and it includes unsourced or primary material, or inappropriate source (Edward Teller?) The Nelson frye quote concerning Arabs is more a statement of Arab ignorance than racism; the use of a dictionary definition to establish racism is clearly a violation of NOR because it is using a primary source to make a synthetic statement. Anti-Iranianism in early Islam is again about international relations (competition between different states for political power) and not racism. Changing the names of places from one language to another is not racism. The quote from From The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries is also original resource because a quote is taken out of context, put into another context to make a point the quote itself does not make. The section, Ali vs. Umar ibn al-Khattab, also seems to rely on primary sources. And so on, and so on. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not true. I never claimed that this article has a high quality. I only said racism will become important when it is put into practice by politicians. So political manifestaion of racism and racism need to be covered together. That's all what I said. We all know that people of any two country in Europe or Asia may make joke about each other. This is not important but when these ideas are put into practice and real life by politicians then it will become important. About Iranian-Arab relation which has been studied alot, I have to say that: There exists a racism and it was a driver for wars. Have you heard about Saddam last words about Persians? He wanted to clear the earth from Persians even in his last minutes of life! This is not politics or "international relation"! This is racist ideology. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 13:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It might be helpful to offer an example here. In wikipedia, Iranian president Ahmadinejad is considered racist. One can easily use your arguments and say all his remarks are about politics and international relation. But this argument can not succeed as our experience shows. Ahmadinejad even clearly rejected allegation of racism in one of his speech. But he is considered a racist by the public. And it is acceptible in wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 14:12, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

First, the title does not represent the contents. Second, there is a high potential to mix up racisism against the Iranian people with criticism of the Iranian gov't policies.

<p><b>Keep</b> This article should be kept for several important reasons. I will start off by addressing the arguments already made on this page (i.e. by user GabrielF). The section on the U.S. must be improved, but it should definitely remain. This is because a great deal of Anti-Iranianism exist in the United States. It is common knowledge that this was the case in the late 70's and early 80's because of the Hostage Crisis. In fact, the United States has been involved in Anti-Iranianism is many other cases. The article covers this a bit superficially and with a bit of POV, but this can be improved. I disagree with GabrielF that countries that are against the Iranian government aren't necessarily against Iranians. This is a distinction without a difference. Although there are many dissidents who oppose the government of Iran, we cannot say that the Islamic Republic is not a representation of most Iranians. Imagine a country being Anti-Israel without being Anti-Semitic. I must further disagree with GabrielF when he says "The problem is that this article lumps several different topics (anti-Persian sentiments in the ancient world, actions taken by governments against historical Persia, disputes between the US and Iran, anti-Persianism in the Arab world) and lumps them under the heading 'anti-Iranianism.'" An understanding of the divide between East and West is necessary to understand why Anti-Iranianism in the ancient world is directly related to Anti-Iranianism in the modern world. Greek and Roman literature has contribited to Anti-Iranian sentiment in the modern West. This is discussed in the book <i>Persian Fire</i>. Also, the reason that anti-Persian sentiments in the ancient world, actions taken by governments against historical Persia, disputes between the US and Iran, anti-Persianism in the Arab world are "lumped" into Anti-Iranianism is that they are all forms of it. Take the article on antisemitism for example, it discusses antisemitism in the ancient world and in the modern world. It "lumps" antisemitism by Arabs and by Americans under the title anti-semitism. This is the case with this article. Even though anti-semitism by Arabs and Americans are very different and for different reasons, they are still antisemitism and should be included in that article. As the sections on Anti-Iranianism by different countries grows, they will have their own articles. GabrielF concedes that Anti-Iranianism exist: "There is no question that racial prejudice against Persians or other Iranians exists, and it deserves an article." This article must be improved, not deleted. It is true that there are many problems with this article, but they should be addressed in its talk page. Furthermore, the article has greatly improved since the posting of this AfD, and many points have been addressed (i.e. referencing sources). GabrielF says that there are too few returns for the google search of Anti-Iranianism. But he does not elaborate why it is too few. I believe it is quite sufficient and only proves the point that this article should remain (i.e. scholarly books use the word Anti-Iranianism). The point has already been addressed that there are article on anti-ethnic and anti-national terms. This is significant because it shows precedent, a major theme in Wikipedia. In conclusion, there is no doubt that there should be an article on Anti-Iranianism, and this article is not only salvageable but quite sufficient as a starting point. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 22:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</p>

<dd>I should say this article not only has so many reliable citations but its notation with the name of Anti-Iranianism that is criticised not to have enough sources is unaccepted too. because the words about Iran have mostly been Translated from Persian and the translation has been different and I think the current translation is the best and says the meaning better as "Xisms" is translated extremely different . and I apreciate <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">User:Zereshk</a>'s added section (usage) that shows the accuracy of the article better. According to its use and this article's renaming mustn't occur becuase the titles discussed in do not qualify that name. For this claim you should be more familiar to Persian literature and Iran history to understand how different the Mongols where to Iran rather than the others. Not only their behaviour to Iran and their destruction is suggestive of this fact but continual centeral Asian People attack to Iran is another evidence for their Anti-Iranian policies(If can be said policy). As the mongols' army where mostly Centeral Asian people.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Deleting such an article, filled with numerous legitimate sources, is not the answer. The topic of the article is absolutely valid. Any issues concerning POV (of which I personally don't see much in the way of problems within the article) or information that pertains more to the government rather than issues of prejudice and so forth can be worked out on the talk page. But there is literally no justification for deleting this article, nor is there any Wikipedia policy that would support such a deletion.

Prejudice and discrimination should be denied, minimized, or ignored, especially in light of our post-9/11 world. The fact that certain editors would rather delete the entire article rather than work towards consensus on its talk page (as far as inclusion of information), speaks volumes.

<li>It think you're missing the point of this AfD. According to the writer of the article, Zereshk,: "Anti-Iranianism refers to any act act that causes the vast mass suffering of any entity affiliated with Iran." (quote is on the article talk page). That's the problem - this ISN'T an article about racism towards Iranians, its an article about everything anybody ever did that hurt Iran, whether those actions were caused by racial or ethnic prejudice is irrelevant as far as the article is concerned. Quite frankly, this article is a disservice to people who want to combat racism against Iranians because it devalues real racism by effectively calling everything anybody ever did that hurt Iran racist, even if the motivation was purely political or economic. When somebody says that everything anybody ever did that hurt them was racist, than people who might otherwise be sympathetic to combatting racism are going to be less likely to listen when real prejudice occurs. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 03:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The Neutral Point of View policy has nothing to do with demanding some sort of "balancing of perspective" to Wikipedia-- it's about making sure that articles <i>themselves</i> are non-biased.

I suggest incorporating them into the article once a consensus is reached about what content the article should or should not contain (these links reference the type of anti-Iranianism that should be included in any case: animosity. against the Iranian people). <small><b>Note:</b> I am posting them here instead of the talk page because there is more discussion here than on the talk page (at least for now) and because the whole point becomes rather moot if the article is deleted.</small> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- may I also suggest turning to scholarly literature on Iranian-American communities abroad as a source of information about anti-Iranian/Persian sentiment (or the lack thereof) in particular countries or regions. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think this may have promise. See, for instance, an article by Fawaz A. Gerges in <i>The Journal of Palestine Studies</i> titled "Islam and Muslims in the Mind of America: Influences on the Making of U. S. Policy" <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0377-919X%28199724%2926%3A2%3C68%3AIAMITM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0377-919X%28199724%2926%3A2%3C68%3AIAMITM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> (unfortunately it's not free-access). Still, there is a section on the effect the 1979 hostage crisis had on American feelings toward Muslims in general (inclusive of course of Iranians). A quote: in a 1981 poll of Americans, "50 percent of the respondents described 'all' or 'most' Muslims as 'warlike and bloodthirsty'". I think scholarly work of this type can go a long way toward improving the quality of the article, once consensus has been reached, of course. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:28, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete:</b> This topic may warrant an article in Wikipedia, but certainly not in its existing format. It reads as a polemic that conflates all instances of hostility towards Persia/Iran the state as somehow being a form of discrimination. There is no treatment of (very real) ethnic hatred and condescension towards Iranians within Imperial Russia, while Russian territorial aggression is supposedly passed off as being an example of ethnic hatred?! Russia expanded because it wished to become more powerful. It expanded into Iranian territory because Iran at the time was weak and an easy target. That's only one example from a long list of fallacious assertions in this article. If we are to keep this article, we should start over from scratch with a coherent and limiting definition of what Anti-Iranianism (awkward term in my opinion) actually is. I would suggest: statements or beliefs regarding the cultural or ethnic inferiority of Iranians and actions taken based upon such beliefs. To include an action in this category, therefore, it would have to be demonstrable that it took place because of a belief in cultural/ethnic inferiority of Iranians. Moreover, the link between actions and beliefs would need to be established AND generally uncontroversial within the scholarly literature. This task is far from impossible; salvaging this article based on its present content is, however, impossible.</li>

<dd>I don't believe that this article is being nominated for deletion because of a desire to stifle discussion of this topic. I believe it is nominated for deletion because it is 1. presented in an unencyclopedic, unscientific, and unprofessional manner and 2. about a english term which neither exists in the popular consciousness nor is widespread in academic literature. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreemother199_9604.html" title="User:Treemother199">Treemother199</a> 05:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I agree with most of what you say above except the last part. I don't think "salvaging this article based on its present content is ... impossible" -- it simply requires a great amount of content to be deleted--there has been quite a bit of progress in this respect over the past two days. Also, in response to the reasons for deletion: (1) "unencyclopedic, unscientific, and unprofessional" -- I think you are being a bit too harsh; in any case, this can be corrected by editing/improving the article based on consensus reached on the talk page. (2) The article could (I believe should) be renamed (or moved) to "anti-Iranian sentiments"--this would no longer be a neologism. Overall, I think this AfD has been positive for the article as it has been improved quite a bit (although it still needs a lot of work) and, more importantly, the major contributors have begun discussing on the talk page and on various user pages to establish consensus as to the future direction of the article and to address criticisms raised in the AfD. The thing is: it will require time to improve an article of this size--time which the 5-day limit of the AfD simply does not allow. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 05:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I looked back over the very long article, and the only information that I think exists that would be relevant for an "anti-Iranian Sentiments" article is the section dealing with toponymic changes to eradicate Persian names. But that information should be condensed dramatically--I think its length is unwarranted. And more space should be devoted to a coherent explanation of why this activity constitutes ant-Iranian sentiment, rather than to listing empirical evidence of a phenomenon which has many potential causes. Quite frankly, I don't see a use to the rest of the very long list of examples for which relevance is not explained. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreemother199_9604.html" title="User:Treemother199">Treemother199</a> 05:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What about the sections noting "in the Greek of this period 'barbarian' is often used expressly to mean Persian" or "Be watchful of Iranian Muslims and never treat them as equals of Arabs"? I do agree that much of the content should be removed as unrelated to "anti-Iranian sentiment", but large parts of the Greek and Arab sections (and small parts of other sections except the Mongols, colonial powers, and the US--I think these three sections should go altogether) should be kept (and possibly the pan-Turkist section as well--I have not read the cited article, so I cannot comment). I do hope that the contributors take to heart the call to devote more space to providing "a coherent explanation of why this activity constitutes ant-Iranian sentiment" <i>based in reliable sources</i>, of course. I think efforts so far to improve the article are promising and that it should be kept so that these efforts can continue. If, after a real effort to improve based on consensus achieved at the talk page, the article still falls short of Wikipedia standards, I will re-nominate it for deletion myself. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
