<li>I added the page because I found articles for <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bern_Switzerland_Temple_a695.html" title="Bern Switzerland Temple">Bern Switzerland Temple</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Illinois_Temple_e662.html" title="Chicago Illinois Temple">Chicago Illinois Temple</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freiberg_Germany_Temple_391b.html" title="Freiberg Germany Temple">Freiberg Germany Temple</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/n/Kona_Hawaii_Temple_8de4.html" title="Kona Hawaii Temple">Kona Hawaii Temple</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laie_Hawaii_Temple_ce85.html" title="Laie Hawaii Temple">Laie Hawaii Temple</a> and about 8 others. There are basically a smattering of random articles on about 10 of the 120 operating temples out there, and no comprehensive List Of article anywhere. I initially made the article to be a list of the temples that could link to other Wikipedia articles, but saw that with just a little effort I could make external links to the LDS pages. Please don't interpret it as a dump of an LDS page, it is meant to be a foundation for a Wikipedia article that links to richer Wiki articles on each temple. It needs to be expanded. I think that the external links add value, but agree that at the core the page needs to point to Wikipedia articles. Maybe a table with the external link and with the Wiki link. I haven't done tables though, I spent an hour on it as it was, and I thought that it could be done later. If you delete this, I think that this article will eventually be created. <a href="../../../b/h/l/User%7EBhludzin_20c6.html" title="User:Bhludzin">Bhludzin</a> 04:15, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is already a category: Category:Latter Day Saint temples.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is a legitimate topic for a list, and the chronological order makes it useful in a way that a category couldn't be, but is now a directory of external links, which (as already pointed out) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is something Wikipedia pages are not supposed to be</a>.

You can't just cut and paste material from other web-sites into Wikipedia!!! Also, I doubt Wikipedia should be a repository of directories. We wouldn't want to see a list of all the Walmart stores on here (temples to consumerism), or a list of all gyms (temples to fitness), or a list of all the streets of the world (the paths to all temples). But links to websites that provide them would be more appropriate, if in context for the article(s) those links appear in. Provide a link to the external site that presents the list in question, and remove the list itself from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 12:07, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think a simple list like this can be copyrightable. There is also an obvious difference between important religious sanctuaries and Walmart stores. As far as I understand, only the most central Mormon sanctuaries are called "temples", which is why there is in many cases only one in each country. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 12:19, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Facts are not copyrightable. Additionally, the organization has subtle but significant differences to the presentation on the cited page. <a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>•<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#F0F">talk</font></a> 11:23, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OK - I updated the page so that it's a table with the Wiki links and I added the Temple's current status. As a future update I want to add the construction style/type as a column. If this is acceptable, please remove the AfD status. If not, let me know why. <a href="../../../b/h/l/User%7EBhludzin_20c6.html" title="User:Bhludzin">Bhludzin</a> 16:47, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> is this list comparable to a list of Christian Churches, or more akin to a list of Christian Cathedrals? I ask cos I seem to think that lists of churches are discouraged unless the church itself is notable for something or another. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 17:24, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This would be more akin to a list of cathedrals than a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ottawa_churches_755b.html" title="List of Ottawa churches">List of Ottawa churches</a>. There are about 145 LDS temples currently operating or announced; this list up for deletion is missing the newest to be announced. I didn't count, but there is roughly the same number as on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buddhist_temples_7f2d.html" title="List of Buddhist temples">List of Buddhist temples</a> article. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 17:37, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There are a number of notable stories for each temple, which make it more than just a list of buildings. There are the stories of miraculous events at the dedication of the Kirtland, Nauvoo and Salt Lake temples, Wilford Woodruff said he met with the signers of the Declaration of Independence in one, Lorenzo Snow said he met the Savior in another, plus probably thousands of journal accounts from less prominent people - I am assuming that there will eventually be Wikipedia articles for all of the temples listed. <a href="../../../b/h/l/User%7EBhludzin_20c6.html" title="User:Bhludzin">Bhludzin</a> 18:25, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was answering the question as to scope; roughly how common temples are. Hopefully, there will be enough information about each of the temples, in the future. But for this vote, we will have to consider the fifteen articles about temples that already exist. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 18:36, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> with requested clean-ups. I think that people will want information on LDS temples, in chronological order. If this list isn't kept, then (as unothodox as this may be on Wikipedia) I think that a single link to one or two such a lists should be included on the Category:Latter Day Saint temples page. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 17:37, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>All right, I removed all red links, and added square feet. I want to keep the official LDS links because they link to the church page with the current temple hours, phone number, etc. I want to add architectural style as a column in the table, but please give me a break! I have frantically spent about 5 or 6 hours on this page in the last day trying to keep it from being deleted. Please spare it so that I can have a break and come back and do the architectural style information in several days (I do have a life outside of this). I also intend to start doing Wikipedia temple pages, where I can add Mormon historical events relevant to each temple (unless of course I have to frantically fight to keep each one from being deleted). This will also clean up some of the temple red links in the Mormonism articles in general.<a href="../../../b/h/l/User%7EBhludzin_20c6.html" title="User:Bhludzin">Bhludzin</a> 02:02, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I want to do the Temple articles. I think it seems natural to have a list that indexes and links to them. But, (correct me if I'm wrong) if the list includes external links then the list must be deleted? The external links supplement the list with "live" information. If this is the approach taken, then after I did articles on all 120+ temples, I would be allowed to create the list to link to them? <a href="../../../b/h/l/User%7EBhludzin_20c6.html" title="User:Bhludzin">Bhludzin</a> 04:16, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>KEEP</i> but <i>Merge</i> with some material from <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_%28Mormonism%29_097c.html" title="Temple (Mormonism)">Temple (Mormonism)</a> about temple construction and history into either article. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 06:26, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a useful list with the dates and other stats. I was just wondering if there was a list for this; it's much more useful than categories, and it can be a complete list, unlike many that we maintain. Merging with the general article on Mormon temples would overwhelm that article, which is meant to describe temples for the entire movement as opposed to a list of buildings for the LDS Church in particular. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <font color="purple"><i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i></font> 08:47, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I removed the "list of links" nature of this page - and updated the table in a few other ways. I also added wikisectioning so that individual rows with specific temple information can be individually edited and directly linked. I suggest that these changes address the concerns of the nom. Agree with Cool Hand re merging with general temples page - additional useful columns could be added such as number of Ordination rooms, number of Sealing rooms, existence of visitors center, existence of Holy of Holies, etc. <a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>•<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#F0F">talk</font></a> 10:55, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
