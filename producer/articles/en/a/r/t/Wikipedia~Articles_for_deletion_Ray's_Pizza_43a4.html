<p>Is there a purpose to this page? I could see so if they were all a part of one particular company as franchises, but as the article reads, it's just a coincidence.

<li><strike>Hi Wikipedia, I wrote the article. Not to be rude, but why did you call my article "nonsense" and "speedy" delete it earlier? I looked at the procedures for deleting and I don't think my article is "nonsense." Frankly, if you're going to insult articles people write and blank them out immediately, I think your attitude to contributors is awful. And if you don't live in New York--which you obviously don't--you don't have any right to decide whether an article about Ray's Pizza is nonsense. Oh well, off my soapbox for now... Thanks for reading.</strike></li>

<li>No, I didn't touch your Kennedy Fried Chicken article. And insults aren't going to get anywhere. The point I am trying to make is that if you are talking about one particular chain of Ray's Pizza, that would be a case. But you're talking about <i>several</i> Ray's Pizza, not a particular chain. Yes, there's is Tommy's in LA, just as the article states. But being from LA myself, I know of at least fourteen other non-related burger joints in LA by the same name and have nothing to do with the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy%27s.html" title="Tommy's">Tommy's</a> of that regard. Doing an article on one particular chain is fine, but what is the purpose of doing an article on a bunch of restaurants in the area whose only link is that they have the same name? It's not a single particular company you're talking about, it's a single coincidence. If there's a Ray's Pizza company that owns 17 restaurants in NYC, that's Wikiworthy, IMHO. But if there just happens to be seventeen unrelated Ray's Pizza places that just happen to have similar names, that's one for the phone books, not Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 04:08, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>What's notable is the confusion surrounding Ray's Pizzas and their relation to one another, which has bitten many a newcomer to the city. And the so-called justification "NONSENSE" for deleting my article is simply a lie, and insulting to boot. Just because you don't know what an article is referring to doesn't make it NONSENSE.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b>!!! not to support the above tone of whoever wrote the article, but "Ray's Pizza", as a <i>concept</i>, is a VERY important NYC establishment that deserves to be here, regardless of who owns them and despite the controversy. they really really are on every block. On <i>the Daily Show</i> someone once told jon stewart that she lived "by the starbucks," and his instant response was "that's like saying you live by the Ray's!!" "Ray's" as a whole, not the first one, not the legal battle, not the one company that owns seventeen, but the concept, the Ray's on Every Corner. It's that sort of place, something that is inextricably linked with the very idea of pizza- and just as strongly, the city itself- for virtually anyone who lives in the city. It is absolutely notable, not in any way equivalent to some 15 year old kid's garage band or someone promoting his copyright on "Joe's Diner". The world is a big place, and to the millions living in New York, Ray's is very significant. Most people think of the Statue of Liberty or the empire state building when they think of New York; most people who live there think of Ray's. It is part of home. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> <a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeah_0915.html" title="User talk:Heah">(talk)</a> 10:19, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: The IP who wrote this and who has been storming around screeching insults is one thing, but the article is absolutely a speedy candidate. There is no content. A statement of a negative is not a statement. Please, folks, vote on the article, and not the topic. So, given the long story on this subject on <i>The Next Big Thing</i> radio show (WNYC) in 2002, all we get from this person is "It's not one thing." Gosh. Then the Kennedy's Fried Chicken? Is there only <i>one</i> Kennedy's Fried Chicken in only <i>one</i> city, and are they all subsumed under the same negative? Is Ray's actually significant elsewhere? The story was presented on <i>The Next Big Thing</i> as a minor bit of humor. No content. It should be speedied again, and the yahoo who keeps recreating it is about to get blocked for his actions. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:09, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>(psssst... no threat-like posts...) but I agree about the (non)notability. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 11:21, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No threat. I meant that as a statement of future intent, not a "behave or else." Recreating deleted articles with personal attacks in the edit lines is noxious, vandalizing behavior. (This "IP" seems to know what the deletion logs say. Similarly, this "IP" is simply recreating deleted content rather than using VfU, which is process, while simultaneously pretending to be a newbie who is bitten.) At any rate, folks need to remember that they're being asked to consider the article, and not the topic. The reason is that we end up keeping utter junk that way, as everyone passes the buck onto that imagined future editor who might, someday, write the article that VfD voters imagine is lurking inside the lump of dross before them. If VfD voters want to write the imagined article, then that's fine, but "maybe I think there was a legal case about this once" won't do it, IMO, until that content is actually within the article. We don't need articles saying "The International Home of Pancakes is not IHOP" or "Hojos is not Howard Johnsons" or (and this happens) "X restaurant in Mumbai is a lot like other restaurants, but it's different." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:39, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, but your position of <i>"vote on the article, and not the topic"</i> is out of step with both policy and common voting procedure. Not-so-great articles on decent topics should be expanded, or sent to cleanup or attention, not deleted. Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_policy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">Deletion Policy</a> for explanation, in particular the "Problems that don't require deletion" table. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:34, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, it is in contradiction with neither. Let's put it this way: let's say that our IP friend wrote an article that said "Ashlee Simpson is not Jessica Simpson. She's a skank!" Now, should that be kept? The fact that <i>an</i> article might be written does not mean that a <i>particular article</i> should be kept. In fact, one would wish to scratch the original and not preserve in its history the libel. The guidelines speak of "not so great" articles on good topics, not "weak, useless articles on topics that might, if handled by an expert, be worthwhile." Since deletion guidelines also call for the deletion of non-encyclopedic content and the speedy delete criteria advocate the deletion of articles without content, I'd say that the "send to clean up" option is not appropriate for feeble stubs. Were it to be so, then we would be leaving articles in that say "The apolo missions were really cool they went to the moon" and "Mars is a planet thats red." Finally, that advice is to those who are <i>going to nominate</i> an article for deletion. Once it's on VfD, consider the article, not the topic, unless you are going to rewrite. If you <i>are</i> going to rewrite, please inform the voters, so they can reconsider. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:20, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

I even live across the street from "Famous Original Ray's Pizza Est. 1964" which I know with almost certainty that it is not the original Ray's Pizza, and I've only lived here a year and a half. I came to Wikipedia to see if I could figure out where and when the real original Ray's Pizza was established. This entry is needed so that a part of New York culture can be explained.

<li>not only that, but this CLEARLY should never have been a speedy delete; if i were a newbie and found such an article had been deleted WITHOUT ANY DUE PROCESS i would not go through the VfU- i mean, it was never VOTED for deletion- i would have put it back up. This thread clearly demonstrates both an abuse of speedy delete as well as the negative consequences of overly agressive VfD'ing. I don't know what evidence we have that this ip is not a newbie or is a vandal. The page was deleted CONTRARY to deletion policy, and it seems it will be staying here after all. i don't know how one person (out of 8 billion) can claim to know on their own what qualifies as "nonsense" and what is actually an important meme; i don't know why this kid got attacked, a block threatened, when really, whoever listed it for speedy deletion should be reprimanded and we all should be much kinder and DISCUSS things.

<dd>Sure thing. Shouldn't we're getting such valuable content from this user that I can see why you'd be afraid of biting him. Mean of me to suggest that his vandalism of user pages would lead to a block. Awful, really, to suggest that the non-stop personal attacks in edit summaries might lead to a block. While the pity party rages, ask yourselves what it is that the contributor gave us. Look through the diffs. See how a sentence is so valuable that any amount of whinging, screeching, and paranoia from the user is worth putting up with in order to have. Please. The number of policies violated by this kiddie wiki author is piling up, but none of them should lead to a block, right, so that we can continue to get statements of negatives from this insightful editor? I can only say that I'm relieved that most of the other admins do have standards. Perhaps our IP editor can be such a great guy as to actually get an account now so that we can have a specific identity to deal with, and not just a floating address. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:39, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">User:Heah</a>, you really ought to look through the contributor's contributions. First thing was that I got given credit for speedy deletions of both of his creations, when I had deleted one. So, he called names. Then, however, he recreated instead of VfU. Then someone else did a proper VfD of a substub that stated a negative (so, gosh, it's now a <i>conspiracy</i> against Ray's Pizza and not just me). So, more personal insults. Deleting admin called a "douchebag," then "obviously never been to New York," etc. So, in the face of this childish taunting from the IP, you insist that the deletions were abuses? Those are very serious charges, and I hope that you will open an RfC on both (or perhaps three) of the admins who speedy deleted his articles, as well as the user who tagged his Kennedy's Fried Chicken for speedy deletion, as well, of course, as the person who made this nomination. Otherwise, <i>do not make accusations of such a serious nature.</i> If I am reacting strongly to your gestures, it is because you are attempting to make an amazingly feeble substub a cause for castigating the entire deletion process. I don't consider new IP's who do nothing but scream and insult to be valuable contributors, no. I do not consider single sentences to be articles. I do not consider the deletion of single sentence substubs to be "abuse" (!) as much as propriety. Hideous the way that you are making very, very serious charges in the name of virtuous protection of the poor little IP (who seems to know many profanities but no information). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:00, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>first, if this conversation is continued, i'd lke to request that we continue it on user talk pages as it no longer has anything to do with whether or not this article will be deleted, but first i'm gonna post this. Second, I don't know what the heck you are talking about, geogre. I accused no one of deleting the page originally, as i had no idea who had done it. I already stated above that i thought the comments here from the ip were out of line. However, I have looked at the contributions from this ip and i'm not sure what your problem is. I haven't found the word "douchebag" used by him anywhere, although i very well may have missed it; I didn't see him call you any names on his post on your <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_Talk_archive_7_f861.html#KFC" title="User:Geogre/Talk archive 7">talk page</a>, don't see a problem with his reasoning that if you were from new york you would know why ray's is notable, and think it is somewhat understandable for a newbie to get upset about things like this and react improperly, due both to their ignorance of how to go about things here and the hurt feelings that come with your first foray into something being quashed without discussion. His response was to ask us to please not be jerks, (without calling anyone a jerk), and recreating an article counter to general policy that was deleted with complete disregard for general policy, with edit sumaries along the lines of "i'm having trouble with the deletion process." You have a huge issue with him recreating the article without going through VfU, but i think its very important to note that <i>the article was deleted without going through VfD</i> and the ip was new here. I haven't searched through the history of your talk page, so i may have missed what you are calling his "vandalism". But he certainly wasn't insulting anyone before the article was deleted, and furthermore his vandalism has NOTHING to do with whether or not this article should be here, and whether or not it should have been VfD'ed according to policy. This is very important, so i'm going to say it again, in italics: <i>the actions of this ip after the speedy delete have NOTHING AT ALL to do with whether or not the article should have been speedy deleted.</i></dd>
<dd>I am not attempting to "castigate the deletion process"; rather, i think it is important to <i>use</i> the deletion process. that's why it is here. I am not trying to "make accusations of a serious nature" and don't think an RfC is necessary at this point. I just think that the articles should not have been speedy deleted, whoever did it, and whatever their reasons were; the results of the VfDs, that the article be kept and that the Kennedy article be merged, obviously give my point some creedence. These shouldn't have been speedily deleted.</dd>

<p><b>Comment.</b> Okay, since someone's calling for my head, I should probably explain a few things. For one, prior to nominating for deletion, I did a websearch for relevance. I found none. Whether or not your milage on Google may vary is different. Secondly, the original article was written in such a way that I found it very nonsensical; it was a poor choice of wording and I should have said <i>pointless</i> or <i>irrelevant</i>. As I said above, as the article was originally written, it's like writing on "Tommy's Burgers" in LA if you're referring to every restaurant in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Los_Angeles_area_a039.html" title="Greater Los Angeles area">area</a> with the name and not the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy%27s.html" title="Tommy's">specific company</a> - it's pointless that way (see the "Joe's Diner" comment above). I did not know about it's pop culture importance (because I'm not a TV watcher) and aside from a layover in JFK, I've never been to NYC, so I wouldn't know about it being on every street, much less the legal issues surrounding it. Had the article been in any condition as it is now (or at least given the hint that it was anything beyond a bunch of restaurants that just happen to have the same name), I would have stubbed it, not VFD'd. As it is now, by all means I agree <b>keep</b>, but I made the call I did for the reasons I did. No apologies (except possibly to the original poster if he/she felt I was on some sort of personal vendetta, which was not the case), no regrets. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 20:38, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">User:Mitsukai</a>, you shouldn't have to apologize. Folks coming in late and shedding crocodile tears for the innocence abused of someone who can only manage "Ray's Pizza is not Ray's Pizza" should not be in a position of calling for your head, either. The fact that later editors have made the article worthwhile is good, and they should each be applauded. However, the article as nominated was a speedy deletion candidate and was speedy deleted. I believe that all those folks who rescued this feeble effort should be rewarded, and they should be proud of their names in the edit history to the article. However, I don't see why the original submission needs to be honored in any way whatsoever. A phone book could have suggested the topic, as well as those pop culture shows, as well as the syndicated <i>The Next Big Thing</i> radio show (which contained more information in ten seconds than our contributor could muster). I hope we continue to get good treatments of pop topics, but those who believe that I'm threatening unreasonably or intimidating the trembling virgins need to wake up and re-read that original submission. The nomination was valid. The rescue was heroic. The original writing was anemic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:39, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Contrary to what is stated above, the first two paragraphs of the article (as it now stands) are wholly of my authorship. Would it bother anyone if I just removed these two paragraphs?

<li>I'm not trying to be an ass, but I put the content back. The article doesn't make sense without them there, and content submitted to Wikipedia is licensed under the GFDL. I did note that a rewrite would be welcome in the edit summary; I'll go back and add that to the talk page. My own opinion is that the first two paragraphs that I restored are extremely well written, and they could be rephrased, but I think they'd be hard to beat for the way they fit into the article in its current form. Again, I'm sorry if I seem an ass, but this is the sort of thing that the GFDL was written for; to make sure that content submitted is always available freely. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused">Unfocused</a> 21:07, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
