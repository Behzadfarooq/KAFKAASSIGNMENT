This appears to be original research of some sort, on a topic we all know and love.

<p>Hmm. If ever there was a concept that I should think Wikipedia should be making room for it is precisely this “ Self-Organizing Collaborative Networks”. This is not to defend the quality of the present entry/intended place holder and starting block – but I do think it argues for someone coming in and lend a helping hand at a time when I am up to my neck in survival tasks (all of which incidentally involve . . . self-organizing collaborative networks – click to <a href="http://www.ecoplan.org" class="external free" title="http://www.ecoplan.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecoplan.org</a> and its dozen or so focus programs to see how this works in the real world. . . warts and all).</p>
<p>I have to say that I am a bit surprised at the virulence, but above all disappointed at the stolid unanimity of this reaction. I would have anticipated in a place such as this more variety of response, more creativity So let me see if I can weigh in here with a thought or two which to my mind suggests that zapping this entry in process would be a bad move. I am incidentally pleased to have this opportunity, because I am a big believer in cognitive dissonance as a knowledge building tool. We try to use this in our own international work to welcome a purposeful, rich imbalance of views and positions within a shared forum, and then let them rip. And since we have a small example of this here, well let’s have a look.</p>
<p>For starters, I came to the House of Wikipedia a few months ago with both genuine curiously and real interests. As I rattled around in it over the last month or so, I been impressed by much of what I have seen and experienced, but also noted with some surprise quite a number of to my mind outstanding omissions – almost all of which in a broad area which I would characterize as “conceptual thinking about critical challenges of society and technology”. To the extent that there is not even an entry for this critical tool . . . or at least was not until earlier this afternoon in which I sat down to knock in a first cut which you will find of course at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], which you may not like either&#160;;-). (BTW, don’t you find it a bit strange that something as important as this had not been at least opened up as an entry. Of course this is not quite fair, since the Wikipedia is still very new and since it is natural that you would set out at first in more charted waters. But hey, but here we are.)</p>
<p>We live in an era in which change and speed of change are more than ever and faster than ever metrics of our daily lives. And while much of the world is indifferent to this, there is a growing current of thinkers and doers who understand that new concepts, new ways of organizing our societies, daily lives and actions are critical to our collective well being. I can think of two good reasons why Wikipedia of all new institutions should recognize this underling reality. First, because you yourselves are an example of this very process of adaptation. And second, if you cannot gear up to handle these new categories of emergent trends, then you will show that you are stuck in the old model. Let me see if I can be more concrete for you.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a traditional “transition instrument” for just one moment which has had no problem finding its ay into these pages. Say [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_College" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_College" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_College</a> Amherst College]. There it is: grounded today in a physical and institutions structure, but in 1820 nothing more than an idea on the part of (mainly) a single person, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster" rel="nofollow">Noah Webster</a>], that what was going on at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College" rel="nofollow">Harvard College</a> was somehow not good enough. A concept in 1820, bricks and motor (and hopefully a bit more) in 2006. Okay? The point that I am trying to make is that at one point a simple “concept” – not mind you a ‘research project’ – can gradually advance to the point where it becomes a or at least a potential “society shaping” phenomenon which is worthy of explicit note. Including in a place like the Wikipedia. Let’s move up a couple of notches in terms of abstraction.</p>
<p>Consider for example that of [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development" rel="nofollow">sustainable development</a>], a phrase in a report in the late 1980’s and even to this day a concept which is not at all well understanding (nor, sadly, particularly effective as a policy molding or even informing device). And yet, here it is – not very profound but workmanlike and probably as good as the concept itself deserves.</p>
<p>Let me take this even closer to the bone and draw to your attention the new (and still very much in process ) entry on [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_transportation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_transportation" rel="nofollow">sustainable transportation</a>] . Neither of these two concepts have bricks and mortar to prove to the world that they do indeed exist, but there they are and at least in this latter case that are in fact actively informing public policy, if not in every administration that might come to your minds at least in enough places for them to be considered useful and usefully evolving shaping concepts.</p>
<p>So, if all this of this true – and I can see a number of people who might already be asleep on this one – what about the present and admittedly weak and, yes!, badly in need of work entry on Self-Organizing Collaborative Networks? Is it subject for the virtual dustbin to which the six of you are consigning it. I think you are wrong friends, because this is one of the most important operational concepts around that is as yet poorly understood but nonetheless going to take on better definition and with it increased importance in the ways in which we organize ourselves for a better world. And part of this process of definition is indeed its presence in Wikipedia which is increasingly a first- stop shop for anyone who wants to know what is up in the world we live in.</p>
<p>If this don’t work – and since we know the underlying concept to be as hard as steel -- we can always take solace in the words of Max Planck when it comes to how scientific truths must sometimes make their way:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh yeah. My vote: Keep it and help make it better. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricbritton_6191.html" title="User:Ericbritton">ericbritton</a> 16:19, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Eric, Wikipedia is not a blog nor a place at which to publish vague articles on pop phenomena. There are plenty of other places for this kind of creative output: wikis such as "everything2", refereed journals such as "first monday", or personal web pages. This article is no more appropriate than it would be to have allowed Eric Raymond to first publish his "Homesteading the Noosphere" essay here.
