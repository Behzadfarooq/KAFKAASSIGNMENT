<li><b>Delete</b>, The alexa ranking of 11,000 quoted in the first AFD isn't anything special. Couldn't find any independent sources myself. If someone did find some decent sources to write an article from then maybe I'd reconsider. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 19:58, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b>. It looks like a blog with no comments, suggesting it isn't very popular. Article doesn't give us any way to verify notability, so failing that, delete. <span style="font-size: 10px">â€”&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 20:27, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. It's better now that sources have been added along with some support for notability. However, being cited by less-notable venues doesn't really add a lot to the article. Would change to "weak keep" if better (i.e. more notable) references were provided. WarCry is indeed a moderately well-known gaming site. The main issue for me here is whether it's notable enough for an article, as determined by overall impact on the broader gaming community. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 21:22, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Added some IGN and GameSpot references, as well as some acknowledgements by game developers for their Editor's Choice Awards. Hope that's enough. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 08:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep and stubify</b> - 1.5M Ghits, and this is a rather well-known network of fansites in the computer gaming space. Based on the comments from a couple of the commenters above, I have to assume that some who voted delete are simply unfamiliar with the most popular sites in computer gaming. WarCry is rather venerable and while this article could be improved (and I would advocate stubification) I really can't imagine deleting it. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 14:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You need to sort of prove its popularity with some independent references. And only a small percentage of those 1.5M google hits actually refer to this fan site. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 15:04, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The above statement is an inaccurate assumption. A quick statistical sampling of the top four pages of google for "warcry" turn up links that are 100% related to the site. The top four pages of google! While I'm comfortable admitting that <i>some</i> percentage of the 1.5M links are unrelated, I don't think that the percentage is "small" (whatever that means). Given that none of the core policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> are violated with this article, it seems obvious that it should stay as a matter of common sense. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 00:14, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - Google News uses it as a news source. This on its own doesn't <i>prove</i> notability, but they do have their own exclusive interviews with various MMO studios. These are linked to from stories at <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=site%3Aign.com+warcry&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=site%3Aign.com+warcry&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, so I'm assuming they're a trusted news source for the MMO community. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 16:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thanks for the link, I added some of the IGN links and a short blurb saying how WCN is referenced by major gaming sites. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 08:17, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Seems like a pretty significant site, like IGN &amp; Stratics. I added a couple of references to the article, mostly about other websites utilizing its (WarCry) as sources and the like. Also, it;s significant enough that they've been officially recognized (and somewhat partnerized) by at least one of the games they're covering (Lineage II - I added a reference to that too). And I also stubified it so that it gets more attention and hopefully gets expanded in the future by someone who knows more about the company's history. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 19:01, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - No significant content (unlike <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simtropolis.html" title="Simtropolis">Simtropolis</a>), seems like a blog, forums pretty much empty except for Off-Topic. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheListUpdater_226d.html" title="User:TheListUpdater">TheListUpdater</a> 22:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a purely subjective observation that has nothing to do with either notability, or any of the policies pertaining to whether it should be included. It also demonstrates that this voter has only looked at the surface-level of the site: in addition, it is comprised of a large number of game-specific sites that are part of its network, each of which has its own additional content. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 00:14, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Here's a summary so far of the major links I've added to the article per WP:WEB - <i>#1. The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i>. These are the best sources so far: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2693686.html?q=internet" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2693686.html?q=internet" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://boston.internet.com/news/article.php/708981" class="external autonumber" title="http://boston.internet.com/news/article.php/708981" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://dndvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9208" class="external autonumber" title="http://dndvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9208" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pages/unions/read_article.php?topic_id=25321157&amp;union_id=4352" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamespot.com/pages/unions/read_article.php?topic_id=25321157&amp;union_id=4352" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://pc.gamezone.com/news/07_13_05_10_38AM.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://pc.gamezone.com/news/07_13_05_10_38AM.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> I referenced these as links that refer to the website itself, or consider it significantly notable enough as to source it for news/interviews/etc. These should demonstrate notability of the WCN. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 08:59, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it's looking much, much better. I wouldn't say that links 4 and 5 there have WarCry as the <i>subject</i> but I'm happy to change my opinion to <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 09:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'd advise you to look at the article first. There already are a number of independent sources, and the site passes WP:WEB#3 by being reprinted/relinked even by other sites that it's supposed to be in competition with. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 19:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Oh, it's also been pointed out to me that the article now passes WP:WEB#1 with the new references added. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 20:46, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm laughing my ass off at these "reliable" sources. Just removed one which was a from a GameSpot forum, but was linked in such a way to look like it was a news link. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 05:34, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It's hard to assume good faith considering the tone of your statements. Some of the links you removed <b>are</b> significant to the article. The GameSpot one in particular supported this statement <small>"gaming websites such as <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameZone_76f1.html" title="GameZone">GameZone</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameSpot_fd17.html" title="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> reference articles and interviews done by the WarCry network."</small> Some of the statements you removed were describing the context in which the references were used. Still, including your alterations, the article does show the notability of the subject there of. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 09:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. BTW, why edit the article and remove links/statements if you're going to vote delete anyway? While I'm assuming good faith, it's hard to do so when someone who votes delete makes alterations to the article that might be construed as weakening the article's significance. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 09:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
