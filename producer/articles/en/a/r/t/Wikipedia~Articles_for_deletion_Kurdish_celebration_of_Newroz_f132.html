<p>We already have a <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norouz.html" title="Norouz">Norouz</a> article explaining the topic. I do not see the reason we need a seperate article for the kurds since its the same holiday for them just like the other god knows how many countries listed on <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norouz.html" title="Norouz">Norouz</a>. Article is more of a link-o-rama with random links that dont provide additional info. Links are often vaiguely relate to the topic such as news reports. Some of them only have a sigle referance to the holiday while not providing any info about the holdiay itself. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 00:39, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Putting all that information in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norouz.html" title="Norouz">Norouz</a> article would make it too long and detailed. So we are invoking the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>, and moving the information to a daughter article. It is done for a lot of general pages in Wikipedia. The Kurdish celebration stuff is verifiable, but too detailed, thus it goes in a daughter article. Plus bringing in the comment about Diyako is an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a> and is besides the point. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 01:34, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe not that large, but too much emphasis on one type of celebration (which is quite different than the others) in the main page (i.e. not in the proportion to the prominence of each). The current set-up allows the proportion of discussion of the different celebrations on the main page to be relatively well in proportion, but the detail that exists and is verifibale is not just eliminated. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 01:46, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Quite different? How? Kurdish article is mostly about the political stuff full of weasle words and plently of irrelevant external links. Ah! The poem can go to wikisource or wikihell (if copyvio). --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 01:50, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes indeed, because of the tensions Kurdish Newroz celebrations have often turned quite political (in demanding cultural rights) - which have simply made the celebrations more notable and thus relevant to deal with in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 07:51, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Is that a fact? Are you suggesting that every kurd is required to have a political motive in order to celebrate Newroz/Nourz (whatever)? Is it a requirement? Simplifying a holiday into a political raley is over generalization, factualy inacurate, and a POV fork attempt. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 07:56, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is a fact that the celebrations at several occasions has been politicized, is an important expression of Kurdish culture and thus has gained quite a lot of attention. Thus it would be strange not to have an article explaining the bacground and implications of the celebration on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 08:03, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Riots are an expression of Kurdish culture? Sure it gets a lot of attention, but the average kurd I met was certainly not breaking windows, burning cars, and throwing pavement peices at local law enforcment personel. Some of those political self expression was quite violent. Newroz wasnt the only time such events have occured. If the riots/political ralleys are a part of kurdish culture feel free to write about that (with proper citation). But that has nothing to do with the spring holiday. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 08:10, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't see any relevance of discussing riots in relation with Newroz. It is a yearly celebration, that gathers millions of participants in Turkey alone. So riots or not, I cannot see how the celebration can be deemed not notable enough for Wikipedia (even though some celebrations sadly enough have resulted in clases with the security forces). <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 09:02, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just like I do not see why article is relevant for political purposes. Its celebrated in millions in Iran as well as many other places just like christmas (according to the wikipedia article). Many other social gatherings in Turkey such as may holiday (workers holiday) end up with simmilar political issues as some kurdish politicians and political organisations have had frequently abused such gatherings. I do not think the political stuff, riots and clashes with the security forces are in no way relevant to the spring holiday. If you are looking for an article about Kurdish civil rights movement, this isn't the right title. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 10:04, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I am not looking for identity or civil rights. I am specifally looking for <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_celebration_of_Newroz_375b.html" title="Kurdish celebration of Newroz">Kurdish celebration of Newroz</a>, in order to understand the background and implications of this even, which gets huge amounts of attention (at least in Turkey) every year. You are free to like or to dislike the celebrations, but they are present, and there is no reason not to let people get the possibility to gather information about it on Wiki. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 10:17, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I am not following you. Then why is there a picture of Abdlullah Ocalan in this article (according to the caption at least). Thats like cultural celebrations in Washington DC with binladen flags and etc. Not exactly your average cultural spring holiday. All that stuff is irrelevant to the holiday. Kurdish tradition does not include political ralleying and violence, does it? --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 10:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Remove the poem (how does that explain the celebration?) and you end up with text small enough to fit the main article.</dd>
<dd>A holiday by definition is a part of "self identity" I suppose, that would explain why <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norouz.html" title="Norouz">Norouz</a> is notable, but does not explain this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Jeff. Based on skimming both articles, the Kurdish version of the holiday seems significant enough to warrant a separate article. The article is referenced, albeit mostly with external links that probably ought to be turned into endnotes.
