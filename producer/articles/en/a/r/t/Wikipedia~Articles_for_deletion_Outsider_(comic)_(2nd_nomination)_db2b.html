<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b> please analyze this article carefully before condeming it, and don't jump to conclusions. <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a> writes: " Professional reviews or critical commentary? I find none." Well Hanchen, I can't find them in way too many articles too, and nobody seems to take it in a bad way. You could improve the article and critize it if you like. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> writes "they didn't even link to their own site!" and this is simply wrong, there is a proper link to the site inside of the box. How Kimchi could overlook it? Perhaps he needs to read the article with more care (or needs new glasses?&#160;:). <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> writes that the article "is based on the Wikipedia version deleted in the first AfD" well this is amazing, because I compared the two and I don't find them alike at all. The subject is the same but that's it. As for the statement: "But nothing has changed since the original nomination." I completly disagree, and must tell you that that the first nomination was alltoo soon after creation and as such didn't had the time to develope (improve) properly. Since then the article has been improved by a enormous extent. Well, looking at the history of the article you will find that I spent a lot of time improving it, and I would certainly not have done it, if I didn't think that it is a worthy subject. No, I am not the author, but I found and read the comic exactly because I found a good article in Wikipedia and quite sincerly I think that is one of the notions of Wikipedia: Good articles = check the subject out. If you delete it Wikipedia is the looser, and noone else. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 19:14, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

Unless Abe has turned into a great fat liar for this AFD only, I'm going to go with what he says.

<li><b>Delete</b> - "Has some history"? <i>I</i> have some history and clearly exist also, but I hardly think that qualifies me for notability. And Flamrande's argument sounds like an argument for using Wikipedia to promote a webcomic, which is certainly not how it is supposed to work. I haven't seen any reliable sources of information regarding this web comic. The webcomiclist and anipike entries are just short synopses with links, which I think falls under the "trivial" category.

<li><b>Comment</b> I can see that noone is atacking the quality of the article itself, so I hope that we can all agree that the article is good enough. What we appear to disagree is if the subject the (the webcomic itself) is "worthy" enough to have an article in Wikipedia. Well, I think that the author made a genuine (very rare) effort to create a quite "logical and believable" universe (it never stops being sci-fi of course). Unlike way too may Sci-Fi universes and other webcomics, the author created a really detailed background for his setting, look in here: <a href="http://www.well-of-souls.com/outsider/insider.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.well-of-souls.com/outsider/insider.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and "you" must agree that the storyline is quite advanced (way too many others are overly simplistic and present the old Good/Evil Hollywood kitsh: Evil is stupid, Good is smart - like in Star Wars: the Empire was completly incompetent, beginning with Palpatine himself&#160;:). The art is very good, alltough clearly not brilliant, while the art of the overwhelming majoriy of other webcomics are simply bad, but really really bad. If all these things don't make this particular webcomic "worthy" enough, I must ask you all: Which webcomic is worthy then? Only those who appear in magazines and are thereby "notorious"? Isn't that a bit of circular reasoning? So it doesn't appear in books and magazines specialized in webcomics? Well, against that there is no argument - I can only wonder about the quality of such magazines. If this was a book or a game (computer or otherwise) instead of a webcomic this proposal would not even take place. I will end with this: read first the comic from the beginning at <a href="http://www.well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider000.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> to the end, for Chris'sake, compare it with other webcomics, and only then cast your vote. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 14:57, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have done some research into how notable this comic is. Most of the online reviews of Outsider appeared in 2001-2002, and are unfortunately no longer accessible. The Outsider was nominated in 2002 for Best Science Fiction Webcomic by the Cartoonist's Choice Awards website (<a href="http://www.ccawards.com/2002.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccawards.com/2002.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021014134010/ccawards.com/nominations.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20021014134010/ccawards.com/nominations.html" rel="nofollow">the site was down few hours ago and the nomination can be confirmed in Internat Archive if it happens again</a>). Also, we should note the history and the trends: there were few upates in 2005, which caused the comic rank to plummet down. I can't figure out if Alexa can give me exact details of the rank few years back, but a rough estimate based on the graph suggest it was around 100,000. Also, if you look at the current trend, it seems the fans are flocking back as new pages have been released over the past few weeks. The reach, rank and daily views are increasing at about 50% per three months, so in about a year if this keeps up this comic will be as popular as the 'top dogs' mentioned earlier.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 16:45, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thanks for coming up with some research and proper reasoning, I'm sure it'll help others. I'd just like to offer some of my own thoughts on the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_888a.html" title="Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards</a>. The bottom line is, I don't think these are notable awards (I haven't nominated winners for deletion, but have done for nominees which didn't win). The thing is, there are just so many categories and nominees, from some afds on Wikipedia, I'm not even sure if the webcomic crowd respect this award. For example, I just took 2 random redlinks on the WCCA article and googled them, I chose "Four Toon Tellers" and "The Tenth Life of Pishio" because I thought they'd be unique names. A google search shows around 70 and 60 unique links for them respectively. Of course, I've not actually looked into these 2 comics, but it's just preliminery stuff. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:02, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Note that the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline suggests a webcomic may be notable if it "has won a well known and independent award." We could debate whether the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_888a.html" title="Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards</a> are "well known" (I don't think they are) but there doesn't seem to be any debate over the fact that this webcomic has never won. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 16:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Pretty decent comic, but unfortunately has not yet reached a level of notabilty acceptable for Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Wikipedia:Notability (web content)</a>. --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatori_Son_533a.html" title="User:Satori Son">Satori Son</a> 06:18, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Comic is a <a href="../../../w/c/c/WCCA_971f.html" title="WCCA">WCCA</a> nominee. Furthermore, the nom's rant fails to assert factual reasons for deletion. The nom has been told that Alexa is a poor indicator repeatedly and is not an official or unofficial criteria on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberSkull_302c.html" title="User:CyberSkull">Dread Lord CyberSkull</a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberSkull_40df.html" title="User talk:CyberSkull">✎☠</a> 09:46, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - If I don't provide Alexa figures in the nom, someone else sure is going to anyway. I'm going to continue posting Alexa numbers up. You may not like them, they're just circumstantial evidence, Alexa's a slightly better indicator than some keep votes I see. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 23:29, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
