<li><b>Keep</b> No reason is given for wanting to delete it. Its verifiable and a very notable subject. A Supreme Court case; two skiing Halls of Fame; and an endowed chair at Harvard. Whats the reason given for deletion? Bad faith nomination or the nominator never bothered to do a Google search.

<li>No real comment on your reasoning, Richard, but please remember to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I don't see any evidence (i.e. edit warring or the like) to make me believe that this was a bad faith nomination, or that it was listed on AfD for an improper purpose. A Google search of "'Whip Jones' Highland" gets only 98 hits.

<li><b>Comment</b> Its never my intention to be rude or impolite, but I am sometimes critical. And people should be critical of me. I have made many spelling errors before Firefox 2.0, and many, many typos that have been caught. Editing is fun, I enjoy it immensely, but has consequences if you make an error or typo. Just look at his Hall of Fame biography. His death is listed for the wrong year. Very sloppy. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 02:21, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>They may well be, don't panic, most of the other people here seem to agree with you so far. The first nomination was when the article was in much worse shape than now.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - Ditto, above. <a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">BMcCJ</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. If the article was then as it is now, I wouldn't have nominated it. Under the circumstances, I need to make it clear that I am <i>not</i>&#160;!voting delete at this time. But, as a renomination, it is not suitable for a <b>speedy</b> keep unless all the <i>delete</i> voters there agree.<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a></li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> What nonsense to bother authors with having to defend meaningful articles. There should be a stiff penalty for unsupportable deletion nominations. Why don't the critics spend time improving articles rather than nominating for deletion. If they are not familiar enough with the topic to propose improvements, then how can they be qualified to judge the merits of notability. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 00:48, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Four things, I guess (sorry, I'm going to be long-winded):
<ol>
<li>It's generally bad form to solicit votes, as BMcCJ did on Mr. Murray's talk page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKevin_Murray&amp;diff=95422746&amp;oldid=93927576" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKevin_Murray&amp;diff=95422746&amp;oldid=93927576" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Some people refer to it as "canvassing" or <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#Canvassing" title="WP:SPAM">vote stacking</a>. Please don't do it - it harms this process (though I know BMcCJ is a new editor, and I'm sure he had no idea about that).</li>
<li>Please try to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume more good faith</a>. AfD isn't nonsense just because an article you like shows up here. Those who participate here generally spend time improving articles as well. But they also improve Wikipedia when they eliminate the junk that shouldn't be here. There should emphatically <i>not</i> be a "stiff penalty" for being <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7Ebold_1b5a.html" title="WP:bold">bold</a> and trying to protect and improve Wikipedia, even if the person gets it wrong. You disagree about the notability of this article and want to keep it - great. Vote to keep. But the idea that we should "penalize" people because they disagree with you - I disagree with that strongly.</li>
<li>If people had to be previously familiar with the subject in order to vote to delete an article, nothing would ever be deleted. Those things notable enough for people to become familiar with them are...probably notable enough for Wikipedia. Stuff no one is familiar with (some 13 year old's Pokemon collection, somebody's friend's band) is probably non-notable. Would you really suggest that we couldn't delete that stuff because there aren't any experts who can comment on it?</li>
<li>And, finally - did you have any reason why you think this person <i>was</i> notable? Please don't take this the wrong way, but I don't see anything <i>about</i> the article in your comment - only a call for "stiff penalties" for the nominator. So why, in your mind, is this person notable? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 03:39, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> This one seems close to me, and I initially voted delete when the article was in worse shape. I don't think the Supreme Court case matters. Remember that there's a difference between "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a>" and "impressive." It's impressive that he pushed a case to the Supreme Court. But "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." The <b>case</b> received multiple non-trivial mentions in published works - but only because of what the Supreme Court did. (And, I might add, we haven't actually written an article about the case yet. When I have a little more time I may start that, but anyone else should feel free to as well.) I haven't seen anyone point out any similar media mentions of Whip Jones in relation to the case. I draw a distinction between someone like Brown, Roe, or Lochner (who became notable just by having their name in the title of a famous case), and those who were just <i>involved</i> in a notable case without themselves receiving any press. So I would discount the court case. However, he seems to have received multiple non-trivial mentions in published works in regards to his skiing business and his Harvard endowment - and that's enough for me. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 03:53, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Please keep this discussion to the merits of this article. I propose taking discussions of the process to whatever forums Wikipedia has for those discussions (feel free to add the links to those forums BELOW) so that this conversation can stay on track.

<li>I think the positive case for this article (above), and the facts that have been in it, for quite a long time, have been listed and mentioned enough.</li>
