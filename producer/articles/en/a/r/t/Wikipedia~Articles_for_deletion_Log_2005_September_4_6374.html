<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. No consensus. I count Kusenose's, Steve Eifert's and Journalist's votes as deletes, Grutness and 23skidoo want merge and redirect, while Denni did what I consider to be the most sensible thing and redirected. There is nothing else that needs to be done.

<li>I am one of the people studing the bearatrosses.

<li>I believe that the article makes perfectly clear that some believe that the bearatross is completely ficticious. This is similar to the situation with Bigfoot or even Mythology.

<li>Speedy delete as spam: In 2 lines of text, there were FOUR links to external websites. Great way to boost page rank, getting spam into a sub-400 Alexa site like Wikipedia.

<p>Cake is a notable band, but this song isn't. Also, this seems to be an interpretation of it.--<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanel_222a.html" title="User:Shanel">Shanel</a> 02:43, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The song is cited in the <a href="../../../c/a/k/Cake_%28band%29.html" title="Cake (band)">CAKE</a> article as one of "Their biggest hits" and it's a fan favorite. The song made the billboard charts. The album <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prolonging_the_Magic_de21.html" title="Prolonging the Magic">Prolonging_the_Magic</a>, that contains the song, has its own article. I thought this article would be an interesting contribution to that subject. I attempted to stay away from mere interpretation of the song by citing the more interesting references contained within without drawing conclusions or violating the lyrics copyright.</p>
<p>Any advice on how to make it more relevent?</p>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> or else <b>keep and expand</b>, but this info should go somewhere--to me, these seem like encyclopedic things about the song. Thanks, Extradog, for being exceptionally reasonable about this. I've seen many people not take this sort of thing very well--hope you stick around. As for suggestions, this material might go better in the album article--there could be little mini-paragraphs about each track on the album. Unless it was released as a single or something like that?

<li>Yes, it is. It's practically a genre by itself, try playing "Bicycle made for Two", "The Entertainer", "Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer", "Pack up your Troubles", "If I were a Rich Man", "Colonel Bogey March", "Papa Loves Mambo" and the like on a cathedral Organ (I could go on, if you like). Are Carlo Curly and Ji-yoen Choi world famous, major label record artists because they are "people who play at organ concerts" or because they are "organ recitalists" with a major following of the type witnessed at the last night of the proms? I would further argue that that description is so encompassing that it can be seen as a whole genre in itself. Further to which the article on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">concerts</a> is in need of attention itself, it would not be helped by the inclusion of this there <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 10:17, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, you should have typed that as "<b>they're</b> fruitless without ground." &#160;:) That said, your very first edit was to the article in question not three days ago. All of your subsequent edits have been to this discussion. You have no user page, no talk page. You have the right to defend the article, but as I said, coming seemingly out of nowhere and making your first set of votes to a page that no new user would even think of coming to, well, I hope you get my point. Nothing personal. - Lucky 6.9 22:48, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You have a logical point. Why would a new user care about a page? Truth be told, I don't know why, but one obviously does. But, if you see it illogical that a user would want to defend an article he contributed to, I suppose I've no right to dispute this. I see your point, but you seem to underestimate that small percent. <b>Most</b> new users wouldn't, but obviously one did. Illogical, due to my lack of contribution and having no name here... I suppose what's done is done, though. I've stated my opinions, and although there's little logic behind my random appearence and voting, I have right to do so. Until you can prove your accusations with something more than your opinion about newer users being silent and falling in line, you still have no grounds. Thank you, and have a nice day. - <b>Koneko-hi</b> 22:54 CST, Wednesday, September 7, 2005.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Bandits of The Acoustic Revolution doesn't exactly fit under the guidelines, but that is because it is a unique concept band, and IMO, the rules weren't able to fortell some mussical project like this. In addition, BOTAR is pretty much the "link" between Catch 22 and Streetlight Manifesto, and I feel it is an essential part of the stories of both the bands. BOTAR shares people and music with Catch 22 and Streetlight Manifesto, and they did release a record, even if it wasnt a mass distributed one (they hand made every copy, which prevents that sort of release). They can't tour because the people in the band are all over the world, and there are a lot of people in the band. I feel they deserve a mention because of the influence on Catch 22/Streetlight manifesto, and for that matter, third-wave ska as a genre.<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerdomo_dcc7.html" title="User:MPerdomo">MPerdomo</a> 14:28, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I quote, rule number 5. "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable."

<p>French-language flash cartoon that has been moribund since May of 2004. Most google hits are from Wikipedia or other online encyclopedias using Wikipedia content, Alexa rank is nonexistent. If it turns out that there's some massive underground Quebecois movement surrounding this, I'm willing to change my mind, but based on what I see this is a dead non-English webcomic with less reach than many non-notable weblogs.

<p>Individual churches are not notable. Being in first person and probably a copyvio are also strikes against it. I would have listed it for copyvio but I was hoping to get consensus to delete instead of getting it rewritten.

<dd>Erm...I would expect stronger commentary from the proposer of this deletion.

<dd>I don't understand what more you want. The church is not notable, it does not deserve an article in Wikipedia any more than the church next door to where I live does. Nor any more than any other church. I do agree there are exceptions -- noted cathedrals, the Crystal Cathedral, Notre Dame, St. Patrick's, etc. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 08:51, September 4, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What I want is pretty clear. You claim it is just your typical church next door. Now show us if that is true. Singapore is not some Christian country where churches are as common as grocery stores. Sure, we arent exactly adding the smallest churches here, but mind telling if this is completely non-notable other then basing it on your own personal ignorance?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 08:58, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I dont know how this can be an attack? If you want to nominate something, its basic courtesy to provide your justifications for it, and not just dismiss it as not notable just because you know next to nothing about it. Did you do any research on this before nominating it? From the above, I doubt so, and I hence I strongly question the validity of this nomination. I dont see how I would be "scoring points" in the above exercise?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 09:03, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unless there is a clear indication, I'd delete it. If you uncover significant information later, it can always be recreated.

Hi,<br />
Yes, I'm editing right now. I'm a complete noob and don't know how to message you back Finbar, but I figured this bit out now.<br />
I've never contributed anything before, but turn to Wikipedia for info all the time.<br />
I'm doing a University assignment on Expectancy Violations Theory (and Interpersonal Deception Theory) and so searched for this topic. Unfortunately my assignment is a Powerpoint presentation so it isn't presented all that nicely, but since I looked here I thought maybe others would too.<br />
Any advice?<br />

<dd>Hi, whoever you are (the author of the article under discussion?), you can and should sign your comments on talk pages and a VfD page (this page is an example of a VfD page) using four tildes. Are you saying that you are a student at the University of Arizona and that your instructor in a communications class assigned you to create a Wikipedia article? I think that would be rather irresonsible, unless perhaps that instructor is an experienced Wikipedia user and was checking to make sure that any articles created as a result of his assignment are up to standard. Any chance you could ask <i>your instructor</i> to comment? I'd like to hear his/her rationale for this alleged homework assignment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, the article mentions "communication theory", but appears to concern a nonsense "theory" having nothing whatever to do with communication theory in the sense of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Shannon_8ca9.html" title="Claude Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 17:44, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Have added welcome note to 203.45.200.5's talk page. Could "203.45.200.5" please indicate whether this is indeed intended to be a Wikipedia article as well as a personal university assignment? I think there is a Wikipedia rule that says you are <b>not</b> allowed to use Wikipedia for personal things. If this is just a personal university assignment, then I think the current content should be <b>removed</b>. --<a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinbarr_Saunders_b918.html" title="User:Finbarr Saunders">Finbarr Saunders</a> 08:56, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, I don't know what a talk page is. I thought it may be useful to someone to share what I had learned on this theory seeing as I would have found it useful. Why the hell would I post a 'personal university assignment' otherwise? Maybe I have the concept of Wikipedia wrong. Whatever.</p>
<ul>
<li>A couple of apologies:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A talk page is the same as a discussion page. Most Wikipedia pages have a "Discussion" link at the top. (Don't ask me why there are two names for the same thing!) When I first posted that "You have new messages" alert, that took you to your own talk page.</li>
<li>I wrongly assumed from your earlier reply "I'm doing a University assignment on..." that you were using Wikipedia as a free web storage area (because some people do that, unfortunately). I see now that you actually want to add to this encyclopaedia. Sorry! and I'll let you get on with your first Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinbarr_Saunders_b918.html" title="User:Finbarr Saunders">Finbarr Saunders</a> 12:25, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not notable. I was going to just put this as a speedy delete, but started having doubts as the subject is a mayor.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Mayors are encyclopedic. This one has served for six years and is on his second term - he's surely notable enough for a Wikipedia article. However, this was certainly a case of extremly bad and unencyclopedic writing, with a lot of irrelevant information, but I've done a complete rewrite of it now. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 12:19, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete: Improperly titled, and mayors are only <i>sometimes</i> in, sometimes not. I wish folks wouldn't extrapolate rules from single debates in the past. It depends on the mayor, the town, and the biography. When a person's name (properly spelled and punctuated) is an article title, what is supposed to follow is a biography. If the person does not have a sufficiently active and meaningful life for people outside of the town to <i>need</i> to know about, then the person should simply be mentioned as "5-time mayor" in the town's article. Break out the biography when the <i>biography</i> is a valid article. In this particular case, the mayor should be mentioned elsewhere, and not done as a biography. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:08, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>REDIRECT</b> to <i>Sexual predator</i>. This is one of <i>those</i> AfDs. There is, numerically at least, a marginal consensus to not retain the article's content as it stands, especially as one of the keeps allows that there may be somewhere else that is more appropriate. One of the deleters also allows for a redirect. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 21:11, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep (formerly Undecided)</b>.

(3) What unique benefit does this company provide to society?

<p>I am very sorry. You do not know the term link farm. Tell me one website that you might deem a link farm. And please do not make inappropiate suggestions, upon this. I am a respected memeber of several big SEO communities, and i do not practice such "false" or "inappropiate link schemes" . If links are to the company websites, these are from friends, other companies, or web directories.</p>

Claims of wnning the unverified chess trophy remain unverified, and the claims were probably added to the article merely to avoid running into speedy criteron A7.

<li>If my IP address is published every time I edit a page, was it neccicary to publish it on the comments page? After commenting, I have since created a user account and I would prefer that my comments are attributed to my username rather than to my IP address. After you posted my IP address, I noticed I had been subjected to two portscans. I understand that something like that is of very little consequence, but it does help to illustrate my security concerns. I am not a vandal and I am not a troll, but when a choice needs to be made regarding my own personal security, the choice is clear. Now rather than edit out my IP myself (which is 'vandalism' in your eyes), I am asking you to please remove it. Now that I have a user page, maybe a link to that would help people learn more about me, and help to deter security nuisances. <a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubster_a0ef.html" title="User:Fubster">Fubster</a> 01:20, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>O.K., you are right that you were not primarily thinking of Elvis, and I still think it is a good idea to have Wikipedia articles of this kind. There is one important point. When I explained to gay historian David Ehrenstein the problem that some contributors to Wikipedia try to suppress every reference that some Hollywood stars were gay, as everybody can see from the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Talk%7ENick_Adams_3fe6.html" title="Talk:Nick Adams">Talk:Nick Adams</a> page and the related archives, the <a href="../../../j/a/m/Talk%7EJames_Dean_cee1.html" title="Talk:James Dean">Talk:James Dean</a> page, etc., he answered,
<dl>
<dd>The problem is cultural. <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">Heterosexuality</a> is regarded as universal and a self-evident truth. Everyone is supposed to be heterosexual, therefore "proof" of same-sexuality is required. Standards of "proof" change constantly. In her memoir of her brief affair with Dean, "Dizzy" Sheridan (Jerry Seinfeld's mother to zillions of TV viewers) spoke quite candidly about the fact that she knew Dean had an affair with producer Rogers Brackett. [I have used this sentence for the James Dean article.] Gavin Lambert has spoken of Sal Mineo's affair with Nicholas Ray (with whom he had had an affair as well) and Gore Vidal made mention of the Ray-Mineo affair too. Gavin Lambert makes mention of Nick Adams' gayness in his biography of Natalie Wood -- who had a great many gay friends. In sort there is nothing unusual about being gay or bisexual particularly in Hollywood. It's the Heterosexual Dictatorship (Christopher Isherwood's useful term) that can't handle the truth.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>These are wise words indeed. Query: do you really have problems with the fact that there are some authors who say that some Hollywood stars were gay or may have had homosexual leanings? You may think about this, instead of condemning my article and rashly saying "delete". <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 20:02, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is somewhat off-topic, but I'm not sure that the idea of <i>Celebrity rumours</i>, or <i>Gossip about actors</i> articles, as mentioned above are a particularly good idea. Firstly, I imagine libel laws would be an issue. Secondly, rumours can be indiscriminate, baseless, unsourced, and all the things which Wikipedia shouldn't be. Perhaps this argument is best saved for when those articles come to AfD themselves though, as this debate is already fairly convoluted as it is! <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 22:28, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that my remarks are off-topic, as the suppression of different opinions which are not in line with the opinion of some fans is a real Wikipedia problem.

Given the National Enquirer being a source can we expect an article on Living on the moon rumours about Elvis Presley? If the article is being used, as alleged above, to promote a book, then it skirts dangerously close to being personal research. The article is inherently POV, and would most likely remain so even with a name change. Given that the article cites its very weak sources at length, I see nothing to suggest that it could be expanded further with the addition of new information.

There is a positive Dutch review of Bret's book. So I have presented at least half a dozen independent sources (published and unpublished books, reviews, articles, plays) which deal with the topic. The article is a compromise in order to exclude the material from the main article, as many Elvis fans do not like the rumors about the singer's homosexual leanings. Perhaps the title of the article may be changed. It should also be taken into account that there are several critical remarks in my article concering the claims. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 00:40, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to BRET, the legendary rocker's "greedy" manager COLONEL TOM PARKER blackmailed him into virtual slavery by threatening to leak reports of the romance. Bret says, "Parker held secret information about a homosexual affair between Elvis and actor NICK ADAMS over his head like a sword. He made it clear that... if Elvis didn't toe the line, he'd let it get out. At that time, it could well have ruined his career. That's why Parker had so much control over him." Presley's sexual experimentation began with a "teenage crush" on actor JAMES DEAN that grew into an obsession, says the book. The star saw REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE 44 times and eventually became close pals with Dean's Rebel co-star Nick Adams. Bret says, "Adams claimed that he had a brief affair with Elvis after Elvis 'agreed to be his date' for a preview of Nick's 1956 film THE LAST WAGON." Presley, by then a sex symbol sending legions of women swooning, became smitten with Adams and even tried unsuccessfully to get him a part in his first movie LOVE ME TENDER, says Bret. In 1958, "Nick Adams and Elvis stayed in the same room of the same hotel in New Orleans while Elvis was filming KING CREOLE there," the author reveals. Many journalists' attempts to 'out' the star in the past were thwarted by his manager.</p>

<li><b>an additional source</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I found an interesting discussion concerning Elvis's sex life and his homosexual leanings. The author says,</p>
<dl>
<dd>The excitement about rumors about Prince Charles opened up in Europe the discussion about the sex-lives of other prominent personalities. To them belongs the unforgettable Elvis Presley, who was stationed as a young soldier in Germany. Up to now it has been a tabu to publicly speculate about the sexual predisposition of Elvis Presley. While the "King of Rock" has been spared by the media, other prominent personalities were forced to come out of the closet. ...</dd>
<dd>In order to bring light on the private secrets of deceased Hollywood stars, a team of experts in Europe is collecting information also about Elvis Presley. One source are eyewitnesses, who have been privately associated as friends and acquaintances with Elvis Presley.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One of the sources they present is this personal photograph, presumably taken by a gay friend, from the beginning of Presley's military service showing Elvis half naked with one of his male friends: <a href="http://www.meaus.com/elvis-and-boy.JPEG" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meaus.com/elvis-and-boy.JPEG" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> The author adds,</p>
<dl>
<dd>The question is already now: how will the Elvis fans take the possible bisexuality of their idol? Will it bring protests and denials, or rather tolerance and understanding for the great singers? A sensitive side of Presley could even increase people's affection for him, according to the opinion of some Presley fans.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this is another independent source supporting the view that Elvis had homosexual leanings. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 10:25, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Another published book claiming that Elvis had a homosexual affair</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In his book, <i>The Boy who would be King: An Intimate Portrait of Elvis Presley by his Cousin</i> (1990), Earl Greenwood, Elvis's second cousin who paled around with Elvis for many years before and after his success, says that Elvis had an affair with <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Adams_3506.html" title="Nick Adams">Nick Adams</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>From the review in the <i>Library Journal</i> (by David M. Turkalo, Social Law Lib., Boston):
<dl>
<dd>Having literally grown up with Elvis Presley in Tupelo and Memphis, Greenwood also served his cousin for some years as his press agent, claiming a front-row seat for the best and the worst of rock music's late king. As with so much written about him, this book is simultaneously interesting and lurid and often the former because it is the latter. But its saving grace, in addition to being well written, is Greenwood's closeness to Presley, rendering this an eyewitness account (the first ever by a blood relative) to the formative childhood years and the inner workings of the Presley family that played such a large part in the musician's personality development. Revelatory and credible in these and other areas, but never descending to either blathering idolatry or merciless crucifixion (a la Albert Goldman), this fast-paced, no-white-wash look at the rock icon will surely find an audience among the millions for whom Elvis Presley still holds fascination.

<li>I counted 4 delete, 2 keep. (OK, maybe I overlooked the fact that one of the keep votes was "conditional"). Never mind, the article seems to be headed for deletion this time around. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:29, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is correct. The original close was legitimate, with four votes to delete, one to keep, one conditional keep where the conditions had apparently been met because the article had been trimmed back as requested and only a small minority of voters stated that the company was non-notable. The article was of course immediately undeleted and relisted here after being summarily deleted by a third party after the legitimate close. I don't know where some editors managed to get the figure of 80% from; perhaps they decided to discount one of the keep votes other than the one by the article creator, which could be legitimately discounted. Even if the provisional keep vote isn't counted as a keep vote, it is <i>a</i> vote, so in my opinion shouldn't be discounted when weighing whether a consensus had been attained. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:14, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The two votes in favour of keeping were both dubious at best. This existing makes both humanity and Wikipedia slightly worse, and must be expunged from both existence and history.

<li>I'm not sure who undeleted (or deleted) what, and whether it was before (or after) whom undeleted (or deleted) what, and whether or not it was while which of the first or second deletion discussions or the undeletion discussion had or had not already been closed, by whom, properly or improperly. And I really hope nobody is going to bother to enlighten me. But it may not have been Tony. Whatever, just so long as someone makes the article go away. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:21, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>P. S. The rules say "Items sent here usually wait five days or so." It would seem to me that if an article has a relatively small number of votes and a ratio whose relationship to 2/3 isn't obvious, that it would be sensible to let the discussion mellow/simmer/fester a while longer, and see whether a clearer consensus emerges. Is there any reason why such a discussion couldn't be mentioned in RfC in order to draw in more voters? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:29, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It was me. The discussion had been closed eight days after being listed. An article deleted out of process, as this one was, can be undeleted by any sysop (<a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html#Exception" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">undeletion policy#Exception</a>) and that is my normal practice in disputed closes where a sysop unilaterally deletes after a close. In such circumstances I immediately relist the article for deletion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:14, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep - qualified</b>. Look folks, I was the creator. I created this in good faith for the people I thought would look for it. I'm a big Wikipedia supporter. I've invested <i>some</i> hours of time (admittedly not tons, but a few hours nonetheless) in helping out with content in places where I know something relevant and hopefully useful. I created the Plum Canary page because I believe the company is attempting to solve a common problem in a novel way. So the page was created to recognize the novelty and provide a landing page that could be used for links in other pages where it is legitimate to talk about the software (e.g. the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_project_management_software.html" title="List of project management software">List of project management software</a> page.). It appears from this second nomination that this page will get deleted. I obviously feel different about this conclusion, but I think in its current cleaned-up form it doesn't make the Wikipedia a worse place (despite the theatrically-condescending comment by Proto). (I won't even take the bait about making <i>humanity</i> a worse place.) I also wanted to go on the record as saying I put this page up in good faith, <b>not</b> to exploit Wikipedia as a link farm.

<p>This article should either be deleted because of dictdef, or, if someone can expand it, it's name should be changed to "ghetto fabulous" which is the term used far more often.</p>
<p>It's a real phrase that real people use, it describes a real and unique cultural phenomenon... it should be included in the encyclopedia. Don't delete.</p>

<li><b>Provisional keep</b> with the requirement that sources be provided.

<li><b>Keep/comment.</b>: Growing up in the Deep South, I heard this phrase, along with plenty of similar ones ("nigger rig" and its more recent child, "afro-engineered", both being the same as "Jury Rigged", etc.) for the greater part of my life. I can verify this as a VERY common turn of phrase that well predates "ghetto fabulous". <a href="../../../h/o/o/User%7EHooperx_0b51.html" title="User:Hooperx">-HX</a> 13:30, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This term is in use so it shouldn't be deleted. The only requirement for inclusion in wikipedia SHOULD be that a term is in use, whether it is offensive or not is irrelevant. BTW, here in Texas, this term is very common and simply means someone who comes into some cash that is a large amount for them but in the overall scheme of things is not much money.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete/Merge</b> since the wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a> already says "Within American culture, following the word "nigger" with a second word connotes an extremely negative conception of that second word, usually playing to racist stereotypes. Thus, to call someone "nigger-rich" is to say that they unwisely spend their entire paycheck upon its receipt." do we really need a whole entry to further expand on this one term? Agree, it's not at all the same as ghetto fabulous. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJessamyn_ecc4.html" title="User:Jessamyn">Jessamyn</a> 01:19, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It is a concise way to find out who has been on the show. This list, for some reason, is very difficult to find elsewhere on the Internet.</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> What part of "what wikipedia is not" does this list fall under? Also, doesn't this clearly fall under the scope of having lists? If nothing else, I don't see that this article is hurting anything or is detrimental to the overall quality of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Much better than a category for <i>Daily Show</i> guests, and it is interesting information (per Ario). We have lists of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">SNL</a> skits and lists of <i>tall people</i>, for Pete's sake!&#160;:) In fact, I'm pretty sure there are lists of SNL guest hosts and maybe even <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Carson_bdcc.html" title="Johnny Carson">Johnny Carson</a>'s guests, so this fits right in.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This has been up for deletion at least twice before and survived. It is regularly policed by a number of editors who enforce a minimum standard of requiring a citation so every drive-by anon can't stick their least favorite movie in.

<dd>I could find "sources" about any movie that considered it good or bad. I'm sure I could find a source that said <i>Gone with the Wind</i> or <i>E.T.</i> were the worst movies ever made. It is all subjective. And, just because it has survived two votes before doesn't mean its any good---I know some'thing' else that has survived two votes and isn't any good. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianinthehouse_3206.html" title="User:Wikipedianinthehouse">Wikipedianinthehouse</a> 21:32, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd personally say "overrated" would be a more appropriate title, but Robert Altman and the viewers of the BBC said "worst", so there it is. <a href="../../../l/u/b/User%7ELubaf_0839.html" title="User:Lubaf">Thanks</a>,<br />

<dd>It is encyclopedic because, just as in <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">Films that have been considered the greatest ever</a>, it cites polls, published books, and the opinions of leading critics. <i>Titanic</i> appears on both lists because it was immensely popular with the public at the time and criticially unpopular. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 21:47, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, <i>Titanic</i> was popular with critics, (86% Rotten Tomato rating), a fact that conveniently disappeared from the article after I had added it in.

<li>Superfluous <b>keep</b> vote, along with a note on proposals to change this article's name. This article's been through a series of back-and-forth name changes, including "List of movies that are famous for being widely considered extremely bad", which is probably one of the most tortuous titles in the history of Wikipedia. We'll probably never settle on a title that satisfies <i>everyone</i>, but I think the current title is OK. It's not really a POV problem; something like "List of bad films" would be. <font color="green"><a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">sɪzlæk</span></font></a> [ <a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">+t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">+c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Szyslak_1b31.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Szyslak">+m</a> ]</font> 10:15, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

I do think that the policies should be tightened up to require a critical or popular <i>consensus,</i> rather than just a single citation. For example: having a movie like Titanic in there is somewhat ridiculous, considering how many awards it's won, how many critics loved it, and how outright popular it was--the people who consider it a bad movie are in the minority, yet the "single citation" policy lets the movie onto this list. - <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifefeed_b291.html" title="User:Lifefeed">Lifefeed</a> 13:03, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>MERGE</b> to <i>Herndon, Virginia</i>. On raw numbers, this is below the guidance of two-thirds. Those who would delete it do not really persuade me that I should lower the threshold in this case (apart from the nominator's point about proliferation). They just cite "non-notable" which, being such a common reason does not stand out as a case for deletion at less than two-thirds. However, to simply keep the article would be to defy the intent of every editor's comments, so I will merge it. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:53, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. My interpretation of the 'average professor' rule is that while an average professor isn't notable, they're very close to notable, and it doesn't take very much to push them over the bar. The fact that he helped design state curricula might be enough on its own to take him over, and the contributions being controversial take him further over. Plus, being a professor from a top-5 university means he'd hardly be an average professor even if he did nothing else. He couldn't have achieved that if he hadn't made significant contributions to his field, even though those contributions aren't documented here.

<p><b>Delete</b> Unencyclopedic and neologistic. Obscure term, and not approporiate. Nobody uses this term, and the author is wasting server space with some perverse inside joke. And sorry, the argument that "I hear this on campus all the time" doesn't fly. It's not a mainstream term, 99% don't know what it means. Also there is already a page devoted to listing ethnic slurs, so why make a whole page? Momenchance 10:37, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). There is no consensus to delete the article, but based on the debate one could argue that this article ought to be merged. I am in a slight predicament here however, because the suggested merge target is List of vehicles from Grand Theft Auto, an article which contains only the names of the vehicles, and no descriptions. Merging content from this article there would disrupt the "flow" of that article, and so merging this would amount to merely turning this article into a redirect. For now, I will let the article stay, and if anyone wants to do anything else with it, such as make a redirect or find a suitable target article which accomodates the car descriptions, they may go ahead and be <b><a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a></b>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:57, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See José Vicente Rangel, Expediente negro. Caracas: Editorial Fuentes, 1969. This is a collection of documents and Rangel's parliamentary speeches on the murder of the PCV leader Alberto Lovera after Lovera's arrest by the DIGEPOL (political police) in 1966. • (see <a href="http://www.normangall.com/venezuela_art4_2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.normangall.com/venezuela_art4_2.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I voted delete in the original VfD. This article is still original research and is non-notable. A single published article in a journal of uncertain reputation is not notable. There is absolutely no evidence that anyone in the artificial intelligence field has given this idea even 10 seconds of thought, so it is not deserving of a wikipedia article. Since the entire article is based on a single reference, in addition to original research it also suffers from serious verifiability problems. The entire article is based on a <i>primary</i> source. In general wikipedia prefers <i>secondary</i> sources as we are unable to make any qualitative claims based on primary sources without falling victim to original research. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 04:18, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is still the same diskussion. This AfD yields no new facts and arguments. Surely, the topic is of low interest in the field of AI. We do not know if other fields are interested in the topic. But the low interest is still considered the only reason for deletion. On the other hand there is no question about the neutrality and factual accuracy, because unlike many other articles the topic has been reviewed by a <a href="http://www.oldenbourg.de/verlag/it-ti/rot-it1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.oldenbourg.de/verlag/it-ti/rot-it1.htm" rel="nofollow">league of authorities</a> in the field of information technology and is , therefore, scientifically proven.

<li><b>Delete</b> - vanity, neologism, non-notable. <i>is , therefore, scientifically proven</i> - the article is about a proposed concept, not about actual facts, so its content can't be proven or falsified.

<li><b>Delete</b> - honest to gosh, when I first saw this, I was horrified to find that vandals are uploading SCIgen papers!!! Closer examination revealed something which in a way is even more horrifying: this remarkably nonsensical article was written by a <i>human</i>! I see that this is the second time that this particular article has been proposed for deletion, and I agree with PJacobi's reasoning for renominating it: this article appears to be in clear violation of the proscriptions against "original research" [sic], vanity articles, and nonnotable topics. On rare occasions, nonsense <i>does</i> have a place in an encyclopedia (e.g. in a discussion of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Shannon_8ca9.html" title="Claude Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>'s famous illustration of the differences between sentences generated by Markov chains and by humans, or perhaps in a discussion of neurological pathology), but this article appears to me to lack redeeming virtues. The article is also misleading in that it mentions genuine technical jargon, but appears to use these words in nonstandard (and nonsensical) ways.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 17:18, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Although I listed this, there's no way I consider Freddie Mercury obscure. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:06, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Apathetic</b>,Meh, I added her because I saw her mentioned in the article for Freddie Mercury, so I decided to set up a stub and see if anyone had more info on her. I'd still like to get that info, but as no one is likely to have it, I don't care either way. Also, I agree with <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> that Freddie is by no means obscure -- Not a Registered User 03:45 PST, Sept. 12, 2005</li>
