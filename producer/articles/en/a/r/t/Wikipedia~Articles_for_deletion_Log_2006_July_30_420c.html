<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sure if Keenspot is independent (I've seen it refered to many times, perhaps incorrectly, as a "<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artist_collective.html" title="Artist collective">collective</a>," implying shared control by its artists); however, I believe that while it may be "well-known" to you and I it is not "well-known" in any sort of general sense. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 17:12, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

To me, the statistics of a retailing company covers sales information and its relation to demographics, and content such as the median age and income of a Wal-Mart customer, etc. Since this article has none of that, I believed a full delete was more appropriate. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 02:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. When patrolling New Articles I've seen a number of these new Pokemon additions to Wikipedia.

Second of all, the location is so non-notable that the article could <i>never</i> be more than a stub due to the simple lack of information about the topic.

<p>This isn't an "unreleased album" but a collection of songs that Eminem did in 1999-2000. Someone took these songs and put them together and released them as a bootleg "Psycho". But this is not an "unreleased album" in the sense that Eminem recorded this album but later it was shelved. It's a bootleg compilation and not even a very notable one at that. There are plenty of CDs like this featuring Eminem that are floating around out there. I've even made a couple myself. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrblondnyc_7b00.html" title="User:Mrblondnyc">MrBlondNYC</a> 00:54, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Should be deleted. The original author keeps reverting it to a version that reads and sound like an advertisement and a how-to guide, and it also sounds like it is ripped off from a gastric bypass surgery website. The version that was up as posted by me (207.210.15.85) tried to change it to sound more encyclopedic, but it is still not encylopedia material.

<dd>I really can't understand the logic in your lack of understanding this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First why not do a copyscape search for it if you believe it is ripped. Saying something is easy when you really don't know what your are talking about....</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as this article is extremely important for someone to know what to do after the surgery. Having the surgery is one matter this is the recovery and life style after the surgery in steps for someone that has little if any knowledge on nutrition. Kind of figures if the person has knowledge on nutrition would they need this surgery in the first place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I proved this article was correct and backed by Doctors who perform this operation now, Universities Colleges, and the Health Industry field.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Gastric bypass surgery has nothing to do with after surgery why would you want to direct this to that page completely wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I see you have removed my references from Hospitals, Doctors who perform this surgery now, and health related fields. I can't understand why this would be removed as well.... I would assume for someone to have an understanding of the article why do you only have up a portion of the article...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why not have a recovery article with the surgery Like having a heart bypass and not telling the person why or what you can do to prevent this form happening again</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I relatively puzzled by the logic here. Since when is 700 google hits too few? Especially since they rather firmly establish that the claim he was the editor was valid-you can read the editorials. And the notoriety earned which resulted in his expulsion is also noteworthy. I'm hardly fond of religous types, but that doesn't make them unnoteworthy. Unequivocal keep as meeting WP:NO.

<li><b>Keep</b> We have tens of thousands of articles on individual episodes of tv shows. This one appears to have been nominated simply because it is a stub.

<li>Individual episodes of television shows are notable <i>if the rest of the world has deemed them so</i>. The way that we can tell that the rest of the world deems them so is that individual episode guides have already been written and published by multiple sources independent of each show's creators/producers. "All episodes of type T television shows are notable" is just as flawed as any other "All X are notable" criterion. Notability is not a blanket. Wikipedia should reflect the subjects that the sources cover. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uncle G, are you suggesting we look for reliable sources independent of the show's creators, or just any sources? I could be wrong, but it seems doubtful to me that many television episodes have really been covered in much depth by mainstream media. The multiple sources that one finds on simpsons, babylon 5, star trek voyager episodes, and so on, probably consist of fan web sites, blogs, personal web pages, and message board postings. (on the other hand, we can find reliable sources for the bare bones details of most any tv show episode) --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 15:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We should look for <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">multiple non-trivial published works that are from sources independent of the subject</a>. With your doubt will come surprise. Many of these shows that people want to argue "are notable enough for articles on individual episodes", but don't have a firm basis for doing so other than a feeling, actually <i>do</i> have independently written non-trivial works published about them. <i>Babylon 5</i> has the famous Lurker's Guide. There are umpteen detailed episode guides for <i>Simpsons</i>, <i>Star Trek</i>, and so forth. If you are arguing that because the sources that you can readily locate are on the World Wide Web, we have no reliable sources that give episode guides, then I suggest that you attempt to counter that <a href="../../../f/u/t/FUTON_bias_4061.html" title="FUTON bias">FUTON bias</a> and look at books such as <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1590920376</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0440223857</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1590920392</a>. Sources for "bare bones details", such as a broadcast date and so forth, do not satisfy the "non-trivial" part of the criterion, which is there precisely to ensure that individual articles aren't mere directory entries.
<p>So the question to be answered here is "Are there episode guides for <i><a href="../../../m/o/e/Moesha.html" title="Moesha">Moesha</a></i>?" Or is this article <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> that is not based upon sources that have already analyzed this episode of this television series? Instead of arguing "All X are notable" (a deeply flawed argument), editors should be <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citing sources</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:49, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Want a source? <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0650264/" class="external autonumber" title="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0650264/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> - there, that's one. IMDB's got separate entries for every ep of every TV show now, and frankly, anyone deeming himself informed enough to vote on cinematic AfDs has to know about IMDB; half the media articles on Wikipedia link to it. As far as the general consensus that individual eps are notable, you could always lead (or join) a fight to change it. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Is it just me or is there a pattern going on here...) Plus, what do we accomplish if we delete it? Save a few kb on the wiki servers? What if something does come out? Boom, it's up there.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I had a quick look at the articles you listed, I would support a deletion on those - many are very advertise-ish and also do not seem to have any verifiable sources.

<li>We usually keep video games, but ROM hacks are <i>not</i> video games: they're vandalised (or otherwise altered) changes to the game code so that a game will appear differently using an emulator. They're a small subsection of emulation fandom, and not well known among gamers in general. They're not sold anywhere (obviously), and the video game press doesn't review or cover them. If you really want more proof that this is utterly non-notable, it gets <b><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Mushroom+Nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Mushroom+Nightmare%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">33 unique Google hits</a></b> and many of them, oddly enough, are random uses unrelated to this ROM hack. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:14, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure how I feel about the subject matter being encyclopedic or not. It certainly would help a person doing research on, say, sexuality in popular music. But I don't really feel strongly about it either way. The one thing I do think though -- those song quotes in the page have got to go! <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>★</sup></a> 14:38, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Short, attributed quotes are acceptable; you must identify the writer. As I understand it, what brings one into copyright violation space is quoting a significant percentage of the song.

<p>Article seems to promote an online game. From the article: "As of June 2006, the game had over 1300 coaches [i.e. players], each with his own virtual club. The game is completely ficticious and players are randomly generated when clubs are created. Ontheball is in its 6th season and has been running since 25 November 2002. The game is currently still under development and continues to be badged as being Beta until the game is stable." These claims don't impress me very much; in addition; the game's website has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ontheball.com.au%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ontheball.com.au%2F" rel="nofollow">no Alexa rank</a>.

<li><b>Delete.</b> You're never going to get a NPOV on this and still have it be a quality article. Some paragraphs are entirely "Windows users claim x. Linux users claim y. Windows users counter-claim z.", which doesn't make for good reading or good information. Anyone can claim anything and post it on a website, that doesn't merit its inclusion in an article. Particularely since most of the claims are from nebulous 'linux users' or 'windows users', which are hardly good sources. If the article was whittled down so that all these claims were of the form "&lt;reputable independantly funded study&gt; claims x" then it would be more interesting and informative than reading every gripe that every linux or windows user has ever had with the other OS.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's far too broad of a subject to be able to cover with the kind of standards expected of Wikipedia articles. For those looking to keep this article, please review <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_article_2aff.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect article">Wikipedia:The perfect article</a> and think about how a single article comparing -all- of Microsoft Windows (and I mean *everything*, not just Windows XP's shell and web browser) to -all- of Linux could possibly be written. Have a look at <a href="http://www.xvsxp.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.xvsxp.com/" rel="nofollow">www.xvsxp.com</a>, which attempts to do a fairly balanced comparasin of OS X Tiger (one version of OS X) and Windows XP (one version of Microsoft Windows); the site is quite large, certainly much larger than any Wikipedia article we've got, and yet that site aims to be far less all-encompassing than "Windows" vs. "Linux". They didn't even try to address "server" issues... and imagine how much more complex this will become once Windows Vista comes out... No, this kind of article really needs to go. If someone wants to start more focused articles comparing a specific aspect of each operating system (such as the user interface, or included applications), then I would support that. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 00:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. And how many of these bridges are non-notable according to your knowledge? While the flyovers are usually non-notable, practically every bridge spanning the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_River_adc2.html" title="Singapore River">Singapore River</a> are considered architectural heritage icons locally. Should all of these be deleted just because of non-notable flyovers? As for the flyovers, precisely they are non-notable, that a list is the most viable location to talk about them <i>collectively</i>. You dont just flag lists for deletion for a whole lot of red links.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Why is this detail needed? If one goes to the individual articles, all of the information about which river, and structure type would be available.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. And why should that detail be unrequired? What else does a bridge do? Sure, anyone can go to specific pages for those details, but you are assuming wikipedia cannot do summarisation for cross-comparison so much so that all details can only appear in their respective articles? I see lots of assumptions there on expected user behavior and needs, and I am not so sure if I am agreeable to all.

<dd>I think the adds + Conan + Grey's Anatomy easily do it. Since you're pressing me, a look at his website shows even more television appearances, he's doing a radio tour currently, and multiple media mentions (<i>Teen Vogue</i>, <i>Glamour</i>, <i>Perfoming Songwriter</i>).

<ol>
<li>No debate here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Raconteurs_9161.html" title="The Raconteurs">The Raconteurs</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Waronker_3049.html" title="Anna Waronker">Anna Waronker</a>, and <a href="../../../b/e/_/Be_Your_Own_Pet_4279.html" title="Be Your Own Pet">Be Your Own Pet</a> only have one album out, too, but meet other criteria, much like Pigg does.</li>
<li>WP:MUSIC actually says "Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show." A theme is an example, not the only rationale. His music has been performed on shows, and he's done live performances on notable media. He certainly meets this criteria.</li>
<li>This is tough to say, although registering as a major add on Records and Radio make this an arguable one.</li>
<li>WP:MUSIC simply says national tour. A national publicity tour is still a national tour.</li>

<ul>
<li>Thank you for the rebuttal. I think we are now clear about the cause of our disagreements, and that's a great step forward. My <b>summary</b> then is that Pigg's song appears on two episodes of one TV show, and he has/will perform live on his national publicity tour. I strongly suspect that "national tour" was meant to mean "a tour that people would actually pay money to go see." I think we should all resist a big label's attempt to buy an encyclopedic article for one of its performers without him/her actually earning the privilege through talent and hard work. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 18:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps it did. He still meets other criteria, and whether it's "a big label's attempt to buy an encyclopedic article for one of its performers" is irrelevant, really. We base encyclopedicness on a series of subjective criteria, and he meets it, so I'm not sure where the protest comes from. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The protest comes from the discussion of the points we've had above. If there are other criteria not already discussed, please note them. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 18:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a>, you chided me earlier for making "assumptions." You are making assumptions about this performer and his talent/hard work or lack thereof. I also think you're <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupting Wikipedia to make a point</a>, though certainly not to a high degree (AfDs are infamous for these kind of discussions... I'm just not sure why you're so passionate in this particular case). At this point, both sides have been presented, and I think it's time for other editors to have a turn to make a decision for themselves, and perhaps we should suspend our contributions to this discussion and let the AfD ride out. No reason for the people who have already commented on here to harp on further about their opinions. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 18:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm looking at his article and it's bleak: one album, two tv episodes playing his song, and a publicity tour. The assumption is that this somehow makes him notable. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 19:28, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, of the points above, we have one agreement, one disagreement of the interpretation of the touring requirement, and one where you were incorrect and he meets. None of your points discuss the multiple media mentions that are clearly linked and displayed on his website, either, so we have two absolutely certain ones. I also haven't had any luck finding past tour information for him, but I have a feeling he's actually done a tour on his own, too. That's two definitely verifiable parts of WP:MUSIC he meets in any case, and, past that, I'll re-paste what WP:MUSIC says here: "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted." Given everything we know about him, deletion seems misguided. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I grouped the multiple media mentions under the category of "publicity tour," and argue that <i>publicity tours are not notable</i> - they are a routine part of the entertainment business. The fact that you <i>think</i> he's had a previous tour is certainly <i>not</i> verifiable and not grounds for passing WP:MUSIC. Lastly, and for the sake of honesty, let's share the <i>whole</i> quote: "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; <i>likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept.</i>" <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 18:55, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"I also haven't had any luck finding past tour information for him, but I have a feeling he's actually done a tour on his own, too." Excuse me? That's "verification?" Our <i>feelings</i> are completely irrelevant. Either he has -- and you can verify that -- or he hasn't.

<li>I knew I shouldn't have mentioned my suspicions of the tour (and I wasn't trying to pass it off as a rock-solid rationale, for the record). My point is simple - he has multiple media mentions (even outside of the tour) and has had his music performed on notable media (Conan, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>).

<li><b>Keep</b> It is common knowledge that Wikipedia is not an "indiscriminate collection" and that we have wikiquotes. But i argue that the nomination is flawed in its logic. The article is not indiscriminate, it describes and represent a real phenomena that it sources to (1) <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">David Ickes</a> website, (2) <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Islam_d7b5.html" title="Radio Islam">Radio Islam</a>, (3) whatreallyhappened.com, (4) <a href="../../../c/o/u/CounterPunch_f9ea.html" title="CounterPunch">CounterPunch</a>, (5) <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rense.com.html" title="Rense.com">Rense.com</a> (6) <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamonline.net.html" title="Islamonline.net">islamonline.net</a> and more. Within those sites, each one (except whatreallyhappened) having their own article here on wikipedia, it can not be said to be a "indiscriminate collection", rather, its a well organized and intentfull collections of quotations aimed to achieve a specific aim. And that is why moving to wikiquote is not appropriate either. This articles main objective is not to present the quotes, rather to represent the <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenomena.html" title="Phenomena">phenomena</a> that the practice of using this quotes represent. The quotes are there to give examples of the phenomena, which is evident since every quote is sourced to its main source, or it stats that it lacks such, and then proceeds to show what <b>secondary sources use them to defame Israel and Zionist</b>. The quotes <b>in the article</b> are not cherrypicked, they are picked from <b>list that cherry pick</b>: A huge and important disstinction. The quotes being inflammatory to Zionists is totally irrelevant. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:08, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>So, you'd be OK with List of nasty things muslims have said about America or List of Anti-Semitic remarks made by Arabs?

<li>I was actualy thinking about creating a counterpart, maybe Controversial anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist quotes, and put them both on the "Arab-Israeli conflict" template. I have absolutly no problem with that. Only questions that needs to be answered is if Zionist proponens have the same practice of listing anti-zionist quotes. I do not understand " <i>an article about controversies that gave quotes as examples would be fine. Bringing them together is not neutral</i>", could you elaborate on that, so i understand?

Re "what is POV pushing": the choice and editing (context and lack thereof) of the quotes.

Whenever you find yourself typing "you seem to think..." the "delete" key is a pretty good choice.

<dd>Listen, a list of quotes might be POV, OR, out-of-context or whadever. BUT. It is <b>not</b> the article that originaly researched the quotes, the quotes in the article are <b>prominently</b> used in the lists of quotes describes. Let me put it this way: If i was to take a biblical verse, and claim it to be false, it would be OR. But if i quote the Qur'an doing the same, then it is ok. You understand my point? "Doing OR" = Wrong, "Reporting on OR" = Right. If <b>i</b> was to create a list of quotes out of thin air, that would be POV, OR, out-of-context or whadever, BUT i am NOT doing that, i am REPORTING that some PEOPLE are doing that. And THAT IS encyclopedic. Maybe you are arguing that it is not encyclopedic to report on those peoples habits of creating list of quotes? And by the way, just not liking to see the list is not a reason to argue to delete.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm just going to go with my original vote. After considering the many sock arguments, I just cannot see any significant notability emerging (other than "he is a hero to the karala people"). The sockpuppets and personal attacks have to stop. It's getting a little ridiculous. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="DodgerBlue"><b>alpha</b></font><font color="black"><b>Chimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>laudare</b></a></sup> 14:51, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Alpha. Do not take a hasty decision. All are not socks. Many admins and some like jyothis are genuine editors who are from malayalam wiki.I may be new here but have sincere intentions and am here to expand the music section with many more articles on singers of kerala (Already started one on <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gayatri_Asokan_4397.html" title="Gayatri Asokan">Gayatri Asokan</a>). Jyothis has given many more links to clear the notability issue. Also please could you explain why this should be deleted? You already might have known that he is a hero for the kerala people. If so he should be notable! The huge response is natural as he has a big fan following in kerala. There are also some other people like <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amit_Sana_ac08.html" title="Amit Sana">Amit Sana</a> who have an article. Why are you all silent on the many comments on amit's article? Sock or no sock you should have a reason. somasundaran's article satisfies so many wiki guidelines while only one is required to qualify it. So what is the problem here? Anyway jyothis has come out with so many links to prove credibility, notability and verifiability(see down). You can also ask him (anyone) to improve or modify the article.Also understand that the section on playback singers from kerala is very weak. Don't we need to improve it? Also seems the so called pradipsomasundaran who wrote the article first was just a fan who was after some fun and is no more on this scene. But fact remains that he has just managed to bring this unnessary controversy by putting up a half baked article in the first place. But we feel that this wonderful artist should not be disgraced further due to this imposter's mistakes and by people such as Angeo who seem to have stooped to low levels of personal attacks. That's why all are pained. This has become a fight for dignity for all of us from Kerala. Also now the article has some dignity and now the vanity issues should not be insisted as the original editor has run away. Please remember that we are all judging on a wonderful singer in his absence!The only way we can end this seemingly unending ridiculous war is stopping this on a good note with dignity restored for the singer.But we should give praise to all who managed to bring up so many information on the singer. Let's take all relevant and useful info and use it to put up a good article instead of turning a blind eye to their efforts.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I believe this guy is genuine. But I don't think he has achieved enough fame to merit a wikipedia article. The links provided which go the newspaper <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">The Hindu</a> were verified by me. Some of the article just mentions his name with a long list of other singers which just say that he is going to sing at this function/festival/programme. Also the <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a> article mentions that he has just sung for one film which is Manasam. Some of the singers which this page has mentioned such as Sunidhi Chauhan have sung in many fims/albums. Also they are known throughout India.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, some of the comments mentions that he has worked with well known music directors such as Kaithapram and Ravindran. Google shows absolutely no hits regarding this. Google hits must not be used as a basis for an article but it could mean PS has worked with them in one movie or a song.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, Pradeep Somasundaran's google hits show it to be 901. But on further inspection, there are just about a dozen sites which really mention this guy. --<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgeo020_177d.html" title="User:Ageo020">Ageo020</a> 21:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Pradip Somasundaran is genuine, very much so! 'Meri Awaaz Suno' was probably the first every Indian TV competition for singing talents and was endorsed by the likes of Yash Chopra. This show was hosted by Anu Kapur, and was one of the very few popular programmes on Doordarshan at the time. It is true that Pradip did not get a major break in the Hindi music scene, even after being a clear winner on a national stage. However, he has worked with some of the great music directors in south indian languages like Ravindran and Ilayaraja.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.26.31.106 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.26.31.106_99af.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.26.31.106">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I understand you desire to have an article on Wikipedia. How about just placing the article in your userspace and dropping the whole matter? It'll show up in people's google searches, giving you what you're looking for. You have yet to cite some <i>notable news source</i> asserting your significance. I'm thinking something like BBC, New York Times, etc - something Wikipedia users have heard of. As for flooding this AfD with anonymous opinions...it's just silly. Anybody can see through the pattern of edits. Quite frankly, your interests would have been best served by posting one clear, well written opinion regarding your notability. I'm just saying. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:DodgerBlue;font-size:95%;"><b>alpha</b></span><span style="color:black; font-size:105%;"><b>Chimp</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>laudare</b></a></sup> 22:05, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would like to disagree on some of the above points. This may seem like a wiki war but please bear with me.</dd>
<dd>1. If he is a noted playback singer, why does IMDB list only Manasam as his only credit. Being a notable singer, why does he only feature in only 3-4 articles in the Hindu. Why doesn't he come in other South Indian newspapers like Malayala Manorama, Deepika, Indian Express or Mathrubhumi. (please consider that this is not an attack on the reputation of the Hindu)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: See here. <a href="http://www.musicindiaonline.com/l/20/c/singer/" class="external free" title="http://www.musicindiaonline.com/l/20/c/singer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicindiaonline.com/l/20/c/singer/</a> This lists more songs. Still this is not complete</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These have malayalam fonts and do not appear in searches. Simple fact! If you want more articles just on this person enough can be provided as he he performs all over the state.</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMDB is very unreliable for judging the significance of Malayalam film personalities. It may be used to argue that someone is notable, but never than someone is not. It lists five films for Baburaj and two for Dakshinamoorthy while the actual number is well over hundred for both.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Google hits on this guy are very few. A noted playback singer must generate atleast 1000 hits. Even though he has 901 hits, only 10-12 actually mention his name as a singer. The rest are just hits for the surname somasundaran.( sunidhi chauhan, PS's co-winner in MAS generates 160,000 hits)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: See searching the name pradeep somasundaram. He is also listed in this name.This will give you another 900 odd results. Then the total make it almost 1800! So that will get you to your magic number of 1000. After all who brought this rule that a playback singer ought to have at least 1000 hits? Strange!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3. The site blogswara just has below 8000 hits. And there is no mention of this site in any national newspaper comparing it to open source revolution. Also please note that the site has just about 10 songs to be downloaded, one of which belongs to PS.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: Did you except all songs to be sung by Pradip? The site clearly tells that this is a joint effort. Not a single persons album.Silly argument which does not guage a person's popularity. If so all films &amp; albums would have songs only by single persons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4. Podbazaar is the audio version of <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youtube.html" title="Youtube">Youtube</a>. Users actually upload a songs or interview and write an article about it. It means that a user can write anything about it. It's not necessarily reliable. Also note that podbazaar is not in the top 100,000 sites according to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa.html" title="Alexa">Alexa</a>.( it is around the 1 million mark.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Answer: We are not talking about Podbazar's popularity here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please do answer this question: Is there a meter by which you can guage a person's popularity? No. Have you lived in Kerala since 1996? Have you heard this person's songs? Then why do you say that he is not popular? Based just on the Internet searches?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Info on the net is based on what info we feed into it. Kerala is very bad in internet density. Broadband started here only in 2005! So it will take some time for people in Kerala to be internet savvy. Please take all these facts into consideration.--59.93.35.130 12:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b></dd>
<dd>Ageo, I dont know on what basis you say that other major dailys has not recognised the person in question. The Hindu has a good online edition and I believe that you will not be searching in the native language, say malayalam or tamil. the problem with the current system that uses the ascii fonts used by individual language dailys are custom-built, which takes out the searchability. hence, I would think that the argument which says he doesnt generate google listing does not hold much good.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I would like to know how many movies are listed in IMDB, with a comparison to the actual number of movies released. this is to identify the authenticity of the argument that says that IMDB doesnt have any records.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please note that the blogswara recorded 5000+ hits and 300+GB downloads within no time of release of its first album, in which the person is a part of.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>On the point that Sunidhi chauhan generated that many, please note that she sings in Hindi, which has a wider audience level and reachability in the net. whereas the other languages are yet to make their way into the internet community in the level as hindi has.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately being mentioned in a list of other people, all of whom performed does not constitute a "feature" as in "Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers." A "feature" is (from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">wiktionary</a>) " 1. An important or main item." Being listed in the context of many others who participated in an <i>event that was features</i> does not constitute a "feature." As far as the unreliability of search tools to properly reflect foreign-language sources, this may have to condemn the article to unverifiability (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeidenstud_07d3.html" title="User:Seidenstud">Seidenstud</a> 03:01, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b></dd>
<dd>Is this a wiki war? Seems like one of your mods Ageo is bent on making it so! He seems to be from Kerala and still bent upon to discredit a person about whom he does not know anything. Hey accept the facts. The other mods are more mature.Have a broader outlook.
<dl>
<dd>contention1): Why is pradip singled out when the abhijit sawants/amit sanas all have articles here?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am a press reporter &amp; writer based in Kerala and know this singer since 1994. I think it's time to close this discussion.Most of the supporting comments are from amateur fans. I am a passerby and was alarmed to see so much talk based on just news from internet! Net or google is not the final word on any person's popularity or talent it also gives incorrect and incomplete facts many times.There is more to a celebrity than google. Has anyone of the mods here has ever heard this man's voice? You can judge his popularity from his music blog. It's unfair to comment on a person's talent &amp; popularity from factual materials just from the Internet without taking a round up of other important factors like regional popularity and support.So thought of giving some clear facts without any bias as one of the mods here has suggested.</p>
<p>A celebrity is more than internet news. It takes just minutes to be one and years to sustain it.Pradip became a celebrity for all malayalees in 1996 and is still going strong after 10 years.</p>
<dl>
<dd>contention 2): I found articles about Kazi, Abhijeet Sawant, Amit Sana</dd>
</dl>
<p>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Amit_Sana" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Amit_Sana" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Amit_Sana</a> - This man does not have any material to support any claims as per this wiki but still he is there!)and even just some participants of the Indian idol/ program on your wiki who are here just due to this single T.V program! Some have not even sung a single film song or any album to credit!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Who authorised this article to stay without even an iota of supporting facts as pradip has?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then why should pradip not be here? (Just a contention)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Contention 3) The same rule should apply for everyone.He is a celebrity since 1996. Some</dd>
</dl>
<p>of his achievements are as below.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) 1991-President's Gold medal winner in A.I.R National level Light Music</dd>
</dl>
<p>competetion</p>
<dl>
<dd>2) 1996- Lata mangeshkar Award for best male singer of India in Meri Awaz</dd>
</dl>
<p>Suno, the first National level Televised Music competetion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>3) 1997- The prestegious TOYI (Ten Outstanding Young Indian Award) given by</dd>
</dl>
<p>JCI International which is recognition to his contributions <a href="http://www.pradipsomasundaran.com/images/toyi.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.pradipsomasundaran.com/images/toyi.jpg" rel="nofollow">TOYI Award</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>4) 1998- Best T.V Playback singer of Kerala award for the</dd>
</dl>
<p>song"Ennakkaruppin"</p>
<dl>
<dd>5) He is a regular in many T.V programs and has done a listless number of</dd>
</dl>
<p>Albums.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This list is endless and they are only some of his major achievement..He has</dd>
</dl>
<p>performed all over India &amp; in all the gulf countries many times.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So your first requirement of having won atleast an award of National repute</dd>
</dl>
<p>is satisfied as he has won three such awards.</p>

<dd>Mod's: The list and details about Indian Playback singers is very new and</dd>

<p>without much indepth info. Why don't we all try to expand it rather than closing out such talents. You should also expand to wider areas of information other than just basing your findings on the number of google hits.</p>
<ul>
<li>An encyclopaedia should try to bring comprehensive info on even the smallest info.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wiki should also be about trying to find real talents(who do have contributed in their fields) who need to be introduced to the whole world. Let's not shun away from expanding knowledge and throwing light for the world. No one should be discriminated against.Let's give credit to the people who introduce such new faces to the wiki. Isn't the whole existence of the wiki based on expansion of such new info?</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Pradip has been on the music scene since 1996 since he won Meri Awaz Suno. This music show was the forerunner of the many later music shows such as Sa Re Ga Ma and Indian Idol. Also note that he is a major celebrity in his home state of Kerala. Also according to <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> not many people outside South India will know him. Hence, he is culturaaly significant for him to merit an article over here. --202.150.117.156 05:35, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;: Pradip Somasundaran is truly Self-made. He is very talented and has many achievements to his credit. How Popular are Internet and Google in 1996 when he won the talent show for Meri Awaz Suno which was famous and broad cast all over India on television channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indian national Newspapers like to sell their stuff based on political news . We are discussing about talent here. Wiki needs to introduce people of talent instead of repeating something already on the net. His contribution to music in Kerala is remarkable.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> He is a well known singer in Kerala. Google hits on him will be far and few. But that doesn't mean malayalam and local newspapers don't cover him. The Hindu is one of the major South Indian newspaper which keeps a good online record. Also local TV networks cover him regularly. He has worked with great music directors such as Ravindran and Illayaraja. Some of his music albums are all the rage in college campuses throughout Kerala. At the time of his victory in Meri Awaz Suno, he was interviewed by every TV network in South India. But as 10 years have passed since then, not many people will remeber him. One of the users is hell bent on destroying his credibility, I am sorry for him --<a href="../../../1/3/0/User%7E130.216.191.84.html" title="User:130.216.191.84">130.216.191.84</a> 23:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>From all the above mentioned information, the following points are enough to merit his article here 1) He has sung in many Films (only some are indicated in Internet as database is old) . Heard he sang in a new film of for Ramesh Narayan. Saw the news from papers. So he is a playback singer and active. He is a life member of M.A.C.T.A (Malayalam Cine Technicians Association) 2) His songs appear on Television channels almost every day! 3) He has two Awards of National repute 4) He has a music blog which is live proof of his activity in music field and his blog is listed the fifth in it's category in India <a href="http://www.indianbloggers.com/category/music/" class="external text" title="http://www.indianbloggers.com/category/music/" rel="nofollow">Indian Bloggers Website</a>and touching 6000 hits in a span of 3 months! 5) He has participated in International Youth Exchange programs two times. 6) He propagates the use of free software in Kerala. 7) He is an eminent lecturer who teaches Electronics which makes him special and different from ordinary singers All these show that he is a multifaceted personality. I found even lesser mortals having articles written on them. Whay have you not gone after such people? So let there be sanity. Let talent courtesy and vanity get it's worth.

<li><b>Pradip Somasundaran</b> is indeed a playback singer. The (auto)bio that appears in this article is almost accurate. I know this man very well and his brother was a colleague of mine. His "Meri Awaz Suno" feat was front-page news for almost all dailies in Kerala at that time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pradip Somasundaran is not very famous nowadays. As you can see in the article, he was on a roll till 1998; limelight has eluded him since then.</p>
<p>That said, let me admit that I am a bit surprised seeing him in Wikipedia. As I said, he is not that famous; yet he is not an ordinary keralite either. Let me say, for a brief period of time, he was a somewhat-well-known guy.</p>
<p>Overall a very funny situation..is he famous enough to get into wiki? Mind you, to an ordinary (non-netizen) keralite he will be more famous than wiki!</p>
<p>However, I think this article should be deleted. Reason? Take a look at it's history. A pathetic attempt for fame and publicity.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Indian wikipedians are not Gods and they are not the masters of wikipedia. Also any wikipedian who lives outside Kerala and has not been in Kerala for more than two years cannot claim to be an authority in this matter. Some contentions like "he was famous then" "he is not famous now' are very immature in the case of celebrities in music, acting, film direction etc. Oce a celebrity is always a celebrity. here there is no need for any concern as somasundaram is very active in giving live shows, T.V programs all across kerala. I even saw his program on Kairali channel yesterday and on doordarshan almost every day! His program Anjali on Amrita T.V is still continuing after 2 years and has won two state level awards. Hence the knowledge of our admins who are away in far places from kerala and those who do not watch television but go on typing on their keyboards though very sincere in this matter is mostly half baked and outdated. So they cannot be blamed.</li>
</ul>

<dd>He is also a regular participant in Swaralaya Music &amp; Dance festival at Palakkad and is performing there this october too! Fact can be cheched from their website <a href="http://www.swaralayapalakkad.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.swaralayapalakkad.com/" rel="nofollow">Swaralaya</a>. He is also to perform for a fund raising program by the Malayalam Film fraternity in Cochin. So who says that he is not active in the first place? Such reckless opinions are only personal opinions and not the truth. If he were not famous now he would not be invited again and again for programs all over Kerala. SO this amounts to deliberate attemopt to defame the singer and is serious matter. The fact is that any famous artist has highs and lows in his career. Right from Michael Jackson to Whitney Houston and the great Rafi in India had bad phases. Jackson and houston have had long times when they have not had any new releases. So will our wiki admin's delete their pages? This is rubbish and immature thinking. If it were such we would have to remove articles of all such people and dead people since their current contributions are nil! Once a person attains celebrity status it is for his whole life. He or she stays in the heart of millions of fans for a particular reason which is for keeps. They may sway between active and passive phases of their career. Anyway this guy is only around 40! He also seems to have up's and downs. But seems quite stable with so many albums awards and achievements to credit. What the hell more are you looking at here? The article also says that he sang for "Art of Living International" which is indeed prestigious if true. Some articles mentioned above like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_sana" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_sana" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_sana</a> are stupid in that they do not have anything on the person concerned. He has no album to credit and also their is no award list or any material that would be termed suitable for his qualification for a wiki article. "Many believe that Amit Sana is a superior singer to Abhijeet and that he only won due to female support but Amit remains great friends with Abhijeet they made a special appearance in season 2 of Indian Idol where he and Abhijeet along with Aditi Paul performed a song together" These are the wordings used in this article! The admin's who are keeping their eyes shut to such rubbish hearsay should hang their heads in shame! So who put it there and why there is no hue and cry about this one??? He has not even won an award. He is just a runner up! There are so many singers in Kerala like Manjari, gayatri who have only 100 and 6 hits in google! So does that mean that they are not celebrities or playback singers&#160;? They are State Government award winners. It is foolish to says that a playback singer has to have 1000 google hits. Who made this rule? Gayatri and manjari are the leading female singers in Malayalam. If an some wiki admin who lives abroad did not hear about them does it mean that they do not exist?</dd>
<dd>Shame on such Admins. They should be reported to the arbitration committe for such immature comments and shouls not be allowed to function as Admins.</dd>
<dd>As for me somasundaran (even if he started the article which i doubt as the first version was like some of his fans one trying to have some fun) satisfies all requirements of having an article here in wiki <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)" rel="nofollow">WP:BIO Notability</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(music)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(music)" rel="nofollow">WP:MUSIC</a> Both the above norms more than satisfied in his case.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Musicians and ensembles There are a lot of bands, singers and other musicians and musical ensembles with articles in the Wikipedia (see Category:Musicians).</p>
<ul>
<li>A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, DJ, musical theatre group, etc.) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country.[1]</li>
</ul>
<p>Has had a record certified gold or higher in at least one large or medium-sized country.</p>
<ul>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,[1] reported in notable and verifiable sources.</li>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</li>
<li>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...).</li>
<li>Has won a major music award.</li>
<li>Has won or placed in a major music competition.</li>
<li>Has been the subject of a half hour or longer broadcast on a national radio network.(He is a graded Radio and T.V artist)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>He satisfies all the above requirements SO IS HIGHLY NOTABLE. So why have you put this article for deletion in the first place? So close this matter now. All other personal likes and dislikes like whether he was popular before, is popular now or will be in future, is nonsense as THERE ARE CLEAR GUIDELINES TO GUIDE US ON THIS. So all personal references like "I have not heard this guy", "he should have won all major competetions in India", etc. do not hold any ground at all.</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>WHETHER HE IS POPULAR NOW OR NOT IS NOT THE ISSUE HERE AS SOME PERSONS ARE DELIBERATELY TRYING TO SHIFT ATTENTION. THE ONLY ISSUE IS WHETHER HE SATISFIES ANY OF THE CRITERION AS PER WIKI NORMS.All other personal comments of what someone thinks on his poularity are to be ignored. There is no meter for poularity and this cannot be acertained mere google searches and by people who are away and are not living in kerala. Let this be decided by we who live here!</dd>

<p><br />
I think now some wikipedia users behave like this sender. <b>Coz i never heard abt Pradip so how can u say?</b> Don’t be behaving like this! <b>A real wiki pedia user who interested in music should know about all singers</b>. He is really a good singer. He is really multitalented like a Teacher in Electronics dept and a singer.</p>
<p>we can never compare him with Yesudas or MG Sreekumar. And <b>he is not a notable Play back singer</b>. <b>But he is a notable singer</b>. And <b>he deserved for this article</b>.</p>
<p><br />
<b>I never say to delete this article</b>.</p>

But need modification. I think there is no need of maximize the article with his all details. And <b>maximum try to minimize the article with necessary details.</b>

<p><b>Comment</b> Alpha Chimp. This is not an article about a Mozart or a Beethoven, only about a singer who now as seen from the info and various comments is notable through his awards and T.v programs. So even if there are socks they have been very informative and have countered vague arguments very well. So I think they can be excused.I think we should give the credit to Jyothis who has compiled the facts. Tintin I think this writeup is not too big. Have see many huge articles like here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton" rel="nofollow">Eric Clapton</a>, and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayachandran" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayachandran" rel="nofollow">Jayachandran</a>(which is more hearsay,over descriptive and not neutral. It also smacks of hero worship). Also since the credibility of this person was in question, Jyothis did the right thing by making the article more comprehensive, and wiki friendly.He has laid out only the facts and information about this singer who has been mis-understood by many wikipedians who are not in Kerala.After all this is our job, bringing out the truth and compelling the people who want such articles to be published to be more accurate. So now Admins please go after the Amit Sanas, Prof. Bindu's and such people. let the people who started this article heave a sigh of relief and improve upon it. Enough time has been spent already debating on this. Admin's take a decision now without going for the extra day.--<a href="../../../g/l/u/User%7EGluewhale_a099.html" title="User:Gluewhale">Gluewhale</a> 15:21, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You do not have any basic knowledge of wiki! You have made all silly references like 1) 1000 hits in google to be a playback singer 2) Close up Antakshari being a music talent show.</p>
<p><b>From your Quote</b> <b>"" *</b>Delete <b>the singer may have won the trophy but its not a trophy well known to other indians.

<p>This was your silly comment in the begening where you wanted this person to win all singing competetions in India (Are you his mentor?)</p>
<p>You said you have not heard him. What importance does this have here on this discussion. You might not have heard about many persons. That shows your ignorance and arrogance not knowledge.You do not have any proven competance in music to prove professional competence of this person. This has been already done by the people who gave him so many awards and made him sing in so many films, albums, T.V shows and live shows in India and abroad. This is not your job. Your job was to see whether the article satisfies wiki norms and you had no business to poke into competance and poularity polls. <b>YOU DID NOT DO YOUR JOB IMPARTIALLY AND WITH NEUTRALITY.</b> Thousands of malayalees including admins here know him and have heard him. Now you want to shut their voices by this last ditch futile attempt? There is also a complaint that you sent anonymous hate mails to the singer's blog and some nasty campaigns making this a personal war. We have proof that you sent personal invitation to other wikipedians from your page to help you in this hate campaign which is below the dignity of any wikipedian. You do not have any right to do so. Your actions speak for your sick mind!</p>

<p><b>This is a message to all Category:Kerala Wikipedians</b></p>
<p>I want your opinion on this particular person Pradip Somasundaran. He claims to be a famous singer in Kerala. Now being a Malayalee, I have not heard of this person before, so I wonder whether or not you have heard of him before and set this issue straight. If so, then please let your opinion be counted at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pradip Somasundaran. Please note that by voicing your opinion as a Malayalee/Keralite will add more weight to your words.</p>
<p>Many Thanks --Ageo020 21:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Hey PS Yes, you are right. I have not lived in Kerala in the past 2 years. That doesn't mean I am not familiar with it. Now Amrita TV is not a TV channel watched by the masses. They watch Surya, Asianet or Kairali. If you have been seen on this channel, it means to me in my biased opinion that you are not too famous to have an article in wikipedia. Also remember that there are many singers who have cut their own records. That doesn't mean they have to have an article too.</b></p>
<pre>
  Plus I am a frequent listener to malayalam film songs and I have certainly not heard of you. Do not waste your time ranting about whether the article should be deleted or not. Instead focus your energy on singing and becoming famous and then having someone else to have an article written about you. This letter may make you more angry, but I am sorry.

<p>I found these messages on your page and on the person impersonating as user pradipsomasundaran. These clearly show your immature dirty mind and illegal actions. <b>This also proves that all your comments are biased as you yourselves have admitted to this here! You have used abusive language with intent to disgrace defame and provocating a person.</b> If the real Pradip Somasundaran finds this out you will cut a very sorry figure for yourselves! This is enough to file a case against you in the arbitration section man!</p>
<p><b>Admins: Remove this person soon. He is a disgrace to wiki. He is just an editor(counter vandalism unit member?) and claimed to be an Admin with an Admin box on his page which was removed when some one reported this.</b> He also is a novice who started editing in March 2006 and yest behaves as if he is the owner of wiki.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The outcome of this this discussion will be decided on merit not your ego! After this is over your actions will be reported to the arbitration committe. Except you all the other people who have commented, including admins have behaved sensibly with reason and dignity.</b></p>
<p>All your silly arguments have been put to rest by many many of the people who commented here. Now that you do not have anything to say, rather than replying to the observations you become a mouth for some other admin and be a cry baby and say that "hey, all the supporters are fake!" You have not replied to the Amit Sana issue so far. Why are you showing double standards?" When you started spreading lies did you expect others to be quiet? Now you will tell that even the other admins are socks. This is a futile futile attempt again. Where were you all this time?</p>
<p><b>Let's stop trying to disprove the already proven celebrity status of one of the most talented young singers of kerala who still has a long way to go. No other singer in kerala sings so well in so many languages and so many styles! He does not have many film songs but he is not retired and is only around 40. He is also very active as a singer with many programs. There is nothing we or he can gain or loose in this unnessary debate. Let's show maturity. Enough material proof has been provided by many for his credibility. He satisfies more than one criterion for an article here.</b></p>
<p><b>Have you all editors and mods from kerala seen how many singers from malayalam have a decent page here? And we call ourselves malayalees??? Only K.J Yesudas has a terific page here in wiki standards. P. Jayachandran also is o.k. But none of the singers gave a good article here! Is it because they all do not have 1000 google hits? Time to stop this silly argument.</b> All the playback singers including kamukara, udayabhanu, unnimenon, venugopal, gayatri, jyotsna, rimi tomi, vidhu pratap, manjari who are loved and adored by lakhs of malayalees do not have a page here! Let pradip's page be an eye-opener to all those who want to take up this issue and make the section of malayalam playback singers strong. Why is it so that malayalees are the biggest "paras" to malayalees?(sorry this usage will be understood by malayalees only. Not in wiki dictionary) Let's all forget personal ego's and get to improving information on all the great playback singers in Malayalam instead of degrading them.

<p>Pradip is a well known singer of kerala.He has done many albums in malayalam.And one of the most commenting thing about him is i think no malayalee sings hindi songs as good as him. So there is no need for a deletion. [User:Tharanath R] 04:30, 5 August 2006</p>

<b>Request to the new editors (especially Jyothis and Gluewhale) who added their comments here</b> : Since you all seem very passionate about articles related to Kerala, I wonder whether you guys would like to hang around a little longer in Wikipedia, instead of disappearing the moment this AfD is over. There are not many articles about Kerala and even those which are, are mostly not in a good shape. We could do with a bit of help in improving the articles.

<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p><b>I end my defense of this article by presenting a comprehensive list of verifiable documents above along with what has been presented by jyothis from various sites which PROVES BEYOND DOUBT that he is a very very notable guy. Not only a great singer of Kerala but a multifaceted talent who has spread his knowledge &amp; talent not only in Indian but also abroad. The Govt. of India has sent him two times abroad to Japan for his talents (we lesser mortals do not even have heard of such programs!). Other than the "Lata Mangeshkar Trophy" he has been honoured both in India and abroad two times, one by by the JCI with TOYI and other the Dubai Kairali Kalakendram for his contribution to music. He has won two awards in Kerala too for contribution to music. He also won an International talent competetion. He has done shows abroad and is still actively doing music shows, singing in films, singing in albums, singing in T.v programs, propagating linux, technology in India and abroad. Now what more do you want from this person?</b></p>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b> and <b>merge</b> the content back in to the main page. As far as the deletion independent of the PETA article itself: all of the people on the page are notable in and of themselves (by virtue of them being real,established articles). All of the entries have references, and the wording at the top gives a fairly clear criteria. So I'm not seeing any reason to delete this page without a merge.</p>
<p>The main arguments for not having the information on the parent page itself are "space" and "POV". The space reason is very weak, given the size of the parent article. The POV argument seems to have been mostly addressed in the talk page, and the criteria at the top of this page nullifies a good part of the arguments against the section's inclusion in the parent. I recommend merging the section back in, and taking further problems with it to the talk page or to one of our fine dispute resolution systems (this is really not an AFD issue anymore). Since this obviously draws out strong feelings, I'll refrain from deleting the article, pending the inevitable deletion review of this controversial page. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 07:36, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's a list of names and external links, usually to PETA websites. It's not an encyclopaedic article.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- Actually, this list was spun off because it took way too much space in the main article and imparted a POV spin on the article dedicated to the organisation (which is itself controversial). It was the opinion of several editors of the article that this list doesn't belong in the article per se. It was created as an alternative to simply removing the list from the article (which was in danger of causing an edit war). Spinning it off seemed like an acceptable compromise. --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 15:22, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - The PETA controversy is certainly encylopedic (although allowing too much unbalance is not). Not sure there are existing criteria for this particular case, so I detect a new criterion emerging—articles which faciliate maintaining the NPOV designation of the main article are worthy of retention. If so, I struggle with the merit of that approach, but... <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 15:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> No. If an article is judged by the AfD process to be unencyclopaedic, it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. Creating an unencyclopaedic article to deal with unencyclopaedic material in another article is passing the buck. This article should be judged on its own merits, not by the wishes of the contributors to another article <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:black; background-color:lightblue; font-weight:bold">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 10:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Celebrities' affiliation with this controversial group is considered very notable by the media, so it's fair game for a list like this -- just so long as the names are cited and verifiable.

<li><b>Merge</b> back into the main article; that's where it belongs.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Unencyclopedic list with little objective criteria. What makes each supporter "notable" enough to be on the list? "Supporter" is also not defined.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The prior comment is incorrect. When discussed, we keep articles on notable topics that also meet all of our other policies. AFD is a process in which we decide about what is notable, and we only hold AFDs for articles, so the fact that there is an article is not a proof of notability. At the most, the existence of an article proves only that at least one person in the world thinks the topic is worthy of an article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:05, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If you mean to say that some or all of the names on the list are non-notable, then one should logically also name the articles pertaining to those persons deemed non-notable for the AfD process. Disputing the notability of the people on the list without first disputing their Wikipedia articles is logically akin to putting the cart in front of the horses (or oxen, depending on your ethnic background).--<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 18:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. As per Agent 86's comments. Articles on Wikipedia get contested for notability everyday. Having an article in Wikipedia is <i>not</i> "proof" of notability. If it were, contesting notability in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> wouldn't be possible and every <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a> page out there would be validly notable, just because it's here. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllisonmontgomery69_6291.html" title="User:Allisonmontgomery69">Allisonmontgomery69</a> 23:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">Vanity pages</a> are written everyday on Wikipedia, and AfDs to get rid of them are also written up. However, most of the names in that list are well-known and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals_5e68.html" title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">PETA</a> is itself notable, and all names listed have references as to what exactly they did for PETA. Are you contesting the notability of 1)all names on the list as non-notable 2)some names on the list as non-notable or 3)PETA itself as non-notable? --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 23:54, 30 July 2006
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> even if you assume that everyone on the list is "notable" (which is always open to review and is subjective) and PETA is "notable" (the latter of which isn't under dispute), how do you quantify "supporter"? How notable do you have to be to be on this list? Does the person have to have a membership? Have tossed some money into the coffers? Said nice things in the news? It's too subjective as it requires one to make an assumption about a person's state of mind. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. How many of those 11.9M matches are actually for this individual? If they all are, as you claim, then it's reasonable that 1% of the matches would be from major news entities or other verifiable sources (i.e. not blogs, personal pages, etc.). That would still be 119,000 sources to quote, and there are <i>no</i> references to major news/media entities in the article.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I believe this person, has distinguished himself, based on several items extracted from the information posted to the bio. I would submit as examples:
<ul>
<li>This person has demonstrated a leadership role in IT at <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Martin_7877.html" title="Lockheed Martin">Lockheed Martin</a>. Lockheed Martin is one of the largest IT and advanced technology contractors in the world.</li>
<li>This person has demonstrated a leadership role in a $700M IT contract. That represents one of the largest federal IT acquisitions of the last 10 years.</li>
<li>This person has demonstrated a leadership role at a Federal agency, in developing its enterprise architecture. Specifically, this person has demonstrated leadership at the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Environmental_Protection_Agency_228d.html" title="US Environmental Protection Agency">US Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Mapping and environment are joined at the hip - for example, the commercial market segment leader in geospatial technology is named, not by accident, "<a href="http://www.esri.com" class="external text" title="http://www.esri.com" rel="nofollow">Environmental Systems Research Institute</a>". Doing this kind of work for the national environmental agency of one of the most powerful and technologically advanced nations on earth places him near the pinnacle of that profession.</li>
<li>This person appears to have been actively involved in the development of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographic_Information_Systems_aeb3.html" title="Geographic Information Systems">Geographic Information Systems</a> (GIS) for over 20 years. Modern computer-based GIS in its' current incarnation hasn't been around for much more than 20 years itself, placing this individual among its veterans and pioneers.</li>
<li>This person has demonstrated leadership at a statewide level, with development of statewide interagency technical standards, as well as holding statewide quasi-judicial office.</li>
<li>This person has several published works.</li>
<li>This person is a member of <a href="http://www.ncees.org" class="external text" title="http://www.ncees.org" rel="nofollow">NCEES</a>. NCEES is the national organization which sets national policy for the engineering and surveying community, and which defines the yardstick for professional licensure. Only a fraction of one percent of engineers and surveyors are ever eligible to be members of NCEES.</li>
<li>This person has excelled and demonstrated leadership in not just one field, but in multiple fields at a statewide and national level. --<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawnTreader_e120.html" title="User:DawnTreader">DawnTreader</a> 03:55, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is a great deal of information available in the medical/psychological literature on the issue that can be referenced in a serious article. There are definitions and terms in DSM-IV - the diagnostic manual used by mental health professions that describe the diagnostic criteria for various types of eating disorders. This term is not one that is recognized in the professional literature. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 15:13, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Comments from the last afd, except for those who advocated deletion, was that the page "needs expanding", "Needs some clean up and more context" and suchlike. Since that time it has had tags for cleanup, context, npov and accuracy, and yet been left virtually untouched.

<p>This nomination concerns eight articles, Nuklear Man, Atomik Lad, Iron Scotsman, Tetsu Samurai, Doctor Veronica Menace, Rachel_(Nuklear_Age), Superion (Nuklear Age), and Nihel, all described as "Main Characters" in a self-published novel, <a href="../../../n/u/k/Nuklear_Age_38e1.html" title="Nuklear Age">Nuklear Age</a>. Nuklear Age itself recently survived an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nuklear_Age_5b23.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nuklear Age">AfD</a>, at which there seemed to be emerging consensus that these character pages should be removed as non-notable, especially since the Nuklear Age article already includes relatively detailed character bios. Opposition to the character pages has also been expressed on the Nuklear Age <a href="../../../n/u/k/Talk%7ENuklear_Age_c845.html" title="Talk:Nuklear Age">talk page</a>. I should also note that two of these have been tagged for cleanup, one since April, the other since June, with little effect.</p>

<p>But it's a rising social trend amongst a small group of people. It's rapidly gaining momentum in other places. In orkut, specifically. It's even becoming a social philosophy of its 20 or so followers. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dakoit (<a href="../../../d/a/k/User_talk%7EDakoit_acc0.html" title="User talk:Dakoit">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dakoit_4ab2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dakoit">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>It is a rather enigmous, yet quite simple meme at the confusion that the existence of religion causes. I am an active and quite so participating member of this ideology, and its presense at Wikepeida is under the free-source agreement that we are subjected to in your page. It may not be your exact and protracted ideology, and the right of alternative opinion is completely legally reserved by you, but we have not only an emotive but an intellectual need to indentify ourselves as a different section of society. A Wikipedia page would allow us to greatly enhance our idealogy's presense amongst the masses.</p>
<p>Why oh Why, oh Ravenous Savanna would you want Towelianism to part, Would you offer the misplaced reverence was God Almighty to fart?</p>
<p>Must you repel us and deny us our expression, Only 'true' muslims know the ranks of ineffective agression.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Nom was probably good faith in light of copyvio concerns, but I can't find where the majority of the article was copied. Does it need more verifiable sources? Yes. Does it need cleaned up and written in encyclopedic tone? Yes. Is it a topic worthy of inclusion in the Wikipedia?

<li><b>Comment</b> - People seem awfully free about throwing the charge "bad faith nom" around. If anyone's got facts on that, I'm willing to listen. In the meantime, I've got huge Original Research concerns, which would be answered if either the nom or writer would cough up sources, which would also clear up copyvio worries. I agree the afd process should not be cleanup, but it's unfortunately been my experience that it's often the only way to get the attention of the writer and/or other interested parties to get around to doing that. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 10:57, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This entire page smacks of original (albeit well-referenced) research. Yes, there are plenty of citations, often lacking in the most flagrant OR violators, but the article is rife with assertions like "If Christianity had originally evolved as a localised mystery religion, then not only should there be parallels between the scriptural narratives of Christianity and myths from the mystery religions, but there should also be parallels with more outwardly things such as religious rituals, and imagery." and "Aside from potential parallels with Gnosticism, which can be investigated more directly, other significant features of Pythagoreanism might have entered into early Christianity, and their presence would add support to a position advocating that significant parts of early Christianity, or all of it, derived from mystery religion." Again, it's an interesting read, and is even persuasive in its thesis, but <i>that's the problem.</i> It's an essay, not an encyclopedia article, and is irrevocably so. <b>Delete</b> as original research. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 19:35, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> From the third paragraph, "The question of whether Jesus derives to some extent from myth (including 100% from it) requires academic analysis of the available evidence from times near-contemporary with the dates for Jesus' life, and on analysis of how reliable such evidence is, and what their biases are." The article then goes on to perform such an academic analysis. Again, yeah, it's well-written, but it's pure OR. I don't know how salvageable it is, given that "academic analysis" is in this article's DNA. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 23:59, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It needs a POV tag for the meantime, but sources on the topic are certainly available in abundance (I can think of the <i>Testimonium Flavium</i> off the top of my head). There is no reason to delete this article, because it is not irredeemably condemned to being original research.

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems that many of the unverified assumptions and "original research" in this article are actually from people <i>opposing</i> the subject. For example, "there is no formally peer-reviewed work advocating this extreme limit of the Jesus-Myth theory". That is absolute nonsense, there has been much scholarly work on the subject: for example, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Nietzsche_159c.html" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> wrote about the subject extensively. Simply because the subject of an article is uncomfortable to some people does <i>not</i> mean it should be deleted. The entire concept of a "Jesus-Myth" is just not one person's original research. The article should, perhaps, be renamed, though. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 08:47, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Another Comment</b> After reading this article carefully, it should be clear that <i>this is not original research at all! It is, on the contrary, one of the more scholarly and well-written articles on Wikipedia.</i> Statements like those offered in the nomination do not contravene original research policies. Here is a relevant quote: "However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia". I am beginning to wonder if this AfD is not the result of an ideological objection to the article, not the nature of the article itself. The idea that what is written there constitutes OR is preposterous. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 08:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It has citations, but it editorializes and theorizes, and does not cover facts (such as Josephus) without being immediately deleted.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> First of all, this is not OR. Yes, it says that "academic analysis" is necessary, but then it <b>summarizes</b> the analysis which has been performed by others, who are identified in the text, in notes, or in the reference section. I agree that the sources for some sections need to be identified more prominently, but that's no reason to delete the article. Second, it doesn't matter if any of us think the "Jesus as myth" theory is questionable, bogus, or even offensive. It's an idea that has had quite a few supporters for over a century. It has influenced books from <i>The Golden Bough</i> to <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. It is encyclopedic and noteworthy. Third, the article does have some POV problems and probably always will, because the subject matter stirs up strong feelings in some people. But that's a reason to work on improving it and covering all points of view as fairly as possible. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestlin_04d4.html" title="User:Maestlin">Maestlin</a> 20:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As I understand it, <i>Historicity of Jesus</i> is about the question of whether Jesus existed, and what evidence is available to answer the question. <i>Jesus as myth</i> is about using the tools of mythologists to analyze accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus, which may or may not lead to the conclusion that Jesus never existed. Such analyses are often carried out by people who want to show that Jesus is totally fictional, but some have reached the conclusion that he was a real person, or possibly real person, whose life was mythicized. I acknowledge that the last viewpoint is not well reflected in the article as it currently exists, but that's a POV problem. The article title has been changed a few times recently; the current incarnation is not great, I agree.

<li>Article is not entirely written from a neutral point of view and suffers from multiple undue weight issues. For example, much of the "Parallels with non-Christian myths from the first century" subsection gives undue weight to material rejected by serious Egyptologists. For another example, the article as a whole does not adequately explain why the theory has been generally rejected by the academic community, thus giving the article as a whole a NPOV failure.

<li><b>Very Strong, Keep</b> Excellent article, completely consistent with a good encyclopedia. Just because it is a controversial topic does not mean that information like this is not important, quite the contrary. Someone took a great deal of time to write on this topic and did an admirable job. When this article is viewed from the perspective that right-wing religious extremism of all faiths is severly impacting the earth today, it is essential to have "fair and balanced" information on all aspects of religion, religious practices, and religious figures. --Tim Bach 03:52, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>- The tone of the article has a clear 'agenda'. The agenda is to discount the historicity of Jesus. As such it should be re-written and merged with <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_jesus.html" title="Historicity of jesus">Historicity_of_jesus</a>. The additional misuse of the title of this article amounts to a type of vandalism when cited in other Wikipedia articles dealing with (for example) Christianity (See also, Jesus as Myth], Christ (See also, Jesus as Myth] and other similar materials. The article is not balanced, but is rather an essay that attempts to debunk christianity. Is the information important? Yes. However, the title is inflamatory and biased as is the overall tone of the article. Would we permit articles entitled "General Relativity as Myth", History as Myth", Israel as Myth, Moses as Myth, Exodus as Archaeological Myth? I don't think so. This article, as titled, sets a dangerous precedent. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Charles_Webb_5c27.html" title="User:John Charles Webb">John Charles Webb</a> 10:33, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The reason to include "myth" in the title is to differentiate it from the main article on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, since that article seems to take the POV that Jesus was a real person despite evidence to the contrary. It is only inflammatory to people who believe this myth is represents a real historical figure. If billions of people believed that Zeus was a real person, Wikipedia would probably have a page titled Zeus Myth. But since everybody agrees that Zeus is a mythological character, there is no need to specify that an article with the POV that Zeus is myth takes that position. If there was a theory that Zeus <i>was</i> a real person, there would probably be an article titled "Zeus as an historical figure". But, since most people think that Jesus was a real person, an article which discusses the mythological origins of Jesus' myth necessarily has to specify this in the title. And the reason that this article is different from the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_jesus.html" title="Historicity of jesus">Historicity_of_jesus</a> article is that the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Myth_0ae6.html" title="Jesus Myth">Jesus Myth</a> article focuses on the mythic origins of Jesus, whereas the other focus on ancient texts which mention Jesus (and the texts which <i>should</i> have mentioned Jesus but do not). The <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Myth_0ae6.html" title="Jesus Myth">Jesus Myth</a> theory certainly is a logical extension of the facts mentioned in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_jesus.html" title="Historicity of jesus">Historicity_of_jesus</a> article, but the latter discusses history whereas the former discusses a particular theory concerning origins of the Jesus myth. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 12:00, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> The use of the word "myth", in this instance, reveals a bias. A balanced presentation would provide enough information to allow the reader to determine whether or not Jesus is a myth. The title implies that the matter has already been decided. The Jesus Myth essay, standing alone, implies an endorsement of a particular point-of-view. If I drafted an article entitled "The Democracy Myth" then the title alone implies the tone of the content. The Wikipedia articles are designed to present un-biased verifiable information. If someone wishes to propose a new naming convention, they can do so on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions</a> while also publicising the proposal at Requests for comment and the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_Pump_1a2c.html" title="Wikipedia:Village Pump">Wikipedia:Village Pump</a>, as well as at any related pages. Once a strong consensus has formed, it can be adopted as a naming convention. (portions of text quoted from Wikipedia Naming Guidelines) Also, part of the definition of the word 'myth' is: A fiction or half-truth, especially one that forms part of an ideology. A fictitious story, person, or thing. As such the article's title (as well as its content) is biased and in violation of Wikipedia Policy. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Charles_Webb_5c27.html" title="User:John Charles Webb">John Charles Webb</a> 18:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply to the Reply</b> By that same logic, the page on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_Denial_7a44.html" title="Holocaust Denial">Holocaust Denial</a> should be renamed since it is implying that "Holocaust Deniers" are denying that a real event occurred, assumedly in order to push some sort of anti-Semitic agenda. The article is called "Holocaust Denial" not to indicate a POV, but rather to identify a fringe theory and separate it from mainstream views on the Holocaust. It is a page about the theory. And while it is true that the proponents of the theory certainly have a POV, the article need not necessarily have a POV. All it need do is describe the theory, and cite some of the claims which support it (with accompanying criticism of the theory where justified). This is what the Jesus Myth article does ... it describes the theory, and explains some of the key components that make up the theory. Any page which describes a theory has to explain that theory's POV. You couldn’t write an article an evolutionary theory without explaining that POV any more than you could write an article on Creationism without explaining <i>that</i> POV. Does that mean that neither of these articles should exist? Are we really prepared to remove all articles which describe a theory from Wikipedia simply because they explain a POV? And concerning the name, do you have a better suggestion? Would you prefer "Jesus Denial"? To me, <i>that</i> would be a POV. However, the title “Jesus Myth” seems to be a fitting name for what the article describes – the theory that just about every element of Jesus’ life story has roots in prior myths. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 11:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>"'Reply to Replies'" The article does cover a scholarly postion, Jesus as a myth. There is nothing wrong the the title.

<p>A Critical Analysis of the opening words of the "Jesus Myth" Wikipedia Article</p>
<p>- The article begins with (text) "The idea that" which presupposes the article's unstated premise. (Who's idea?) (Quote) "The idea that elements of beliefs about Jesus, and the Jesus narrative in the New Testament, are actually syncretisms from myths of his era is a theory usually associated with a skeptical position on the historicity of Jesus." (end quote). - The second sentence (quote) "When taken to its extreme - the idea of Jesus as myth rather than having any genuine historic existence - its advocates often refer to beliefs about Jesus as the Jesus-Myth." (end quote) The sentence is a fragment and has grammar issues. Is Wikipedia going to contain articles discussing 'ideas"? (again who's idea?). - The third sentence which is the beginning of the second paragraph elevates "idea" to "theory" (quote) "The theory is based on apparent similarities between early Christian accounts of Jesus and pre-existing mystery religions, and at the more extreme limit of the theory (that Jesus is 100% myth) is also based in part on the lack of extant evidence about his life outside the Gospels. The extreme limit of the theory has not found widespread acceptance among Bible scholars and historians." (end quote). (How did we get from "idea" to "theory" - is this unsupported original research?). - The third paragraph begins (quote) "The study of whether or not Jesus might be a purely mythological requires academic analysis of the available evidence from times near-contemporary with the dates for Jesus' life, and on analysis of how reliable such evidence is, and what their biases are." (end quote) (What "study"? and another grammar syntax nightmare). - Continuing (quote) "The purpose of this article is not (sic) provide said (sic) academic analysis, but rather to provide an account of research that has been performed into the subject thus far." (end quote). (A total account NO, a biased account, yes! Affirming sources <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a> are glanced over or summarily dismissed without analysis).</p>
<p>These errors in logic, grammar, sytax and bias are (opinion) pervasive. Clearly the article is not neutral, it has an 'agenda' and the agenda is the debunking of Christianity. It makes statements that are unsupported by reliable sources and forces 'conclusions' upon the reader that are unsupported by the logical (?) flow of the article or available materials. I also strongly suggest that the author(s) familarize themselves with the term <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">Midrash</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Charles_Webb_5c27.html" title="User:John Charles Webb">John Charles Webb</a> 03:35, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Who's idea?</i>
<ul>
<li>As with most theories, it has been contributed to by many proponents. If you read the entire article, you will discover who some of those advocates are and what they contributed. It is not the job of the introduction to list them, just as (for example) the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> article introduction does not list any particular people who believe in it. On the talk page it has been suggested that since some sources such as John Mackinnon Robertson are absent, a list of notable proponents be created</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>The third sentence elevates "idea" to "theory"</i>
<ul>
<li>A theory is a subset of an idea. If you read the first sentance more carefully, you will note that it is stated that this particular idea <b>is</b> a theory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>What "study"</i>
<ul>
<li>Study as in "consider in detail and subject to analysis"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Affirming sources <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a> are glanced over or summarily dismissed without analysis</i>
<ul>
<li>A more detailed analysis of the authenticity of Josephus can be found here: <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus_on_Jesus_9e8f.html" title="Josephus on Jesus">Josephus on Jesus</a>. This article is linked to twice.</li>

<p>I posted this artist information because I purchased one of his paintings in Santa Barbara. When I returned home I searched google to fine more information and the only information were the links provided. I was hoping people would continue to add to this so I could continue to find more information regarding this artist. I am not sure if you know of Ovanes Berberian but he is concidered one of the top living impressionists today. According to the gallery in Santa Barbara, Elio is concidered one of his top students.</p>
<p>BTW...I wanted to post some images but I wasn't sure how legal that was. Any copyright issues?</p>

Not listed at <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com" class="external text" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com" rel="nofollow">animenewsnetwork</a> in any form. Only one hit for Stan Aynvarg (this page). Searched for its title and subtitles in both English and Japanese and have found nothing. The name "Stan Aynvarg" isn't Japanese in the first place, so it's not even a real manga series. "Instability Wiki" link at bottom of page is broken.

<li>This is not a vanity piece. I have collaborated with Dr. Diana Kirschner for over 25 years, have written three books with her and numerous peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters. Her work in integrative psychotherapy appears in four prominent books on the subject and a quick search in google scholar will yield some of her contributions. I would like to add a section on her specific seminal contributions to the field of psychotherapy that have influenced practitioners and researchers as well as a section on her more recent work as a media psychologist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Skirschner (<a href="../../../s/k/i/User_talk%7ESkirschner_f55b.html" title="User talk:Skirschner">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Skirschner_9e55.html" title="Special:Contributions/Skirschner">contribs</a>) 23:58, 30 July 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Permanent and semi-permanent sustained off-world outposts are increasingly becoming key plot devices in the show. If this article is deleted, there is no primary location to place references for the additional off world outposts ("Gamma Site") which have been mentioned more than once. Outside of the two stories that included events on the alpha site, there have been key plot elements including the alpha and gamma sites as well. If the data still does not warrant a standalone article, merge it with some other startgate article so that mentionings of the alpha site can be referenced elsewhere.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by DocRadium (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DocRadium_297f.html" title="Special:Contributions/DocRadium">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

I know these endless articles about a TV show may seem pointless, but it's a notable piece of a notable show, like <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnydale.html" title="Sunnydale">Sunnydale</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Academy_d3a1.html" title="Starfleet Academy">Starfleet Academy</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogwarts.html" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a>.

Going by the information in the article, this location is <i>not</i> the equivalent of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnydale.html" title="Sunnydale">Sunnydale</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Academy_d3a1.html" title="Starfleet Academy">Starfleet Academy</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogwarts.html" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a>. The article states that Alpha Site refers to emergency evacuation locations.

Additionally, the article needs <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b>Srose</b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(talk)</font></a> 23:41, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Both of you are completely wrong and I doubt that either of you have ever seen the show. The Alpha site appears in more than 25 episodes, and is a huge part of many key episodes including season finalies. The article is sourced, is not original research, and if it were a real place would certainly be notable enough for inclusion. If you don't know how important something is, don't vote to delete it if you think it seems unimportant.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - No, I have nothing against him and truly don't know who he is. I don't remember how I stumbled on the page, probably doing my random wikignoming - finding a page with no category, etc, and looking it over. As noted above, the original page I saw was absolute junk with obvious non-encyclopedic entries (strike 1). You'll note the page still has no category today except via the AfD (strike 2). If you click "What links here" the only references were an incorrect one I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blowing_a_raspberry&amp;curid=153771&amp;diff=67222766&amp;oldid=65384721" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blowing_a_raspberry&amp;curid=153771&amp;diff=67222766&amp;oldid=65384721" rel="nofollow">just fixed</a> and the NIN one that had been added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66574898" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66574898" rel="nofollow">the day before</a> (maybe that was how I hit the article). The IP that added the link to the main <a href="../../../n/i/n/NIN_6f79.html" title="NIN">NIN</a> page was an obvious vandal as noted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66574898" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66574898" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66575367" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66575367" rel="nofollow">here</a> (strike 3). Also, as noted above, no incoming Google links to his column (strike 4). And lastly, it is <b>very</b> strange that a single person's name would be referred to as something else in the other languages ("The NIN Hotline") (strike 5). So that's why I brought it to AfD. And when a AfD gets innundated with random IP votes with no signatures, I do not envy the admin who has to try to track it all down. Especially because I don't think from what I've read that Meathead == The NIN Hotline. So votes that say "NIN Hotline" should stay have nothing to do with this individual. — <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevragnarok_789a.html" title="User:Revragnarok"><font color="#696969">RevRagnarok</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevragnarok_52e4.html" title="User talk:Revragnarok">Talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Revragnarok_e131.html" title="Special:Contributions/Revragnarok">Contrib</a></sup></span> 12:05, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since when is vandalisation criteria for deletion? Or lack of category? Or lack of internal links? Or an honest mistake in the language links? No, meathead is not the NIN Hotline: he is affiliated with that site, and writes a featured column which is hosted there.

<dd>Linking to your user page is an act of agression? Wow, there's a lot of rules here on wikipedia I wasn't aware of. I'm not going to defend swindley's comment because I didn't write it. By the way, you have yet to convince me that the article is non-notable. In fact, the edits of the last few days have pretty powerfully demonstrated that there is knowledge out there on Meathead that most people who had heard of him were unaware of — more needed to be added, not removed, to make the page encyclopedic. The article as it stands is NPOV and verifiable. Disambiguate the name if you must, but do not delete the page. The <i>Perspective</i> is known independently of the NIN Hotline, and creating a new article on it that would, at this juncture, solely host information on Meathead smacks of bureaucracy. Clearly, someone was motivated to create and maintain a Meathead page, but not a NIN Hotline page. There must be a good reason for that. <a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotleySmith_160d.html" title="User:BotleySmith">BotleySmith</a> 20:57, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just because some people are ignorant of his existance does not mean that others are, and indeed, Meathead is linked with Nine Inch Nails in a significant enough manner so as to warrant a Wiki article (See my aforementioned reference to "Closer to Mario").

If, of course, he makes more flash films. Which he should. Seriously though: Meathead is a healthy counterbalance for everyone that tends to take Nine Inch Nails, Reznor, music as a whole too seriously.

<li><b>KEEP</b> It's important to note that in the context of Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor, Meathead is part of the band's total experience. He has been part of the history of this band since 1999 and is certainly not somone "riding on Trent Reznor's coattails". Meathead's talent and humor have kept NIN fans entertained for years. As a satirist and humorist he is funnier than most of what passes for comedy today. Last year, a rumored end to the Meathead Perspective sent fans into fits of grief and hair ripping at the thought of not having his satirical point-of-view around. If someone not overly familiar with the band, or it's culture were to hear "Meathead" it would be nice to think that they could check it out on the Wiki.

<li><b>Comment</b> I strongly disagree. Meathead will be part of NIN's story forever. NIN is very much involved in the internet. The months leading up to the release of 'The Fragile' is a prime example of this. Do a little research and you'll find that certain marketing tactics were directly focued on the NIN internet fanbase, including Meathead. Also, Meathead kept us laughing during the (long drawn out) years until '[WITH_TEETH]' was released. Meathead was around for all of it and it is relevant. I've only recently heard of the 'mud shark incident'. Does that mean it's not relevant? Absolutely not, I'm just not a fan of Led Zeppelin.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If ever you happen to run into a true fan of the Nine Inch Nails band, the word "meathead" is instantly associated with online news about them. Obviously the people who read his articles care enough to fight for this page, which means going out of your way to do this. In no way do I deem meathead unworthy of a wikipedia page, if out of any Nine Inch Nails columist to have one, it should be him. Simply put, if you don't agree with this page for one reason or another, just don't visit it. But for the fans, this page is a long awaited - and a long due - reward for this incredible satire writer. If you haven't noticed, meathead has had more than his 15 minutes of fame among the internet, this page should just go to show that it goes beyond simple spotlight time 24.141.223.113 18:53, 2 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 24.141.223.113 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.141.223.113_6856.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.141.223.113">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> First off, I enjoy Meathead's work. However, my opinion is that this article should be deleted. I am new to the whole "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">nn</a>" discussion, and as such, I did a lot of reading of opinions and guidelines regarding notability.

In particular, I felt that this was a vanity article, not because it was necessarily written by Meathead, but because "<a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html#Does_lack_of_fame_make_a_vanity_article.3F" title="Vanity page">it can also be vanity if written by a fan, or close relationship</a>." I feel that because of the limited exposure and notoriety of the subject to a very small online community, that all the information presented in the article cannot be "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources</a>." &#160;<span style="border:1px solid #000;font-family:Courier;padding:1px 3px 1px 3px;color:#000;">Tabanger</span>&#160; 19:07, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Another Cluttering Comment</b> your face is absurd. by your logic, any groupie trent fucks should have her own wikipedia entry because she's interacted with the band and is probably online somewhere. way to edit out the key element of what i said with ellipses btw, that in the future--not NOW--no one is going to remember meathead when discussing NIN. even now, not every NIN fan obsessively follows so-called "news" about trent, much less an online humor column by a fan, when there are, i dunno, wars and other seemingly important things going on in the world to follow instead. not a single person i know who likes NIN has ever, ever mentioned meathead to me in real life. face it, this wikipedia entry serves no purpose except for vanity, if not for meathead personally then for the saps who think he's funny. let the more famous "meathead" character have the URL.--72.245.31.166 03:49, 3 August 2006 (UTC)travis <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 72.245.31.166 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.245.31.166_c449.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.245.31.166">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think the argument that because there are wars going on it automatically invalidates anything less than equal in importance to them as non-notable is not logical at all. Personally, I never have heard of the reference of meathead in <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="All in the Family">All in the Family</a></i>. Despite the fact I may be a Nine Inch Nails collector and thus probably am more intune with NIN related news (The NIN Hotline being the most consistent, reliable, and frequent source), meathead has been a thoroughly entertaining section at that site. The article itself does need some revision to take away any arguments that it's entirely vanity related, but personally I think there is a fair amount of information there and could be some more that could further legitimize an article on Wikipedia. I think that just because you aren't familiar with meathead in the context of Nine Inch Nails doesn't mean there isn't a sleu of fans and devoted readers of The NIN Hotline who are always anxiously awaiting to see on their RSS feed an absurd headline that must be something from meathead. I would suggest revising meathead's article and if you or any other Wiki editors are adamant about the <i>All in the Family</i> reference, have a search for "meathead" go there first with an option to view a meathead (disambiguation) link. On a side note, I'm actually suprised there isn't an article on The NIN Hotline. Just my thoughts, though. - Nlibera 13:12, 3 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Nlibera (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nlibera_e657.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nlibera">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Mikewhy" is known to many Tori Amos fans and Tori herself. You could even say that he is a "celebrity" in some Tori circles. He is a fan who runs the popular <i>A Dent in the Tori Amos Net Universe</i> website. But he does not have his own Wikipedia page. Instead he is included in the page about his website. If you give Meathead his own page, you would have to allow separate pages for other fans that write about bands, as well as other NIN fans from the Hotline. Many of the NIN reporters like Leviathant are "celebrities" in some NIN circles. I don't believe Meathead should have his own page. There should be a page for the NINhotline and Meathead should be included on that.--72.81.128.247 14:24, 3 August 2006 (UTC) Dolores <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 72.81.128.247 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.128.247_d755.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.128.247">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

" that's not what i said, dick. as for 'all in the family,' whether you've seen the show or not, millions more have seen it since it debuted decades ago than visited or are aware of some online humor columnist of a band. it's a main character on one of the most famous sitcoms of all time vs. some obscure internet personality. your personal amusement at meathead's obvious/lazily random hybrid of humor isn't exactly equivalent to, much less more important than, a foil on a show watched and loved by millions, so why not give that expontentially better known character the main wiki entry? and i say, why keep a vanity article for this guy at all?65.113.54.254 17:28, 3 August 2006 (UTC)travis</li>

<dd><b>Re: Comment back</b>. Do you really need to resort to name calling? I think my <i>comment</i> makes sense. Regardless if I as an individual do not know about the meathead reference in <i>All in the Family</i>, I agree it should be the first thing to come up in a Wikipedia search. If the current Meathead article is cleaned of the vanity pieces (mostly the "Trivia" section), and if there are any parts that sound non-neutral to have it revised as needed, I think that would be worthy of keeping. That way it's accessible to any Nine Inch Nails fan curious about The NIN Hotline's most well-known author/journalist. Even if you don't know about him, don't like him, or don't care to know more, I think it's viable information that should be available to the inquiring public, no matter how small that inquiry may be. And that is just my opinion, take it as you will. - Nlibera 18:56, 3 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Nlibera (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nlibera_e657.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nlibera">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. "I think it's viable information that should be available to the inquiring public" But couldn't said information be added to a (edit: Wikipedia) NIN hotline page? That makes more sense than having a separate page for every NIN Hotline reporter that is popular in the NIN online fan circles. Once you take out the vanity information, there is very little "viable" information left about Meathead. What information exactly entails Meathead having his own separate page? Because the way I see it, Meathead having his own page is vanity.72.81.128.247 19:49, 3 August 2006 (UTC) Dolores <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 72.81.128.247 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.128.247_d755.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.128.247">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<dd><b>Re: Comment</b>. I agree there are parts that qualify as obvious vanity. They should be removed. Perhaps there isn't a lot left, but there are plenty of articles on Wikipedia that are stubs as well, and in many cases I'm assume there isn't much else to add. As well, the many staff members of The NIN Hotline probably do have the ability to create detailed biographical sections and even one for Meathead (or maybe just Leviathan, owner and head maintainer of The NIN Hotline as far as I know), but then I have no control and cannot contribute to it. I think they are trying to keep it as professional as they can with the staff members "wank page" being small as that's not what the site itself is about as it's for new on Nine Inch Nails. So my understanding is Wikipedia is an open-ended encyclopedia for anyone to add information on anything, in this case Meathead. Instead of trying to find information on Meathead on his website or The NIN Hotline, I could come to Wikipedia to find all the information many have collaboratively added to get as much info on him at once, versus the possibility of googling it or searching through the vast forums of echoingthesound.org (and personally, I'm not a fan of forums). If this article is deleted, then that's what I'd have to do. If it isn't, maybe there isn't a lot now, but who knows in the future. At least I am not restrained by The NIN Hotline's decisions on what and what not to author on their website about Meathead. I hope that was clear, let me know if there is more I can clarify. - Nlibera 01:31, 4 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Nlibera (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nlibera_e657.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nlibera">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Since Nlibera has not commented (yet); this is the way I see it: <b>Informative</b>:1) Meathead is the person who writes the Perspective. 2) Description of the perspective. (This can be a short paragraph on a NIN hotline page) <b>Possibly informative</b>: The Nine Inch Goombas remix. Where and how much has it been played? Did some random QOTD crewmember just play the song once during a break or was it specifically chosen by someone higher up? (If the remix is well known, a sentence or two can be added) <b>Possibly Vanity</b>: Proving that NIN likes him. A brief note can be added that Trent is a fan, but do we really need to know that he accepted an award in place of Trent or some NIN crewmembers threw him a party? The whole thing strikes me as vanity; getting people to like Meathead just because Trent likes him. <b>Vanity</b>: 1) "Pimping” his “artwork”. Selling a few prints online does not warrant your own Wikipedia page. If it did, hundreds of thousands of “artists” would have their own pages. Until I see published articles about his work, his art in galleries, etc…this is pure vanity. 2) Other random "facts" on his page. Not important. (Should be deleted). <i>In short, the "viable information" on Meatheard warrants a paragraph or two on a NIN Hotline (edit: Wikipedia) page, not his own.</i> 72.81.128.247 21:00, 3 August 2006 (UTC)Dolores <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 72.81.128.247 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.128.247_d755.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.128.247">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

It seems to be a very easy way to get information, and there are plenty of articles out there The NIN Hotline has been tirelessly collecting over the years.

That way you could search via magazines, dates, or topics discussed per interview, have more indepth information on nin.com's versions, updates, and other celebutantes (ie, Meathead) associated to Nine Inch Nails in one way or another. Though this is just idle wishful thinking and I myself don't have the time or talents to do such a thing. Then Wikipedia could argue further to remove this Meathead entry. Although I always thought Wikipedia's goal was to strive for collecting as much information on everything eventually. As endless as that may seem.

There are many people throughout the web community who often inquire as to who meathead is, and wikipedia provides a useful resource to those seeking that information, enough so that I fully believe he has enough merit for a wiki page.<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougied_012e.html" title="User:Dougied">Dougied</a> 02:45, 5 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougied_012e.html" title="User:Dougied">Dougied</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDougied_e00c.html" title="User talk:Dougied">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dougied_ebf4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dougied">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Wiki is not paper, so I don't see where the arguments that his page "isn't worth it" are coming from. The problem with not notable subjects is that they tend to be fancruft and of poor quality, and the article certainly isn't Wikipedias worst. It has gone through significant improvement, and it should be noted that theninhotline is encouraging its readers to improve the article, not just to spam this page... <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeBills_5132.html" title="User:GeorgeBills">GeorgeBills</a> 13:27, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Heltemes 16:31, 5 August 2006 (UTC) It would be really sad to delete this entry just because a few people don't understand the gentelman's work in question. Is he a huge internet celebrity, not really. But, he is an internet celebrity none the less. It would be nice to have usefull articles on artists w/in the internet as well as TV,movie, and radio celebs. I can not think of one productive reason to delete this article. Meathead has been around for a long while, and has been humering alot of people throughout his career (and not all nin fans are stoned and have a shi*%y sense of humor (carl the dinosaur)). Also, by reading the comments left by people speaking on the keep / delete topic; it seems that the people wishing for meathead to be deleted are the ones who are throwing out inappropriate language and squabbling like little kids. It makes me wonder if they want his article deleted because they truely think it is useless info, or because they are jealous that someone has actually made a career out of being a Meathead. When in fact the squabblers have to try and get articles deleted on their spare time to be a Meathead.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> This whole thing is so silly. Look, I know people have said it before, but I think it bears repeating [again.] Meathead's page is linked from the official NIN site. The Hotline gets a massive amount of readers, and alot of that is due to the Perspective [which came directly from Leviathant who created the Hotline.] It's a hugely popular column. I just don't see how a deletion is warranted. The page has been fixed from its admittedly laughable beginnings [look, I had never done a Wiki entry before- so sue me] and has really developed into a well written and informative page.

I like it, please keep it.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Holy sockpuppets, Batman! In my opinion, "Meathead" should go to the All in the Family character, and this article should be renamed. Into what, I don't know, but I don't feel as though it should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 21:54, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
