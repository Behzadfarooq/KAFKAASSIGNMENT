<p>Coolcappa is located outside the bustling metropolis of Rathkeale. There has been much strife between the two with Coolcappa being a former colony of Rathkeale under former British dictator Tony Blair. Coolcappa gained full independence in 1900 under the patronage of Charles Dawes, the first openly gay man in Ireland. Following independence, the uncivilised savages of Coolcappa, burnt him to death under order from their priests. Rathkeale has made attempts to recapture Coolcappa several times, most recently with the help of Osama Bin Laden in 2003, but ultimately failed due to major incompetence</p>

<p>The census revealed that the population of Coolcappa now stands at 5000. At it's peak, it had the highest population in County Limerick with 20 million residents in 1924</p>

<p>Coolcappa is divided into two sections- the prosperous North with its rich oil tycoons (Coolcappa having the highest volumes of oil in Ireland) with a national school, church and giant shopping center and the South with its uncivilised cannibal leppars. When back in the 1960s, lepparsy was found in one Derek O'Leary, he was shipped to the South with his family to the South. When there they started a new population and developed a taste for human flesh. Every year, any beggars that wind up in the city are sent to the South, so the cannbals will leave the oil tycoons alone. The South is also well known for its polar bears, surreal magic portals and hobbits. It is believed to be the inspiration for the show Lost</p>

<p>Coolcappa is well known as The Shit Hole of Ireland, most likely due to its problems with cannibalism and prostitution. It was the site of an unsuccessful French landing by Napoleon during the Rebellion. It gained independence in 1900 and installed Fergus Begore as their first president. He proved an eccentric man, with laws including the what is now called the "ball chop" law which demaned that every man be neutered. In 1903, it was discovered he was actually Fergie Gerot, a female and the first tranny to arrive on Irish shores since Grace O' Malley. She was burnt at the stake</p>
<p>The Great Beggar clearout of the 1920s in Rathkeale forced many homeless people into Coolcappa. Their new president Adolp Goebells ordered them all to be put into a room and gassed as burning at the stake was going out of fashion. Adolp later fled Ireland and helped set up a Facism party in Iceland. Although put to death by the Americans in the 50s, he is fondly remebered in Coolcappa, with a statue memorated to him in the center of Street One and Only and the gas chamber still used every Christmas for a ceremonial sacrifice</p>
<p>America once tried to invade to get Coolcappa's vast wells of oil by claiming Coolcappa were hiding weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunatly there was no Fast Food outlet in Coolcappa so America gave up and went home.</p>
<p>Recently Coolcappa has come to national prominence for its drugs and gang warfare. It was voted the most unsafe town in Limerick and is home to several drug barons and pimps</p>
<p>Every year a festival is held in honour of The Beatles, who once passed through Coolcappa where the "ball chop" is reinacted in a fun game known as "The Ball Chop", where children with axes try cuting each others testicles off. It is the one time of the year both North and South siders intermingle</p>
<p>Famous people like former President Eamon deValera stayed there during the summer, calling it "the worst days of my life". Famous singer Johnny Cash came from Coolcappa and has mentioned it in many of his songs most notably I've Been Everywhere with the lines "I been to Memphis, Chicago, Illinois, COOLCAPPA... It has been the site of several concerts including Band Aid, where Bob Geldof mistakenly called the town Cappagh, who were at the time in a bitter arms race with Coolcappa, leading to a riot and the injury to Bono, turning him into an annoying ass for the rest of his life. George W Bush is also rumoured to have some relatives in Coolcappa, but current president Thaddeus Bush says there is no truth in them there lies, ya hear!</p>
