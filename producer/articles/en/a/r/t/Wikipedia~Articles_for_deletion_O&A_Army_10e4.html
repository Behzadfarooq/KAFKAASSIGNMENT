<li><b>DELETE</b> There is no encyclopedic value and regards a group whose size and impact are culturally insignificant. It reads more as advertising for The Opie &amp; Anthony show and contains information which is difficult to verify thereby making it an unreliable resource. Wikipedia's value is that its contrinutors and editors value accuracy and truthfulness highly. With no way to verify the claims made by this entry's author, and through the insignificance of the subject, it serves as a blight on Wikipedia's reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Strong Delete</b>- This page is nothing more then a branging Trophy for these Pests. Their actions are an utter disgrace to be displayed on Wikipedia. Many of the problems they have caused are illegal also. This content has no encyclopedic value and should be removed by all means necessary. JPJ 05:21, 11 September 2006</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep</b>-Thus far the article has survived, even though there is no such army particularly in a smaller form on the main Opie and Anthony page. The "Pests" as they are, are a major part of the show and have grown to such a degree that they have recieved attention in national publications and even warranted a mentioning on O&amp;A's David Letterman Appearance. The evidence is overwhelming to keep this section. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:39, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I've said before... Wikipedia is not the place for an article like this. This article exists just to promote a group of people. It has NO encyclopedic value, and I say this as an Opie &amp; Anthony fan. <b>DELETE</b>--<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP_c970.html" title="User:IAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP">XMBRIAN</a> 04:40, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Aah, but it does. This article is longer than many other articles and includes a lot of information on the particular topic of "The Pests." One may take an interest to looking them up, based on the fact that they may have read aboot them in a publication, heard aboot them on Opie and Anthony, or may have seen Pest activities on the streets. It has encyclopedic value, and many articles tend to promote things. McDonalds is noteworthy, but it promotes McDonalds. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>No.. it's not. It has nothing to do with how long it is if it's all pure shit. I bet if I added a criticism section to this article you'd go all apeshit on me, right?--<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP_c970.html" title="User:IAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP">XMBRIAN</a> 04:47, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I wouldn't, depending on how well it was written. If you went off on the Pests, calling them full of shit and all fuckheads, maybe I would because that's certainly not encyclopaedic. You're just too lazy or afraid to add one. So instead of whining, why not go and add that criticism article? I could even help, because I know some fans do take exception to Pest activities. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:50, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Which proves what your aim is. Not to improve Wikipedia, but to tear down whatever you don't agree with. Your deletion notions are ridiculous.

<ul>
<li>This is a deletion page, not a place for "Pat Battle" Claims or a "Ramone" joke. You say the article is unencyclopaedic, but your demeanor is unbecoming of an editor to this encyclopedia. You don't seem to be taking it very seriously. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:58, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>We'll let others come and decide that. But I have a strong feeling this article will survive, whether in present form or not, despite what you want. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:59, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah.. let others decide. However, if this gets posted on Wackbag or FBA as a link for the pests to voice "their" opinions, then this article should just be deleted on the spot.--<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP_c970.html" title="User:IAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP">XMBRIAN</a> 05:01, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't control that, however I will say I won't do that because when fansites get involved they tend to just vandalize the page for the hell of it (Making Ramone jokes, Ol' Gravy Leg references, the like.) So, we'll keep it relatively quiet, lest we want to revert vandalism every two minutes. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 05:05, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>Whether you like the pest or not, they are apart of a national radio show and have been mention in numerous publications. if you get rid of the PESTS then go to anything else that isn't "encyclopiedia worthy".</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The O&amp;A Army is a group of fans that are a part of the Opie &amp; Anthony Show, and often times are guests of the show, in and out of the studio. They are an integral part of the show, and they're growing. The links above demonstrate same. They should be treated with the same respect as any guest of the show, if not more. For example, Richard Dreufuss was a guest of the show. Shall we delete his article as well? Likewise for any other guest who's appeared on the show, and has their own article. This deletion request is clearly motivated by personal reasons, as opposed to professional ones.</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The pests only exist on the Opie and Anthony show and articles related to them should be in the wiki O&amp;A article. No legitimate reason for them to have a seperate article except for them to try to get their names mentioned on yet another internet space. The fact that they are posting links to this discussion on their message boards so non-wiki users will come here to support them shows their desperation for attention.</li>

<ul>
<li>So we're all clear, this article is not too far off from being a very similar one to the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trekkies.html" title="Trekkies">Trekkies</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browncoats.html" title="Browncoats">Browncoats</a> articles. Would you delete that one as well? Consider that, along with the many credible cited sources involved in this article, before you consider deletion. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:08, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>HOLY CRAP! READ WHAT IVE BEEN POSTING! NOMINATE IT YOURSELF!</p>
<p>NONE of the articles I have cited I have EVER had a problem with! However, they are all articles you SHOULD have a problem with because you are the one who is complaining aboot THIS article. But there are many articles that are called into question due to the precident you may set in THIS article.</p>
<p>I AM a Browncoat, and Trekkies SHOULD have their own article. But the way you're arguing why the Pests shouldn't have their own article, neither should Trekkies or Browncoats. Thus, I expose your agenda. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:16, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is my agenda? WHY DONT YOU COME OUT AND SAY IT?--<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP_c970.html" title="User:IAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP">XMBRIAN</a> 04:17, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To remove all traces of The Pests from Wikipedia, and readd the Spaz baloney back in. For what reason you have this particular agenda, I do not know, but it's none of my business why. However, I'm making it my business to stop it. YOur personal opinions have no place on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:19, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't touched the O&amp;A article in months. if you had a fucking brain, you'd realize that I want to put this back into the O&amp;A article.--<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP_c970.html" title="User:IAMTHEPEOPLESCHAMP">XMBRIAN</a> 04:20, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you would pay more attention to earlier notes, the reason this article came into true existance when I found it and cleaned it up was because the O&amp;A article was already over 80kb long, which is FAR longer than the recommended (or sometimes allowed) amount of content for the O&amp;A Main Article. Hence, this is how this article came to be. It can go back in the main article, but will eventually once again outgrow the main article. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:22, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You pretty much disagree with the whole of the article, which is why you proposed deletion, and not *suggested* merging it. You went three steps ahead, not even calling for moderation or suggesting an offical merging, but just right to deletion. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 04:26, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> So since this article should be deleted, I guess all articles about fangroups and fanbases should be deleted as well, correct? That means The Grateful Dead's <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Heads_7190.html" title="Dead Heads">Dead Heads</a>, Phish's Phish Heads, Firefly/Serenity's <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browncoats.html" title="Browncoats">Browncoats</a>, Star Trek's <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trekkies.html" title="Trekkies">Trekkies</a> and even American Idol's Taylor Hicks' <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Patrol_493e.html" title="Soul Patrol">Soul Patrol</a> articles should all be deleted as well, right? Just because they're loosely affilitated fangroups, that doesn't mean they don't have some kind of cultural impact and it doesn't mean their articles should be deleted. It's already been revealed that XMBRIAN has a personal grudge against the O&amp;A Army which is fueling his request for this article's deletion. His motives are personal and petty, he's not requesting it for the improvement of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You do not know my true motives. Maybe I don't care for the pests, true. However, explain the other people who have voted delete? Do they hate the pests too? Wah wah!

<p>Stop trying to deflect attention from the fact that you've lost ground in this argument. Give us a valid reason that hasn't been addressed and debunked to prove that your motives aren't personal. We've already presented plenty of articles and coverage of the Pests' exploits to warrant the existence of this article. Heck, there are fangroups who have less coverage and attention paid to them that have their own Wiki.</p>
<p><b>Pests advertising and soliciting meatpuppets</b> Wiki editors should consider Dugout Doug's solicitation of outsiders to this discussion in making their decision about this article.</p>
<p><a href="http://oaexperience.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4501" class="external free" title="http://oaexperience.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4501" rel="nofollow">http://oaexperience.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4501</a></p>
<p>It is considered highly inappropriate or unacceptable to advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated in order to attract users with known views and bias, in order to strengthen one side of a debate. It is also considered highly inappropriate to ask friends or family members to create accounts for the purpose of giving additional support. Advertising or soliciting meatpuppet activity is not an acceptable practice on Wikipedia. On-Wikipedia canvassing should be reverted if possible.</p>
<p>The arrival of multiple newcomers, with limited Wikipedia background and predetermined viewpoints arriving in order to present those viewpoints, rarely helps achieve neutrality and most times actively damages it, no matter what one might think. Wikipedia is not a place for mixing fact and opinion, personal advocacy, or argument from emotion. Controversial articles often need more familiarity with policy to be well edited, not less.</p>
<p>If you feel that a debate is ignoring your voice, then the appropriate action is not to solicit others outside Wikipedia. Instead, avoid personal attacks, seek comments and involvement from other Wikipedians, or pursue dispute resolution. These are quite well tested processes, and are designed to avoid the problem of exchanging bias in one direction for bias in another.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>And what is wrong with asking fans to contribute to this discussion and to lobby against this article's deletion?

<p>And what if those people go on to have extensive Wikipedia backgrounds? Are they still meat puppets then? I actually do have a Wikipedia account and have edited several articles in the past including this one (I added the "O&amp;A Army Vs. O&amp;^A Pests" section), but forgot my password. And even if I recovered it, using my account now would give the impression that I was doing sock puppetry by posting anonymously at first and then under my Wikipedia account after.</p>
<p>You're capable of sock/meat puppetry as much as we are, all you need is an IP Spoofer or a few pals. How do we know you haven't been doing it?</p>
<p>And you don't think we see what you're trying to do? It seems that you're upset because more people seem to be opposed to your request for deletion than there are approval of it, so you're trying to get the Wikipedia people to become suspicious that there are meat/sock puppetry going on to discredit the opinions of people opposed to you who have been alerted to your request to delete this article on OA Experience. I, for one, have not been doing sock/meat puppetry, all Wikipedia has to do is check my own IP to see all my posts are coming from the same place. But alas, there's that darn IP Spoofer strategy, and the circle of suspicion goes around and around. Your attempt at breeding suspicion to get your way is so transparent. Accusing us of sock/meat puppetry doesn't change the fact that we countered your request for deletion with articles of the Pests' activities and other instances of loyal fanbases like the Pests getting their own Wiki, and whether or not this Wiki is deleted shouldn't be decided on sock/meat puppetry, but on the facts we've presented.</p>
<p>And furthermore, being someone with "extensive Wikipedia background" means nothing also. Just as it is capable of people having more than one account through an IP Spoofer, it is possible for someone to have more than one account with "extensive Wikipedia background" as well. Stop trying to discredit others' opinions because they haven't posted on Wikipedia as long as you. It's in the same vein as the false superiority people get when they have a huge post count on a message board and they see a newbie with a diminutive post count. High or low post counts mean nothing, extensive or limited Wikipedia background means nothing. As long as you make valid points, how much time you spend on a board or how many posts you have means nothing. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.117.67.html" title="User:205.188.117.67">205.188.117.67</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.188.117.67.html" title="User talk:205.188.117.67">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.188.117.67_dcc7.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.188.117.67">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>You can, but it's obvious by your writings you stand for those entries for being in Wikipedia for the same reason that I do. To delete those articles is as much of a detriment to Wikipedia as to delete this one. The Pests have achieved enough notoriety to warrant a large scale article such as this one, and the evidence has been shown in cited articles from FMQB, Foundry, Orbitcast, and even Forbes Magazine.

<p><b>Strong Delete</b> The comparison between the "Pests" and Trekkies is odious and when you compare the two it doesn't hold. Trekkies have been around for decades, have had documentaries based on them, have contributed to making Star Trek a household name, and number in the millions the world over. The O&amp;A Pests are just a handful of hardcore O&amp;A fans by comparison, and O&amp;A are far from household names. If this article were to stay then it would open the doors for Wikipedia to be cluttered with "articles" (I use that term loosely) for every drive-time morning DJ/crew in the country.

Sometimes, that "Handful of fans" is noteworthy, particularly when they make major news media outlets (Like the Pests) or can drastically manipulate DVD sales (like the Browncoats). <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 14:54, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't agree that the Browncoats are very noteworthy, but at least they didn't include a section on "Famous Browncoats". This pest article is just a way for some clowns to put their names on another website.Water Boy 15:28, 14 September 2006 (UTC)Water Boy</li>

<li>Because the Browncoats are a different entity than the pests. What the Browncoats do is stat petitions and attend Conventions to support the fallen show, <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly.html" title="Firefly">Firefly</a>. Pests, however, are frequently mentioned on the show and in the articles they appear in, by name. Thus, some have earned notable individual recognition. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 15:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - The Pests are a force in their own right. They often act without the permission of the Opie and Anthony show. All of thier attacks are well documented. They definitely deserve to have their own article. GA. <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardnug_8cb6.html" title="User:Wizardnug">Wizardnug</a> 11:39, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think the "Browncoats" should have an article either. Firefly is not a relevant enough show, at least not yet. Perhaps a blurb about the Browncoats on the Firefly page, but most definately not an entire page. Hell, I didn't even know what a Browncoat was until just now. The same for the Pests, a blurb on the O&amp;A page would be just fine. I also have to agree with the folks who are taking umbrage with the "Famous Pests" section. If you take a poll anywhere except an O&amp;A gathering, I'll bet the vast majority of folks will not know who "Dugout Doug" or "General Bam" are. As a group they may have a tiny bit of noteriety (as far as the O&amp;A Universe is concerned) but as individuals they have none at all.Shemps 23:04, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Again, disagree. Browncoats were largely responsible for Serenity (the movie) being able to be filmed at all, and have been a massive force behind the sales of Firefly/Serenity DVDs, even organizing certain days where everyone will buy a copy off of... say... Amazon.com, in which it will force sales for the week into teh #1 or #2 slot. But enough aboot Browncoats, that's for another time. The point is, sometimes a fan following has become large enough and notable enough to a point where it can no longer be ignored by even Wikipedia. Trekkies, Browncoats, The Wack Pack, The Pests, in the end, they all have their own reasons for being on Wikipedia, but they all belong here. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 23:50, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Closing comment:</b> Since this has largely turned into a mess and the votes are more or less tied, I'm closing this as "no consensus". This has been an example of what an AfD discussion should <i>not</i> be. A place in Wikipedia is not a prize to be granted to cool shows or groups, or to be denied on the basis of dislike for a group of fans with nothing better to do. The article <i>should be renominated</i> a couple of months from now; in the meantime, the fans should do a better work of finding references and tidying up the text, and the detractors should amass clear arguments based on policy and which do not resort to the word "cruft" or insults of any kind.
