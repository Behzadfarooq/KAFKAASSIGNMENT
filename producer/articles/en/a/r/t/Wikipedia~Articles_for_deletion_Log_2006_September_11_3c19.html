<li><b>Delete</b>. Original research, totally POV. <i>"The high crime rate in Mexico could be due to genetic diffrences in monoamine oxidase genes that were present in the Aztecs and were passed on to the present day Mexicans."</i> You must be joking. Poverty tends to be correlated with high crime rates, and Mexico is a fairly poverty-stricken country.

<li>The basic fallacy of the argumentum ad Pokémon, which is what you are propounding, is that Wikipedia's task is not to be an encyclopaedia of what <i>you</i> consider, subjectively, to be more "worthy" and more "important" than Pokémon. It is the world at large, not Wikipedia editors, that determines notability. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>.

If you think that the world at large has an unbalanced perspective, then it is the world at large that you need to change, by persuading it to write more source material on what you personally consider to be worthy and important.

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>Since there is a common theme to this set of airplane crash AfD, there will be an equally common theme to my replies</i> I think it's bad precedence to start putting a "death threashold" for the notability of a plane crash. I would say a crash with <i>any fatality</i> is notable. Ideally entries are written because they will be of encyclopedic interest and value to others to read. A plane crash with fatalities (even a small number) affects alot of a people--the community where the crash took place, people actually involved in the crash as well as friends/families, anyone who is interested in the aviation crash history of a particular airline, and those people who like reading about crashes anyways. Someone was originally interested in the topic enough to write the article in the first place. I can easily see many others who will have continual interest in reading it. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:49, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those are all fallacious arguments. Saying that something affects a lot of people and therefore merits inclusion is a fallacious argument because there are quite a lot of traffic accidents every single day that affect a lot of people, that cannot even be verified after the fact. Saying that something includes a fatality and therefore merits inclusion is a fallacious argument because there are many fatalities every day, the reporting of which would turn Wikipedia into the very memorial that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">by policy it is not</a>. Saying that because someone was interested enough to write the article and it merits inclusion is a fallacious argument, because people write all sorts of original research about things that they are interested in (mainly themselves, of course, but not universally) every day.
<p>An argument that <i>isn't</i> fallacious is an argument that addresses the sources, as <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> does.

<li><b>Comment</b> Do car crashes get the kind of media coverage that airline crashes do? I would say the relative <i>rarity</i> of airline crashes in approximation to car crashes plays a major role in that. Plus the public has a perpetual fascination with airlines which makes the notability of commercial airline crashes with fatalities all the more enduring. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:08, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Uncle G. How many car crashes get national media coverage? or even regional coverage outside of it's individual market? How many car crashes trigger <i>mandatory government investigations</i>? Now contrast that with commercial airline crashes which <i>always</i> get's coverage if there is a fatality. (<i>If it bleeds, it leads</i>) and more often then not the coverage is regional if not national and they <i>always</i> trigger a mandatory government investigation even if it's pilot error. It's a fallacious comparison. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>An easy survey above shows that <i>you</i> were the one who introduced the car crash comparision to try and nullify my contention that fatalities in a commericial airline crash is a <i>major thing</i> and adds markedly to the signifigance of the event-and by extension it's encyclopedic merit. Your retort was that my contention was akin to making Wikipedia a memorial and your introduced your fallacious comparision of a car crash. Ironically, your fallacious comparison only <i>strengthens</i> my contention because in that absurdity of your comparision the overwhelming signifigance of commericial jet airline crashes is shown clear. The media coverage and the <i>mandatory</i> government investigations they trigger set them apart from other events in a signifigant manner.<br /></li>

<li><a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> points out the basic problem with this article. It doesn't cite sources. Neither does the article in the German Wikipedia. For all that readers know, this could be complete fiction. (It wouldn't be the first time that a <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilartikel.html" title="Nihilartikel">fictional article originated at the German Wikipedia</a>.) Even if this were a real island, how are readers expected to verify the article's contents? How can readers verify that the dimensions of the island are as the article gives them? Requiring that readers go to the island and physically repeat the measurements is contravening our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy.
<p>We keep articles on real places not because they are "real places", but because they are <i>independently and substantially documented</i> real places. (The plot of grassland to the side of my house is a real place.) Small towns with small populations are documented in censuses, for example. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mill_Ends_Park_e6af.html" title="Mill Ends Park">Mill Ends Park</a> was written about in a newspaper for several years and was listed in the Guinness Book of Records, for another example. Where is the documentation for this island?

<li>Those references seem to just be about the entire Lake Constance region, talking about museums and castles and town centres - which I doubt exist on this island... anyway the one mention of the island literally just says that the island belongs to Lindau. No information about the island at all beyond that it's in Lindau. And yeah, Worst Analogy Ever seems warrented here, sorry.

<li>Before you claim too much high ground on the matter of editors doing research, you might care to notice that I <i>already</i> linked to two such pages, including one of the very ones that you cited, in my rationale preceding yours, and noted that they provide no information about this island beyond "Hoy is an island in Lake Constance.". (There are several such pages. They all have no more information on this island.)

<li>Towns are or have been inhabited. This island is empty, and as far as we know has always been empty. But if you can show me a bunch of other articles for similar islands (let's say, less than 100m²) which have no historical facts, disputes, lighthouses, or other clearly important distinguishing features, then I may rethink my position.

<li>I thought it was kind of clear that the problem is that there's little to no information in English about this island. The only information in german so far is just that "It's an island".

<li>I just read that there are 3.5 million lakes over 20 acres in Alaska alone. I personally find the idea that every geographic location is "relevent" to a bit troubling, Uncle G's arguments make a good deal more sense. I'm not sure wp-de's philosophy on this has been sufficiently challenged... although I was just looking at it through a machine translation, it didn't seem like there was anything approaching the refinement of Ungle G's arguments on the german AfD for this article. It was just a pretty simplistic "Keep, all places are notable" argument, regardless of whether there's actually any good information on that place. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 17:12, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I know that we could technically have 3.5 million articles on 3.5 million lakes, but 99.99% of them never say anything more than "There's a lake this big at these coordinates". There's just literally no more information in print or on the web. I don't think that's at all useful in an encyclopedia. So by extension, if an article about a place could literally never say more than "There's a place here that's this big"... I don't think we should include it, it's really no more important than Uncle G's plot of grassland. But I think there might be some confusion here, the german's might be assuming "Well of course there's more information" and just not mentioning their sources. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 17:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your actual argument is fallacious. Counting edits to an article doesn't indicate whether something is encyclopaedic. Sources do. <i>Please cite some</i>.

<li>Counting edits to an article doesn't indicate whether something is encyclopaedic, that's right, but whether it is of interest. The article seems to be of interest (but its style could be more encyclopaedic, yes). And as to citing sources, see above: <i>If lack of sources were reason enough to delete articles then we'd be half the Wiki we are.

<li>Additionally: When compared to areas of the same size (e.g. Uncle G's <i>grassland</i>, see above), islands always get more attention. Another example of the grassland size type is <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockall.html" title="Rockall">Rockall</a> with a diameter of 25 m. Size alone is not a sufficient argument.- However, I'd agree that, on average, relevance decreases with distance between the location of the place and the location of the readers, i.e. Hoy is definitely more interesting for the German WP than for the English WP. --Panda17 20:09, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, this island apparently has <i>less</i> attention than the patch of grassland at the side of my house. We do <i>not</i> measure notability by how far away things are, moreover.

<li>Sure, every Wikipedia puts more weight to things within countries of the specific language, even if they all try to be international. And there is no problem with that! That's why it's okay to delete the island in the English WP and to keep it in the German WP.</li>

<p>There are medieval sources. I have been editing the german version. There is some possible ambiguity in the sources due to high sedimentation in the area but the article represents the consensus on the topic. I think the problem is rather that the article on <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindau.html" title="Lindau">Lindau</a> does not list it as a tourist attraction, so english-speaking tourists (there are quite a few) will not easily find the article. When i go traveling i like to know as much as possible about the place i am visiting even i do not care about the places i am not visiting. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasegand_0289.html" title="User:Masegand">Masegand</a> 17:20, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can you show us some links (in German is allright) that show us that it is a tourist attarction? Similarly, can you give any indication in what medieval texts it is referenced, and what is said there about it? The German version says nothing about either claim, and none of the websources given here do so. It is listed, usually at the end of the lsit, as a minor island in the Bodensee, and that's it. See e.g. Uncle G's post above, who says as well that while many claims have been made by 'keep' proponents, none of them has been able to give any source for it, making it (the claims of importance, not the island itself) unverifiable and thus a perfect candidate for deletion. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 18:36, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Indeed i guess it is a minor tourist attraction, there are no visitors entering the island but it is well visible from the bridge to the island of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindau.html" title="Lindau">Lindau</a> and approachable by boat, and listed in the hungarian version of Lindau. The medieval sources i heard of are images not texts, and the english article does not make much claims other than that the island exists and showing an image. As well as on several tourism websites where it is listed among other small islands in the lake of constance (without image). The origin of the name is also not explained. In the german article on Hoyren the (church) latin horea/storehouse is mentioned. I could find a reference on horreum/barn, granary, storehouse on <a href="http://bible-history.com/latin/latin_h.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bible-history.com/latin/latin_h.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and horia/small fishing boat which would also make sense. There is also the greek horaios/beautiful which would hint to an early 19th century fabrication for the purpose of tourism or simply greekophilia which was rampant in bavaria at the time, however Hoyren is mentioned in medieval text in 1275/1278. So apparently several sources would have to have been faked then which is not impossible though especially if you are a conspiracy guy e.g. the bavarian illuminati etc.... In alemannian language Hoy sounds like german Heu/english hay possibly related to the barn, granary, storehouse meaning, but unlikely/strange for such an small island. Please note i am not doing primary research just speculating, but possibly those people doing it needed to be contacted or referenced indeed.... In the german version there is also a reference to the medieval gallows island, which Hoy is not but sometimes assumed to be as it is the only small island left near Lindau in these days. About its relevance, nothing other than simple facts are mentioned in the current english article, but the length of this discussion is surprising and i think also related to US/European cultural differences about the relevance of something like that. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasegand_0289.html" title="User:Masegand">Masegand</a> 20:33, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Saying every murder victim is notable is no different from saying that every town is notable. Many towns have only stubs; even more, particularly in less developed countries, have no article at all. Recognizing that all murder victims are notable doesn't mean that Wikipedia will be flooded because the articles will only be created if someone takes the time to research and write the articles. All that accepting the notability of murder victims will mean is that if someone creates a verifiable, non-copyvio article about a murder victim, it will normally be kept. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 03:55, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete (as nominator):</b> I forgot all about getting back to the AFD I was about to start, so here's my reasoning, there is no commonly recognised "Eighth Wonder of the World".

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for reconsidering. About the declarers thing, a lot of the citations I found were rather vague -- a lot of "considered to be the eighth...", "called the eighth...", "known as the eighth," which allows inclusion on Wikipedia, but not as having been declared by a specific person. I'm not sure that many of them even have a notable historical figure that used this particular appellation (the list's entry for the Thames Barrier originally claimed that Elizabeth II called it the eighth wonder, but I couldn't find a citation for it, so I took it out). I'll keep checking around, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 04:53, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> "the rule of inclusion will always be subjective" -- it isn't subjective at all. The rule for inclusion, like everything else on Wikipedia, is whether a reliable source has identified the subject as an Eighth Wonder. This isn't Wikipedia editors deciding what ought to be on the list. I agree that the reliable source calling it an eighth wonder is somewhat subjective, but that doesn't at all make it inadmissable at Wikipedia; if it did, we wouldn't be able to quote album reviews or editorial remarks because they are POV. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 12:35, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

This isn't an encyclopedic list, it's a list of X with unassociated value Y where the unassociated value is a purely subjective phrase, a cliched advertising slogan.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Au contraire, my friend is an excellent source with great credentials. You see the problem with this list, yes you do.

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me that you're confusing the POV issue. Yes, it's an inherently POV statement to call something the Eighth Wonder of the World, but our <i>sources</i> are not held to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>; only our editors are. As editors, we can't state categorically that X, Y, or Z <i>is</i> the Eighth Wonder, but we <i>can</i> say that A called X the eighth wonder, assuming that A is a reliable source. Consider, for example: <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">Films that have been considered the greatest ever</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_have_been_considered_deities.html" title="List of people who have been considered deities">List of people who have been considered deities</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_incidents_famously_considered_great_blunders.html" title="List of incidents famously considered great blunders">List of incidents famously considered great blunders</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_have_been_considered_avatars.html" title="List of people who have been considered avatars">List of people who have been considered avatars</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Place_names_considered_unusual.html" title="Place names considered unusual">Place names considered unusual</a>, and I could list dozens of others. I'm not implying that this article should be kept merely because there is a precedent, but that all those articles display other people's opinions. As long as they are reliable sources -- and I hope that comment about your friend was in jest, otherwise you severely misunderstand <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> -- their characterization of a particular subject is admissible. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 14:57, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - no, I understand <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> quite well, thank you, but it is clear that irony does not communicate well. The fact we can admit to the inherent POV and RS problems here, yet people look away at the end result, bespeaks to underlying problems. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 11:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Again, I disagree that there are any POV or RS problems; citing someone's opinion is a perfectly reasonable thing to do and falls right in line with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Saying "The <i>New York Times</i> has called this film 'a masterpiece'" is perfectly fine to state in an article if it is sourced, just as is "The <i>New York Times</i> called the Thames Barrier the Eighth Wonder of the World." Yes, that's the point of the view of the <i>Times</i> writer, but I defy you to show me a policy page that says we don't include other people's published opinions on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is nothing interesting about that variant though, beautiful is a very commonly understood notion applied to an almost infinite number of things. In the case of the Eighth Wonder, there actually is no Eighth Wonder, despite it being a proper noun and a title. Obviously comparatively far fewer things exist that people would assert are the Eighth Wonder compared to things asserted beautiful, meaning the list is not only much more manageable but much more useful because of the rarity of the phrase. If you wanted to sort the page into things called the Eighth Wonder by third-party print media (ooh, let's) and those that merely claim themselves to be, fine. But I think both are useful for illustrative purposes. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERankler_6eec.html" title="User:Rankler">Rankler</a> 01:56, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

The only difference between that article and this is that "models who refer to themselves as beautiful" is a pretty useless and unencyclopedic topic -- who would ever need it? -- whereas "Eighth Wonder" is such an obviously commonplace expression (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-26,GGGL:en&amp;q=%22eighth+wonder+of+the+world%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-26,GGGL:en&amp;q=%22eighth+wonder+of+the+world%22" rel="nofollow">300,000 Google hits</a>) that its inclusion on Wikipedia would clearly facilitate encyclopedic understanding of the common phrase. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 03:16, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Rankler is incorrect in stating that the citations are only from the subjects themselves. The only times when the subjects' official sites are used is when they are quoting <i>someone else</i> (e.g. Akshardham), or when they make a broader statement like "X is widely known as the eighth wonder of the world," and in those latter cases, there is an independent citation backing the official one up (e.g. André the Giant). <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 12:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are POV concerns inherent with this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>Since there is a common theme to this set of airplane crash AfD, there will be an equally common theme to my replies</i> I think it's bad precedence to start putting a "death threashold" for the notability of a plane crash. I would say a crash with <i>any fatality</i> is notable. Ideally entries are written because they will be of encyclopedic interest and value to others to read. A plane crash with fatalities (even a small number) affects alot of a people--the community where the crash took place, people actually involved in the crash as well as friends/families, anyone who is interested in the aviation crash history of a particular airline, and those people who like reading about crashes anyways. Someone was originally interested in the topic enough to write the article in the first place. I can easily see many others who will have continual interest in reading it. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:50, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It should be noted that there is currently <i>no notability standards</i> for airline crashes (not even an essay). What we have is a substantial event involving a commercial airline crash that resulted in loss of life and triggered mandatory investigations and resulting media coverage. In the absence of a current guideline, I do think the above plays a large consideration in the notability and merit of inclusion. I do encourage the development of such an essay but I think the one precedence that no one wants to see come out of this is some sort of "body count threshold" (i.e. so many people have to die to be considered notable) being connected. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 09:28, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>True, there is no specific standard for air crashes, but that's like saying there's no specific standard for a specific company, book, or person, when the general WP policies and guidelines still apply. To act like we need to reinvent the wheel for every pet issue misses the points that we're still bound by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, or simple extension of other policies and guidelines. One point that looks very applicable is from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which asks whether there has been any lasting contribution to the field. It's clear in this case there has not. Also, if you don't want to reduce this to a body count, then don't. I haven't, and I don't see why you keep waving the dead about when you say you don't want to. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 14:44, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a difference between inferring that there is notability because a fatality is involved in a signifigant event and a "death threshold". One is acknowledging a <i>facet</i> of an event that adds to the signifigance and the other is setting up a measuring bar like a carnvival ride that says <i>"You must have X number of people die before you can be included in this encyclopedia."</i>. Far from "waving the dead about", I'm contending for the former and strongly advocating against the later. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:54, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - important crash on several fronts. First, notability: it had NTSB investigation with a full hearing and an extensive report. Most minor aviation accidents, even with fatalities involved, don't get federal NTSB investigation (local FAA district office alone investigates many/most) and then many of those with NTSB investigation don't get a public hearing. So this one ranks near the top in that department, which relates to notability, since NTSB is a political body that invests its limited investigative resources (to some extent) according to the perceived public importance of the case (e.g. number of casualties, public figures or celebrities involved, etc.). Also, there were several important considerations in the accident itself that make it notable technically. First, the real causes of the 2 separate technical malfunctions that led to the crash are both unknown, which is fairly rare. Also, the crash worthiness aspects led to recommended improvements in that area. In addition, the actual proximate cause of the accident, i.e. lack of crew coordination and division of labor, led to a general recommendation in that area (which unfortunately didn't help much until some other accidents re-inforced the modern concept of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crew_Resource_Management_d63c.html" title="Crew Resource Management">CRM</a>). In all, this is an important crash with unusual (undetermined) causes as well as important safety recommendations. The article does require work, however. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:20, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Someone was originally interested in the topic enough to write the article in the first place. I can easily see many others who will have continual interest in reading it. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 09:34, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think thresholds or precedent are the issues at stake here. Crashes are not notable just because those involved die. Wikipedia is not a memorial, and thousands more die in car crashes, affecting friends, families, and others interested. I don't see how a plane crash killing 14 is any more notable than a ten-car pile-up killing 14, but to have an article on the latter would be seen as absurd. Plane crashes happen very frequently, and more often than not, people die in them; none of this makes them notable in and of themselves. Furthermore, the "someone was interested enough to write it and others will want to read it" claim is entirely specious. Many articles are written and deleted every day for failing to meet Wikipedia standards of notability, from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Catherine_Woods_79ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Catherine Woods">murders</a> to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Fortunate_Sons_dca4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Fortunate Sons">bands</a>. The fact that someone has interest in recording certain information doesn't in any way affirm that the information is useful to anyone else, or that it should be retained. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 11:03, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't think anyone is advocating that Wikipedia becomes a memorial here. There is no listings of who died or what not. What's being put forward is the concept that commercial airline crashes are <i>major things</i>-particularly those that have a fatality. Besides launching mandantory investigations, crashes with fatalities receive far more media converage and have direct impact on numerous people--even those not even involved with the crash. I think the comments that have unsettled some of us is the concept that because <i>"only -blank amount- died"</i> in the crash that lessens the notability of it. If you want to craft other arbitray guidelines on airline crash notability (Media coverage, procedure changes after the fact) then a Wikipedia Essay space awaits with your name on it. <i>However</i>, such notability essay (much less guideline) does not exist yet and the foolhardy "death threshold" is not one to currently stand in for it. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 09:15, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True. But Macomb County is so balkanized into small cities that no city chief of police there is remotely as important as the county sheriff. The sheriff is also responsible for the county jail, which in a large county is a pretty significant institution. The Macomb County Jail has a capacity of 1,450, per the <a href="http://www.macomb-sheriff.com/Pages/jail/jail_services.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.macomb-sheriff.com/Pages/jail/jail_services.htm" rel="nofollow">official site</a>. <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKestenbaum_5f93.html" title="User:Kestenbaum">Kestenbaum</a> 04:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>My contributions are short. One fact. One preference. Two links to my web sites for those curious about me.</li>
<li>I don't plan to add to it. I'm not sure at this point what to do, if something false is added -- your feedback welcome on this.</li>
<li>I stood by and with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Stallman_a8be.html" title="Richard Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> and did much work on the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Project_c451.html" title="GNU Project">GNU Project</a> and helped him, gjs, hal, and rjc start the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Software_Foundation_6e41.html" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a> (FSF) for over a dozen years. I was a founding member of the Board of Directors of FSF, and served on the Board for a dozen years.</li>
<li>I'm listed on the FSF page for that role. Yes, I added that entry as well.</li>
<li><b>I added that entry and filled out the rest of the Board's history and added the <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_H._Tower_Jr._0666.html" title="Leonard H. Tower Jr.">Leonard H. Tower Jr.</a> article, because a number of people sent me e-mail asking why that history wasn't in the Wikipedia FSF article.</b> I added the two links to my websites, because the articles for the other FSF Board Members had them, and it would help sastisfy people's curiousity about who I am. I didn't add the link to my bio.html, because I only wrote it to sastisfy requests from high school and college friends about what's life been like.</li>
<li>I be willing to see my preference changed into a quote, if that fits Wikipedia culture better.

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> I searched for sources on Leonard Tower, and couldn't find any reliable ones. I think we can source that he was a director of the FSF, but as it stands, that isn't enough of a reason to have an article.

<li><b>Comment</b>- As far as I can tell, nothing in the article indicates that this journal even <i>has</i> a website, so I don't see how <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is relevant. However, the article about the journal's publisher spells this "Fanoon" and I'm convinced that both are probably problematic transliterations from Urdu.

<li><b>Keep</b> (possibly with cleanup). Referring to it as a website and measuring it by Alexa is disingenous. It quite clearly states that it's an organization, and that ".org" is merely part of the name they were incorporated under. It even makes reference to its website.

<li>Like I said on this article's talk page, there are lots of these Yoruba regional kings, almost all of whom are going to be pretty difficult to verify with Google. That said, without being able to find anything more specific than evidence that a Cheif named Adetola was made a regional king (may or may not be this guy), I really don't see how we're going to be able to verify this one through reliable sources. I hate to have to see a Nigeria-related article go, because we really do suffer from a lack of them (see <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">WP:CSB</a>), but I don't think that we're going to find enough evidence to keep this thing. From the article, we can't even tell where this guy is supposed to be from, and he isn't mentioned in any of the Nigerian national newspapers whose archives I checked. That alone ought to raise questions of notability, since local cheifs frequently make national news. So, regrettably, I find myself having to vote <b>delete</b> on this one. It would be nice if the closing admin would not prevent recreation in case we're able to confirm this person's notabilty (or even existence) later. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 14:16, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is about a musician with claims to notability including Grammy Award nominations ... the problem is, most of these claims are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>.</p>
<p>This article has been up for deletion twice before. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pete_Holly_b5f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pete Holly">first time</a>, it was deleted. After that, it was created in the Wikipedia namespace for some reason, then moved into the main namespace and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pete_Holly_%282nd_nomination%29_5548.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pete Holly (2nd nomination)">nominated for deletion</a> again, where it was closed as a "no consensus keep". In response to the "no consensus keep", I added {{fact}} templates to the article in hopes of encouraging the subject's fans to improve the verifiability of the claims. However, that was over three months ago, and nobody has made a single edit to the article since then until it was nominated for AfD.</p>
<p>As to the substantive claims in the article, Pete Holly's web site says "-4-GRAMMY NOMINATIONS FOR "PETE HOLLY III"- -INCLUDING ONE FOR THE VIDEO "HEART OF GOLD"-in 2006-" yet his name never appears on the most recent year's <a href="http://www.grammy.com/Grammy_Awards/Annual_Show/48_nominees.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.grammy.com/Grammy_Awards/Annual_Show/48_nominees.aspx" rel="nofollow">list of Grammy nominees</a>. The article only claims that Holly has "received 4 first round nominations from "The Recording Academy"" but there is no such thing as a "first round nomination" in the Grammys. Entries to the Grammys are screened to determine eligibility, but the Grammy web site explains that "The purpose of screenings is not to make artistic or technical judgments about the recordings, but rather to make sure that each entry is eligible and placed in its proper category." <a href="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Voting/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Voting/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> The only recordings that can be considered "nominees" for the Grammys are those which make the final five choices in each category, which I don't believe Pete Holly has ever done.</p>
<p>Maybe Pete Holly really does meet one or more of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria, but the article really needs verification from reliable sources, because I have never seen a musician's web site blatantly lie about his receiving Grammy nominations in the same way that Holly's does. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:17, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Folks, so that I don't keep spending time creating pages that get nominated for deletion 30 seconds after creation, can you point me to the page the contains the definition of "notability" you're using? I was going by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Uncle G's criteria</a>, which states that notability is <b>objective</b> and <b>measurable</b>, but that's obviously not being being used here, or we wouldn't have to vote. Thanks.  <span style="color:#066;"><a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPmc_0a22.html" title="User:Pmc">◉ ghoti</a></span> 05:44, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I wouldn't be so negative about voting/consensus/discussion <i>per se</i> (since even "objective facts" can be disagreed about by imperfect humans), I agree that it is important that people have rationales. The only rationale given for the original deletion proposal was that it seemed "like a travel brochure". Since the article is about a structure that is used for recreation and a base for travel in a certain area, I have a hard time imagining an article about it that wouldn't sound a bit like a travel brochure. Facts like how many people can sleep in the hut, for example, could be considered "travel-speak," or they could be considered very pertinent information about the structure.</dd>
<dd>I would like to see more about the connection to Jim Haberl, and any special circumstances regarding the funding and construction of the hut, since those would increase the value of the article; and whenever print sources become available, those would of course be good references, further nailing down the notability. But I do find it weird that this was nominated for deletion so quickly. What's the hurry? This is not commercial spam or a personal attack. -- <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpireguy_272b.html" title="User:Spireguy">Spireguy</a> 20:06, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is one of several linguistics articles that the author, Nimic86 (<a href="../../../n/i/m/User_talk%7ENimic86_25ee.html" title="User talk:Nimic86">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nimic86_81ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nimic86">contribs</a>), has just added. Xe asserts on Talk:Neophone that "There's always plenty of room for brand new terms which serve perfectly useful purposes.". Wikipedia isn't for promoting brand new linguistics concepts that one has just made up. And this is one such. There are no sources that describe this as a concept in linguistics.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Full Disclosure: I am a Free Range employee. Free Range might not be a name as well known as the larger communications firms Porter Novelli or Fleishman Hillard, which both have entries here in Wiki, but ask almost any non-profit organization with a presence in DC, and they will know Free Range. They will know the Meatrix. In the world of non-profit advocacy, Free Range has and is playing a significant role that's worthy of notation here in Wiki. In this sense, Free Range is not "non-notable." By putting our entry up on Wiki, we embrace the idea that anyone can edit our entry. We hope they do. But by removing our entry, I'd argue we're missing documenting an important player within the heart of America's progressive non-profit community. -- Susan Finkelpearl, Saturday, Sept. 2, 2006, 9:47 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sfinkelpearl (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sfinkelpearl_63f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sfinkelpearl">contribs</a>) .</small><small>(This editor has only contributed to this AfD and the article under consideration)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b>I'd like to comment in defense of this article and the signifigance of Free Range Studio's presence in both the non-profit world and the popular culture world. From the definition and guidelines of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia Notabillity article for Company's and Corporations</a>: "A company or corporation is notable if it meets any of the following criteria: The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." The Free Range article has been updated with over a dozen citations and references from independent, non-trivial sources discussing Free Ranges' works. A google search of Free Range Studios will yield hundreds of articles discussing Free Range and its work. These hits range from major news papers and film festivals all the way down to personal blogs and online forums. Clearly there is a large and independent interest in the notable work of Free Range. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Meatrix_21ae.html" title="The Meatrix">The Meatrix</a> created an internet viral phenomenon, was viewed over 10 million times and won a <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webby_Award_426c.html" title="Webby Award">Webby Award</a> in 2005. <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/press/archived-speeches.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webbyawards.com/press/archived-speeches.php" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>Eriq Wities 20:31, 2 September 2006 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wities (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wities_1999.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wities">contribs</a>) .</small><small>(This editor has contributed only to this AfD, the article under consideration, and closely related articles)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> In addition to the posting above, I'd like to also comment in defense of this article. As a person rather well-versed in the non-profit technology community, Free Range has clearly met the Wikipedia standard of "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works". A huge number of individuals in in the progressive non-profit sector has been touched by one of Free Range's works, including Store Wars which has been published and commented on by everyone from About.com to Business Week. To delete this entry would be slap in the face to the non-profit community. -- Ryan Ozimek, Monday, Sept. 4, 2006, 18:32 EDT <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 141.156.164.47 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.156.164.47_2c94.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.156.164.47">contribs</a>) .</small><small>(This comment is this editor's only edit)</small></li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I think more research will need to go into this. There is a claim for notability and for all we know this guy could be the Persian version of P-diddy. Currently it's unreferenced and far from a perfect state but if notability can be established then it's worth keeping. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:10, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point. If "9 successful albums" is anywhere close to true, he's easily notable. I would be slow on the trigger with this one, especially as the original author seems to be familiar with contemporary Persian musicians but very unfamiliar with English wikipedia&#160;:-\ <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 07:23, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I googled him a bit. Anything written about his biogrphay is taken from his official site and so you can't know if it's realy true or not, well that's the story he has told! I didn't find 9 albums but 6. There was no information about how successful they were, but none of them was listed in any top 10 or something like that. It lookes like, he was not a very successfull singer in the past, but he got famous after singing together with <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googoosh.html" title="Googoosh">Googoosh</a> (the most popular female singer of Iran). I found also something about his family: "Mehrdad AsemAni left his 1 year old daughter (Maahak) to be with his gf (GooGoosh). Mehrdad's wife (daughter of a rich iranian merchant) took her daughter and left him to Iran." <a href="http://www.irankicks.com/ikboard/archive/index.php/t-28159.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irankicks.com/ikboard/archive/index.php/t-28159.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Move</b> Another point is, that "Mehrdad" is a popular persian name, with relativly old history. There were some important kings in persian history who were called Mehrdad (M. I, M. II, ...), so the first content which is associated with this name is some historical persons like <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus.html" title="Cyrus">Cyrus</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darius.html" title="Darius">Darius</a>. Dariush is one of the most popular iranian singers, but you won't get any information about him on <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darius.html" title="Darius">Darius</a>. The same is with "Amadeus". No-one has written an article about Mozart and called it "Amadeus", although he may be the most famous "Amadeus", so an article about Mr. Mehrdad Asemani, who is not even the most popular and well-known "Mehrdad" shouldn't also be called Mehrdad, but "Mehrdad_Asemani". See also <a href="../../../../de/m/e/h/Mehrdad.html" class="extiw" title="de:Mehrdad">de: Mehrdad</a>. Mubed 07:45, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ok, let's <b>delete it</b> instead of improving the content. Come on! You have created real public legal proceedings here. Let's proceed to the execution.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> According to the article "NetUP also contributed to popularization of Linux in Russia". If this is correct the company is can be notable but only if the effect was enough to create a verifiable source for this.

<p>Probably a hoax or autobiography, no verifiable facts</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> This article has many faults. First of all it does not come with any verifiable facts, just claims of different types. Secondly this article does after my opinion not come with any bio facts (like birth, education, present jobs etc) which can be used to verify that this is not a fraud. Third of all there is a claim that this person is the first non-sami to live in <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakselv.html" title="Lakselv">Lakselv</a>, something that I doubt since there have been non-sami living there for probably hundreds of years. And it also makes unsourced claims in relation to <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakselv_Airport%2C_Banak_9f6e.html" title="Lakselv Airport, Banak">Lakselv Airport, Banak</a>. In the talk page it is claimed that the person has been on <a href="../../../t/v/2/TV2_%28Norway%29_4f0e.html" title="TV2 (Norway)">TV2 (Norway)</a> and <a href="../../../t/v/n/TVNorge_ad48.html" title="TVNorge">TVNorge</a>, but not what programs, if it was a regular or as a prop. This is not mentioned in the article itself. A serch on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.kvasir.no" class="external text" title="http://www.kvasir.no" rel="nofollow">Kvasir</a> (Norwegian serch engine) shows nothing that can verify that the person is actually noteworthy of any kind. Neither has repeated questions to the author about finding some sort of source that can verify the integrety of the person has not been answered. The article has also been deleted previously on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">September 7</a>, while this article was recreated on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_8.html" title="September 8">September 8</a>.

<p>A mass nomination for the streets of Penn State University. These streets are non notable outside the university: some of them have been nominated for merging, and while I have no reason to oppose a merge of info (if people want that info in the main article, be my guest), I would oppose the keeping of the generic "allen street" as a redirect to Penn State University. I don't oppose the inclusion of major, famous streets (highways, major streets in big cities, Monopoly streets, ... ) but the inclusion of every street of a University campus is overkill.

<li><b>Delete</b>, Wikipedia is not a road atlas, and it'd suck at it if we tried (in current form). Per the usual standards, it's not obvious why any of these roads are notable by themselves, nor is it obvious how we could write more than 2-5 sentences of non-crufty information about each one before getting hopelessly mired in inanity. Yeah, I'm probably wandering off into my own opinion here. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 17:40, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just don't see myself why it is a subject worthy of an encyclopedia article. Counter-arguments on the talk page have included the presence of such articles as <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_Whale_6698.html" title="Exploding Whale">Exploding Whale</a> - but while this has received non-trivial press coverage, the only press coverage Navel Lint appears to have received is in connection with the Ig Nobel prize. Surely there's a reason why these prizes are awarded? If it wasn't for the prize, the first link would also be viewed as gratuitous and non-notable, i'm sure. I'm open to any valid reasons to keep, however - i'm just realising that those last few sentences could be interpreted by some as overbearing... - should I write articles on <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_trousers.html" title="Exploding trousers">Exploding trousers</a>; <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuticles.html" title="Neuticles">Artificial dog testicles</a>; Television viewing by locusts, or communication among herring by farting? --<a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_more_bongos_9740.html" title="User:No more bongos">No more bongos</a> 13:32, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, what I should have said was "press or academic". I would, myself, immediately define a study into it which won an Ig Nobel prize as being trivial. Others may disagree, though. I do see what you're trying to say, but I still think it has no place as an article of its own. Claus Diff's suggestion to merge seems like a possible compromise, and if consensus heads that way, I wouldn't have a problem. --<a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_more_bongos_9740.html" title="User:No more bongos">No more bongos</a> 15:43, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I was sure that this would be an easy article to delete, but, lo and behold, the article actually addresses the subject in an encyclopedic fashion.

<li><b>Nomination Withdrawn - Close Please</b> - There seems to be a consensus to keep, so to save a long, drawn-out argument, I'm withdrawing the nomination. This isn't to say that I agree with the arguments to keep - I firmly believe the consensus reached is the wrong one. This is entirely without prejudice to any further AFD, either by myself or somebody else. Nevertheless, I would like the nomination withdrawn, as I have no desire to get into lengthy arguments, or to waste editors' time with bloated AFD discussions. <a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_more_bongos_9740.html" title="User:No more bongos">No more bongos</a> 20:20, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Seems like a notable neighborhood/section of a town. Has some history, no reason to think it's untrue.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- the place certainly exists, though I'd have to do a check on the accuracy of some of the information within.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Ebbsco's Australia and New Zealand database has 105 hits mainly from the Geelong Advertiser.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm of the opinion that a town is inherently notable, and even a section of a town if the history about the administrative split from Ocean Grove can be verified.

<li><b>Keep</b>There was no documentation on the internet about my town or now suburb as many see it, so I decided to use wikipedia to put a bit about the history. If you need proof of existance use <a href="http://www.street-directory.com.au" class="external free" title="http://www.street-directory.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.street-directory.com.au</a> it is marked on there(at detail level 5). but it is more considered by the locals to start at tuckfeild street. The infomation I have written is gathered from people who have lived in Ocean Grove longer than me. The Handshake is an actual handshake (this section was deleated, I'm not sure how many people still know it, but it does exist at least me and my friends still use it. I dont mind if that section isnot deemed encyclopedia worthy, but the histroy is definatly worthy Koikaze 10:36, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am placing this article up for AFD at the request of its subject. As a result of malicious vandalism to the article (see OTRS ticket #2006090810001751) he has asked us to consider deleting it. In his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please express to the editors that I hate being listed on Wikipedia because of the open source policy which has caused lies to spread about me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have explained to him that we don't as a matter of course delete articles on notable individuals even at their request, but in fairness to Mr Kennedy I think it is reasonable for his request to be discussed by Wikipedia editors.</p>
<p>This nomination should not be interpreted as an endorsement either of deletion or retention: I will remain neutral in this discussion so that I can fairly report its outcome to Mr Kennedy.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, As an admin who has been watching the article, let me weigh in a little on it's history. And there is a good bit of deleted history to it. The article's subject is apparently fairly controversial in certain circles, and has a number of detractors. There was an edit war a while back between a strong supporter and a strong detractor. The detractor was posting some extremely derogatory material, but would provide no sourcing that would satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Several admins (including me) became involved, the page was protected, and in the end the bulk of the edits with the derogatory material was removed from the edit history. The one "vandalism" that has happened since then was of similarly derogatory material. It was quickly reverted by Dawn Horse Warrior (<a href="../../../d/a/w/User_talk%7EDawn_Horse_Warrior_57e1.html" title="User talk:Dawn Horse Warrior">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dawn_Horse_Warrior_b728.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dawn Horse Warrior">contribs</a>), who is at the least a strong Kennedy supporter. So in the end this is not about normal vandalism, but a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> issue, with unsourced derogatory material. Still revert on sight stuff, but a different type of "vandalism" than most are used to. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 14:52, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In the non deleted edit war, the page was at one point semi-protected, and the detractor, who had a new-ish account was able to resume editing and warring within a day or two. So Semi protection is not necessarily useful in cases where the detractors of the subject are determined enough to wait out the aging of new accounts. As for it being "Significant" vandalism, while I'm sure Mr. Kennedy thinks that any vandalism is significant, looking in the history I see the one edit war between 617USA (<a href="../../../6/1/7/User_talk%7E617USA_d0ae.html" title="User talk:617USA">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_617USA_3037.html" title="Special:Contributions/617USA">contribs</a>) (Pro) and Suture (<a href="../../../s/u/t/User_talk%7ESuture_baf5.html" title="User talk:Suture">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Suture_73cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Suture">contribs</a>) (con) that lasted 4-5 days in mid July, and one more, from the 7th of September, that was quickly removed. I would not really call these "significant vandalism", compared with many other pages on the project. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a>
<dl>
<dd>The specific piece of vandalism that Mr Kennedy was concerned about was reverted within 30 minutes by another editor. I've already explained to him our unwillingness to protect or semi-protect articles that are not subject to persistent vandalism. --ⁿɡ͡b <a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Nick Boalch</a><span style="padding: 0 0.1em;">\</span><sup style="font-size: 70%;"><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">talk</a></sup> 15:53, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The GWB article is only semi-protected, not full protected. Semi protection is great against casual vandals, but not that useful against determined detractors/edit warriors. All it takes to get past semi protection is 4-5 days of patience, and the account is old enough to get around it. And that's exactly what happened on the WHK page back during the July edit war. Page was semi-protected, the detractor with the new-ish account waited 1-2 days and was able to resume editing the page despite the semi-protection. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 16:59, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note: Because it was I who objected to the tactics of <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a> in the first place, and now pushed to have this article <i>un</i>deleted, only to have it pounced upon by User:CrazyRussian again, the following refutation of his above points is required here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Barry Gurary was the <i>only</i> remaing male relative of the Schneersohn-Gurary-Shneerson family in his generation (note, that the 6th rebbe's name was spelled with an "h" in it, and the 7th rebbe was his cousin and that is why his name was spelled differently, without the "h"). This is very significant. Wikipedia has an article about <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alois_Hitler%2C_Jr._9fc9.html" title="Alois Hitler, Jr.">Alois Hitler, Jr.</a>, the half-brother of Hitler. Why? The <i>only</i> reason which indeed makes it notable is that he was Hitler's half-brother. Period. There are many other cases like this, such as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Harry_of_Wales_f9b1.html" title="Prince Harry of Wales">Prince Harry of Wales</a> (what has he done that makes him notable? and it's unlikely that he will ever be king of anything!), whereby family relationships alone warrant an article.</li>
<li>Barry Gurary didn't just "steal some books from his uncle" -- because who was to say that his uncle had a right to them in the first place. In any case the court ruled that the books belonged to the Chabad movement and not "to the uncle."</li>
<li>It is NOT "disengenious" to compare Barry Gurary to the <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsarevich_Alexei_Nikolaevich_of_Russia_513a.html" title="Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia">Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia</a> because, as I stated, the Tsrevitch was a young kid who never got to be Czar (and what did the Tsarevich ever do in his short life that made him "notable"?) Indeed there is an entire category called <a href="../../../h/e/i/Category%7EHeirs_apparent_who_never_acceded_883f.html" title="Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded">Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded</a> and Barry Gurary could fit into such a category perfectly if there were a Hasidic equivalent! When Barry was 14 (the age at which the Tsarevitch was executed by the Bolsheviks) he was indeed viewed as the ONLY heir to the Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty by his grandfather, the 6th rebbe.</li>
<li>When CrazyRussian compares Jewish statistics with Russian or world statistics he crosses all lines of logic because we are talking about Jews and Judaism and since there are only about 13 million Jews in the world, they will <i>always</i> be outnumbered compared to numbers in the world's general population (currently at over 6 BILLION).</li>
<li>To claim that there are not enough works about Barry Gurary in the world is also a poor argument (how many books are there about Alois Hitler Jr?) because there are many articles relating to Judaism, and to <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic Judaism</a> in particular about which there are few if any sources because the topics, while they may be of importance, remain signficant within the history of a group or as part of a sub-culture which may seem esoteric to outsiders.</li>
<li>At the very least, the article is far better than most of the hundreds of stubs relating to Jews and Judaism.</li>
<li>Finally, as CrazyRussian admits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shemaryahu_Gurary&amp;diff=75088509&amp;oldid=75088422" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shemaryahu_Gurary&amp;diff=75088509&amp;oldid=75088422" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, he hadn't even heard of Barry Gurary before he came across the article, and he was also the one who submitted it for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shemaryahu_Gurary&amp;diff=75088422&amp;oldid=75075893" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Shemaryahu_Gurary&amp;diff=75088422&amp;oldid=75075893" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> so the question is: How can <i>anyone</i> judge, let alone submit for "deletion," an article they they openly admit they know nothing about? Therefore what is the rush to have it deleted again so quickly unless there may be other POV objectives that I cannot fathom at this time. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 03:03, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Crazy: Why call what is a clear logical categorical rebuttal a "diatribe"&#160;? In any case, the issue of Barry Gurary goes way beyond the parameters of a "rabbi's bio", it touches upon a far deeper matter pertaining to how and why and at what point potential heirs to <i>any</i> dynasty or powerful group are marginalized and deligitimatized and sent into obscurity, if not literally executed at the end of it all. You know, as an example, if one were to adopt a Stalinist frame of mind, then Trotsky's bio is "not worth keeping" beyond tarring him as a cheap "villain," and yes I know, Barry Gurary was no Trotsky, but think of it in terms of the Hasidim who swear by family successions <i>only</i> when it comes to their rebbes' iron-clad rulership over them, Barry Gurary presents as big a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conundrum" class="extiw" title="wikt:conundrum">conundrum</a> to Lubavitch as much as the issue of Trotsky's mere existence represented to Stalinists.

<li>Crazy: Perhaps you are not that well-acquainted with Wikipedia yet where articles may start as stubs and then progress over time, sometimes years, into longer articles. This article is well beyond stub status, it has a number of links that verify a lot of its content. To ask for Harvard research-level quality as an article progresses is not always realistic because as you may be aware, articles need time, sometimes years, to evolve and mutate into better articles.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article's title is (1) <b>inflammatory</b>, (2) <b>biased</b>, and (3) <b>nonacademic</b>. There are countries with higher degree of regional dissimilarity, Canada, UK, Spain, India, Russia, to name a few, but for <i>none</i> of the countries, the regional differences have been listed in a separate article like Dissimilarities in Canada or Dissimilarities in Russia.

Obviously a POV attempt of deletion driven by the nominator's seeing Wikipedia as a tool to advance his political agenda. Totally valid topic, totally neutrally written.

<dd>I let the others judge. Besides, I said I was open to the rename suggestion but not to some kind of "merge" under the pretence that the topic is somehow not worthy an article on its own. It is worthwile to point out that both attacks on the article's existence came from two radical but curiously the exactly opposite ends of the political spectrum. The nominator of the previous AfD wrote an extremely inflammatory (by content, not the title) "East Ukraine" entry, now AfDed, that almost called for the partitioning of Ukraine. The second nominator, sees the mere acknowledgement of Ukrainian non-uniformity as "divisive", "inflammatory" and "biased" and launches an attack on it from the opposite end. <b>That radicals attack the article from both ends seems a good indication that the article strikes the right balance</b> --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:38, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Irpen's claim that "<i>radicals attack the article</i>" is nothing but a personal attack against everybody who somehow turns out to have an opinion different from his.

<dl>
<dd>That's blatantly false. I recognize and accept the POV that are different from mine and resolved hundreds of articles with my good-faith opponents. There is no personal attack in calling radical views as such. I can point to a good bunch of instances where you pushed views radically different from the mainstream in the country whose opinion you claim to represent as well as from the positions widely accepted internationally. That's exactly why such views did not find any backing. Finally, when you have nothing to say on the topic, accusing your opponent unsubstinantially in a personal attack just shows that you really do not have anything more to say. You just "disagree". --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 00:29, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Unless the contribuitor quickly writes some sense in the article, I am going to vote for its deletion. So far it is some chaotic rant that different neighbors influenced Ukraine. But not a word how it actually created the "disiimilarity" and of what kind, and why not "north-south" nor NNW-SSE. Also the title is of dubious usage:no google hits besides wikipediatry. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:30, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This was discussed at Talk:East-West_dissimilarity_in_Ukraine#Delete. The article is open for anyone to develop it. I might if I get to it as well. As for the title/google hits issue, the title is descriptive.

<li><b>Keep</b> No need to delete this article. Mina Khel tribe is the ruling clan of Marwat Tribe, for past 300 years.

<li>I'm new to Wiki so this is a real question. How do you interpret notability? WP:ORG criteria states: "Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable UNLESS verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found."

<ul>
<li><i>Respond</i> I usually look for coverage <i>about</i> the subject of the article. So I'm looking more for coverage about the camp than about the race that occurs there. That isn't strictly required, but the notability guidelines exist so that 1) we don't indiscriminately collect data on non-encyclopedic topics and 2) we have some reason to believe that enough <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> about the topic of the article exists that someday we can produce an article fully adhering to the policies on being <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and having a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>.

<p>The info is not vanity it is factual, and as for non-notable corporation... It is not a corporation so before users try to delete things more research should be done. What crosses the threshold of something that is considered notable? Meaning that you are interested in it, or that the information is valuable to someone else. If it had more info about the company and not what IDEZ was actually defining it would be more of a vanity page. 24.59.59.240 07:19, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

The fact that her career has taken off on the Internet more so than any place else (though again, she has toured the US and into Canada) does not make her irrelevant, in fact, it makes Wikipedia perhaps the most valid place to report on her career. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington"><font style="background:#000088;" color="#FFFF88">AlexWCovington</font></a></b> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 03:59, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ohconfucius seems to have actually done the research and come up with a <i>delete</i> conclusion, but I admit I haven't done it myself, and that my "ask a friend" test was a little lazy (in fairness, my buddy Pete really does know a crapload about the indie music scene, so it wasn't just like some random friend... but yeah, I should do the research myself). Anyway, I remain borderline. I will research again tomorrow, as per Alex's request, and may change my vote. We shall see. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 04:49, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Terra Naomi has been on several national tours, including one opening for pop-star Tyler Hilton, in the summer of 2005. In addition the Wikipedia rules say that "Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show." One of her songs has recently appeared on the soundtrack for the new Maggie Gyllenhall movie "Sherrybaby," which is available on Amazon and iTunes. <font color="purple">Ezra</font> 13 September 2006</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> How are your "people got killed for translating the Bible" arguments any less out-of-proportion than the Nazi analogies?!</dd>
<dd>The point you are missing is that Wikipedia is not some government democracy that you can vote for change. It's a private organization, and they make their own rules, using their own money combined with private donations. You can ask nicely for them to change their rules, but you have absolutely no right to <i>demand</i> it. After all, you are completely free to buy a web server and create your own website using the Wikimedia software...</dd>
<dd>Anyway, this petty anti-rule argument is moot. I would strongly encourage those who voted "delete" to please see the rationale for my changed vote at the top of this page.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I just edited the article to add an additional citation and reduce the POV and promotional aspect of it. I think it reads fairly neutral now. Artist <i>does</i> satisfy one criteria of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> (track appears on other notable media), and in addition has some inherent notability due to the unconventional path to success. Even a strict reading of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> turns this article into a redirect rather than a delete, and I think the latter point puts it over the edge to a keep-er. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 19:04, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> and it might be added that that is one interpretation of <i>Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.)</i>... personally I don't think having a track on a soundtrack really satisfies that because at that point the question now becomes "is the soundtrack notable in and of itself as a form of media". Besides, in my opinion that argues a redirect... I'd be more convinced if I saw a tour schedule from a source other than her own website. Still, it is largely a moot point because peering into my crystal ball I predict this will be kept at least on a "no consensus" and in one year's time she will likely meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> solidly anyway.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> please do not put words in my mouth. I am not contesting the film's notability at all. I am contesting the fact that the artist has no verifiable notability beyond this. In light of that, yes, deleting the article and redirecting to the movie is fine. Not every artist that has a track featured on a movie sound track (moreso an indy movie like this where no-name artists are usually used) should have and article. There needs to be more claim-to-fame beyond a sound editor deciding that X artist's song sounds good to use for a 5-10 second clip for X part of a movie. The article was pegged for AfD because there are no verifiable claims of notability beyond the persona website and now having a track used in an indy movie (which frankly is laughable at best) <b>Delete and redirect</b> --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 19:12, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b></p>
<p>Basically this (sorry long) item places the justification on Terra Naomi being the currently pre-eminent example of an Indie musician exploiting a new "scene" via the medium of YouTube.</p>
<p>First I need to introduce myself by saying I have no connection with Terra Naomi save that I’ve contributed a lot to her message board in the past 2 months. I’ve also been (sort of) been delegated to assemble some points on why Terra Naomi entry merits retention by some members of the board. Note that I'm well aware these things can become personalised, so this is factual.</p>
<p>Of all the factors, the most important is her importance on YouTube. That the full future impact of YouTube and its ilk as major cultural channels has yet to be fully evaluated is undeniable, but the influence is clear to see. If, as I believe, YouTube and the like are considered to be influential and important, then Terra Naomi is undoubtedly the pre-eminent exemplar of Indie music on that medium. It can easily be argued that this qualifies under this condition&#160;:-</p>
<p>“Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.”</p>
<p>(local scene referring to the YouTube community of course).</p>
<p>The facts regarding Terra Naomi’s importance on YouTube are undeniable and verifiable. These include the following</p>
<p>for two months from the early July to early September, Terra Naomi was the most subscribed musical channel on YouTube. Only in the last week since major label involvement on behalf of two other artists has that position been supplanted on the all-time list.</p>
<p>one of Terra Naomi’s 32 videos (Say It’s Possible) has been viewed over 860,00 times alone. On YouTube alone, total views are in the region of two million.</p>
<p>Terra Naomi’s songs have inspired over fifty YouTube “covers” (I’ve lost count after that).</p>
<p>The following are key YouTube stats (as of 13th August 2006)</p>
<ol>
<li>16 - Most Subscribed Channels (All Time)</li>
<li>3 - Most Subscribed Channels (All Time) - Musicians</li>
</ol>
<p>Of lesser importance, but still worth noting are</p>
<p>Terra Naomi has a strong presence on MySpace, with 800,000 plays (verifiable) and over 21,000 “friends”. This is many more than some more established artists (for example, Katie Melua – the selling female artist in the UK last year has fewer than 8,000). Yes, these can be manipulated, but I’ve not heard of Terra Naomi “polling” anybody.</p>
<p>From stats I’ve assembled from Terra Naomi’s message board, she has an international presence unprecedented at this stage of a career – 53 countries represented in all continents (save Antartica). Evidence of an increasing globalisation through this new medium.</p>
<p>Terra Naomi has a track (Clean) on the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack for Maggie Gyllenhaal film, sherrybaby (released 5th September 2006)</p>
<p>Terra Naomi ha also released (independently) four CDs (ignoring promotions) including</p>
<p>Terra Naomi 2002 Terra Naomi EP Terra Naomi 8 Track Virtually CD</p>
<p>Terra Naomi has toured across the United States on her own, and as a support act to Tyler Hamilton.</p>
<p>I would also add that I have met Terra Naomi at two concerts she gave in London (The Borderline, 26th August 2006 and The Troubadour, 28th August 2006). These are verifiable as I have pictures on Flickr and there is a review of the Troubadour performance on YouTubeTalk. Those watching included two groups who flew in from Italy and one from Germany for the event.</p>
<p>Terra Naomi was in London for talks at the invitation of a record company – details are confidential, and I’m not party to them, but she was accompanied by representatives when I met her.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you have a hard sell considering MySpace or YouTube a "scene". There are hundreds upon hundreds of bands on those sites promoting their music.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If this should be deleted, then pretty much everything in the "In popular culture" category should too. I mean, judging by what's been said here... why do we need a List of pop culture references to Rock, Paper, Scissors article for every time someone plays Rock, Paper, Scissors in pop culture? I mean, I don't think it should be deleted, but if this goes, then that does to. I've learned a thing or two about notability, and everyone seems to know of some of these referenced like the <a href="../../../3/0/_/30_Minutes_Over_Tokyo_4082.html" title="30 Minutes Over Tokyo">30 Minutes Over Tokyo</a> one, even if they don't watch/play/whatever Pokémon. However, if you want it off that badly, I say merge and redirect to <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatty-chan_b884.html" title="User:Matty-chan">Matty-chan</a> 23:15, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>DO NOT DELETE This is my favourite restuarant. I currently live in Lexington and I know the owner. He is an amiable Korean whom I have known for the last four years. Joe's Jambalaya is the absolute greatest thing ever conceived, except Norway. I especially enjoy the usage of my Diamond Card. The absolute genius is that it has great food, a wonderful atmosphere, and all at a great price. Who wouldn't love CG's, as it is affectionately known. The owner is an incredible person who even lets us use the kareoke machines to sing, "God Save the Queen". This is without a doubt an historic moment for Wikipedia. The deletion of this article would be a travesty of justice and a <i>Italic text</i> de facto <i>Italic text</i> endorsement of the prevalent commie establishment. So, I call on Wikipedia as a red-blooded, capitalist soceity to come together and save Clown Gumbos. Without Clown Gumbos, we simply could not survive. Thank you, and God Bless Capitalism. -Ole Frijanger

<li><b>Delete</b> as unsourced list that only identifies a handful of schools.
