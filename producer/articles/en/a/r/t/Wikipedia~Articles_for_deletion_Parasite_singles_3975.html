<p>Not an appropriate topic for an encyclopedia. Does not cite sources. This appears to be little more than a concept from some sociology paperback, which likely masks some political or cultural agenda. Suggestions for what else to do (merge) with this article are welcome. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 05:58, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> relates to Japanese sociological phenomenon of children refusing to engage with outside world, certainly notable, and has had media coverage, but article needs work.

<li><strike><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../h/i/k/Hikikomori.html" title="Hikikomori">Hikikomori</a>, as some of the topics mentioned on this page are mentioned there, so expansion would be helpful. Further, <i>hikikomori</i> is a term that is more commonly known and accepted (especially as per a recent <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">NYT</a> article). --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 06:41, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</strike>After review, I <b>abstain</b> per my lack of proper knowledge on the topic to make a judgment. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 17:44, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Definitely do <b>not</b> merge with Hikikomori, because Hikikomori is a severe disorder, while "parasite single" can refer to people with jobs and active social lives who are still living with mom and dad. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 06:54, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am quite leery of a sociological topic that is getting a lot of current media coverage, particularly in this era of Fox News. This needs more than a NYT article, and a more thorough history going back several years. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 06:47, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> -- I have no idea if it's a validated social-science concept, but if it's getting wide media discussion, then it's notable on that basis. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 07:02, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a well-written article that explains the concept's significance quite well, although it could probably use more citation. It's not the same thing as <a href="../../../h/i/k/Hikikomori.html" title="Hikikomori">hikikomori</a> and I feel it deserves its own article (but I'm no expert on Japanese social concepts...) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka">Grandmasterka</a> 07:25, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Needs sources but a useful article. 714 Google results but include verifiable sources such as the BBC and USA Today <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Parasite+singles%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Parasite+singles%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>No doubt, a search in Japanese would come up with more. A Google book search came up with three pages showing the term is commonly used. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Parasite+singles%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=6KL&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Parasite+singles%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=6KL&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Google Scholar comes up with 76 results too <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Parasite+singles%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Parasite+singles%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - The topic is well known in Japan, in frequency of usage probably comparable to <a href="../../../y/u/p/Yuppie.html" title="Yuppie">Yuppie</a> in the US. Hikkikomori is a related but definitely different subject. (Disclaimer: I am one of the major contributors to the article, and also contributed significantly to Hikkikomori. I am also no Japanese, and have no <i>political or cultural agenda</i> beyond improving the coverage of Japan in Wikipedia) -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> | <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 14:33, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The concept of Yuppies has been around for decades. Can you establish a history for this term longer than the past few years? Otherwise it seems like popular slang. At the same time, I'd like to see some evidence that this is a recent social phenomenon, and not something that has happened almost everywhere throughout history -- I mean come on, kids living with their parents is nothing new. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 19:43, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Kids living with their parents is nothing new, but a large fraction of people in their twenties feeling no real pressure to marry or contribute to household expenses, and spending almost all their income on discretionary purchases, is fairly new... <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 20:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Especially in a society where early marriage is normal and expected. Oh, and the term "yuppie" dates to 1984, and I seriously doubt that you would have used the "only the past few years" test in the 1988 equivalent of Wikipedia. "Recent sociological phenomenon" is, strangely enough, recent. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:53, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why is this social phenomenon significant? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 03:02, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, I don't know, maybe because it's a significant alteration in a conservative society's behavior and affects everything from economics to the country's low birthrate. The multiple Google Scholar and Google Book hits might have been the tiniest clue as to significance. A better question is, why do you keep asking pointless rhetorical questions? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why do I ask rhetorical questions? Because this is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not some spurious letter to the editor about "those darn kids who won't get jobs." Please, show me something more than a crackpot theory about a "conservative society" and a 500 word article in the Times. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 10:10, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On a side note, Shoehorn, could you try a more neutral language. Calling it <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Talk%7EParasite_singles_b147.html" title="Talk:Parasite singles">bullshit</a></i> or <i>crackpot theory</i> does not aid a factual discussion. Also, as another info, the German article on this topic has 1100 words and the Japanese one has 900 words. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> | <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 11:20, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
