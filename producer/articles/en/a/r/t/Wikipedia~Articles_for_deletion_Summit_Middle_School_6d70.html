<li><b>Delete</b> The fact that this (undoubtedly ordinary) school exists is not sufficient to warrant it's inclusion. If a school is somehow fundamentally unique, of interest, or supremely representative of something broader, then it merits inclusion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article tells me where the school is and how many students it has (and that a person whose article wouldn't pass CSD A7 went there), and will likely not ever offer any other useful information, making it <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">an unexpandable stub</a>.

<ul>
<li>My very small expansion of the article "<i>by adding something other than demographic</i>" already proved you wrong (before you even made the comment). Also, the student, while not famous, and not warranting a separate article yet, is more relevant than a famous person would be, if that famous person got fame well after graduation (as is typical). I'm sure the details that are likely to be added won't be of interest to you, and many others, and that's ok with me; since I feel they will be of interst to a sufficient number. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:00, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have really broad definitions of notability as pertains to schools, and the person you added was the alumnus I was referring to. That said, I require more than deographic data and assertion of existence before I'm willing to accept that a school is an encyclopedic topic, and the insertion of a fact that would be minute trivia in <a href="../../../c/o/q/Coquitlam%2C_British_Columbia_a0e3.html" title="Coquitlam, British Columbia">Coquitlam, British Columbia</a> and doesn't seem to have anything to do with the school just isn't enough. The fact that the most important non-demographic datum about this school is the proverbial half-column story on page five of the local paper speaks volumes, I think. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:12, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What's this thing with demographics you keep bringing up? I actually don't like the demographics excess of school articles, just as I don't like the excess demographics I see in countless swmall township articles. I won't be the person telling you that "3.53% are Asian", just as I wouldn't have told you that of the 13 people in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_North_Dakota_1a09.html" title="Perth, North Dakota">Perth, North Dakota</a> "100.00% White, 0.00% African American", as I find such machine-speak worthless. I realize you don't find the same things I do, to be interesting which is fine. If wikipedia was a democracy, and I a politician, I would do be my best to win every vote I could, by giving people what they want in school articles: long celeb lists; school shootings; Victorian-era construction; sensational head-line scandals, and more. Fortunately, I needn't worry about that, and am hapy this article will be kept without it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:40, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe I wasn't clear; if there's nothing to say about a school but raw demographic data, I feel the article should be deleted (or merged, if appropriate) as an <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">unexpandable stub</a>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:48, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You still fail to explain why <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_North_Dakota_1a09.html" title="Perth, North Dakota">Perth, North Dakota</a> is ok, even though it has the problem you incorrectly claim this school does. Aside from demographics, there's nothing else in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_North_Dakota_1a09.html" title="Perth, North Dakota">Perth, North Dakota</a>, yet I know you would never think of deleting it. Anyway, anybody can see this article was expanded beyond what you said it could be, and will continue to be. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 15:05, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_North_Dakota_1a09.html" title="Perth, North Dakota">Perth, North Dakota</a> is okay because overwhelming consensus says that demographic-only articles about cities are okay, however small the city. (I'm ambivalent about the subject myself.) You, and many others, want to extend the city precedent to schools. I, and many others, want to extend the precedent for individual people. Reasonable people can (and do) disagree about this, and can attempt to find a middle ground.<br />
As for expanding past what I said it could be, bear in mind that my vote was based on the current version of the article.

<li>Yes, I did notice the datestamps. Notice above I claimed to have proved you wrong "<i>before you even made the comment</i>". It's modest expansion so far since creation, proves it can continue to be expanded, and in one-spot will have what no other single location has. This puts it ahead of a lot of other articles. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 16:33, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
