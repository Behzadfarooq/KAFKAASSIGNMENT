<p>This was on prod, but it seems controversial to me. There have been some POV issues, and perhaps there's no need for a separate "anti" article, but I think there needs to be a discussion on this. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickelShoe_8b97.html" title="User talk:NickelShoe">Talk</a>) 15:54, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Original PROD deletion reason by me: <i>No references, no evidence of notability or a coherent organisation; appears only to be presentation of personal POV, not an organisation in the wider world</i> - that is, there's no evidence given in the article that it's actually anything other than a POV rant - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 16:39, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. You can't get rid of a whole movement, and the associated controversy, by just slapping an AfD on it. I think it's a bad idea to ever slap an AfD on a long article with lots of editors over a long period of time; those editors have said that it is in fact a good article.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 16:04, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy keep and cleanup</b>, POV warring is not a justification for deletion, no matter how severe.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I marked this as PROD because there's no evidence even named in the article of an organisation. This article doesn't describe someone's attributed views at all - it's pretty much a POV rant arguing the issue itself. There's no article there. If there is, rewrite it to address the apparent lack of a reason for it to exist, don't keep it in the hope one might appear one day - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 16:39, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I'm tempted to simply say "nn, delete", but since that is one of the AFD habits which annoys me most…this article completely fails to establish what it is actually about. There is nothing about the history of "Anti-metrication" or who espouses it, it is simply a rant against <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cro-magnon.html" title="Cro-magnon">Cro-magnon</a> reactionaries who prefer old-style units.

<li>I'd happily withdraw my original nomination (does this count as my nom, as it was brought here as a contested PROD?) if they could just, uh, point me at an organization of this name.

<li>If you <b>DELETE</b> this article, you need to DELETE the METRICATION article also... Otherwise you are DEFINITELY biased in your POV. This article keeps being being re-written in a pro-metric biased POV (EXAMPLE: <i>"because of <b>perceived</b> flaws in the metric system"</i>, tell me that's not biased! When the flaw exists in the Imperial system it's a flaw... When it exists in the metric system, it's <b>perceived</b>!?!?!) The fact of the matter is, any article dealing with this subject is going to be controversial and if Wikipedia deletes all controversial articles, then it's a pretty lame source of information. And it that's the case, I want to see Metric System, SI, and Metrication deleted also because they are all extremely biased! <a href="../../../a/r/f/User%7EArfon_0c76.html" title="User:Arfon">arfon</a> 17:35, 22 March 2006 (UTC) - <b>KEEP</b> - This whole argument is Assinine! This is an article descibing the Anti-metrifcation movement and it's reasons. It's assinine to <b>expect anything BUT A anti-metric POV on it</b>! It's a biased POV when you describe the movement and then add words to make people think that the movement is wrong and it's people are stupid. <a href="../../../a/r/f/User%7EArfon_0c76.html" title="User:Arfon">arfon</a> 17:53, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see why the metrication article can't also contain information on anti-metrication. And we don't delete articles because they're biased. The issue here is mostly with the lack of verification. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickelShoe_8b97.html" title="User talk:NickelShoe">Talk</a>) 17:40, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no sources cited; pure OR. It started off being biased original research: why a few editors think anti-metrication is silly. Then it became truly absurd original research: why one editor thinks anti-metrication is our only saviour against the Devil's Units. There <i>is</i> the potential for a good article here, if we had, say, a well-sourced description of the history of metrication and those silly people who opposed it — but this isn't it, and in any case there's no reason why it needs to be <i>here</i> and not as part of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrication.html" title="Metrication">Metrication</a> or, if necessary, a better-named spinoff. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 17:48, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> obviously needs several tags (cleanup, sources, POV etc.) but this article does capture a genuine set of arguments that those against metrification use. I wouldn't call it a "movement" because there is (AFAIK) no organized group with this agenda. Some record of these arguments is worth keeping in an encyclopedia. fuddlemark's (MarkGallagher's) suggestion of incorporating some of this material into an "Arguments against Metrification" section of the main Metrification article has merits and may be a good compromise. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 17:56, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you can find <i>anything</i> resembling a verifiable third-party source for this stuff - 'cos at the moment it is actually a few individuals' ramblings - it would be most welcomed - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 18:00, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> While I believe the movement itself <i>may</i> be notable (meaning: notable if cited) I don't think a POV fork of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrication.html" title="Metrication">Metrication</a> is called for here. Opposition to metrication is already discussed in that article.

<li><b>Delete</b> It's a POV fork. The resistance to metrication is clearly an issue (though poorly described and completely unsourced here) that needs to be discussed <i>within</i> the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrication.html" title="Metrication">Metrication</a> article. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 18:12, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as a POV fork.

<li>Sorry about that. But anyone, especially Americans, insulting the metric system makes me angry. I stand by my delete vote, though. As for Finnish stereotypes, the Swedes call us silent and impolite, the Estonians call us heavy drinkers, and everyone else calls us Nazis. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 20:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see where you are coming from. i am a bit sensitive on over-generalizations of America and the idea of collective responsibility for the mistakes of my leaders and/or dumb things said by the fringe. I get a little touchy since, when I lived in Europe, I had to spend about 2 hours a week defending myself from drunken accusations made by people that did not approve of NATO operations in the former Yugoslavia or the music of N'Sync. As for a reason for why I vote delete: pov fork, nn movement, and other reasons given. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 20:55, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. POV rant, original research, irreparably biased. Don't get me wrong: If this article was <i>about</i> the anti-metrication movement (if there is anything resembling an organized movement), and if it was written to provide information about the history of that movement, its supporters and opponents, their attempts to influence legislation, standards bodies, etc., it might be salvageable. Or it could describe how the transition to the metric system was accomplished across the world, to what extent this caused confusion, consumer price increases, etc. However, as it is, the article is at best a blatantly biased and incomplete comparison between the metric system and a narrow set of alternatives. Best to scrap it and start over somewhere else: I'd much rather see a properly sourced article on the history of metrication. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 23:24, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There may well be room for an NPOV on anti-metrication based on verifiable references. However, this is not it.

<li>It is <i>not</i> 100% factual, and it is not completely sourced. The stuff about French wine, for example, reads like you've made it up ("could only be explained by"), as does "unit confusion" (a case of "many people believe" = "I believe", or <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>). The sources themselves are very sad indeed; one of the best is an ABC Radio interview with an English teacher (!) who rattled off a few "facts" he heard somewhere. The vast majority of sources (certainly every one I looked at) came from someone who was not themselves an expert, and who cited no sources of their own. So: it is <i>still</i> biased, <i>still</i> original research, and <i>still</i> unlikely to be wholly factual (although nobody has argued for deletion on <i>that</i> particular criterion). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 10:16, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I followed the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrication.html" title="Metrication">Metrication</a> article to source it therefore, it's sourced the same way.

<li><i>"It is not 100% factual"</i> point out the errors, don't just make a broad statement and expect me to accept it.

<li>The article states that the fact that French wine wasn't immediately switched from 720mL bottles to 1L bottles "can only be explained by" popular resistance to the Metric system (that the English once had a measure of a similar size is apparently relevant, although the article hints but won't say why). It <i>also</i> says that the bottles were later increased to 750mL, and includes all this "information" in a section about how Metrication inevitably causes traders to try to rip-off their customers ... by <i>reducing</i> the size of their measures.

<li>I second what Nickel Shoe says. Metrication is a significant process with enormous cultural, historical, scientific, technological, etc. importance. It therefore deserves an article. The opposition to it is also significant. The question is whether there is room in the main article to cover this opposition. It seems that there is not. <i>Thus</i> we have the article <i><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-metrication.html" title="Anti-metrication">Anti-metrication</a></i> (which, as I mention, would be better renamed).
