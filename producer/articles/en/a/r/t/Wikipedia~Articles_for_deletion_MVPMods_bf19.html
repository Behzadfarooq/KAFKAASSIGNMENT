<p><b>Delete.</b> The article has absolutely no legitimate basis for existing within Wikipedia's database, for it was clearly created based on an individual's biased perspective on an internet website. The article contains many unnecessary references to certain individuals and actually derides them within its text. This is absolutely unnecessary and should not be tolerated. Very little factual information is being displayed, for the article is filled with opinionated, idiosyncratic statements with the sole intention of <i><b>promoting</b></i> the website. The absence of a neutral point of view throughout it, the inability to verify many of the article's statements, and the fact that it was written from an idiosyncratic perspective with the intention of advertising the webpage on Wikipedia, thus, legitimizes its deletion. Furthermore, one can visit the website's forum itself at www.mvpmods.com and discover that the creation of this page has clearly been an immature advertising campaign in order to arouse amusement amongst its members.

<li><b>comment</b>It is the duty of the voters here to change their votes from deletion to keep. The article is cited in the media unlike other forums found on wikipedia. The initial creation of the article, far before this version, was done without the members of the site's knowledge for purposes dealing with information, not advertising. People here hinge their deletion arguments on "dopesn't satify wiki requirements" or "too much pov statements." These have all been deleted and citation has been added. Change your vote, change your reasoning, or admit that you have no interest in sticking to wiki's actual rules and purpose: information for the people. --wikilagata, 7 July 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment for vote</b> That doesn't subtract from its legitimacy.</li>
<li><b>Comment against vote</b> Same reason as Razum's. Seems that those who support MVP Mods are either contributors or their friends. While I think the site should get a mention in the article for the game that it's based on, this attempt to create an article is simply for promoting the site. Also, there's seems to be implication that those who are for keeping the articles are somehow "management" or "bosses" of Wikipedia who are holding the good guys down. I sense immaturity is running rampant here. -- CRiyl 01:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment against comment against vote</b> So, those who are interested in Subject X are unsurprisingly interested in Subject X in Wikipedia. And People who participate in Subject X outside wikipedia should be ignored as they are biased. Gotcha.

<li><b>Comment</b> If by "Subject X" you mean MVP Baseball, then yes as it is a well-known franchise that has (p)reviewed by many in the video game media and was a subject (or victim, depending on your POV) of the sports game licensing wars. If you mean modifying video games in general then there's already an article for it. I don't see anything wrong with contributing to either MVP Baseball or game mods article to illustrate how places like MVP Mods extend the game experience given those contributions conform to policy. Nobody's judging; stay cool. -- CRiyl 03:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, have just seen this bit of the discussion above - is it being claimed above that the <i>content</i> of this website (i.e., its actual mod files in this case) have been "distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster"? Is that what is being claimed here (because that's what <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>3 is referring to)? Please provide some evidence if this type of distribution of the site's content has taken place.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to agree with JChap. I have been contributing to this web site for quite some time and just cannot see how this article can be included in its encyclopedia database. Yes, certain web sites that are NOTEWORTHY (IGN, Yahoo, Google) should certainly be the subjects of articles. I have never heard of MVPMods, however, prior to locating its page today.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, well if YOU have never heard of it, it must not be worthy of inclusion. I personally don't think there should be any entires about modding and mods for any games in the wiki but there are. There's loads of entries about mods and sites for first person shooters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_game_mods" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_game_mods" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>but because the best selling baseball game of all-time is not popular among Wikipedians it becomes not worthy of inclusion (example - it is not even listed as a 'Notable release' here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_in_video_gaming" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_in_video_gaming" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. MVP 2005 is a popular game amongst the general public, many of whom are not as internet-savvy as those in the first person shooter communities. The PS2 version alone was the 7th highest selling game in the US last year<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7794" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7794" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, (The mvpmods site is a site devoted to PS2, Xbox and PC versions of the game) I have yet to see anyone 'expert' in the world of sports video-gaming disagree with the notion that mvpmods is the most popular site for video game baseball modding. Also there are no big ign or gamespy awards for mods and sites like there are for first person shooters. And it is also difficult for major sites like ESPN and others to refer to the site because of a concern about being seen to tacitly endorse possible licencing violations with various 'unlicenced' players (Barry Bonds) and things like beer advertisments being included in some of the mods.

<li><b>Comment</b> If the ARTICLE does not prove that it passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. This has nothing to do with popularity among Wikipedians. This has to do with proving notability as per agreed guidelines as they stand at this time. The burden of proof is on the article to demonstrate it is a notable subject, not on Wikipedians to prove it isn't. If the activities of the website are such that they potentially break game licenses and cause potential legal issues for reliable reporting sources (as seems to be claimed here), then why on earth should Wikipedia be left open to those same potential legal problems by including an article about the site on here? Wikipedia insists on reliable third party sources exactly because it wants verifiability, which guards against any potential legal issues. This is not a blog hosting site for mavericks and avant-garde niche artistes who are otherwise put down by The Man and his awkward insistence on the Law, this is an encyclopedia, beholden to applicable laws itself. Might I also suggest another reason for a lack of reporting in those reliable third-party sources? Perhaps the site is, in fact, not notable enough? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 23:16, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It does, a piece has been provided from Computer Games Magazine ABOUT the site. You say the article is not about the site, but it is, if you actually read it. Wikipedia has no legal problems refering to the site because wikipedia does not have a commercial relationship with Major League Baseball. The burden of proof seems to be much lower for games with a large following amongst the 'hardcore' internet community. It seems a mention in a magazine is all they need.Corinh 23:45, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep if cleaned up</b> POV writing does not require deletion of an article; it can be cleaned up. The case for deletion in this case then seems to be about notability. Above is correct that you <i>can't</i> say it is the #1 site without citing that claim to an outside source. If it really is that popular, however, its popularity (even if not #1-ness) should be verifiable. That it isn't done so far doesn't mean it can't be done, and if it really is mentioned in published magazines as said above, it could be done. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 20:53, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> While MVPMods has relevance in the subgenre of PC sports gaming, but I'd like to see more NPOV, especially after reading <a href="http://mvpmods.com/index.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=22051&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://mvpmods.com/index.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=22051&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although this is an entry of a website and it's mods, there is no way this can be deleted without considering there being near 50 entries of Half-Life mods. --Kccitystar 15:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Should you even be voting given your being a contributor on the site would bring bias? Why bring up the quantity of mods of Half-Life? Not trying to be snobbish, just asking. - CRiyl 16:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually being a contributor to the site does not cloud my judgement, and it was I who first started the article initially, however others had edited after me. The first version of the entry did not contain any form of bias toward MVPMods.com, and it was molded very similar to Maddenmania.--Kccitystar 16:44, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> then you need to delete most of the sites in the Computer and video game websites category Krawhitham 18:07, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It meets the guidelines more than many of the sites listed in that category. Unlike the First Person shooter fan-sites, due to MLB licencing restrictions 'modding' for this game is not endorsed let alone even acknowleged by the game's manufacturer (The original game itself can no longer be sold by EA Sports). The licencing issue and the legal grey area mods for licenced sports-games occupy contributes to the lack of 'official' (read-corporate owned) references. It should be noted that the one reference in the entry is from the only independently owned videogames magazine in the United States.Corinh 02:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
