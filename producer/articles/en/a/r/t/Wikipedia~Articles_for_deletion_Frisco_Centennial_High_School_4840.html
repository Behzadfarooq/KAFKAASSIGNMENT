<li><b>Delete</b>. "Die" might be a little too strong, but this article exhibits no encyclopedic value, is full of POV statements, and in parts nonsensical. I may as well toss in that until there is an agreed policy on schools (<a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> did not succeed, and the creation of a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">wikiproject</a> <i>does not</i> automatically confer encyclopedic value on any given article within that project, and schools are <i>not</i> inherently notable, and "precedent" is meaningless - we're not wikilawyers and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stare_decisis.html" title="Stare decisis">stare decisis</a> does not apply), each school article must be judged on its own merits.

<li><b>Keep</b> I cleaned up the article (this involved getting rid of all but a paragraph), and according to overwhelmingly widespread precedent, high schools <i>are</i> inherently notable.

<dd>
<ol>
<li>While the number of college graduates is increasing, there are still a lot of people in the US whose highest level of education was their local high school. We have articles about colleges, so why not high schools too?</li>
<li>This is an expandable <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">stub</a> article. Sure, it doesn't present a lot of information right now, but sooner or later someone may expand it.</li>

<li>Notability for <i>this article</i>: <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisco%2C_Texas_9441.html" title="Frisco, Texas">Frisco, Texas</a> has experienced massive population growth in the last few years, this school was built because of that and is already over-capacity to the point where two more are being built. Not the strongest argument, but it's good enough for me.</li>
<li>I personally don't like requirements for notability such as "notable alumni", if for no other reason than it would confuse new editors who want to know why their school article is being deleted if those other ones can stay. Also, newer high schools like this one will obviously have troube meeting this sort of requirement.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, contrary to repeated erroneous claims, there are no precedents for automatic "Keep" votes/comments on schools. There have been arguments for and against (See <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28schools%29_Arguments_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (schools)/Arguments">Wikipedia:Notability (schools)/Arguments</a>... and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents</a>) and votes often end up with no consensus. Quite apart from that, in my view schools have no "inherent notability"... and this one has neither demonstrated notability, nor have I found any proof that it has any. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a>(<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 11:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Notability nuggets: The school was created to satisfy the increasing population in the area, and 2100 students spend their days there. That's more than <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryn_Mawr_College_8219.html" title="Bryn Mawr College">Bryn Mawr College</a>. Considering the number of High school in America, and the number of school-spirited kids makingn articles, it's pretty much a futile effort to fight back. Not that I'm defeatist or apathetic, but combined with the fact that the article is borderline notable, it results in a keep. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 12:01, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">User:Motor</a> is correct in pointing out that there is no "automatic keep" rule for schools (I'm still not sure why people invoke <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Schools</a> as constituting an "automatic keep" / "inherently notable" rule, but that's neither here nor there). Certainly, there are notable schools, which should (and do) have articles. However, this does not mean that every school should have an article ... only the notable ones. After all, there are notable -authors- who should (and do) have articles, but we delete the nonnotable ones all the time, etc. etc. Anyway, the only suggestion of notability that occurs in this article is in reference to the school's size (student population of ~2,100). OK, my local McDonalds gets more than 2,100 customers a day -- does that mean it should have a page, too? Of course not. Anyway, if this school actually becomes notable (and the article makes the case for it), I'll be the first to change my vote.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I was hoping you might make an argument why *this* particular school is notable. Has it done something to make it stand out from the thousands of others. Arguments about "inherent notability" as well as citing non-existent precendents are just, well, hand-waving. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 21:15, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
