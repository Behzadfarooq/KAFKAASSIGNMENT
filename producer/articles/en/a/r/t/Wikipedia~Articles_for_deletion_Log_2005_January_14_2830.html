<p>The VfD notice for this was added to this orphaned article by an anonymous user back in December, but it never got posted. I agree with the assessment; it's not notable, and probably a joke. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdc_936f.html" title="User:Cdc">Cdc</a> 00:14, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was actually going to vote to keep it - I do NOT agree with RickK's point of view. However then I noticed the use of first person in the article, which gives the impression that it's a self-promotion piece. If any newsworthiness can be found for the organization, 300 members or two, then I'd be willing to change my voice to keep with a cleanup/make NPOV provisio. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:58, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as likely promo, advert as well as non-notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a notable concept/term and deserves to have an article. But until someone writes something appropriate, this should be made a redirect to "<a href="../../../g/i/f/Gift_economy.html" title="Gift economy">Gift economy</a>". <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 03:44, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not convinced of the correctness of the redirect. <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gift_economy.html" title="Gift economy">Gift economy</a> describes a type of economy, and various real-world examples of it. In contrast, Gifting way is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> that propounds a "<i>natural law of economics</i>" (If <i>I</i> were to suppose a "<i>natural law of economics that has run the affairs of this world since its creation</i>", I'd suggest that it was <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermodynamics.html" title="Thermodynamics">the first law of thermodynamics</a> and point to the great big <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_fusion.html" title="Nuclear fusion">nuclear fusion</a> reactor up there in the sky continuously pumping energy into the system.) and attempts to piggyback off a mainstream idea. There's no supporting evidence given for this "natural law", or even for a widespread agreement that this is what the phrase "gifting way" means in the first place; and the article reads more like a New Age manifesto than an encylopaedia entry. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:47, 2005 Jan 14 (UTC)

<li>Yes the article as written makes little sense, but the term is, I think, a real and notable one.

<li>The term is real, but people don't agree on what it actually means.

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is an Old Way, Native, Aboriginal, concept that is not quite the same as gift economy.

<li>I find it quite interesting that if something does not exist on Google, then it does not exist. I would find that rather limiting of my worldview. For example you will not find the word "uuchunn" on Google. Does that mean it does not exist or is a neologism? For that matter isn't "wikipedia" a neologism? As for something being a point of view, what isn't? You are only the sum of your experiences, thoughts, and feelings, which are all unique to you. Any viewpoint you share with others is your point of view for that is all any of us have. I had wanted to "gift" some of my wisdom and knowledge back to the wikipedia community. At this point it is taking more energy than I am willing to put into it. I tried to explain this concept in terms that I thought you might understand. Apparently this has made it worse in your view? I had thought of wikipedia as a depository for concepts of a diverse cultural background and yet it seems that a concept much older than most of the concepts in this database is being labeled and censored by those unable to see outside of their own cultural box. As a user of wikipedia I find this dissapointing but enlightening as to the article process here. I am unsure if the viewpoints expressed here represent a consensus of the wikipedia community, I suppose time will tell. I wish you well on your project. Ted 17:54, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are lots of adherents to "New Age" spiritual philosophies, lots of people interested in native or aboriginal cultural values, and they are just as likely to create webpages as anyone else. It is clear that approximately none of those people use the term "gifting way". If something does not exist on Google, then it may exist... but it doesn't matter (ie, it is not encyclopedic). Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, and while there is a place for opinionated essays or original research or advocacy, that place is not Wikipedia. Such types of material are excluded regardless of how well written they may be or the personal qualities of their author.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The article describing the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brobdingnag.html" title="Brobdingnag">Brobdingnag</a> is the second book of <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gullivers_Travels_2666.html" title="Gullivers Travels">Gullivers Travels</a> which is a highly notable book and studied in schools throughout the world. It is analogous to deleting <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Two_Towers_%28book%29_7a3a.html" title="The Two Towers (book)">The Two Towers (book)</a> and redirecting it to the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>. The whole point of having wikilinks is to be able to look at connected facts at seperate articles allowing readers to look at articles containing more information. The Brobdingnag is an important part of Gullivers Travels which warrants further discussion in its own article. Brobdingnag. I have discovered that this article has been redirected to Gullivers Travels before the expiration of the vote. I am <b>absolutely appalled</b> that this unilateral decision was taken one day into the vfd process. What is the point of having a process where everybody votes over the worthiness of articles if people decide to unilaterally redirect one day into the process? Is there are process to appeal the redirection of this article?<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 08:46, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Swift's aim in "Gulliver" was to write political satire, not to create a fictional universe; that is why the argument that there are <i>n</i> articles dedicated to other fictional places doesn't pull. There is nothing here that wouldn't fit into <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulliver%27s_travels.html" title="Gulliver's travels">Gulliver's travels</a> (if it isn't already there), and no potential for expansion here. - <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 10:13, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The nature of Swift's motivation as a writer is irrelevant. Any person seeking data on the subject of fictitious lands in literature should reasonably expect to find Brobdingnag, Lilliput and Utopia listed alongside Mordor, Narnia and the Looking Glass world.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:07, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The motivation gives an idea about the intended scale of the fictional universe. <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narnia.html" title="Narnia">Narnia</a> <i>is</i> the fictional place in which the seven novels of the Narnia-cycle are set, and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordor.html" title="Mordor">Mordor</a> does not reduplicate what is said in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-Earth_4e64.html" title="Middle-Earth">Middle-Earth</a> article. It might be incorporated after an extensive re-write, though, and we could get rid of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angband.html" title="Angband">Angband</a>, too. I can't see how the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brobdingnag.html" title="Brobdingnag">Brobdingnag</a> entry could ever grow beyond what it is now. - <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 09:12, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're missing the point. It is necessary to retain separate articles for all <i>important</i> fictional countries in order that the fictional countries category is appropriately comprehensive a cross-reference source. As culturally and historically significant examples it is imperative that Swift's inventions be included therein. Their lack would represent a significant and misleasing oversight. The length of the article itself, Swift's motivations as a writer and the number of stories he set in invented country X or Y are not relevant at all.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 11:54, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am just less concerned about the "List of fictional places" than I am about duplicated entries. In case of duplicated entries one (the better) tends to grow and the other tends remain stagnant and of poorer quality. Until the underlying issue with the Wikimedia software (that redirects can't appear in categories) is resolved, maybe we should exercise some restraint and redirect manually. - <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 15:42, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Regardless of Pilatus's assertions, this article certainly could grow well beyond what it is now. With entire articles written on minor characters and places from all sorts of sci-fi and the like there is no reason why there should not be an article on Brobdingnag, particluarly as it's much more significant and well-known than something like <a href="../../../e/r/e/Eregion.html" title="Eregion">Eregion</a>.

<p>It's not vanity. Look into Mobile Suit Gundam. A continuouing series from Japan, that much resembles that of Star Wars in North America. After Era was a web-based role playing game derived from that series. The guy is a legend around the Gundam role-playing community. And no, he didn't write it. Someone else from After Era did. Who am I? Well, just some knowledgeable bystander.</p>

<p>Actually the dangers of corsets, or the corset, or a corset. It starts: "Many books write about the damages from corset. But if it all was correct, the European was extinct." By my standards, that's patent nonsense, partly because there's no reason to think that even dangerous corsets would kill a very large percentage of their wearers before childbearing age, or render them unable to bear children (even our silly foremothers would have cottoned on), but mostly because what I regard as everyday knowledge tells me that a great number didn't wear corsets: rugged, sturdy peasant stock would have made up for the febrile city dwellers. Still, somebody might point out that there's a germ of truth in the description of the fears and some merit in the counterargument, and that the article could be rewritten for accuracy. But then it could all be in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corset.html" title="Corset">Corset</a>. Meanwhile, it's unlikely that anybody would look up "The dangers of (a/the) corset(s)", so a redirect seems superfluous.

Moreover, regardless of Byron Crawford's personal opinions, this entry, while certainly discussing Mr. Crawford, the Mindset Army, and his other pertinent dealings, does not necessarily espouse them. This entry merely calls attention to the fact that Mr. Crawford is a prominent member of the African American community. -- Johnny Whitewater

<dd>The band has charted on several occasions and is gaining publicity in the local and regional music and regular press. The band has already had an article and two reviews in the NME (New Musical Express) as well as local papers such as the Journal, Shields Gazette etc.</dd>
<dd>Also, we can all do without sarcastic, facetious comments such as 'come back when you're famous'.
<dl>
<dd>My comment was not meant in any kind of facetious way. My point was a totally serious one - the band are not yet famous (if you can prove me wrong with some references, feel free), and are thus not yet worthy of a Wikipedia article. I have no problem with <i>famous</i> or <i>noteworthy</i> bands receiving pages, but this page (which I think reads like a vanity) is about a band that is (all but unknown.

<li>Comment: It turns out that there's a singer/songwriter named Joe Byrne <a href="http://www.joebyrne.com/bio.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.joebyrne.com/bio.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> who has been playing gigs for many years, and has released 2 cassette albums and 1 CD album. He's obscure to me, but based on the article as it is, he is more notable than this new British band.</li>

<p>I <i>way</i> want to keep this one, but <i>where are the citations</i>?? <b>Delete</b> unless some evidence of those charted recordings and national press articles shows up. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:38, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The singer-songwriter looks notable enough to me, and googling indicates some policeman involved with the Kelly Gang (whatever that is) who gets a lot of hits and may be notable. I agree with Wyss that a band supposedly covered in NME, with charting recordings, should get a number of google hits... I don't know how many, but let's start with one. To be frank, at this point, I don't believe this band exists. Feel free to prove me wrong. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 23:45, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Just noticed my comment could be construed as putting words in Wyss' mouth, as he didn't say all that I said I agreed with him on.

<li>Delete, there is no record of this group charting anywhere on the Top 40 charts database which is fairly reliable. The fact that they are yet to play their first concert where people pay to see them also makes me believe that they are notable. Tuf-kat referred to Joe Byrne in relation to the Kelly Gang. Joe Byrne was known as the lieutenant of the Kelly gang the most famous of the Australian bushranging gangs. He drafted the Jerilderie Letter which Peter Carey based his book <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i> which won the 2001 Booker Prize. Orlando Bloom played him in a 2003 film <i>Ned Kelly</i>. I have created a page for <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Byrne_%28bushranger%29_785e.html" title="Joe Byrne (bushranger)">Joe Byrne (bushranger)</a>. If we decide to delete this page, I would like to move <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Byrne_%28bushranger%29_785e.html" title="Joe Byrne (bushranger)">Joe Byrne (bushranger)</a> to Joe Byrne.

<li>Agree with the move, as this Joe Byrne sounds definitely notable. The singer-songwriter seems ok for an article, but the bushranger sounds much more important and thus a disambig block would be fine (i.e. not a disambig page at <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Byrne_8979.html" title="Joe Byrne">Joe Byrne</a>). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 08:42, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>a 7-year-old org'n promoting the concept of the venerable practice of board games and pencil recreations as "sports", which is evidence less of acceptance than of some among us "mental athletes" being jealous of the public's attention to more visible forms of excellence; the split among the organizers and the allegations against 1/3 of those found worthy of mention suggest the likelihood of a state of disarray.</li>
<li>some vague "recognition" of <a href="../../../f/%C3%A9/d/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_des_%C3%89checs_85f5.html" title="Fédération Internationale des Échecs">FIDE</a> by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Olympic_Committee_e5dd.html" title="International Olympic Committee">IOC</a> -- perhaps recognition that cooperation with FIDE might somehow be a way for IOC members to turn a few more corrupt bucks from their status, for all i know.</li>
