<dd>Well, the Wikipedia definition of notability and the common definition are not that same as I know you realize. Here it is a "term of art".

<dd><b>Keep or Merge</b> with <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a>. Although convinced that this subject was notable (Google, large number of newsgroup/message board postings) my delete vote stemmed from concerns about this article not meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

In particular <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Self-published sources in articles about themselves</a> seems to qualify. Alternatively, I would also support a merge into <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a> as the present article has no mention of serial numbers lists like the subject of this article. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 15:07, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Dont Delete</b> Even though it doesn't have many sources this article provides useful information. Because it's about a grey-market product there's not much publicly available info about it to cite and Wikipedia is probably the #1 public source of info on it on the web. This is definitely not spam for the product as the product is free and contains no spyware etc. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.14.158.147_6fe8.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.14.158.147">204.14.158.147</a> (talk) 20:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Dont Delete</b> It satisfies policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and guideline <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> because there is a primary source (The software is freely downloadable, from www.serialz.to). It may not satisfy guideline <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> (I haven't actually checked each of the over 60,000 google results), but as the guideline "is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense" I think the fact that there are so many mentions of it mean that it should be treated as notable. If it is not regarded as satisfying <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> then it should be merged with the wikipedia warez page as per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> .

<dd>No, all the website proves is that it exists. So does the tic-tac-toe program I wrote, but that doesn't make either one notable. The reliable sources have to address the issue of notability.

<dd>Yes, that's what I said. The article satisfies policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> because there is a reliable source as specified in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</dd>
<dd>Notability is a separate issue, and furthermore is a guideline not a policy, allowing for exceptions guided by common sense. Please refer to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Also, according to <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> "Software that can be proved to have a consistent number of users (beside the creator(s) and their friends) but do not meet the above criteria may be merged into the article describing their main functionality" . Hence my proposal to merge with the main wikipedia warez article if the serialbox article does not meet the notability guidelines.

<li><b>Comment</b> It might be worth pointing out that the edit war might have avoided if the users who believed the link to serialz.to was not valid had discussed it on the serialbox talk page. MrDarcy above actually suppresed the discussion by advising <a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOri_Redler_3c58.html" title="User:Ori Redler">Ori Redler</a> to stop discussing the dispute. [Ori Redlers talk page:<a href="../../../o/r/i/User_talk%7EOri_Redler_0d07.html" title="User talk:Ori Redler">User talk:Ori Redler</a>]. A side point anyway since I believe that there are better ways to deal with an edit war than by deleting the article. Mark M 22.1.07</li>

<dd>I know that MrDarcy has recently been promoted to an admin. It makes the apparent breach of guidelines all the more surprising. Please see <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>. "The first resort in resolving almost any conflict is to discuss the issue on a talk page." Mr Darcy suppressed the discussion. That is also why I asked him to explain his actions, but he chose not to do that. In any case, this is irrelevant to whether the article should be deleted, I mentioned it only as a comment since you referred to the edit war in your case for deletion. Mark M 22.01.07
<dl>
<dd>The question of whether the link was allowed or not had been discussed and settled with a clear consensus earlier on the page. No established user has come along to disagree with the consensus to allow the images but not the link (which seems to violate one policy and at least one guideline, as well as posing <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a> problems). This anonymous user, however, refuses to accept the consensus, so he's making baseless claims against me instead. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 15:59, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't believe there was a consensus. There seemed to be almost equal number of views to keep versus not to keep the link. I didn't refuse to accept the consensus even if there was one, I was merely discussing the merits of the case, not engaging in the edit war. And I have provided evidence that you suppressed the discussion, <a href="../../../o/r/i/User_talk%7EOri_Redler_0d07.html" title="User talk:Ori Redler">User talk:Ori Redler</a> so my claim is not baseless at all. If you wish to discuss this further can we do so on the serialbox talk page rather than cluttering up this deletion discussion. Thanks, Mark M 22.01.07

<dd>I'm not going to discuss the link here because the place for that discussion should have been on the article talk page. However, just for the record I have edited a few other unrelated pages so I should not be considered a singlepurpose account. Mark M 22.01.07

<li><b>Keep!</b> There's a sort of willful absurdity to the argument that Serial Box is not significant because it lacks a formal, well-publicized source/distributer. IT IS AN UNDERGROUND PRODUCT. It's authors/originators deliberately stay hidden, with the file in question being distributed through non-traditional channels. In spite of this, it has seen wider distribution and is much better known among the Mac using community than many 'real' commercial software products. Those calling for the deletion of this entry have profoundly misunderstood the nature of the subject at hand; underground publications, by definition, do not have formal, static, verifiable sources...but there is absolutely no doubt that the product is real and significant. --DeeMT 25 January 2007</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this is a useful source of information about it. It is worth having some objective information about the program, and perhaps something about its effects on the software industry, legal issues, etc. <a href="../../../y/a/h/User%7EYahoKa_fed0.html" title="User:YahoKa">YahoKa</a> 05:53, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
