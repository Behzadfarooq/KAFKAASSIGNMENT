<p>The article is full of lies. None of the albums in the discography exist and their names along with those of The Cortez Trio are complete nonsense. This article along with edits to others were created by <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> who is Justin Besant. He is a high school student nothing more. He has never toured through Canada and The Cortez Trio is him and two friends performing at Cafe Bleu which is a school music recital. There has been continued vandalism of other pages such as <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie_Besant_ef44.html" title="Annie Besant">Annie Besant</a> who Chinamanjoe claims that Justin Besant is the great-nephew of. However if this were true, Justin Besant would be well over 90 years old. Also, the only record of Justin Besant is on self-editable webpages such as this and <a href="http://www.last.fm" class="external free" title="http://www.last.fm" rel="nofollow">http://www.last.fm</a>. If one were to look at his last.fm page: <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Besant" class="external free" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Besant" rel="nofollow">http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Besant</a> they would discover that his albums seem rediculous and all there are are a few songs he made in his spare time on his keyboard in his room. The pictures on his albums are also clearly stolen and the entire thing is obviously fake. This page was also made by <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a>. Yofoxyman 00:57, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I don't really understand this hoax concept. Notability, I can understand, but hoax i cannot. Is every page I create going to be considered a hoax, just becuase some wacko highschool kid said so? Is the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Koven_24be.html" title="Steve Koven">Steve Koven</a> page a hoax? Is the The Maytones page a hoax? Is the Vernon Buckley page a hoax? How about all those other contriubtions I have made. Are those all hoaxes as well? I think you should reconsider everything Yofoxyman has said. Remember, he is the one that is currently banned. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> 16:23, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ok I did some research. All IPs from the University of Toronto Schools are <b>142.150.33.***</b>. In this case the following two votes are <b>not</b> from "the creator of the article from different school computers". They <b>are</b> from different computers around Toronto. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> 01:46, 25 April 2006 (UTC) the precedding two posts both made by the creator of the article from different school computers Yofoxyman 00:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC) Please provide a source for this statement. The preceeding two posts were made from different locations around Toronto. Not from University of Toronto Schools. Thank you.</p>

<dd>Regarding Yofoxyman's previous statement which I have removed because it was completely false and would just be misleading. -- No, they most certainly were not! I would know, since 1) I didn't vote for them (and I am the creator) and I don't know who did. 2) those IP addresses are clearly not from the same building. 3) If you are referring to the University of Toronto Schools, which I assume you think I am from, which I am not, but anyways, those are not even the correct IP addresses, so I would appreciate it if you retracted your statement since it is completely based on speculation not fact. Thank you. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> 00:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>it has already been proven that you are from the university of toronto schools, also, i believe that UTS's IP addresses are actually registered to UofT and not UTS. Also, why have they all been from similar IP addresses and not from actual users. I also hope you don't plan on creating new accounts just to post here. Yofoxyman 00:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Prove to me that those IP addresses are from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_Schools_533f.html" title="University of Toronto Schools">University of Toronto Schools</a> then! I think you might have some trouble, becuase as far as I am aware, I have only voted once. By similar IP addresses, I think you mean they are all addresses from the GTA (<a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>), which is where Justin Besant's fan base mainly resides. Maybe Justin Besant is more popular than you thought. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> 00:31, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>is it a coincidence that on all pages with mention to justin besant on wikipedia that <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> is the only one who speaks in his favour? it's not.<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> is justin besant, there's nothing more to the story, and hes behind everything. Yofoxyman 00:38, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I personally consider this to be a personal attack. I am certainly not Justin Besant! You have based that on absolutely nothing. Please take it back immediately. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> 00:44, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No chance, it has already been made pretty obvious that you are Justin Besant. This, last.fm, the fact that you saved the entire justin besant page on your user page so you would still have it to put up after it was deleted. Stop denying it, everyone here knows its true. You are your biggest and only fan. And I am not saying this as a personal attack, it is a clear fact. Yofoxyman 00:47, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Protecting the integrity of Wikipedia is a goal worth trying to accomplish. The complete lack of any evidence to support this article in places you'd expect to find it, plus the fact that only the creator of the page and a handful of people from apparently the same ISP seem to think that this is worth saving, are enough for me to think this needs to go. <a href="../../../j/c/o/User%7EJCO312_9c68.html" title="User:JCO312">JCO312</a> 21:54, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
