The article at the time had no reliable citations that I didn't mention, and he didn't say anything like "I disagree that a Glamour magazine thing alone doesn't make her notable" or anything, and so I wanted him to clarify. By the way, AfD is <i>not</i> a vote. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 07:05, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry for using the term "vote". I am experienced enough to know that AFD is not a vote. I know that opinions can be disregarded if discredited (and by using this word I am not accusing you of anything, I am simply using it as short hand for an attempt to make an opinion count for less in determining the final consensus when the time comes to decide whether to delete or not -- it is had to see how you are not doing this). That is exactly why I am attempting to counter your attempt to discredit "keeps" in an AFD discussion in which the keep opinions (is that a better word than "vote"?) clearly outnumber the "deletes", all keeps are from experienced users, and none of the keeps are suspect for other reasons (eg ballot stuffing) and thus the consensus forming seems to be in favor of keeping the article. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 12:16, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Asking someone why they voted the way they did is an " effort to discredit a vote by an experienced user"? On what planet? More to the point, you still haven't explained the magical power that allows an experienced user -- at a glance -- to immediately discern notability. Hey, I'm more "experienced": doesn't my "experience" automatically count for more? No?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable. Not just a student leader, as this organization seems to be extremely active across Boston. Also, the Glamour Magazine award (an award given by a high-profile national magazine; the magazine published an article about Hyde) establishes a more national notability.

<dd>Both national magazine articles are pretty weak - she is one of 10 people mentioned in the glamour magazine article (she gets a few paragraphs) and one of several mentioned in the article (again a few paragraphs). Personally I think this falls fowl of (WP:BIO):</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>i.e. the works in question are trivial, at just a few paragraphs in length. Additionally <i>17</i> is hardly a good source of information, likewise <i>Glamour</i> magazine. If it was Newsweek, Time, New York Times, Washington Post, etc, I might be less inclined to question it's value. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegapixie_ea09.html" title="User:Megapixie">Megapixie</a> 00:45, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This smacks of elitism. Glamour and Seventeen are both high-circulation magazines. They are magazines (seventeen in particular) that focus on the demographic that this orgainzation is relevant to. Even if there were 10 people selected, when we are talking about a national-circulation magazine that is particularly relevant to the demograhic in question, such a mention is quite indiciative of notability in the organization's context. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 01:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I was merely responding to your inane "smacks of elitism" comment. But to respond, being lumped in with a nine others pretty much defines "trivial mention", dunnit? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:44, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Okay but first address mine - the organization that she runs is not de-facto notable per <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> being only local in scope. The articles publicize her work with that organization. Are we saying either:</dd>
<dd>A) The organization is notable (despite being local) - the two publications back that up.</dd>
<dd>B) The organization is not notable (since it doesn't meet WP:ORG) - but she is since she has featured in two national publications.</dd>
<dd>If it's A - then that's entirely a different arguement, which you haven't addressed. If it's B then a couple of paragraphs in two articles spaced several years apart is hardly fame-worthy notability.</dd>
<dd>To address your point regarding elitism: absolutely right I consider Time, Newsweek, etc. better publications. As to demographics, I'm not clear what you are saying - that fact that she might be more or less notable to a twelve year old girl hardly seems relevent. Does a mention of a computer programmer in a national linux magazine, make him more notable, because the magazine is targeted at his demographic&#160;? Or does an absence of mentions in mainstream press make him less notable&#160;? <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegapixie_ea09.html" title="User:Megapixie">Megapixie</a> 12:49, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aside from my point about demographics, the fact remains that Glamour and Seventeen are among the top circulation magazines in the US and shouldn't be discounted simply because you happen to think they are low grade. Glamour is #27 in circulation with 2,371,986 average monthly circulation.<a href="http://www.magazine.org/circulation/circulation_trends_and_magazine_handbook/13222.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.magazine.org/circulation/circulation_trends_and_magazine_handbook/13222.cfm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Seventeen is #31 with 2,034,462. Both therefore exceed the average circulaiton of such well-known magazines as US News &amp; World Report, Entertainment Weekly and Money (to name a few notables). True Time is #16 and Newsweek is #16, but these rankings show Glamour and Seventeen are both in the league of the most widely circulated magazines. None of the Linux-type magazines (or similarly narrow-interest magazines) you mention as an anaology are even in the top 100, so the analogy is pretty useless. As for your "elitism", many (myself, an Economist reader, included) consider Time and Newsweek to be very low-brow and trashy (I wouldn't waste a minute on either, they read like they were written for idiots and just don't dig too deep), so I imagine your assertion that Time and Newsweek are so much "better" than Glamour and Seventeen truly is a matter of perspective. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 13:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So I take it that you assert <b>B</b> that she is notable purely because of the magazine mentions which are pretty weak to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. You also assert that the Economist &gt; Newsweek (I agree completely). I therefore embrace and extend Ecomomist &gt; Time =&gt; Newsweek &gt; Glamour &gt;= Seventeen. Which brings us back to Glamour and Seventeen not being very good sources of notability. And since they are her only claim to notability - it's therefore a pretty weak claim. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegapixie_ea09.html" title="User:Megapixie">Megapixie</a> 13:16, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, my underlyign point is that, if we want objective measures of notability based on magazine articles we should look at the circulation of the magazine being cited and not subjective conceptions of which magazine is "better".<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 15:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
