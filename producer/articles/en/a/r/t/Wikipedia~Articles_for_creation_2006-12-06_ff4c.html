<p>In 2004, Equality Knocks was launched with combined support from both Equality Texas (formerly the Lesbian and Gay Rights Lobby) and the Houston GLBT Political Caucus.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this organizating effort was voter identification and mobilization against Proposition 2. Proposition 2 was a proposed amendment to the Texas state constitution which bans the legal recognition of same-sex marriage ceremonies.</p>
<p>Proposition 2 passed, but the momentum for a permanent political organization remained.</p>
<p>In addition to voter identification activities, HERA founders believed their new organization needed to promote aliance building among all progressive causes throughout the Houston area and surronding communities.</p>

<p>Anarchism is Not Enough is a manifesto against systematic thinking, a difficult book by a famously difficult writer. For the scope of its critical imagination, it is the most radical work of Laura Riding's early period. This period extends from the end of 1925, when she left America for Europe and Robert Graves, to 1939, the year she returned to America, renounced any further writing of poetry, and soon after married Schuyler Jackson.</p>
<p>Published in 1928, when Riding was twenty-seven, Anarchism is a kind of early autobiographia literaria. Long out of print and now available for the first time in paperback, this is one of the most imaginative and daring works of literary theory ever written by a modernist figure. Lisa Samuels's edition sets the work in its historical context and elucidates its central intellectual difficulties. Her introduction and notes are a valuable aid to an understanding of Riding's work.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-06_ff4c.html" title="Edit section: Mean Streets: The RPG of Classic Film Noir">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mean Streets: The RPG of Classic Film Noir</span></h2>
<p><i>Mean Streets: The RPG of Classic Film Noir</i> is a pen-and-paper role-playing game developed by Mark Bruno and published by Deep7 in 2002. According to the publisher, <i>Mean Streets</i> takes the best (and bleakest) aspects of film noir, presenting them in a concept with which to role-play cynical private eyes, unscrupulous gangsters, and dangerous femme fatales as portrayed in film noir from the '40s and better part of the '50s.</p>
<p>The rules for <i>Mean Streets</i> were designed around Deep7's proprietary rules engine, titled XPG, of which its mechanics are unobtrusive and easy to learn, even for the novice player. It is the same rules system that is used in <i>Red Dwarf the Roleplaying Game</i>, <i>Bloode Island XPG</i> and other Deep7 products including the upcoming <i>Shriek XPG: The RPG of Teen Horror</i> and <i>RADZ</i>, a post-apocalyptic RPG. The XPG system was designed by Deep7 creative director Todd Downing. XPG is a stat+skill roll-under system using 2d6. The margin of the successful roll is the degree of the success. Boxcars (natural 12) is always a critical failure, resulting in some form of fumble. On snake-eyes (natural 2), the character has a critical success -- the player can make the roll a second time and, if successful, add the second roll's margin of success to the total.</p>
<p>Since release, Mean Streets has spawned a number of supplements, including:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <b>Vendetta</b>, a gangland resource<br />
‚Ä¢ <b>Usual Suspects</b>, an NPC resource<br />
‚Ä¢ <b>Concrete Jungle</b>, the New York City setting and sourcebook<br />
‚Ä¢ <b>Dark Companion</b>, a collection of new rules and updates<br />
‚Ä¢ <b>Modus Operandi</b>, a sourcebook on law enforcement and the courts<br />
‚Ä¢ <b>Casablanca</b>, an exotic city and setting sourcebook<br /></p>
<p>A free supplement also exists for the game, incorporating fantasy elements to the core game. Titled, <i>That Old Black Magic</i>, the supplement presents an alternate setting for the game, incorporating sorcery against the backdrop of 1940s Hollywood. It's a world where gangsters in expensive suits are master sorcerers, spirits get the third degree from cops, zombies come six to a crate just like bon-bons, and your landlady is a licensed witch, according to the official description on the game's support site, which is maintained by the game's developer Mark Bruno, independently of Deep7.</p>

<p>It takes just a note or two to hear that La Excelencia is different. A New York salsa band led by percussionist Jose Vazquez-Cofresi and Julian Silva. La Excelencia is made up of younger salsa musicians, it plays raw and hard, with none of the sweetening that gunk up pop salsa of today. This is unprettified salsa dura, with the percussion cranked, lots of breaks, the voices loud, almost distorted. It‚Äôs the sound of a tough working band, the sort that used to be everywhere in New York during the 1970's salsa era, and now are rare to find. It‚Äôs unapologetic, and unafraid of its tradition. The lyrics of La Excelencia give us a look into the modern day barrio, and speak of social issues found in our own lives. With the release of "Salsa con Conciencia", La Excelencia has received international and national recognition. The real deal doesn‚Äôt show up that often, and here it is. Celebrate it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-06_ff4c.html" title="Edit section: Ahl-i-Hadis Movement in Bengal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ahl-i-Hadis Movement in Bengal</span></h2>
<p>Origins of the Ahl-i-Hadis movement started in early 19th century and related to a movement initiated by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shah_Waliullah_d004.html" title="Shah Waliullah">Shah Waliullah</a> (1703-1762) of Delhi. The Ahl-i-Hadits came under severe criticism for not acknowledging the existence of the sunni schools and came to be known as ghair mukallid or non-conformists. They believed that every Muslim of sufficient learning can draw his own conclusions from the Quran and Hadith and not rely on opinions and decisions of the classical jurists. Waliullah‚Äôs works were carried on by a number of his disciples such as Shah Sayyid Ahmed (1786-1850) of Rae Bareili. The movement‚Äôs central message was the purification of faith which had been infiltrated by the Hindu culture.</p>
<p>The movement developed in Bengal under the leadership of Mualana Abu Abdullah Mansur Rahman Ansari, who came to Dhaka in the 1860s. Ansari was appointed Imam of the Ahl-i-Hadis Jam-i-Masjid and head teacher of the madrassa attached to the mosque. Ansari‚Äôs preaching was largely done in the Dhaka and Mymmensingh region where he managed to influence a large number of people including Haji Badruddin (1800-1875) a wealthy merchant from Dhaka, Maulana Ibrahim of Mymmensingh and Aminuddin of Bakerganj, who later became leading Ahl-i-Hadis members in Bengal.</p>
<p>Ansari‚Äôs sons, Maulana Abdul Jabbar Ansari and Abdul Hakim Ansari took up the cause of their father and helped spread the Ahl-i-Hadis cause in the rural areas of Mymmensingh. Haji Badruddin helped the movement financially, sending out different preachers to different areas of Bengal and Bihar. In the same period Mualanas Wilayat Ali and Inayat Ali emerged as the leading personalities of the movement takings it message to the far corners of Bengal and attracting large number of followers.</p>
<p>To consolidate their efforts the movement was turned into an organisation under the heading the All-India Ahl-i-Hadis Coneference in 1906 at Lucknow, India. Later in 1914, the Anjuman-i-Ahl-i-Hadis of Bengal and Assam was created. The reason behind forming a committee is as follows:</p>
<p>(i) to answer questions relating to its doctrines</p>
<p>(ii) preach it in different areas of the country; and</p>
<p>(iii) unite the members of the movement under a banner The Anjuman translated the Quran into Bengali, participated in open debates and discussions in propagating the movement.</p>
<p>The Wahhabi Trials (1868-71) led by the British Government meant that any ‚Äòrevivalist‚Äô religious activities were suppressed. Many of the Ahl-i-Hadis men were arrested which led to the disintegration of the Anjuman leading into the 20th century. During this period Maulana Abdullahil Kafee al-Quraishi came forward to uphold it‚Äôs caused and founded the Bogra Ahl-i-Hadis Samiti in 1920 giving the movement a new direction. Under Quraishi‚Äôs leadership many centres were opened for propagation. The movement continued and in 1946 the All Bengal and Assam Jamat-i-Ahl-i-Haids was created at the Rangpur Conference with its headquarters at Calcutta. The offices later shifted to Pabna after partition in March 1948. Steps were also taken to form district and local jamats (organisations).</p>
<p>May 1949, Maulana Abdullahahil Baqi established the Ahl-i-Hadis Printing and Publishing House at Pabna and later that year published the first issue of the monthly Tarjumanum Hadis under the editorship of its president, Al-Kafee al-Quraishi. The organisation's name changed to <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Pakistan_505e.html" title="East Pakistan">East Pakistan</a> Jamat-i-Ahl-i-Hadis after partition (1947).</p>

His acts of charity go highly regerded, for Children in Need he shaved his hair in the classroom of one "Mr. Torney" and a piece of this hair has been preserved in a coffie jar for pupils to remember this legendary event. One of his more interesting attributes is his ability to eat far more than the average human body could digest, most of this being <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haribo.html" title="Haribo">Haribo</a> sweets.
