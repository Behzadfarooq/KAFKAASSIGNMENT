<li>[Added by Data] User nominating this page for deletion is acting solely on a personal vendetta. The TribalWar community is 15,786 members and 7,248,464 forum posts of Internet history. It is the sole remaining community web site for the Earthsiege/Starsiege/Tribes universe, and has been THE source for Tribes news and resources since 1999.

<li><b>Keep.</b> [Added by old_skul] This AFD is a personal vendetta against the site and should be summarily discounted. Although the article could use some cleanup, it's clearly a page in history for many people and serves as a historical record of many of the social interactions that make internet forums generally interesting from a social standpoint. It would be detrimental to Wikipedia to remove this article. Old skul 15:02, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> [Added by DwarfVader] As the page describes Tribalwar has been a part of internet history, much in the same way that Something Awful, and the person named Maddox. Both have articles writing on Wiki, just as Tribalwar does. If Tribalwar were to be deleted for the reasons stated above those entries would have to be removed as well as they fall EXACTLY under the same qualifications that Tribalwar does. Bugs or Shane recently created his own unfourtunate drama over at Tribalwar, that resulted in him making an ass out of himself. He blames Tribalwar for this very incident and thus has choosen to attempt to have this article deleted in an effort to "get back at Tribalwar."---DwarfVader 04:41, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> TribalWar is a relevant staple of the internet and gaming community. It has referential ties to other similar websites such as Something Awful and 4Chan, and has several notable "claims to fame" such as interaction with CNN and Tribes community-specific LAN events. TribalWar is the last resource for any Tribes/Starseige/Earthsiege content and continues to renew its content to compete with modern gaming resources. This proposed deletion is a purely personal and spiteful event due to TribalWar forum mockery/embarrasment of Shane "Bugs5382" Froebel, and further discussion is a waste of Wikipedia resources. As noted by TribalWar Site Administrator Anthony "Rayn" Maio, Shane Froebel was a TribalWar staff member who was fired from the site several years ago, and this proposed deletion is only part of his ongoing vendetta against the community. --Fboftwfame 04:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

This delete nomination is a mean spirited counter-attack by Shane on an organization he has a well-know vandetta against. Shane, if you wish to become a Wiki moderator as your personal page suggests, you might not want to engage in this blantent sort of childish behavior in the future.

<li><b>Keep</b> By <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines, a website is fit for an article if it has appeared in a major outside source. Various outside sources have mentioned www.tribalwar.com due to the internet meme All Your Base. Also by the same, <a href="http://pc.gamezone.com" class="external free" title="http://pc.gamezone.com" rel="nofollow">http://pc.gamezone.com</a>, as well as a multitude of other gaming-related newssites have mentioned Tribalwar in relation to the Tribes franchise. These qualify it under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> only comes into play when there is a debate over any information given in the article. This is easily remidied by editing, not deletion. Xpdnc 05:56, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Tribalwar is a great forum and has a lot of users. It deserves a wiki. Shane's personal problems with the site triggered this and that is not fair to Tribalwar. This AFD request is an abuse of Wikipedia 67.80.77.53 06:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Unseemly personal issues aside, www.tribalwar.com is deserving of a wikipedia article for several reasons. Firstly, due to the fact that it is directly linked to the popularization of the All Your Base phenomenon. The AYB movie that was cited in Newsweek as being one of the first incidences of homespun viral media was developed from original tribalwar forum content, and was posted there for the first time. The site and its content are therefore a legitimate part of history from an internet content perspective, and may serve as a reference for viral content history and research. Secondly, the CNN hotlinking episode, although minor, is a footnote that serves as a useful cautionary tale for internet content providers with respect to the practice of hotlinking. The many thousand people who were subject to the incident may or may not be aware of its background, and considering the sizable population of those affected, it is entirely justifiable to think that they may want a record of what really happened at that time. As such, the site is notable. However, it still admittedly requires some editing and provision of direct sources. LogRoller 06:28, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>New users please note:</b> Arguments about vendettas, or about <i>other</i> subjects having Wikipedia articles, are irrelevant.

Cite magazine feature articles, books, papers in journals, documentaries, and so forth that are about this web site, and that are from sources independent of the web site.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The major complaints with this page seem to involve content that shouldn't be mentioned on Wikipedia.

Also, note that there does seem to be an effort in the discussion page, including a temp page, attempting to clean the article, contrary to GassyGuy's claim above.

I don't see how this article meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which, by the way, is only a guideline, not "policy". The sole rationale provided for why this article meets WP:WEB above—that it has been covered by the press—is not sufficient, in my opinion. Note also that the presence of other articles on non-notable stuff on Wikipedia does not excuse or justify the presence of this article on a non-notable stuff. As regards sock puppets, you might have a technically valid point that these voters are not sockpuppets but meatpuppets.

<li>I agree that personal attacks on Shane should be kept out of this DISCUSSION (for the second time, this isn't a black and white VOTE sir). However, may supporters of the Tribalwar wikipedia article reacted in this manner because Shane's nomination to delete their article is based entirely on recent events on Tribalwar pertaining to images of his sister. Shane has even gone so far to try and negotiate with Tribalwar, reportedly stating "I will withdraw the Afd, if you can convince everyone, and I mean everyone on TW to post zero information on me and my family members ever again. That included everything: pictures, transcripts, images, and etc. everything. And that is the only compromise that I will give. One thing is broken, I will re-add it to AFD." I agree the Tribalwar wiki article might need some work to get it up to standards, but this is a gross misuse of Wikipedia administration tools by Shane. -Bonafide 67.174.18.197 14:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Whether the article should be kept or deleted is based on the merits of AfD nomination and the subsequent comments of other wikieditors. If the article has enough merit for inclusion in Wikipedia, then it will often survive the AfD process regardless of the nominator's motivations. With that said, most of the keep votes have either engaged in a personal attack against the nominator, outright declared this as a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a> nomination, or both. None of these provide enough merit to keep the article by themselves. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 14:28, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's kind of an elitist attitude. Yes, I recently registered my account. That does not mean that I have not been using wikipedia as a source of information for a number of years now.

I find this type of accusation insulting. the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribalwar.html" title="Tribalwar">tribalwar</a> wiki entry has existed since March of 2005, (possibly earlier than that, but the edits only show the last 500).

<li>Yes you are correct, being wholly unverifiable is a reason for deletion. My argument is that TW is indeed verifiable and does have citable sources.

Note that other fansites in such positions, such as BZPower have passed their AfDs due to the same reasoning. Of course, it's hard to call this purely a Tribes fansite any longer, but it still has standing in the community and is linked to from outside for purely that reason.

<li>Personal attacks are never rightfully aimed at anyone on Wikipedia (<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>). Calling users meatpuppets is certainly uncivil (also a violation of policy: <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>) and possibly also a personal attack. Your criticism here is valid, and I at least will openly admit to not considering WP:CIVIL inviolable and knowingly making (possible) personal attacks. But this accusation is not random or unjustified. In my opinion, meatpuppettry is an apt and evocative description of externally influenced collusion (I have provided the evidence earlier) to sway consensus on Wikipedia, which makes one of the most fundamental and inviolable policies—indeed the backbone—of Wikipedia, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>, impossible. You certainly have as much (not more!) right as anyone to contribute to Wikipedia, but note that anything you contribute will be mercilessly edited by other editors. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 21:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Although it is perhaps a notable message board, I'm not sure if wikipedia is the place for such an article.

<li>Alexa is misleading for this type of site since Alexa basically measures page views, and sites like this get tons of reloads from their users. 80th on big-boards is pretty feeble IMO. Take a look at the higher-ranked ones (70-80, say): <a href="http://rankings.big-boards.com/?p=4" class="external free" title="http://rankings.big-boards.com/?p=4" rel="nofollow">http://rankings.big-boards.com/?p=4</a> -- 79th is "Howard forums" mobile phone discussion board, 78th is "S2KI Honda S2000 owners' community", etc.; I can't see those as encyclopedic. Big-boards itself is pretty specialized, so 80th place is really no big deal. It might be evidence (not conclusive) of notibility if a site is in Big-boards top 10, but certainly not 80th. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 22:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
