<dd>Irishguy, the poster asking for deletion, references on the linked source of the alleged "copyright" source the following....Fleshlight History - Interview from S.E.X. zine; "This little article I saved should help you" (current website text image here: <a href="http://www.hidebehind.com/B5380D00" class="external free" title="http://www.hidebehind.com/B5380D00" rel="nofollow">http://www.hidebehind.com/B5380D00</a>, and to prevent the obvious legal threats which I'm sure will ensue, such use of this image is covered under the Fair Use ruling as I'm using it to make a point in this editorial comment. The actual website image is owned by the domain registrant for www.fleshlightvideo.net, although I question said registrants copyright ownership of all materials contained therein). The article is bordered by no less than 5 referral ads to the Fleshlight products. You are using the original article for commercial purposes. You are a shill. There is no use of the article here for commercial purposes, it is for informational purposes only. You obviously do not own the copyright of the source material, merely saving it from another now defunct source does not make you the owner of the material. Again, either produce evidence that it is copyrighted material or shut up. (LubeNLuv 22:35, 24 May 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>OK. First off, I didn't put up the copyright violation notice. I put up the AfD tag, so you are barking up the wrong tree. Second, in what world would I be using <i>the original article for commercial purposes</i>? I am making no money here, and that is the very definition of using something for commercial purposes. Third, enough with the rudeness and the personal attacks. It isn't your place to tell people to <i>shut up</i>. The AfD will continue and people whom you disagree with don't have to <i>shut up</i>. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 23:03, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you placed the AfD tag onto this article and referenced the source, then you clearly didn't note the source did NOT claim to be the copyright holder. It claims just the opposite. So your claims are baseless and your placement of the AfD tag is what is in question. Your continued commentary about which users opinions should be considered "questionabile" simply due to their lack of historical posting are supercilious and put your motives into question. The AfD must either provide evidence that the text is copyrighted or the tag is without merit. (LubeNLuv 23:12, 24 May 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>I followed standard procedure. This article has been prodded twice and removed twice by an IP without comment. It ALWAYS goes to AfD when a prod is removed without comment. I noted that this article is unimportant and the subject already has its own article and that it is nothing more than an interview which is not what Wikipedia does. I remarked that it may very well be a copyright violation and it probably is. But frankly, the article should be deleted regardless because it isn't encyclopedic. Also, it is standard procedure to note when a brand new user makes a comment on an AfD page. It is usually a sign of sockpuppetry. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 23:31, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please point me to the standard procedure FAQ for Wikipedia that encourages labelling first-time posters as "sockpuppets." Just like your claims of copyright violation, I believe that statement is entirely a fabrication of your own making. I can point you to the guidelines, I assure you it does not mention labelling first time posters as "sockpuppets" or even noting that they ARE first-time posters.

<dd>First off, those are talk page guidelines. This isn't an article talk page, it is an AfD page. Second, you yourself should have read that page before attempting to throw it at me. Note the rules on <i>No personal attacks</i> and <i>Assume good faith</i>, both of which you have broken it almost every one of your posts. If you have looked through any other AfD, you will note that first time editors are pointed out because they could be sockpuppets, they could be random people sent here to fill AfDs with <i>don't delete</i> votes, etc. Third, you really should stop going on about me claiming copyright violations as I have refuted this in pretty much every post above. No matter how loudly you say it, it won't make it come true. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 01:07, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b> I am the original subject of the interview listed both here on WikiPedia and on the Fleshlightvideo website. This is not a copyrighted work and if it was, I'd share the copyright with the authors. It's also not an entirely accurate representation of the history of ILF, the makers of the Fleshlight. However, the individual who claims to "hold" the copyright to this work is dead wrong for claiming so and is well known to also claim "ownership" of other peoples videos and public-domain materials as their own for the sole purposes of driving personal click revenues via their website. I believe Wikipedia is a proper repository for this material and would like to see it remain here uncontested. SSHUBIN 20:46, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please explain to me the definition of the "<b>EDIT</b> this page" function if not to make edits? Or perhaps your screen shows a differently worded command? Also, thank you for calling out the earlier "edits," but you still fail to address that the current discussion pertains to the "POSSIBLE COPYRIGHT VIOLATION" notice all users are greeted with upon attempting to read the "Fleshlight History" entry, where the cited reference for said "POSSIBLE COPYRIGHT VIOLATION" points to a non-copyrighted work. I repeat my claims because they continue to go unanswered. Why is this entry flagged as possibly violating copyright laws when the cited evidence does not claim copyright and, in fact, claims to be derived from other sources?

<dd>First, it is only <i>Fleshlight History</i> because it has been renamed twice since the AfD tag went up. Second, I didn't tag it as a copyvio so stop claiming that I did. Third, all pages have the same basic templates, but discussions on AfDs don't count as <i>edits</i> in any sense of the term. Any more strawmen you would like to set up? Also, I note that you completely avoided the multiple prods and the fact that I didn't put up the copyvio prod that you insist on accusing me of doing. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 09:32, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Bolt_Head: Sex Zine conducted the interview - and several sites use the interview as content - I can only assume that it is free for public use. I can rewrite a whole new article but it would be easier to just leave the current one alone. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bolt head (<a href="../../../b/o/l/User_talk%7EBolt_head_15a4.html" title="User talk:Bolt head">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bolt_head_f1f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bolt head">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>"THIS INTERVIEW IS NOT COPYRIGHTED, PLEASE NOTE "The interview is from Xandria.com" AND IS FREE TO COPY AND USE. Again the interview IS NOT COPYRIGHTED, the source was XANDRIA.COM - the same source I used for the article - which originally was from "The S.E.X Zine" - you are VERY WRONG, Jamie." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bolt head (<a href="../../../b/o/l/User_talk%7EBolt_head_15a4.html" title="User talk:Bolt head">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bolt_head_f1f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bolt head">contribs</a>).</small></p>
