<li>I'm with DmitryKo here. Given they are the <i>same</i> ranks and branches of the <i>same</i> force, which appears not to be indispute, then differences in insignia can easily be dealt with in the main article. Otherwise there will be substantial duplication between the two, plus a tendency to mislead by implication. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:52, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll admit that my prose isn't fantastic (I'm an astronomy student, not a English major), but you should be looking at the topic, not the content of the article in deciding if it is worthy of an article on Wikipedia. The death penalty is a controversial issue in the United States, and every execution receives coverage in the national news media. I'd be interesting to know how we would decide who is "interesting" or not? Multiple murders? Rape involved?

<dd>What about this man's death, more then so many others, sheds light on the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> debate? You chose this man deliberately, yes? So I assume there is something special about him. Now maybe it's just that he is somehow special to you. If that's the case, you <i>should</i> be creating knowledge; put down your feelings and post that as a blog, or to your local paper, or to a relevant mailing list. If he is or should be special to us, then tell us why! Either way, write from the heart, not the head. We can fix your prose, but we can't inject spark if there's not life to begin with.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I personally don't see a reason to have biographies of random murderers who are sentenced to death, there are so many murderers and they don't seem special to me. However, a number of the murderers Evil Monkey lists above are no more noteworthy than Thacker, and it would be inconsistent to keep them and delete this one. I am not suggesting that we should keep an article that merits deletion just because other articles that might merit it didn't get nominated, just that the continued existence of so many articles on 'ordinary' murderers suggests a consensus consistent with keeping the Thacker article. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostGirl_ed70.html" title="User:GhostGirl">GhostGirl</a> 13:26, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The purpose of Wikipedia is "The Free Encyclopedia" and that means that certain topics are going to be able to be kept updated and included than in the "Encyclopedia Brittanica" or what not. Also, if the Thacker article is cleaned up, and more research done on the man, the crime, and whatnot, then it could be a valuble asset down the road. Further, I like to see biographies on such things, if for nothing else than to give an understanding as to why the individual was put to death, what the individual's last meal, and last words were. Remember, an insignificant peice of data to us, down the road could be vital in the understanding of the future.<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldan_2c27.html" title="User:Soldan">Soldan</a> 16:04, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Um Pat? Your article is a vanity article. It was written by you to promote your shop. That defines vanity. There is no notability here. You've built one bike and it's only a prototype. The spelling and grammar in your article is awful. This has nothing to do with an edit war. Besides, see those votes up there? Those are people who have nothing to do with the edit war and yet they believe that the article is non-notable and vanity. I'm not mad at you.

<li>Strongly agreed. No prior interest here either, but being in business 'more than 10 months' isn't a claim to fame. Noone is saying this venture isn't good, just that it's not had the impact required to merit inclusion in an encyclopedia. Previous edit wars are irrelevant, the article will stand or fall on its own merits according to published criteria. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostGirl_ed70.html" title="User:GhostGirl">GhostGirl</a> 18:29, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let me remind everyone that it is easily possible on wikipedia to make sock pupets to place a vote.

(not how long you've been in business) <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segway.html" title="Segway">Segway</a> is a pretty new (imerging) company .

Perhaps we might remove any bias information but deleting these articles seems hardly reasonable. The same for CyclePat. I believe that it is a manufacturing company that has much influence. (It's seems like woohookit has brought this subject on going from extreme measures (fast delete) to gradually less extreme (delete)) Perhaps this article only needs some discussion to clarify any miss-understandings? --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 20:39, 6 November 2005 (UTC) --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 21:01, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Greetings. Sources for Daniel Dancer are definitely lacking. I got my info from a Reader's Digest book "Facts &amp; Fallacies" (around 1988) but that does seem to be the only reference. In hindsight, I noticed that some of the articles in that book have at least dubious details, so I've begun to have second thoughts. If this one really remains the <i>only</i> reference, maybe this can be relegated to the category of "fallacies" (or "legends").

<p>I just stumbled across wikipedia, and was amazed at how badly it reflected the art-scene in Scotland. I have already spoken to a few other artists who are going to send me short biographies so that this can be put right. There really are not so many prizes for professional artists and this should not be the criteria for inclusion. Rather it should be based on activity and peer recognition. I know it is not so easy to find stuff on me on the net. It is a problem when you name is quite common. That is why I am also currently working on a website to regroup my work, which has been ongoing now for 15 years. If you want to check out my day job, here is where I teach:</p>

<li><b>DELETE</b> The FIRST sign that an article is VANITY is that it is an auto-biographical entry. If this person were so important, someone who doesn't know him personally would have written an article on him already. In his soapbox, David Michael Clarke appeals to nationalism and self-promotion. That it is "not so easy to find stuff on me on the net" is a good reason to suggest that David Michael Clarke is NOT NOTABLE.<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 01:20, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I have been advised that my name is been placed on your online encyclopedia as some sort of joke or prank. My name Derek Ivany is currently catergorized as an article for deletion. This affords the notion that I am somewhat uncredable or unworthy of acknowledgement. I am not sure what your organization is about or why my name is there. But I do not want to have my name or image defamed with some sort of online rhetoric. Please have my name removed from your website.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

It is essentially a sub-class of "motor assisted bicycle" and has had it's chance of being incorperated with that article, however... that article is purelly narrow minded propaganda for electric bicycles, hence it is my belief so we can lighten up the article on "<a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a>" that we resume the creation of electric bicycle --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 05:55, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think CyclePat has nominated this for deletion without really understanding how deletion policies work. cyclePat, this is for nominating an article to be deleted.

For anyone else -- CyclePat, a bicycle shop owner in Canada politically active enough to be involved in some petitions and court cases related to the issue, started working on an article on <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycle.html" title="Electric bicycle">electric bicycles</a>. I and several other editors began helping him. We decided that the article should be moved to <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">Motorized bicycle</a> so that it could incorporate text from several articles about bikes of this sort; they were fractured over <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycle.html" title="Electric bicycle">electric bicycle</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power-assisted_bicycle.html" title="Power-assisted bicycle">power-assisted bicycle</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power-assisted_cycle.html" title="Power-assisted cycle">power-assisted cycle</a>, etc. Not liking changes to the new <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a>, CyclePat has begun reverting the redirect on <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycle.html" title="Electric bicycle">electric bicycle</a> and re-creating his old article, which was mostly about Canadian jurisdictional laws and was rather POV in spots. <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycle.html" title="Electric bicycle">Electric bicycle</a> should <b>stay redirected</b> to <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a>. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 06:08, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>KEEP</b> Fred Negro is an Aussie legend, not only for his larrikin lyrics but for his sometimes disturbing, but always hilarious column in beat magazine. His own inimitable style is the embodiment of dirty StKilda pub rock in the 80’s and 90’s. Don’t drop Fred. CS</p>
<p>I could easily be wrong, this is one of those maybe, maybe not ones. I'd say not notable, but locals may have a better perspective.

<p>Let me make a few quick comments, and hopefully others will concur. As the page has only just gone up it should be given some time to grow before a call is made on the case for continuance. However, though the page stresses FN's 'local' profile in St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia, it should be understood that that Melbourne is arguable the centre of Australia's live music scene, and further that St Kilda is the pinnacle of the Melbourne scene. Significant in St Kilda means significant nationally. Further, his influence is not restricted to music, but extends to an influential comic strip. This is not a suburben muso. thanx (unsigned - comment from 08:19, 6 November 2005 Showard)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep!</b> I have lived in Melbourne, Australia for 17 months on and off over the last 3 years and spent quite a lot of time checking out the music scene in Melbourne. And YES, Fred Negro is a significant feature! A living legend in the Melbourne music scene - especially among those who still remembers the 80ties. Most facinating of all he still delivers an impressive live act. I was facinated by the first gig I saw (at the Espy, St. Kilda) and speechless after the second one (somewhere on Queen Street, CBD) - which featured a piece of Fred's famous stage act of performing naked (!) and banging his dick against the mic stand to the beat of the bass drumm (se photo below - its Fred on the right with the blue shirt).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - A WP entry would be valuable because Fred is one of those people whose work everyone (in Melbourne) has seen, but about whom most people know little. It would be good to see more biographical information in the entry; many Melbournians would be able to add some. The weekly "street press" magazines have a wide readership in Melbourne, and anyone who has read one in the last decade or more will have seen a comic or article by Fred. He has a distinctive style, very politically incorrect, impossible not to notice. The work is not to everyone's taste, but many would be curious about the author. David Nichols (who writes for Beat street press magazine amongst other things) said that when Beat polled their readers recently, they found that one of the main reasons people read the rival Inpress magazine was that Fred is in it. David thinks Fred was publishing underground comics as long ago as the 70s and appeared in a Penguin Down Underground book of comics around 1983. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregwadley_4f26.html" title="User:Gregwadley">Greg_Wadley</a> 22:01, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete without Prejudice</b> - The Griffith SLA is the Australian equivalent of the Harvard Law School student association, since Griffith has been rated as Australia's Leading Law School (source:Good Universities Guide 2005). As an alumni i am aware that this organisation may be noteworthy in its activities, however the article submitted to wiki is an attempt at vanity as it does not list the achievements of the association, and presents as nothing more than a group of students wanting attention (vanity). I say that this article should be deleted, and should the Student Law Association in the future manage to submit a more appropriate article to wiki demonstrating its noteworthiness, then that should must be allowed. - Does anyone on the SLA remember the Road to Nowhere?</li>

<li>Turning this into a disambiguation page would only be wortthwhile if others were also listed. As it stands the proposed article Innovation Club (Nan Hua Secondary) would fail the same test: it is not notable, and not easily verifiable either.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think it would be better to have information about individual series such as Tri-Nations, English/Great Britain tours and I would certainly vote to keep such information. It would be of interest to many people in the UK, Australia and New Zealand and would definitely be encylopedic. The problem with this article is that the information is not in context but I would vote <b>Keep</b> until such articles are developed. It would be great if interested editors started work on such a project. Just because an article is not of interest to you doesn't mean it doesn't have encyclopedic potential. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 23:06, 6 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If someone were to write an <i>encyclopedic overview</i> of those series, I would vote keep every single time. This, however, is not encyclopedic; it's a raw collection of data, almost entirely without context and presenting little value to the development of articles about those series. The problem isn't that this isn't interesting (nevermind that it is by its nature of interest only to those interested in both the English national rugby team and statistics), the problem is that this is unencyclopedic. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:14, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is the second part of an existing soundtrack of an existing DVD film with the same title.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Noted on the author's user page - his signature is "Lino", which coincides with the mention of "philospher Lino Missio", making this a vanity entry. A Google search reveals a few people (Kent, Kramer, Tan Man Ho) publishing as if this is an established field of study. In general concept, it seems that a number of legitimate academics in philosophy are also involved in psychology, marrying the two disciplies. However, this article doesn't convey that concept.

<li>Text such as "The thought randomly came to me while in Mrs. Hall's American History class." is comprehensible. The article is written in English, with reasonable spelling and punctuation, and has content that conveys meaning. There's a distinction between <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonsense" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:nonsense">nonsense</a>, in the sense of untruth or fabrication, and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a>.

<li>Your point is well-taken.

<li>I disagree&#160;:</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of german newspapers and magazine have talked about Speedminton and presented it as a new sport, not a mere commercial product. According to the german news agency Deutsche Welle&#160;: "Played until recently, [...] the game has now made its breakthrough as an official sport." "There are around 6,000 active Speedminton players in Germany." ( <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,951494,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,951494,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,951494,00.html</a>)</p>
<p>According to some sources, there would be 80 000 occasional players in germany. The equipment is similar to other sports equipment (rackets similar to squash rackets) and is sold in sport shops. Speedminton is played in Badminton Clubs. --145.226.1.30 14:17, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pro</b> deletion&#160;:<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt; Speedminton and Blackminton are commercial names.<br />
=&gt; As far as I know, Speedminton GmbH is the only company in the world which sells the Speedminton equipment.<br />
=&gt; You can't play Blackminton without buying special equipment from Speedminton GmbH.<br /></p>
<p><b>Cons</b>&#160;:<br />
=&gt; If you refer to articles in newspapers, rules, equipment, players (who are sportsmen), etc... it is a real sport.<br />
=&gt; There are other articles about unrecognized sports (for instance&#160;: <a href="../../../d/d/c/DDC_Frisbee_f94d.html" title="DDC Frisbee">DDC Frisbee</a>) or even commercial products (<a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubik%27s_Cube_6ec5.html" title="Rubik's Cube">Rubik's Cube</a>) in Wikipedia<br />
=&gt; You can play without buying the equipment from Speedminton GmbH&#160;: Speedminton can be played with squash rackets and a conventional shuttlecock.<br />
=&gt; Speedminton is a german sport. German wikipedians are certainly the best informed to know if an article about Speedminton is a commercial self-promotion or a serious article. And the german article about Speedminton in Wikipedia.de is online since 1 July 2004...<br /></p>
<p><b>I propose to</b> remove any reference to the name "Speedminton" (the official name of the sport is "Speed Badminton") and to the company Speedminton GmbH. (Therefore, the article must be renamed "Speed Badminton"). --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie_2700.html" title="User:Jeremie">Jeremie</a> 17:19, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I changed the article. I removed any reference or link to the company Speedminton GmbH. The article is also more precise about the importance of this sport in and outside Germany. I added a link to a german speed badminton association. I didn't removed completely the word "speedminton", because the sport is more well-known under this name, but I put a ® to emphasize the fact that it is a registred trademark. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie_2700.html" title="User:Jeremie">Jeremie</a> 20:35, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: this raises the question of whether an article on a topic that deserves an article should ever be deleted, no matter how awful or short it is. Sometimes editors only seem willing to work on an article when it is threatened with deletion. Usually the article is about something that people feel strongly about, like a school or a city, otherwise they get speedied or deleted through AfD, even when they are notable enough for an article. When an article has to be completely rewritten and the current article doesn't provide any useful content ("X is nice" or something), should it be deleted even when it is a notable topic? -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:26, 6 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd suggest it should be decided on a case by case basis, which is what we're doing. You're free to vote delete if you feel that this page isn't worth a stub. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenAveling_8f0b.html" title="User:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 05:57, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That question has long since been answered. For the truly "awful" articles we have the speedy deletion criteria of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a>, user tests, and short articles without context (which includes the "xe is nice." example), so that we can get the redlinks back and start afresh. If an article (on a topic that satisfies the relevant inclusion criteria) is meaningful and has context, then <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:stub</a> is where one should head.

<li><b>Comment</b>: but when it is something people feel strongly about, like a school or a city, most people won't speedy it or vote delete on AfD no matter how bad it is. I would say that this article was clearly something that would be deleted (it's been cleaned up). Had it not been a city, it would not have been cleaned up and would have been deleted, possibly speedily deleted. In fact, editors are chastised for nominating articles like "X is a high school in Y." Stuff like that would be a slam dunk speedy on almost any other topic. So, should we not nominate schools or cities at all? -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:45, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>An article about an airline which does not currently exist, nor can any information be found in news sources. The airline industry is a volatile one, and it is quite likely that this airline will <i>never</i> exist. Likewise the Callie group (parent company which is launching the airline) article cannot be verified by news sources, web searches or local phone directory searches. Not notable. Both articles only links in are from the other article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>.

<p>There appears to be some good information ( for example: <a href="http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/HotTipsForEmailers" class="external free" title="http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/HotTipsForEmailers" rel="nofollow">http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/HotTipsForEmailers</a> ) and easy peer supported forking and linking redundant components of the campus to allow for rapid expansion as demand grows.</p>
<p>I am concerned that this request for deletion, although probably motivated by the stubbiness of the article or concern that this was a promotion entry, may be viewed by others as fear of competition and undue influence by the Wikimedia Foundation. Since this project appears to peer based (perhaps based upon mnet, gnunet, groksters et. al. and other emerging peer technologies) and encourages participants to set up and manage their own servers it has the potential to scale up rapidly once it hits critical mass.</p>
<p>Considering the methods whereby Wikipedia and Wikimedia starts as attempts to bolster a failing dot com and then work organized by the cabal off the mailing without participation at the meta site (which was being used to stall energetic newcomers with busy work .... or perhaps as a site to harvest others notes, homework or entrepreneurial efforts) I think we (Wikipedia) would be well advised to bend over backwards to avoid the appearance that we hampering or discouraging other volunteer/participatory sites prototyping other organizational and business models. We do not wish to present the misimpression that we view the planet as big enough for only one wiki and we intend to own/control that wiki/modern grid.</p>
<p>I vote NO. Do not delete competitions article. Rather I intend to embrace and expand the stub while I keep an eye on the site and explore its material, processes, licenses, etc. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazyquasar_f6df.html" title="User:Lazyquasar">user:lazyquasar</a></p>

What's the matter with keeping these as separate discussions?

<li><b>comment</b> I don't think this qualifies as <i>original research</i> since the source article is a review article, which ought to be a summation of the state of scientific knowledge on the matter at the time of writing, and therefore encyclopedic. That being said, I have real doubts that Macmillan has relinquished their copyright on the article so that it could appear in four chunks on wikipedia. The journal prints nothing but neuroscience reviews, if this permission is the publisher's policy, it's quite conceivable that every article of every issue would appear on wikipedia. I wonder if Kosslyn (Dept of Psych, Harvard U.) is aware of, and endorses, the actions of Kosslynlab? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 06:45, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> all but <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditory_imagery.html" title="Auditory imagery">auditory imagery</a>, and revert that, but it's a tough call. This is clearly a valid subject, but this series of articles is massively problematic. They read like original research, smell strongly of copyvio, and fail to establish a significant basis outside of a single book. It looks as if the length of the articles is out of all proportion to their interest to a general audience, and it's not immediately clear how to get from this mess into a single encyclopaedic article on mental imagery, which is what is probably needed. If the original author were motivated to distill these down into that single article I would vote to keep that, I think. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 14:15, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
