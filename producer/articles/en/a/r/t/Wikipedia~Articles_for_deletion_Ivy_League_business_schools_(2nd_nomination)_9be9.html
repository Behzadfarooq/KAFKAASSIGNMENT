<p>A new discussion is necessary. I still feel that this page represents nothing more than academic boosterism; it would be more useful as a page directing readers to the individual school pages. Nothing really notable links to the page, either.

<li><b>Delete</b>, merging any useful content into <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a>. There is nothing (no precedent, no citations of common usage, etc.) establishing "Ivy League business schools" as a topic any more coherent than "Chemistry Ph.D. programs at universities founded in the 1870s". Even the most prestige-oriented of the rankings themselves don't break these schools out into a separate category. Wikipedia has a persistent problem with the creation of ill-justified articles on "Ivy League" plus X, where X can apparently be anything at all. Most of these articles -- <i>definitely</i> including this one -- ought to be folded into a paragraph or two in the article on the <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a>, as that's the most interest I could imagine them having for any reader. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 17:57, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That analogy is, of course, false. Ivy League is a very different concept from Universities founded in the 1870s, and Business schools are not just programmes. A valid analogy might be <i>Religiously affiliated colleges at Canadian Universities</i> - but Schools of the 1870s fails because it's not a cohesive group, whereas Ivy League is. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. My analogy was, of course, a bit hyperbolic. But after looking over the article again, I can't see an <i>article</i>, with a coherent topic, anywhere. I see a lot of ranking-cruft and two short paragraphs under "History" that would fit well into the <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> article. Those claiming that this is a coherent self-contained topic might note that two Ivy League universities do not even <i>have</i> business schools. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 18:22, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>COMMENT: Agree with WilyD, again. Also, this article is far more worthwhile than say the article on sister school relationships between the residential colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 18:17, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>keep</b> please per wilyd the article is nice and sourced <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a> 18:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Why would this list be more notable than say, Pac-10 business schools which would include Stanford, Berkeley, Southern Cal, UCLA, Washington, and Oregon? <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 19:13, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not that I've heard of the PAC-10, but if <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> didn't have an article, would the correct action be to delete <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> or to make an article for <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>France and Germany are infinitely more important than a loose association of business schools. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 19:19, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>France and Germany are only finitely more important than an association of business schoools, but that's neither here nor there. If the absence of article A is sufficient in one case to argue for the deletion of article B, what changes in my hypothetical example? Is it somehow a strawman? As I understand it, it's merely "If an article with validity level X doesn't exist, we should delete all other articles of validity level X" - what nuance have I missed? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:25, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, if their importance is in doubt. If there isn't a list of Big-10 molecular biology programs, then there shouldn't be one of Ivy League molecular biology programs. The only reason that the articles on France and Germany should survive are their sheer importance. And you're overvaluing the concept of Ivy League. You are presuming that "Ivy League is a very different concept from Universities founded in the 1870s". This is not true in case of the business schools. All of them (except Wharton) were founded in the 20th Century. Even the earliest ones are contemporaries of other important schools such as MIT Sloan and NYU Stern. There is nothing historical or operational that distinguishes the Ivy League business schools as a whole from the other good business schools. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 19:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand what you mean by "if their importance is in doubt" - so if someone passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but is not that important (say, an MLB player with a short career), and another person of similar importance doesn't have an article, we should delete the first? The business schools are <b>not</b> the same as programmes - and they're not divorced from their parent institutions. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your example is a non-issue. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> explicitly states that "Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league" generally deserve their own article. There is no such standard for a group of programs associated with an athletic conference. Actually, anything associated with such a convoluted category would be a likely subject for AfD. And while I agree that no program is divorced from its parent institutions, it generally is divorced from whatever conference or group the institution is associated with. Do the Ivy League business schools have exchange or collaboration programs that are not found between, say, Harvard Business and MIT Sloan, or Columbia Business and NYU? If the Ivy League business schools do coordinate with one another in exclusion of other comparable business schools, then the group is notable and deserves an entry. If not, the group is simply unnotable. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 21:07, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The whole argument you presented (as far as I understood) relied <b>only</b> upon the presence of another article. It didn't address the merits of this article whatsoever. Notability isn't a criterion for deletion anyways, except where people are too polite to say "This is spam" (i.e. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>) and use it as a euphamism instead. As for co-ordinated action, I don't see the argument - lots of uncoordinated activities that form a pattern are worthy of articles, i.e. <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism_in_Asia_1718.html" title="Imperialism in Asia">Imperialism in Asia</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you read what I wrote above, you'll see that I did address the merits (or lack thereof) of this article. And I'm sorry, notability IS a criterion for deletion. To quote <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, "Articles are deleted daily on grounds of notability, and this has been common practice for over a year now." As for the analogy with <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism_in_Asia_1718.html" title="Imperialism in Asia">Imperialism in Asia</a> — Well, if those Ivy League business schools did fight one another like the Japanese, Russian, American, and British imperial forces did in Asia, then the group does deserve its own article. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 21:32, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, you'll discover that's neither a policy or a guideline. Articles are never <i>really</i> deleted on grounds of notability, they're deleted because they're spam or vanity, but we're too polite to say (or don't want the arguments). In areas where spam isn't a problem (science, math, arts, history) notability is never used as a criterion for deletion, because they don't get spammed. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 02:14, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
