<li>Not sure how to use this...we're constantly refining this article &amp; we believe it will be of interest to many people.

<li><b>keep</b>. I am the aforementioned Aaron Smart (the current president of the society). The society is of historical importance to UL and the Students' Union as it is one of the longest-running societies still in existance - many never last longer than a couple of years. And 1989 may not seem that long to some, but the university has only existed since 1972.</li>

<dd>Though I think some of the writers have misunderstood the concept of the Wikipedia, and this article is undermining the integrity of the encyclopedia.

<li>Also note that all the above remarks were made before heavy re-writing of the article; the language previously used in the article was most certainly not appropriate for an encyclopedia entry. --<a href="../../../z/i/l/User%7EZilog_Jones_9c07.html" title="User:Zilog Jones">Zilog Jones</a> 09:53, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Please review the article again - it has been heavily revised. If this is still not up to standards I can edit it some more. But regardless, GSoc is a society officially recognised by the UL Students' Union, just like the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Limerick_Debating_Union_c9a1.html" title="University of Limerick Debating Union">University of Limerick Debating Union</a>, who also have a Wikipedia entry.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. It's not the page is badly written--in fact, it's quite well done. However, we generally don't look for articles on topics this minor or specific (no insult intended, but it is rather fine-grained). The problem with this criteria is that it varies from user to user, and we've never been able to agree on a definition that we could put on paper. So it's kind of confusing. I think the best thing to do would be to create a section in the college's article entitled "Student Activities" or something of that nature, and expand that.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Apart from personal bias (can anyone really explain why a bunch of Irish students going 'Arr, I'm a goblin' is more notable than a business that employs 150 people, or a scientist publishing important new research and lecturing to over 150 students is? Really? I mean, seriously, is the chair of this society more important to the university than a professor of physics? Did anyone join the university thinking 'the course is crap, but they have a good roleplaying society?'). I'm of the opinion that this is vanity, and an over inflated sense of ones importance in the scheme of things. I was a chair of a society at University (and one that had more active members than this one) and while it's a good way to pass the evening and all that, I wouldn't think of creating an article for it. This deserves at best one line in a section on societies at the University. Want to know more? Look at the University webpage. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 20:44, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Good points Meelar and FreplySpang. If there was more imformation on the UL Students' Union and other student activities in UL, the article may seem more significant though. I might add some more to the UL page on this, but I couldn't say much.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There's still the fact that the Debating Union also have an article and no one has complained about that as of yet, and I'm sure many other clubs and societies from other colleges also have entries (<a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_College_Dublin_c17f.html" title="Trinity College Dublin">Trinity College Dublin</a> do, but they are kinda of more importance than ours, being several centuries old and all).</dd>
<dd>Maybe the person who started this article was being a bit too "bold", but I think it would be good for historical posterity. Imformation on clubs &amp; soc's here from before the Students' Union building was built around 1998, is pretty much non-existant, and for all I know the society will be long forgotten in a few years after I leave.</dd>
<dd>And Average Earthman, who ever said this was more important than other aspects of UL? It's not my fault that few want to write articles on the academic aspects of the univesity, but I'm sure in time there will be more --<a href="../../../z/i/l/User%7EZilog_Jones_9c07.html" title="User:Zilog Jones">Zilog Jones</a> 21:55, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment:</b> What the article still needs, and would work towards it's defense, is the information about some of it's other national events such as TRICON 2001. With regards to the impression of role playing, there are already a ton of articles on the subject. It's not necisarily more important than a business that 'employs' 150 people, but we often have had more than 200 members sign up in a year. A perfect encyclopedia would contain information on such things. It's not intended to be vain or over emphisised, there's just more information available on it then alot of things of similar importance. We do have a budget in the thousands and vanity pages according to the tutorial pages are personal as opposed to an orginisation.--Kaiser Sma 23:00, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment:</b> In further reference to average earthman's comment, alot of people (right or wrong) have put a considerable amount of effort into this society, many people do join UL in part for it's clubs and societies. I know many people who have spent considerably more time and effort into making them work then their respective studies. This was not made as information for potential students, it was made because we believed it deserved a permenant reference. Most of the people involved in it's construction are graduates as well.--Kaiser Sma 23:22, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Someone putting effort into something does not make it notable, and I've been both treasurer and chairman of a student society with more members than this one claims so I'm not totally clueless on how they work. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 17:29, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, this society has its own website (where they are boasting about being in wikipedia), so this information in available to interested parties. Wikipedia is not the sum of all mundane information, it should be an encyclopedia. There a a role-playing society, and anime society and infinite religious and sporting groups at every university, some of these may be valid long-running clubs that have hade members of note and are suitable for an encyclopedia, but <b>most</b> aren't, you're looking at one of the unencyclopedic ones here. Just because an effort has been made to make it look good does not make it a worthy addition.

<li><b>comment</b>: Bainer, you're wrong on two counts (as far as I can tell). You say the society only affects 120 people. We won the best improved society of the year, as voted by all the other clubs and societies in the university. We have 120 members at the minute, as Zilog Jones said - but 600-800 past members and goodness knows how many in the future. We're involved with other universities in paintball competitions, wargames and some sci-fi interests. (so not just role-playing). You also said people were voting twice, which I would have picked up on straightaway had it been there.</li>
</ul>
<p>The person who started the article (me) did indeed not realise what he had started. I wanted an encyclopedic account of my favourite society, and one which I believe affects enough people to warrant a wiki article. If I looked it up (and found there wasn't a page there) how many other people would try? Another point of information - societies are asked by the university staff to set up stands during open days. This is to "show off" the clubs and societies to prospective students. Many students frequently do choose one university over another because of a better list of societies, if they can do their course at either. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrumad_691d.html" title="User:Trumad">Trumad</a> 21:21, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Clearly "affects" more people than just its members, it's of possible interest to other members of the Irish gaming community, and perhaps to the UL "societies crowd" in general. However, I'd certainly rename, as per Klonimus, and trim excess detail, as per several contributers. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:37, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Actually, I withdraw my last statement. What defines a club or society as "significant" is too vague and discretionary, and could even be verging on discriminatory in some cases. It's not exactly hurting or degrading the Wikipedia by having such entries. Though as others have said, we may decimate some sections of it - as it stands now, it's already bigger than the actual UL article! --<a href="../../../z/i/l/User%7EZilog_Jones_9c07.html" title="User:Zilog Jones">Zilog Jones</a> 09:22, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> If they keep us in suspense for this long and then delete it I'll be very annoyed indeed. There are enough people here saying "keep" to warrant keeping the article on wikipedia, and not enough "deleters" to care enough to actually delete it after 5 days. Therefore, vis a vis, they have no right to delete it. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrumad_691d.html" title="User:Trumad">Trumad</a> 15:07, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I don't think you understand. An admin has to make the decision. Read the rules! --<a href="../../../z/i/l/User%7EZilog_Jones_9c07.html" title="User:Zilog Jones">Zilog Jones</a> 15:33, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
