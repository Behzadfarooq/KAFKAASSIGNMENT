<li><b><s>Keep.</s></b> I'm actually the one who put up the speedy tag while on new-page patrol, but then I had second thoughts. At first it looked like a typical smear piece, but then I did some Googling and found out the story was legit. By that time, an admin had dleted the artcle, but I simply backpaged through my browser and re-posted the article with slight modifications. Sanchez is getting some press coverage because of his current status as a Marine corporal and his past as a gay porn star. That press coverage makes him somewhat notable for now. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 08:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think the page should be <b>kept</b>. First of all hes won a rather notable prize (the Jeane Kirkpatrick Award for Academic Freedom at CPAC). Hes also made quite a few appearances in the mainstream media (at least once on Hannity and Colmes, once on The OReilly Factor, the story of his outing was #1 on Keith Olbermann's Countdown, hes been on Alan Colmes Radio Show, hes published articles in the New York Post and Salon.com and thats just off the top of my head) not to mention now with this outing hes been the subject of major news in the blogosphere, including being featured on Eschaton, DailyKos, Gawker, etc. According to his interview with JoeMyGod he also has a major book release coming up. The incident is also tied into Ann Coulter's "Faggot" comment and now hes been the subject of two major statements of support from Michelle Malkin and David Horowitz. So yeah, he seems way more notable to begin with than <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Gannon_c068.html" title="Jeff Gannon">Jeff Gannon</a> ever was and essentially had the same thing happen to me, so if we keep Gannon it seems more than likely that we should keep Sanchez. Keep in mind this is all related to his political work. He was also one of the world's top gay porn stars for several years, including working for Kristen Bjorn and other directors and he has a considerably porn filmography. So whatever way you look at it, I think hes notable and the article shouldn't be deleted. -ThongWearer 08:08, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh yes, by the way, I also think the article should be <b>merged</b> with the Matthew Sanchez one, it is obviously about the same person. -ThongWearer 01:52, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obvious <b>Keep</b>. The Matt Sanchez story has emerged from the blogosphere into the legitimate media. The facts of his television appearances and his award by a major political group qualify him for inclusion on the grounds of notability. The facts of his careers in the sex industry are also thoroughly germane to his biography - particularly because his filmography alone qualifies him on the grounds of notability. However, the article should be merged with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Sanchez_b0d7.html" title="Matthew Sanchez">Matthew Sanchez</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangali_5158.html" title="User:Malangali">Malangali</a> 08:26, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> The article fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and meets criteria for speedy deletion under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G4" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G4</a>. Aquasplash 21:21, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>--I dont think it qualifies for WP:CSD#4. It was erroneously speedy deleted because the person who put up the speedy delete tag did so thinking it was vandalism before he could verify the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that the article, as it exists, conforms to the description of a list of links, and should not stay as it currently exists. However, many articles have appropriate external links, and this easily could be expanded into a genuine article with the external links relegated to the appropriate section of that article. There is a distinction between official and unofficial music charts, by the way, which explanation would be an appropriate inclusion in this article. Fcgier 19:57, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - it's encyclopedic information that is genuinely useful. However, it's very region-specific. Could we do better than abbreviate the placename to 'LCRV'? - Richardcavell 01:35, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Relates only to the Lower Colorado River Valley, the LCRV of the title. It would be useful if it was non-geographic (i.e. covered the world, or at least a continent) and I suspect some of the comments made above may have been made on the basis that that is what it is. Otherwise, to be encyclopaedic, we need the same sets of pages for every conceivable regon in the world, including my back garden! So, it's not a similar discussion to Gallery of Scout and Guide national emblems, but it would parallel Gallery of Scout and Guide emblems from the Lower Colorado River Valley.<a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 14:27, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, that would be less useful. There's a reason that field guides are generally region specific.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The basis for selection appears to be the 2006 JoongAng university evaluation, which appears to be similar to the rankings of U.S. universities by U.S. News and World Report magazine or of Canadian universities by Maclean's magazine. In other words, it is not the author's original research. The term "Ivy League" for some of the most prestigious U.S. universities comes from their football league, which is named the ivy League. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 01:42, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The problem is not that it's original research but rather that it may be a made-up topic. Why six in particular? Are the six universities often mentioned as a single group? (Not in my experience, though reliable sources showing me wrong would be welcome.) At least "Ivy League" is a widely used term. <a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooChung_b5b0.html" title="User:YooChung">YooChung</a> 01:50, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The content of this page is not a list of private universities but rather a description of a very limited selection of private universities ranked highly by the creator (based on sources). It was also renamed from a page that actually included a public university. I think it's better to start List of private universities in South Korea from scratch rather than renaming it from this page, which is woefully inadequate as a list article. <a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooChung_b5b0.html" title="User:YooChung">YooChung</a> 01:50, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> South Korean secondary school curriculum is divided into two specialized course. one is Humanities/Social Science course, and the other is Natural Science course. It is widely known that top six universities in terms of each course are Se-Yon-ko-Se-Sung-Han(acronym for Seoul National, Yonsei, Korea, Sogang, Sungkyunkwan, and Hanyang.) for Humanities/Social Science course, and Se-Ka-Po-Yon-ko-Han(acronym for Seoul National, KAIST, POSTECH, Yonsei, Korea, and Hanyang.)for Natural Science course. I would like to suggest people to try a couple of Korean search engine for this notion and you will find it's prevalent among Internet users and secondary school students.User:Arthurhahn 2:22 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> Every university has, as it ought, an individual article. If they were part of a formal organization or if the were commonly referred to in sources by a particular name, , then there would be reason for an article. If Arthurhahn can find such a name (or names) then it might justify an article under such a name.

<li><b>Delete</b> - as a poorly-named disambiguation page that seems to have arbitrarily chosen 6 schools and hard-coded itself to that number via the title.

<li><b>Delete</b> what makes them so unique and what distinguishes them from other private universities is not indicated in the article.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I created this account with my old account, even though I switched accounts. I am an alumni of this school, and when the article started, it was a strong school article, but had no sources about events, etc. Now, this article has been used just for student gossip and rumors between students. Like <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> stated, almost all information within this article is unsourced, and it looks like the information will stay unsourced because due to its small size, there are not a lot of reliable information to support the claims made by users and editors of this article. I've tired to fix up this article many times, but it has become pointless, due to constant reverting and the lack of reliable information. I think that this article doesn't help the Wikipedia community at all, and it would help if this article was deleted. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickyfuzz14_d028.html" title="User:Chickyfuzz14">Chickyfuzz14</a> 18:30, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Agree - Efforts have been made to mentor/guide editors of this article to follow Wikipedia guidelines and policy. However, the article continues to grow with non-encyclopedic, blog-like details, without references. It seems to be an open playground for current students.

<li>Yes, I agree very much, but even if the result is keep, and all the unsourced information was deleted, there would 1. be no article, since there is almost no sourced information and 2. be reverting like crazy, unless the page was protected, but I don't think that is the answer. I know I have, including <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (I think) reverted unsourced information at one point, but the unsourced information just gets reverted again, and again. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickyfuzz14_d028.html" title="User:Chickyfuzz14">Chickyfuzz14</a> 18:49, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What is was (I was one of the students that got bike riding approved) was that when POCS was first created, bikes couldn't be rode to school due to a high schooler in Santa Rosa who got killed riding his bike to school the same year the school district was trying to get POCS approved to be built, so the city was all like, "We don't want another kid getting hit, so students can only walk." It still doesn't make sense to me, but w/e. And buses only go to a couple streets in the area, so most kids walk.

Any Beatles-related information that hasn't (or in some cases has) found a place in another article is included here, with no justification except "the Beatles rock, so we have to mention everything we know about them". <a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexicon_cf83.html" title="User:Lexicon">Lexicon</a> <small><a href="../../../l/e/x/User_talk%7ELexicon_b836.html" title="User talk:Lexicon">(talk)</a></small> 01:36, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge into relevant sub-articles</b>. (changed from earlier <b>Keep</b>, changed from <b>Weak Delete</b>) I'm typically in favor of listcruft. The world does not really need List of Dragon Ball Z characters born in March or April with Power Levels over 290. But here, it's the Beatles, likely the single most influential band in Western pop music history (and that's coming from an ardent <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a> fan). Perhaps they're not "bigger than Jesus", but I could wager for "nearly as big". That is to say that, like <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, a lot of otherwise unnotable or redundant/pedantic fluff that doesn't exactly require its own article is bumped up a notch in importance due to the impact the Beatles had on <i>life</i>. This list is probably more comprehensive than any single fan site out there, and it's "notable" in the sense that there are probably people interested in it - and more people interested in it than in similar listcruft.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, just a random thought - since the entire Beatles article is "only" 62KB long (compare to 93KB for the 9/11 attacks - this may sound flakey, but I think the Beatles are easily as important), has the possibility of breaking <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> into seperate "main" sections for each period (say, prehistory / quarrymen years /// fab four / everybody wearing the same outfit years /// studio / psychedelic years /// final let it be years /// solo careers from a Beatles perspective, with the main article summarizing each) been broached? It might allow for the inclusion of several of these miscellanies in the sub-articles. I believe the Beatles to be a lot more important than, say, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Ball_Z_eb3c.html" title="Dragon Ball Z">Dragon Ball Z</a> or even <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, and I do believe that in this case, inclusiveness wins out over any sense of cruft.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, the article is poorly organized, possibly by its very nature, and poorly written, and should be dealt with somehow. <i>I'm bouncing around a lot here, and ultimately my vote is to split the Beatles history up into separate subarticles (if it hasn't already been done - I'll admit I didn't fully scan <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">the current article</a>), and put most, if not all, of the information there.</i> --Action Jackson IV 04:57, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep/Merge</b> - All this info is important and should be included on Wikipedia, its just not sorted properly.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is an interesting and encyclopedically-written article, but it's still fundamentally and entirely an expanded dictionary entry. It discusses the etymology and history of the word, but unless you want to see similar articles on literally thousands of other words, this should go. As for the Time thing, let's use the following measure: if Time had instead awarded "Person of the Year" to "Time Readers" (which is basically what "You" means in that context), would they get an article of their own?<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 22:49, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't prophesize and say that they would, but they should. A single article called Time readers would do no harm, if it worked from the sources- the article itself and the resulting media coverage. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 22:57, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Up to now I have assumed some of the people mentioning the Time person of the year thing were joking. Since it appears they weren't, I just want to emphasize that the Time thing cannot justify keeping an article named "You" on Wikipedia. The Time piece's usage of the word "you" in its title is just that--usage--and it's a dictionary's job, not an encyclopedia's, to document usage of words. If the Time Person-of-the-year-2006 had to be strictly identified, it would be <i>the public</i> or <i>the online public</i>. That <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html" rel="nofollow">the piece</a> is a commentary on the public's use of the Internet is evident from reading it and the commentary it engendered such as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6187113.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6187113.stm" rel="nofollow">this</a>. It has nothing to do with "you," or you, or me, or Time readers as has been suggested (though the piece was <i>addressed</i> to Time readers). We can write material on Time's person of the year 2006 on Wikipedia, but it wouldn't be at <a href="../../../y/o/u/You.html" title="You">You</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:09, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. It's not a typical usage. Moreover, coming up with our own title for Time's selection would border on OR- Time used "You." BTW, this is not to say that Time's choice was a good one. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 21:12, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Assume for the sake of argument that the article <a href="../../../y/o/u/You.html" title="You">You</a> did contain information about the Time 2006 Person of the Year write-up and reaction to it. Then <i>that</i> would be appropriate Wikipedia content, and the right course of action per <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> would be to transwiki and remove the <i>rest</i> of the content--about the meaning, usage, and etymology of "you"--and to insert a {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWiktionarypar_6f6e.html" title="Template:Wiktionarypar">wiktionarypar</a>}} tag. The important point I should have focused on in my previous comment is that the Time 2006 Person of the Year content has nothing to do with the Wiktionary material about "you," just as Time's 2000 Person of the Year (Bush) has nothing to do with the etymology of the name Bush. (BTW, on OR, I wasn't suggesting that we report in Wikipedia article space that "the online public" is Time's 2006 Person of the Year. I agree, that would be OR unless sources outside of Wikipedia have said it.) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:05, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd say an appropriate title for the person of the year would be something like You (Time's 2006 Person of the Year), analogous to <a href="../../../y/o/u/You_%28Radiohead_song%29_f414.html" title="You (Radiohead song)">You (Radiohead song)</a> etc. This is disambiguation and not OR. Actually <a href="../../../y/o/u/You_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="You (disambiguation)">You (disambiguation)</a> has an entry for the person which does not lead to <a href="../../../y/o/u/You.html" title="You">You</a> at all. --<a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 08:51, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am nominating this article for deletion mainly due to the fact that the title is misleading, but also due to the fact that the information is readily available in better-labelled articles, namely <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28incidence%29.html" title="Autism (incidence)">Autism (incidence)</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_autism.html" title="Causes of autism">Causes of autism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_in_autism.html" title="Controversies in autism">Controversies in autism</a>, and <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">Vaccine controversy</a>.</p>
<p>The title "Frequency of autism" would imply that the article is about just that, but sadly it reads like a soapbox for the "Autism Epidemic" and vaccination controversy movement (See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, Wikipedia is not a soapbox). I have attempted to make good faith edits, and to discuss problems, but certain authors refuse to enter into discussion, and simply revert my every edit - to the point of even removing my npov tags.</p>
<p>So after much thought, and many months of trying, I am nominating the article for deletion on the grounds of:</p>
<ul>
<li>duplication</li>
<li>mis-representation</li>
<li>being a soapbox</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - very soapboxy, or, at best, misguided. It almost seems as if the article text is written for a phantom article called Autism Epidemic, which would be highly dubious - it's an epidemic in that more cases are being reported, but there's a growing trend in psychiatry to diagnose something - anything, and one man's autistic child is another man's eccentric savant. --Action Jackson IV 05:41, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Glad you sought to verify your facts. Make sure you get it straight, this AfD is about the the two year old article that was originally <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">Autism epidemic</a>. This original article has an intact edit history. The pov fork <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28incidence%29.html" title="Autism (incidence)">Autism (incidence)</a> article has a much shorter history, and it is not the only article to have been hijacked to a far less visible page. Yes, there was a different pov fork version created in an abuse of process by <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">user:Midgley</a>, that was part of the backdrop to the earlier AfD fiasco about this, the original autism epidemic article. Midgley was reprimanded for creating a sock puppet for The Invisible Anon, Essjay was being disruptive in removing a complaint about Midgley, and abusive in blocking the wrong editor. Please see comment below about the <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay_controversy.html" title="Essjay controversy">Essjay controversy</a>. Essjay actively aided with the creator of the pov fork, after a much deserved complaint was leveled against the creator of the pov fork The article in question here and now was original <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> article, not the pov fork created by <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">user:Midgley</a>, his <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28incidence%29.html" title="Autism (incidence)">Autism (incidence)</a> article with the much shorter edit history was indeed created in tandem with the old AfD linked above, during which the article in questin here was also subjected to, simultaneously a) a name change, despite not having a consensus on an alternative title b) the AfD attempt one year ago, which was fraught with gamesmanship, c) a daughter pov fork article created by an editor affiliated with the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Health_Service_ad67.html" title="National Health Service">National Health Service</a> (NHS), which is in the middle of many debates over the mushrooming autism epidemic crisis (the pov fork is now poised, a year later, to subsume the parent article), and d) meddling by <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">user:Essjay</a> that benefitted <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">User:Midgley</a>, an NHS editor who was also engaged in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppetry</a> in the very same time frame. Thanks for making sure that was brought up, because no one could even find this article because the name is wrong, which is the real question at hand). In a gross abuse of process, the article and edit history is preserved in accordance with what <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan%27s_Law_a65c.html" title="Jonathan's Law">Jonathan's Law</a> will soon make law. The article and edit history was shoved to the current page title without reasonable discussion, and the talk page has remained attached to the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> page. The original article has come under withering attack, due to mistaken notions like the one you have set forth, MastCell. Sadly, it's not surprising that this AfD has gained momentum from a single editor with a gust of shuffled paper (with rich overtones reminiscent of <i><a href="../../../f/l/o/Flowers_for_Algernon_1f08.html" title="Flowers for Algernon">Flowers for Algernon</a></i>), in the way the Wiki is turning prostrate to the lockstep paper shufflers. The Wiki has already developed a bias atuned much too strictly, almost as if transfixed, to the likes of the JVCI/NHS and the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advisory_Committee_on_Immunization_Practices_96c9.html" title="Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices">ACIP</a>/CDC) -- in tandem with simultaneous gross misrepresentations . The <a href="../../../f/r/a/Framing_effect.html" title="Framing effect">Framing effect</a> article resulted directly as a result of misrepresentations associated with Midgley, JFDWolff, and the NHS, apparently inserted with the deliberate intent to inflame, e.g., the pov fork author's hijacking of the npov <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccination_critics.html" title="Vaccination critics">vaccination critics</a> page, which morphed into the pov ridden <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationists.html" title="Anti-vaccinationists">anti-vaccinationists</a>, a title intended to inflame, rather than contribute to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Informed_consent.html" title="Informed consent">informed consent</a> for the parents, guardians, and children affliected by autism --- another issue, pejorative article titles, that is clearly meant to undermine, by editors apparently bent on sending the page edit history down the old <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_hole.html" title="Memory hole">memory hole</a>. Hopefully, the disgrace of this AfD fiasco is not indicative of Wikipedia's possible deliberate non-complance with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>'s <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan%27s_Law_a65c.html" title="Jonathan's Law">Jonathan's Law</a>. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 02:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please do not respond by trying to confuse distinct issues. If you intend to distract attention away from the facts in the matter, that is what your earlier comment will do, just as Midgley's explanation about different clock settings had nothing to do with the discussion about the impropriety of his creation of a pov fork at the time of the first AfD. Please stick to the facts, rather than speculating about the huge number of new laws going into effect besides <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan%27s_Law_a65c.html" title="Jonathan's Law">Jonathan's Law</a>, such as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combating_Autism_Act_ef86.html" title="Combating Autism Act">Combating Autism Act</a>. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 04:32, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

It's this: does this article meet Wikipedia's guidelines and policies for inclusion?

<dd>If you wish to discuss pov forking, then you should acknowledge which article was created during the middle of the last AfD fiasco, by a known puppeteer and associate of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Health_Service_ad67.html" title="National Health Service">National Health Service</a>. That is dubious enough, in and of itself. During the same time frame, Midgley impersonated The Invisible Anon, who clearly was the subject of a wide ranging assault by a number of editors, including <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">user:Essjay</a>, over articles related to the <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">vaccine controversy</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_in_autism.html" title="Controversies in autism">controversies in autism</a>. These systematic divide and conquer activities most certainly are directly related both to the autism epidemic article, and to the author of the pov fork, Midgley.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ombudsman, you have been given almost a year to clear up this horrible POV mess of an article, but have failed. The only "advance" has been in the renaming, but in some respects that has simply made the article even worse, as the prose is still about the "autism epidemic", rather than being truely about the new title of the article. As far as I'm concerned I hope that the end result is locking both this and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">Autism epidemic</a> as redirect pages, so that this farce of the past few years can hopefully be halted. There is a place for your controversal ideas on Wikipedia, but the way you push them is far from ideal. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 09:31, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, MastCell, this is not a vote, an AfD by its very nature is supposed to be a call for a voice of reason, not a call for absent minded forgetfulness about the serial abuse of processes whereby the pov fork article created by an editor whose antics deserved the complaint that <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">user:Essjay</a> removed. Then Essjay blocked the anon that <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">user:Midgley</a> created and abused a sockpupet of. If you look through the conversation strewn about Essjay's parsed talk pages, you will find that Essjay immediately archived his page when confronted about his abusive block on the anon sockpuppeted by Midgley. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 03:51, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What this happens to be is a discussion that involves abuse of process, and you seem to be avoiding discussion of the abuse of process that led up to the damage caused to the article by allowing a page name change despite a failed AfD. The original AfD failed, but that decision was in effect ignored, while serious discussion about the page name was undermined because of the bogus name change that violated the propriety of the AfD process. Please don't make any more inappropriate misreprestations about the nature of the discussion here. It is about the abuse of process, exemplified by the fact that the page was shoved into <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purgatory.html" title="Purgatory">purgatory</a> out of process, despite a complete lack of consensus about if, much less where, the page should be moved.

<dd>Obudsman, why don't you forget about conspiracy theories and start thinking about coming up with a good reason that your article should be saved? I have nothing to do with either of the editors you seem to have issues with, and it was I that nominated your article for deletion. For the record I also have nothing to do with the NHS or medicine in any way, so your theories just don't hold up.</dd>
<dd>Whichever article out of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_of_autism.html" title="Frequency of autism">Frequency of autism</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28incidence%29.html" title="Autism (incidence)">Autism (incidence)</a> was created first is quite irrelevent if they've both been stable for a year or so. The "Frequency" article has huge POV, and doesn't address it's subject properly. The "Incidence" article doesn't mention vaccinations, but has no POV problems unless your personal POV is truely twisted. One of your "vaccination is bad" friends put the npov tag on the "Incidence" article last month, but has failed to come up with a single reason as to why he thought so. I haven't seen one from you either, yet you constantly say it has problems. If you honestly believe that your issues with the article will hold up, why don't you attempt to nominate <i>that</i> article for a deletion debate?</dd>
<dd>I repeat that you've had <b>almost a year</b> to clean your article up. I suggest that you start working on it now to remove it's soapbox style and "vaccination is bad" POV.

<li><b>Block</b> Ombudsman for violating the terms of his probation - disrupting a page on a medical topic by tendentious editing. <b>Don't merge</b> Ombudsman's autism epidemic soapbox with <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28incidence%29.html" title="Autism (incidence)">autism (incidence)</a> please, all the facts in the former page (and probably still some non-facts, alas) were demerged or shelled out into autism incidence, then it was restricted (largely, but not completely, yet) to information about incidence, which is distinct from prevalence, both of which are interesting, and neither of which is even clearly known, never mind agreed upon. Frequency is not quite a topic - it isn't clear what it means - whether prevalence, incidence or something else (the latter, I think, in realistic terms for that page). I find it curious that anyone describes the autism frequency page as "well written", it isn't, it isn't encyclopaedic and much of it fails even to be grammatical. Ombudsman introduces, above, a lot of irrelevancies, as he does all over the shop, but the anonymous user who refused to register the username he presented himself as was a real nuisance here and elsewhere, who departed in the middle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/86.10.231.219" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/86.10.231.219" rel="nofollow">an RFC upon him</a> which he blustered greatly about but in that instance proper WP procedure worked well.

<dd>Again, the nexus of the problems arises here, wherein legitimate content is all too often allowed to be replaced with misrepresentative material. Replacing the vaccine critics page with an article with an anachronistic term that was more apt before the advent of useful vaccines, such as the later versions of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polio_vaccine.html" title="Polio vaccine">polio vaccine</a>, clearly shows a propensity within the Wiki's medical articles for, pov misrepresentations that are inherently pejorative. Regardless of the process, a legitimate article title was replaced with a pejoratively titled, pov misrepresentation that only serves to replicate as spam the pov of the medical establishment. That is fact. Your mistaken accusation is inflammatory and untrue, so you are the one, Midgley, in need of making a retraction. Don't feel alone, as even Fred Bauder has engaged in such lamentable <a href="../../../f/r/a/Framing_effect.html" title="Framing effect">framing effect</a> misrepresentations.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Cesar_Tort_and_Ombudsman_vs_others/Workshop&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54815186" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Cesar_Tort_and_Ombudsman_vs_others/Workshop&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54815186" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Nice try at distracting attention from the pattern of pov hegemony consolidation in the Wiki's medical articles, but the focus here is on the propriety of merging a venerable article and its edit history into the memory hole, which came to a head after <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> was recently redirected, away from the original article that directly addresses the topic to the pov fork you created.

<dl>
<dd>The article is simply a description of the language, I honestly don't know how it could be considered original research (OR). I'm familiar enough with Ekspreso to know that the name is not a neologism (NEO). I've known about Ekspreso for years, and it is a genuine auxiliary language that has been seriously discussed on several newsgroups. Is it well constructed - see for example the Babel text - and is better known than many other auxiliary languages. The number of speakers is unknown and probably small, but that's also true of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latino_sine_Flexione_26f5.html" title="Latino sine Flexione">Latino sine Flexione</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occidental.html" title="Occidental">Occidental</a>, two important auxiliary languages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to notability, Ekspreso is the only language I know of that was designed for people in a hurry. It is also one of the few Interlingua derivatives. This can be clarified in the article. Regarding sources, the third external link is obviously the source of much of the article. It doesn't contain a comprehensive description, but it does briefly describe the language. In any case, Wikipedia policy is that unsourced articles should be sourced, not deleted. Finally, there may very well be comprehensive information available offline or in one of the many websites I found.</dd>

<dd>A note of caution - right now, the main <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlingua.html" title="Interlingua">Interlingua</a> article contains quite a bit of misleading and incorrect information.

<p>There's no article for the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turtle_Beach_2a8a.html" title="Turtle Beach">Turtle Beach</a> Montego DDL sound card, but there's an article about its <i>control panel</i>?

<dd>The distinction is whether it is likely that the article can be improved. As there is essentially nothing there, and no references, there is no way we can tell. I think a friendly note such as Noroton send to a school yesterday is the way. (The practical reason for deleting these as they come in is that this is the time when they are noticed, and probably the only time. Probably we would do well to have some more rational but complicated sorting method, but at least for schools, we dont.) <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:06, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: Give me a break. This happened on several articles that I created. Within minutes, there were AFD templates slapped up, no discussion regarding it or whatever.

As far as the comments by the author and by <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">User:Noroton</a> are concerned, it is expected that an article, once posted, must stand or fall on its merits as they appear at the time. An author can take as long as needed building an article on a sub-page or in the sandbox, but once the "save" button is hit the article is up for judgement.

<li><b>Delete</b> An article should, from its beginning, contain some idea of why it in Wikipedia. Why do we care about this particular subject?

<p><b>Delete</b> - indiscriminate list and directory, seeking to capture not just every instance of a "suicide attack," but any instance of an action which in the <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">unconfirmed</a> opinion of an editor might possibly be a suicide attack.

Jeopardy! is a particularly notable show, enough to have picked up a variety of references from other notable shows during its time. This significance in popular culture warrants an article of it in popular culture. It is unsourced for the same reason most plot summaries are unsourced, though you can verify each item by perusing the specific work. Has there been some published study referring to Jeopardy! as an important cultural phenomenon? I don't know, but just look at this list with <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMMON_SENSE_6374.html" title="WP:COMMON SENSE">WP:COMMON SENSE</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> In this case deletion review's overturning the first AfD doesn't mean that the article was/is good, only that its original AfD did not come to a consensus and was ended prematurely without sufficient numbers and by a potential misunderstanding of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> on the part of its closing admin (as per his explanation which can now be found in his talk page archives).

<li><a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a> does not mean that the resultant split off article is somehow exempt from the standards that are supposed to be applied to every article. Splitting off a trivia section into its own article and labeling it "in popular culture" doesn't make the information any less garbage in the new article than it is in the old. Too many times editors decide to dump this kind of mess into someone else's lap by forking it off into a pop culture article rather than dealing with it in the article where it came from. But junk is junk whether it's in the main article or in a pop culture article and <a href="../../../b/h/t/WP%7EBHTT_103f.html" title="WP:BHTT">better here than there</a> is spectacularly uncompelling. If there is no better reason to keep an article than its information might end up cluttering another article, then the clutter article should be deleted. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:14, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're completely missing my point. My point is that with anything more than just cursory popular culture references, the Jeopardy! article is too large. I would say that 75% of the stuff in the article right now should be pruned, but the other 25% is notable, and that the Jeopardy! article does not have room to list that 25%. Yes, we need to do a better job of pruning, but that in itself is not reason to delete the article. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 20:41, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's funny how often that "keep but prune" gets offered up as a defense for these garbage dump articles. The funnier thing is that once the AFD closes, I rarely if ever see any of the people who are so desperate to keep but prune actually do any pruning. The funniest thing of all is that when I go in and try to prune them, most or all of what I take out gets put right back in again. So you'll forgive me if I put absolutely no credence in the "keep but prune" defense. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:19, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> I view the article as a legitimate split of the main article. However, if it is an article in its own right, the mess should be cleaned up. I agree with Ponte's view, that there are significant references to Jeopardy! in pop culture. I would view a notable instance from popular culture as follows (all of the following is my view, not policy or guideline that I know of):
<ol>
<li>The <i>Jeopardy!</i> reference in a TV show's episode constitutes a major part of the episode's plotline</li>
<li><i>Jeopardy!</i> references are regularly and repeatedly presented within a TV series</li>
<li>A memorable or regularly occurring parody</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>What would not be notable is:
<ol>
<li>A passing or brief reference to a <i>Jeopardy!</i> element</li>
<li>Appearances by Alex Trebek, Merv Griffin, etc. on behalf of <i>Jeopardy!</i> are not necessarily notable in their own right</li>
<li>Individual non-recurring sketches on sketch comedy shows</li>
<li>Parodies within a program (not 100% sure about this)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In a TV episode, if <i>Jeopardy!</i> plays on a TV set or someone hums the "Think" music, that's not notable. Without commenting on other subject areas, a well-known thing (tangible item) would not warrant a "in popular culture" article. A media work would justify a "in popular culture" article, provided that the media work has been discussed across many other works. I will create a list of what I think are the notable pop culture references in the article's talk page. Perhaps this would help the article rise above being nondiscriminate. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 21:58, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Jeopardy! has had a pretty profound effect on popular culture, and the article is pretty good (for a list). It can be expanded out from being "just a list", though, and there's a little bit more already starting up. I think it's time to get the hedge clippers out on it, though. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 00:00, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Many "In popular culture" articles are unmaintained and thus massively erratic in the quality of the entries. They also often dive into a mere list of occurrences rather than discussing cultural impact and how X is seen in culture. Considering that Wikipedia seems to attract these sections like crazy, I think we should at least give the better-maintained ones a chance. That way we can at least point to a "good" "in popular culture" article and challenge the bad ones to either improve to that standard, or be deleted. That said, while this article looks better than most, I'd say that some pruning could still be done, and more prose to tie things together would be nice as well (even if that involves skirting original research). <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 03:32, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The spirit of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a> is harmonious with the concept of sensibly forking overlong articles into families of articles organized with categories and templates, which is how we've been trying to manage <i>Jeopardy!</i> topics on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 13:31, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - an indiscrimiante colletion of information. If it does not belong in an article of its own, it does not belong in another article. The arguments that it is split have no actual bearing on the appropriateness of the article. I could split any part of an article into any number of pieces and then use it as an argument for keeping it. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 17:41, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see what was so bad about the first AFD that this has to go through it again. The first AFD was clear-cut, and gave plenty of good reasons to why this should not be kept. Encyclopedias need to be overviews, not a hodgepodge of trivia. The section on the main J! page is fine and give proper/notable pop culture mentions. 69.218.255.54 18:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Definately notable, but that's not the issue. The main reasoning was "to start the page from scratch." However, deletion and then a restart is not the greatest solution, as you'll have people quabbling over how to start it again. I suggest starting a new page from scratch on a user subpage, then negotiation, and then finally implementation when protection is lifted. <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="black">bibliomaniac</font></a><a href="../../../b/i/b/User_talk%7EBibliomaniac15_e27b.html" title="User talk:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="red">1</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bibliomaniac15_b1b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bibliomaniac15"><font color="blue">5</font></a></b></i> 05:45, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This will lead to a lame edit war. The article has been protected for quite a while now and notability is not the issue here. The reason is to restart both the article and its editors. Ackoz 05:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what exactly would magically prevent these current editors from latching onto the new article? --Action Jackson IV 05:57, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I have already started a user subpage a while ago as a sort of sandbox. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadger_draft_expulsions_461d.html" title="User:Jadger/draft expulsions">user:Jadger/draft_expulsions</a>--<a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadger_b81c.html" title="User:Jadger">Jadger</a> 07:22, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable, and it would be preferential to have placed the reasoning as a brand-new entry on the talk page, rather than requiring a scan of the entire TOC. I don't doubt that this is a problematic article, but I think mediation would probably be a better avenue. --Action Jackson IV 05:57, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a dead-end disambiguation page - despite the plethora of links in violation of <a href="../../../d/a/b/MoS%7EDAB_c126.html" title="MoS:DAB">MoS:DAB</a>, there aren't any links that actually go to other articles on other Megatokyos. It mentions that there's a Megatokyo in <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubblegum_Crisis_a1b8.html" title="Bubblegum Crisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a>... except that there's no article on that, and not even much chatter on the setting in the BG crisis article. And (I guess) the dicdef that "Typically it refers to a futuristic version of Tokyo." Right.</p>
<p>This was de-prodded on the basis of "reasonable disambig." Anyway, I don't see any evidence that this will be the case any time soon, but suppose somebody did make Megatokyo (Bubblegum Crisis) and it didn't get merged. In that case, the hatnote on the main page can simply refer to it directly rather than forcing two clicks, one to the disambig page and one to the other article. I mean, this is hardly a big deal, but I don't see the point of this page... <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 05:45, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> for the moment, but by all means have a discussion on the main talkpage (which is a better venue for merge discussions than AFD) on whether to merge these articles. My impression is that the articles are well-sourced and on a notable topic and controversy in U.S. politics history, and I am not altogether against detailed coverage of it, but several of the articles nominated bear resemblance to newspaper articles rather than encyclopedia articles. On the other hand, the main article is pretty long already, so some splitting off into side articles may well be appropriate. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:24, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the nomination: <i>"these articles do not violate any written policy of Wikipedia per se"</i>. Although I find the articles unwieldy, I disagree with the nominator that they are unnecessary (especially not incredibly so) or useless (especially not overwhelmingly so).

That said, a merge of one or more of these articles to <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_oath_controversy_of_the_110th_United_States_Congress_e560.html" title="Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress">Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress</a> may be appropriate, but that is not a matter for AFD.

<li>I realise that and didn't mean to suggest that your nomination was intended to insult the editors of the articles. However, I don't feel that "common sense" alone (i.e., without discussion on the talk page) can dictate what ought to be done in this case, and the disagreement above seems to support that view. You raise a valid point that these articles may not need to exist separately, but (again) I feel that's an editorial issue suited for a talk page rather than AFD. I am not opposed to content being merged from one into another and subsequently trimmed (or vice versa), but I do not believe simple deletion is an appropriate course of action in this case. I hope this clarifies my position and the argument I'd intended to convey.

<p>Do we really need an article entirely about one man's work during one session of a U.S. state legislature?

<li><b>comment</b> this article was made in attempt to give depth of information to a Wikipedia subject. One of the largest criticisms against Wikipedia is its lack of depth. I understand that this is probably a losing arguement, and that active controversial politicians will be lucky to get a single page, while every episode of the Simpsons and South Park and every character within them will have massive amounts of information and multiple sub-pages given to them.</li>

<li>It's not about volume of information - I do have a big crush on abundant information about political figures - it's about volume of articles.

<li><b>Rewrite or Delete</b> I nominated this article for deletion shortly after it was created. The author asked me to give him a chance to develop it more. He convinced me that the article on Keith Ellison's work in the 83rd was too long to be in the Keith Ellison page. Therefore, I did not contest it, and allowed the article to be written. Unfortunately, this article may by definition display undue weight. I suggest that we get someone other than Wowaconia to attempt a rewrite. I would do it myself if I wasn't going out of town on business tonight. I'll be gone longer than this Afd will take. If you vote to rewrite, I'll take a crack at it. If it still shows undue weight then I say we delete. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStayinAnon_a615.html" title="User:StayinAnon">StayinAnon</a> 15:52, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Keith Ellison is by definition notable, being an elected official in both a state and federal capacity, but his cumulative actions in one legislative session are not. We don't have a separate article on <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s term as a state senator for New York. We don't have a separate article on <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a>'s term as Governor of New York. That's because although both did notable things as senator and governor respectively, none of those deeds are notable enough to make a separate article on their cumulative deeds necessary. Anything that can be said about Keith Ellison's actions as member of a state legislature can be included either in his own article or in the article on that legislative term (or on the action in question). --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 19:17, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Or could it possibly be that the reason it doesn't have references is because it's absurd to believe that 98% of the items on the list are in any way specifically associated with Christmas? I mean come on. Look at the list. Australians specifically associate <i>vegetables</i> with Christmas? <i>Beer</i>? <i>Seafood</i> and <i>barbeque</i>? This isn't a list of Christmas foods, it's someone's Christmas dinner menu.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, it provides a nice, quick, organized way to figure out "Christmas" dishes by country (which considering the large number of dishes listed in the category, is almost a necessity), even if not everything is sourced yet. I am sick of people who put things up for deletion because "most of it isn't sourced". Sourcing takes time, and something unsourced now could have a cite less than an hour from now on this site. Further, if there are "questionable" dishes listed, what the hell is preventing anyone from a.) removing them from the from the list b.) digging up a cite to prove or disprove it or c.) tagging it with "citation needed"? That's what we HAVE <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags and their brethern for, folks. That's why we can EDIT these things. Having such a list is very, very useful (especially given that most individual Christmas dishes in the category for them are NOT listed by country, but by name). Does it need work? I'd say so. But worth deleting? Hardly. - <i><a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">User:Runa27</a> not logged in</i>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>But the point is that almost everything on that list is <i>not</i> specifically a "Christmas dish." There is no point in asking for a cite that people eat turkey or cake or drink champagne at Christmas because it's common knowledge that people do in fact eat turkey and cake and drink champagne on Christmas. That something is eaten by some people at Christmas does not mean that it's a "Christmas dish." The list is based on a false premise. And as always, <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a> is not a compelling argument for keeping. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:10, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Otto, this is another case among many (the current AfD discussion on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fat_actors.html" title="List of fat actors">List of fat actors</a> is another) where you have insisted that some outside authority or scientific measurement or the like must already have certified clear boundaries for a list. The absence of that kind of authority does not mean a list is indiscriminate, just that cultural lists have different inclusion criteria from, say the list of periodic elements or some category of flora or fauna. We all know that Christmas foods exist. We all should accept that there might be questions about the inclusion of some items on the list. Proper citation can regulate that well enough for our purposes, and if you don't believe that, you should explain why. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:06, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>So far, I haven't seen the people in this AfD debate who are arguing <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> to be applying it <b>as deletion criteria</b> in the way that I understand that policy. See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> for details, especially <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">reasons not to delete</a>. Remember, an article that has X problem should usually be kept, so long as there is adequate reason to believe that X problem can be fixed to bring the article in line with Wikipedia policies. In deletion debates, it is not merely necessary to show that an article has a problem, it is also necessary to show that the problem is likely unfixable. In the case of attributions, the usual solution is either (1) add attributions or (2) tag the uncited material or (3) delete the uncited material. Christmas-oriented cooking is a huge subject, with each nation having its traditions, and dozens of cookbooks coming out each year. There's no particular reason to believe that this article is uncitable, not notable enough to exist, or too poorly defined to exist. All the reasons to delete the article that have been brought up so far are, in my opinion, article quality issues rather than deletion criteria, and could be solved within a few weeks at most if some talk page dialogues are started. Does it ever occur to you to bring up quality issues on the article talk pages before bringing an AfD? It really seems to me as if about three-fourths of your AfD nominations are a result of impatience with article quality, rather than being grounded in a thorough understanding of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> and other policies. I know that policies can be interpreted in different ways by different people, but I do think your interpretation tends to be farther from the norm than usual. I really think it would help all of us if you made more use of <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Cleanup_ae6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup">cleanup tags</a> and talk pages rather than doing what seems to me to be hasty AfDs. AfDs should be a last resort, except on articles that are clearly in risk of violating <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 03:54, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, you've already clearly demonstrated that despite your ability to link to various policies you have no faith in anyone else's ability to read them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 12:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I took another look at <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, and nowhere does it say that simply because an article <b>hasn't</b> had enough sourcing that it therefore <b>must</b> go, and when I go to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> and look at "Problem with page ... [Item:] Can't verify information in article (e.g. article lacks source citations)" I see this under "Solution:" "Look for sources yourself and add citations for them to the article! Ask other editors for sources using the talk page and various citation request templates. If those don't work, come back here. If it is truly unverifiable, it may be deleted." Clearly, going first to AfD with an article problem is discouraged and actually working on an article that you've got quality problems with is encouraged. These quotations can be found under the section called "Problem articles where deletion may not be needed". I have every faith that you have the ability to read that policy and have read it. The question is, what's your reason for not applying it? Not a rhetorical question, but one that deserves a serious response. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:52, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the idea that this can't be sourced is absolutely ludicrous. For most Christmas-related food and drink you have to choose among too many sources. I get the impression "I don't like the subject" is the real argument here, based on what's been said. Deletion discussions should not be popularity contests. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> makes several excellent points. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, the real argument is and continues to be that having sources that say people sometmes eat one food or another on a specific holiday doesn't mean that the food itself is exclusively or even strongly associated with that holiday. Eating something on Christmas doesn't make it a "Christmas dish." I would not argue WP:DONTLIKEIT because I know that it is not a valid reason for deleting an article so I would appreciate it if you would address the actual arguments that I do make and not make stuff up. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:03, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Where to start? Firstly, definition of 'holiday': there isn't one, and many of these are not holidays in any meaningful sense (for example, St David's Day is NOT a holiday in Wales - it's just 1 March). Secondly, much of the information is absolutely wrong (for example, green and red are the 'national colours' of Wales, but St Davod's day is associated with yellow because of daffodils!). Thirdly, some information is downright confusing (e.g. Armistice Day - Nov 11 - is a holiday in some countries, but not in the UK where the poppy is a charity fund-raising symbol associated with the armistice). In addition, hopelessly ethnocentric (read largely USAcentric). <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 14:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've read this article twice now, and for the life of me I can't figure out what it's doing in an encyclopedia. There's an important "Dan Schneider" who's a film producer, and who accounts for the Google hits, but he's not the topic of this article. The Dan Schneider we're talking about here is presented as a writer but has never published a book. Nor has he published much--if anything at all--in the realm of articles or stories. In fact, there's not a single notable thing about him in the banal biography presented here. Even the casual mention of his extremely obscure website in the <i>New York Times</i> is a passing one, hardly qualifying this article as a notable one. Probably it was written by a personal friend of Schneider. I vote to delete it.Professor Ron Hill 15:13, 9 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— Professor Ron Hill (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Professor_Ron_Hill_db23.html" title="Special:Contributions/Professor Ron Hill">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> Almost 20,000 google hits for "Dan Schneider poet." Obviously notable. Of the three Dan Schneiders listed in Wikipedia, the writer is tops in Google: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Dan+Schneider&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Dan+Schneider&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=Dan+Schneider&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official</a></li>

<p>This over a tv star and pro athlete. Wikipedia has articles on many online sites and personalities, and this site is among the most popular online.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Commentary</b>. Hmm. The only vote in support thus far is from an unsigned and anonymous dial-up. I wonder if that vote is from Dan Schneider himself. What he states is inaccurate--most of the hits are for Dan Schneider the film producer or Dan Schneider the athlete. The unpublished poet is hardly more notable than the other two Dan Schneiders. In fact, the confusion among the three is probably what has allowed this vanity article to exist for so long.Professor Ron Hill 15:17, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> -- On the one hand, this doesn't feel encyclopedic enough... but on the other hand, I hesitate to pull the trigger on a page with multiple independent sources.

I'd say he's met that. (And since the page was created by an admin whose created a number of literature-related pages, calling it a "vanity" page is a bit much of a stretch.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Ummm ... "all" you can find is that he runs a website? Then you either didn't read the article or didn't pay attention when you did. The New York Times? NPR? A sister pub of the Village Voice? This article has verifiable sources, and some genuinely significant ones to boot. As far as your screed against Alabamaboy goes, allow me to quote from <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>: "In this scenario, it may be easy to make claims about conflict of interest. Don't do it. The existence of conflicts of interest does not mean that assume good faith is forgotten. Quite the opposite. Remember the basic rule: discuss the article, not the editor." There is nothing about this article showing the use (never mind the abuse) of admin powers to create; any editor could have done it. Presuming sockpuppets have been used to update the article (a huge if), there is nothing in policy prohibiting or even discouraging the same. Possibly there is some reason for this smoke screen, but I can't figure it. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:45, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> The sockpuppet which started this AfD, as well as the anonymous editor who posted personal info about me, is related to a case of cyber stalking, as detailed on my talk page at <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlabamaboy_de21.html#Cyber_stalking_and_harassment" title="User talk:Alabamaboy">User_talk:Alabamaboy#Cyber_stalking_and_harassment</a>. The accusation of me using sock puppets in this article is wrong. And with regards to this article's subject, Dan Schneider is a well-known writer, poet and critic. All of the bio info in this article came from a front-page <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Pages_1ab8.html" title="City Pages">City Pages</a> article, which is how I first learned of him. If needed, I can provide additional references for this bio information, but since they come from that article I thought I'd sufficiently provided them. Because there are several Dan Schneider article on Wikipedia (the writer, an actor/producer, and a baseball player), the best way to google his notability is to google "Cosmoetica," which is Schneider's well-known website and is a unique name. It has 54,000 hits. When that is added to the list of credible media sources that mention Schneider, this article's subject is notable. As a side note, I deleted the personal info this cyber stalker placed about me in this AfD. I specifically asked a member of the Arb Committee if this was permitted and the answer was yes.

<p>This is one of a number of articles I found from the cleanup of the series of articles involving <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_A%26M_University_9617.html" title="Texas A&amp;M University">Texas A&amp;M University</a>. The series is comprehensive, and in a great amount of detail concerning all aspects of the University, whose article is already overlong, overlinked, and overladen with information of relevance only to alumni. As far as this article is concerned, the "school" has only a small intake, and I do not believe the article adequately asserts why this is notable, nor demonstrates that it is indeed notable. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:58, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have GOT to be kidding. There are plenty of books and history to be shared here. While it is good information for alumni, it is also good for current students, prospective students, faculty, friends, family, and anyone else interested in these topics. There is no reason to wholesale delete a page just because you think "there is already enough information." There is also a lot more information that is NOT included in these pages because it is considered trivial, but if someone wants to know more about the yell leaders or muster or the history of gig 'em, what is the harm in putting it down in writing. <a href="../../../b/q/z/User%7EBQZip01_f891.html" title="User:BQZip01">BQZip01</a> 07:31, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The duplication problem can easily be solved by removing it from the artist's page instead, so we should discuss whether this album is notable. According to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> the notability of an album depends on the notability of the artist. As to that, I'm not sure.

<li><b>Delete</b> - This appears to be a lobby group looking for publicty. It doesn't matter if their cause is just or not, just that this isn't what Wikipedia is for. See MGMbill.org and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_MGMbill.org_c52a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MGMbill.org">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MGMbill.org</a> for more discussion on lobby and special interest groups.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I created the page. We definitely aren't "looking for publicity" from Wikipedia, and I can't imagine how this even qualifies as publicity. We are a citizen's group making a significant impact on the state of Alabama. That seemed to be something worth noting in an encyclopedia. It sure matters to the many businesses that will be affected by the outcome, to the tourism industry of AL, and to the many citizens of Alabama who will see hundreds of new beers become available. --Danner Kline</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - Please see the discussion about the other lobby group who were trying to make a significant impact on the entire United States. Their topic sure matters to just under half of current population, as well as doctors and religious leaders. The importance of your cause is not the issue. The importance of your group is. Please see that discussion. --<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalter_G%C3%B6rlitz_3e2a.html" title="User:Walter Görlitz">Walter Görlitz</a> 21:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Many other non-profit organizations are described in Wikipedia articles. For example, when I want to find out information about the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Cancer_Society_165c.html" title="American Cancer Society">American Cancer Society</a>, I know I can go to Wikipedia to get information. Similarly, <a href="../../../n/o/r/NORML_b5f7.html" title="NORML">NORML</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parent-Teacher_Association_e7fc.html" title="Parent-Teacher Association">Parent-Teacher Association</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Coalition_for_Reproductive_Choice_f278.html" title="Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice">Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_We_Stand_America_6c08.html" title="United We Stand America">United We Stand America</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_American_Suffrage_Association_9999.html" title="National American Suffrage Association">National American Suffrage Association</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_b228.html" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/g/Raging_Grannies_2860.html" title="Raging Grannies">Raging Grannies</a>, etc., etc. etc. There are hundreds if not thousands of pages on Wikipedia that provide information about organizations around the world. I guess Walter could say these groups are just looking for publicity also, but I hope reasonable people will know better. There is a big difference between an article that provides factual information about an organization vs. a page that is nothing more than lobbying in an of itself. If the article at issue contains lobbying, that can be edited. But don't delete an informative article about the origin and activities of an organization just because the organization engages in advocacy. Review the discussion archives on Walter's profile page, and you'll see he's been a little too aggressive with his deletion activism in the past. Apparently, he's still at it. --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanjolawyer_442a.html" title="User:Banjolawyer">Banjolawyer</a> 19:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Not to mention <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mothers_Against_Drunk_Driving_bdf6.html" title="Mothers Against Drunk Driving">Mothers Against Drunk Driving</a>. There's a lobby group trying to tighten alcohol laws. We are a group trying to repeal prohibition-era alcohol laws. Activities of a similar but opposite nature. They are national; we are limited to one state. Nevertheless, I fail to see how any argument made for deletion of our entry should not also be applied to MADD's entry. -- Danner Kline 20:15, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - There are differences between these notable NPOs and the one under discussion. Again.

<dd>The information herein was originally included in the main L&amp;B article, but that got too big, so I was looking at ways to split the article up. This item is (as far as I know) used entirely as a transclusion item to link articles related to the historic railway (locomotives (such as TAW mentioned above), locations (Woody Bay), structures (Chelfham Viaduct), incidents (Braunton Road railway accident) etc.) with the modern heritage/restoration activities. If, as you suggest, this were moved to Wikisource, could it still be transcluded? regards, <a href="../../../l/y/n/User%7ELynbarn_2dff.html" title="User:Lynbarn">Lynbarn</a> 10:42, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> No, but do you really need this whole page on every article that has anything to do with this railroad?

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is extremely confusing, and I am <i>still</i> finding it difficult to determine precisely what "Perhance it is not dead but sleepeth" <i>is</i>. The best I can come up with is that it was a quote uttered by an admirer of the railroad after it was shut down? I hardly see how a quote of this nature has any value as an encyclopedia article. Is it the name of a monument or memorial? If so it might be keepable with some more cleanup and sourcing, but even then I think the best bet would be to merge it back in to a parent article. If anyone with better parsing skills than myself cares to clarify what this is talking about, let me know. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 21:05, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you have grasped the message quite well, the quote is from an admirer, and although not spoken, was written (on the card shown inn the illustration} after the line closed. The heritage railway now being restored and rebuilt is in part a monument and memorial to the vision and hopes Capt. Wolf expressed, and his words became the inspiration for the restoration project.

<li><b>Merge</b> back to the original article, this statement/motto has no notability of its own.

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Bhopali Bakar" seems to be a neologism -- I've never heard the term (I've lived in Bhopal for ten years, and Google doesn't know it either -- it returns Wikipedia and mirrors). Some people use the word "Bhopali" to refer to the Hindi accent of <a href="../../../s/o/o/Soorma_Bhopali_01a7.html" title="Soorma Bhopali">Soorma Bhopali</a> (of <a href="../../../s/h/o/Sholay.html" title="Sholay">Sholay</a> fame). But it seems that in academic/linguistic circles, Bhopali isn't considered a separate dialect or language. In the 1962 census, merely 10 persons gave "Bhopali" as their mother tongue<a href="http://www.languageinindia.com/aug2002/indianmothertongues1961aug2002.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.languageinindia.com/aug2002/indianmothertongues1961aug2002.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. The only other reliable source where I could find Bhopali being mentioned as a dialect is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521299446&amp;id=Itp2twGR6tsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA424&amp;lpg=RA1-PA424&amp;vq=bhopali&amp;sig=Gl3ShqixVcuNHT_PnDByXDxh5c4" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521299446&amp;id=Itp2twGR6tsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA424&amp;lpg=RA1-PA424&amp;vq=bhopali&amp;sig=Gl3ShqixVcuNHT_PnDByXDxh5c4" rel="nofollow">a book</a> by <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Masica_3151.html" title="Colin Masica">Colin Masica</a>. But, Masica uses the term "Bhopali" as another name for <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malvi_language.html" title="Malvi language">Malvi</a>, and not what this article talks about.

<dd>"Bakar" is definitely something one does not relate to, but Bhopali Hindi and the difference that it has to mainstream Hindi is something every resident of Bhopal would notice. Do not let a bad name cause the article to be deleted. The name can be changed. And Bakar seems odd, but actually refers to "BakarCh*di"- a term very much used in Bhopal, but not polite enough to mention ( and should not be put in the title).<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 12:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article on Bhopali Hindi needs to be developed on the lines of the one on <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bambaiya_Hindi_2287.html" title="Bambaiya Hindi">Bambaiya Hindi</a>. The reason why Bhopali has no references is because it has not caught attention of anyone in or outside Bhopal to do a research. It has been in existence for decades now and is no neologism or one man's brainchild. Utcursch must have stayed in the new parts of Bhopal, hence has no idea about the dialect. This dialect has touch of Nawabi sophistication in it, which has turned more comical due to the witty nature of Bhopalis. The article needs better material and examples and a few references, if possible, more than anything else. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChintu_rohit_e455.html" title="User:Chintu rohit">Chintu rohit</a> 09:01, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>delete</b> - At one point in the recent past there were 60+ wikipedia links to the Meyer site, which is primarily a commercial site pure and simple (Meyer's own press release states this). Some links, such as the ones to commercial cellular automata software and the links to commercial prime number software, have been deleted multiple times from wikipedia. A non-notable self-published masters thesis on the site was linked to from three different wikipedia physics articles, in addition to being self-listed on dmoz multiple times. The site also has potential copyright issues - I have been unable to find a statement that any of the articles on the Meyer site written by others are published with the original author's permission. The 60+ former links to the site squandered any benefit of the doubt I might have once had about the author or his site. 4.246.200.154 05:41, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Let me ask a simple question. How can I, someone who's totally clueless about food service industry jargon, tell if the term is something that's actually used in the food service industry, or if it's something an editor just made up? If the article doesn't give me enough information for a totally clueless person like myself to be able to tell, the <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">attribution</a> policy requires a <b>Delete</b>. Also, right now the only thing in the article is a definition (See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICTIONARY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DICTIONARY</a>). Minimum requirements for a keep vote include an explanation of why the topic is something <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">reliable sources</a> describing the term and explaining why it's of interest.

<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Every article has to start off with an attributed definition of terms? Does the first line always need an inline link to a definition from Dictionary.com? As fore, I still think this stub should be merged back into its original article, <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_of_House_0993.html" title="Front of House">Front of House</a>, which also doesn't have any attribution (and nor does <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foodservice.html" title="Foodservice">Foodservice</a>).

<p>Another non-notable student organization. The best this article claims about the subject in terms of notability is its being a large club at New South Wales University.

<dd>You can't do that either - the Student Guild I assume ran the Clubs and Societies program, but it encompassed far more than that.

<li><b>Keep</b> Can this AfD debate be closed and listed properly as a 2nd nomination where the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_New_South_Wales_University_Theatrical_Society_a220.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/New South Wales University Theatrical Society">1st nomination</a> result was <b>keep?</b> I don't see new information here that suggests the first result should be overturned, certainly not in favour of a deletion.

<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> or <b>merge</b> - persistent re-nomination for deletion isn't nice, per Greatwalk. Unfortunately, the article University of New South Wales student clubs and associations does not exist as a merge target - are we instead referring to a subsection within the university article? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 19:03, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school article. The club is not all that old and the article, other then the list of productions does not have much content.

<p>God appears in far too many places in fiction (especially as an idea rather than a character) for it to be a good idea to try to list them all. Most of the material here is questionable; for instance, God doesn't really appear in The Chronicles of Narnia (which isn't a film anyway), Bedazzled, and certainly not in The Matrix... God does appear in some of the other movies as a brief reference, and I'm sure the list is grossly incomplete and always will be. Fundamentally, this is a similar article to <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depictions_of_God_in_popular_culture_7468.html" title="Depictions of God in popular culture">Depictions of God in popular culture</a> which I've also put up for deletion. The difference is that this one has slightly less crufty trivia, NO pretentions of attempting to create an article, and is a bad premise for a list. God is a major theme in western literature: for this reason it's essential to write about that as a general trend, but a very bad idea to list all the times God appears. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:18, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: The list says it has to be a physical or mental (i.e. voiceover) manifestation of God. So it's not possible for an editor to claim that God is everywhere and add every movie to this list. The list states its discriminating criteria at the top of the article, and as such, it's not actually a very long or incomplete list. If the list was about the idea of God, or God as a metaphor, or themes about God, then I'd probably agree with the deletion. But as is, it's a much narrower topic than that. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 16:55, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as indiscriminate and ill-defined.

<li><b>Keep</b> seems to be more than a list.

<li>Just so people know, The Bible used to be on the list, but was removed. Per the talk page, it's controversial to consider the Bible fiction, although obviously some people do. But it does open up another difficulty: why can we include The Ten Commandments (the movie) which is an adaptation of a bible story -- how can it be fictional if the Bible isn't? And if we include all biblical adaptations...

<p>If you search google for for the game you will not be able to find many reviews for the game. If someone external to the game has written a review that isnt on the internet, nor does a page come up in the search, the wiki-page cannot exist? In america it may well have been printed in a local paper, but i cannot provide such a reference for i do not live in the U.S. .Kangphil</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - As far as I can tell, the game has not had 18000 players unless every hit to the page is a unique player. I'm sorry, but 18K hits over the past 4 years equates to only a dozen hits a day. As it stands now, there could be 12 people who go online everyday. I'd also like to point out that the site is <i>declining</i> in popularity relative to other sites (based on the fact that its rank has dropped about a million in the last few months). I would like to remind Kangphil that it is advisable for a page's author to identify themself when participating in an AfD discussion. I understand the frustration of losing an article that you've put a significant amount of time into, but I would encourage you to focus your enthusiasm towards a more notable topic. <a href="../../../-/b/o/User_talk%7E-Bobby_2c83.html" title="User talk:-Bobby">→</a><a href="../../../-/b/o/User%7E-Bobby_56ae.html" title="User:-Bobby"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Bobby_0e62.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Bobby">←</a> 16:13, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> After discussion with Kangphil, I decided to have a quick look for sources myself; the nearest I could find was a brief review <a href="http://pc.gamezone.com/gamesell/p22800.htm" class="external text" title="http://pc.gamezone.com/gamesell/p22800.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but I don't know how reliable pc.gamezone.com is. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 16:10, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment/Question</b> - Gamezone is a fairly large vg review and info site. However, if I recall correctly, they allow user submitted game reviews. I can't look at the link you posted through my company's filters, but could you determine who wrote the article? <a href="../../../-/b/o/User_talk%7E-Bobby_2c83.html" title="User talk:-Bobby">→</a><a href="../../../-/b/o/User%7E-Bobby_56ae.html" title="User:-Bobby"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Bobby_0e62.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Bobby">←</a> 16:16, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as NN.

<p><b>Comment</b> I have contacted someone to see if they are willing to try the game and review it, they are from the website mentioned earlier. Kangphil 18:59, 9 March 2007 (GMT)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hrm. You mean the site <i>claims</i> to have 8,000+ (<i>not</i> 18,000) accounts. I was hoping for independent verification myself. Beyond that, getting someone from a website to review a game doesn't count for much. Please review the criteria from <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and let us know which elements of that your site meets. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:37, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

I am renominating because that nomination was confused partly by nominating Shields Pictures along with some of their film series which <i>are</i> notable (but the articles were closely based on copyrighted material, and so were deleted by me as copyvios). As far as I can tell, Shields Pictures didn't have any role in <i>producing</i> these notable film clips, they just own them now and license them to others.

<p>This is Mark Punswick, President and owner of Shields Pictures. The person who posted this entry (as well as entries for our 3 historic Paramount series "Popular Science," "Unusual Occupations" and "Speaking of Animals" - all of which have been deleted according to what I've been told) contacted me and asked me to post a statement. I'm doing this purely as a courtesy to them as apparently they invested quite a bit of time and effort in listing information about us and our series on Wikipedia. For the uninitiated our film library holdings document important and historic personalities and events of the 20th Century. Our collections contain the earliest known film footage of Dr. Seuss, the earliest known color film on Philo T. Farnsworth, the Building of the Mount Palomar Space Telescope, the Building of Boulder/Hoover Dam, the Building of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, the only known film footage of Paul Garber - founder of the Smithsonian Institute's Air and Space Museum, Frank Lloyd Wright, and on and on. We have a standing policy with academic institutions, researchers and archives in that we make selections available for viewing at no cost (we pay for transfer and shipping) which sets us apart from companies such as the Getty and Corbis (I just checked and both purely commercial enterprises have fairly substantial listings on Wikipedia so I fail to see what the issues are here). We also make 35mm film prints available for archival screenings all across the country and at no charge (we archive our film print masters with the UCLA FILM and Television Archives and sometimes they charge a small fulfillment fee but we never do). Content Listings for the series had apparently been posted (which is fine by me - this information is also available from the Library of Congress and the New York State Archives albeit not as easily searchable) and were subsequently deleted by Wikipedia editors. In perusing prior postings, deletions and comments I was quite dismayed to see statements posted by Wikipedia editors referring to the Academy Awards as a "popularity contest" and was a bit taken aback by the aforementioned comment referring to our holdings as rubbish. I have done was what was requested of me and now leave it to you fine folks to determine the outcome. If someone has a legitimate comment, question or request (no rants please) they can contact me at &lt;redacted for spam protection&gt;.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not really sure what Wikipedia's policy on news personalities is. Personally, I don't think every local news anchor should get a page. However, I'd like to see some other ideas before making a decision. I will point out that if we are going to delete Ms. Ryan's article, we also need to delete all the other personalities from <a href="../../../w/f/t/WFTS-TV_3f87.html#News_Personalities" title="WFTS-TV">WFTS-TV</a>. None of the individual's have anything more than a stub.

<dd>He is not "well known". He certainly is not one of "the few" who have published on Jewish "meditation and mysticism" or in the areas of "meditation and reincarnation". He is a <b>self published</b> vanity author, who has never had a book reviewed by a major publication. He apparently created this article and spammed references to himself all around wikipedia to drum up publicity for himself. He is the very definition of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and has no <b>non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject</b>, let alone multiple references.

<dd>Actually you are incorrect. Aronson publish real books but are also a vanity publisher. Meaning they will publish almost anything as long as you pay them. Give them a call and ask them - I happen to be well aware of the situation there. Not that that would make any difference - there are still no non-trivial published works with Pinson as a subject way which are notable in any and he has very low ghits. There are many more notable than him Goldie Milgram, Ariel Bar Zadok, Akiva Belk, Akiva Tatz, Joanne Gerber and the list goes on. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">David Spart</a> 11:28, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the books are vanity, and the "reviews" are all in non-notable publications and are mostly not about his books especially. There are no non-trivial external sources about this individual, merely two or three fleeting references to his work (one by a friend) and a review in a non-notable web journal. "Ascent to Safed" said that he is "reliable and authoritative", that just about says it all. You choose to delete Sokolovsky a few weeks ago because he is against your POV despite being notable, but want an article on a genuine nobody because he conforms to your own POV despite having no notability whatsoever. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">David Spart</a> 12:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b> - the seconadry sources cited in fact do not make him notable. The citations at ZEEK/ Forward are using him as a safe whipping post to say what they dont like about current Haredi books seeking to present Judiasm in a hip way. They show just the oppsoite of notability. They show that he is a small enough person that a reviewer can trash him and not worry about reprisal. The article from Brown is in a STUDENT journal of Brown U. is just that, a student journal. We dont included every rock band, visiting rabbi, or hillel director who gets cited in a student article. The books do indeed seem vanity and it looks like several of his works have not even appeared. He uses of conflict of interest words and peacock words in his own self promotion, these words of promotion are then compied into the articles by and about him is equally a sign of NN. He may be a nice guy, a smart guy, and he may give many lectures, but he is less than Steve Burg - head of NCSY - whom we decided to delete. He is also less than several of the names mentioned above.

I also didn't like seeing the Steve Burg article deleted, as I think being the head of <a href="../../../n/c/s/NCSY_4e8b.html" title="NCSY">NCSY</a> is notable, but I tried and was unable to find any secondary sources about him, unlike in this case. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 20:52, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The article in the Forward was by the editor of Zeek, hence the articles are quite related. Unfortunatly, this is a case where a speedly delete might have been kinder and more efficient, so that two weeks later someone could start a normal modest article about the guy. The creators of the original article called him "the greatest modern Jewish philosopher" and compared him to Luria. Not a good way to start a modest article of a minor person. Maybe he does deserve an article but this case seems to be working backwards from COI and megalomaniac Peacock words to establishing even minor notability. Even now, I find it offputing that the article calls Pinson, someone who only gives a few adult ed classes, a "rosh yeshiva." --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">Jayrav</a> 21:07, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

Whatever peacock words the original author of this article used really doesn't matter as that's easy enough to remedy. Anyway, do whatever, I'm getting frustrated and exhausted wasting time and effort when so much of editing at WP seems to center around people's private beefs and personal quarrels with other editors rather than reasonableness (this is not directed at you particularly, just a general sense I'm getting on these afds, which means time for a break for me). --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 21:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Definitely controversial subject, deletion reeks of censorship. There are plenty of sources that could be included. There are other ways of dealing with controversial subjects on Wikipedia than deleting them. This is one subject that has had a great impact on society apart from sexism.--Parsleyjones 17:51, 9 March 2007
<ul>
<li>"Deletion" does not "reek of censorship" since nobody is proposing we delete the articles of all the researchers and their work. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 00:56, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Censorship doesn't mean removing something completely; women's breasts are censored on TV, but there are still billions of them out there. To simply declare that the subject is a subheading of sexism is to declare a POV, and to prevent the subject from being addressed fairly. Is Wikipedia going to officially state that sex has no bearing on intelligence, and throw all research that might not support that under the heading of sexism?--Parsleyjones 23:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Individuals like us can never write a good non-bias article on something like this.

<ul>
<li>An article like this needs expert attention, which most wikipedians don't have. There is no point of quibbing over this article when most of its points can be well covered in the biographies of researchers on the matter, like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Lynn_a2a6.html" title="Richard Lynn">Richard Lynn</a> etc. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 00:56, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm afraid I must disagree, since there is a wide gulf between what a researcher produces and the subject itself. Especially when there's more than one researcher. Besides, content disputes are not grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:24, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But there shouldn't be a big gulf between what a researcher says and what we report. Hence, it is perfectly fine. "content disputes are not grounds for deletion" No idea what that was suppose to mean or prove. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 05:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree, if a notable researcher says something, it would behoove Wikipedia to include that information. I don't see this as a real problem with Wikipedia, given that many times information is added within moments of being reported. Some people actually have trouble with that, thinking it's too quick. However, I don't think you understood my comment. Wikipedia is not a collection of sources of research, like say Nexis-Lexis, but rather a compilation of information. As such, the subject of an article is independent of the researchers. This is true for every subject, whether it be <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_and_intelligence.html" title="Sex and intelligence">Sex and intelligence</a> or <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrophysics.html" title="Astrophysics">astrophysics</a>. People don't look for the researcher, they look for the subject. What you're talking about would be a different thing than an encyclopedia, or at least, fundamentally change the nature of Wikipedia. So, that's something too large to discuss here. But anyway, content disputes are not grounds for deletion means exactly what it means. If there is a dispute as to the actual content of a page (as compared to disagreement over whether the subject of a page is encyclopedic or not), then the proper form to resolve those disputes is not through the deletion of an article. Perhaps you need to review the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policyand</a> the <a href="../../../g/d/_/WP%7EGD_ec47.html" title="WP:GD">guide to deletion</a> so you can understand the difference better. You might also wish to review the AFD of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Daniel_Brandt_%2813th_nomination%29_9a9c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Brandt (13th nomination)">Daniel Brandt</a> article, to see some responses as to why the mere trouble of editing an article is not convincing as grounds to delete. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no potential bias or original research interpretation of sources available in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrophysics.html" title="Astrophysics">astrophysics</a> as there is in <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_and_intelligence.html" title="Sex and intelligence">sex and intelligence</a>. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 18:01, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Potential for bias is not a reason to delete, otherwise we'd have no articles on anything related to sex, sexuality, politics, religion, Israel-Palestine, Iraq, the United States, Iran, North Korea, Turkey, the EU, ...

<li>Isn't there someone famous here who runs on the premise "no article is better than a bad article"? I'm actually well-read on Sex and Intelligence and Race and Intelligence and I know very well that although both articles do report plenty of facts, many of these facts are being misrepresented and morphed (on both sides). I don't consider myself an expert but I do think we need an expert to fix these articles up if we're gonna keep them. No one wishes to step forward so I see delete as the only option. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 20:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Are gender and sex the same thing? They say gender is a social construct, and it seems to me the question of sex and intelligence is asking a biological question.--Parsleyjones 23:42, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong, strong Keep</b>. An encyclopedic topic that has been the subject of (semi-)scientific inquiry for well over a century. Though much of the initial (i.e., 19th century) research was based in sexism, it is inappropriate to label more recent research on the subject as such. Also, <b>do not move</b> to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_and_intelligence.html" title="Gender and intelligence">gender and intelligence</a>. Gender is a semi-flexible social construction, sex is a biological characteristic; research on this subject has (almost) <i>always</i> been about the latter. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:08, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Do Not Rename</b>. The nomination asks if this material would be better merged, and yet this is a deletion discussion not a merge discussion. The size of the sourced content is large enough to force any article it would merge into into "verylong" status. So I cannot agree with the nominator's reasons for deletion. Usedup suggests that an article like this can't be written without bias, but the article lacks a current bias tag, and appears to contain a fairly reasonable dose of sourced information. Moreover, as someone who has done work on equally charged issues elsewhere in Wikipedia (the current debate over the Pope's past in the Hitler Youth comes to mind), I don't find that argument plausible either. As these two arguments for deletion are trivially rebutted, and I see no other reason to suggest deletion, I'm forced to "keep." As far as the rename--"gender" and "sex" are different things, the research listed deals with sex, not gender, so the rename would be inappropriate, thus "do not rename". --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Decker_f7b7.html" title="User:Joe Decker">Joe Decker</a> 02:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, I don't understand how gender and sex are such different things, could you explain why? And can you offer some suggestions to fix the ambiguity in the title? I understand this article was moved from <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_and_intelligence.html" title="Gender and intelligence">Gender and intelligence</a>, but I don't see that the new title is an improvement. After all, sex is also the act of intercourse, and I could imagine some coverage of that subject. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:11, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure, glad to! A good description can be found here: <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Sociology/Gender" class="external free" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Sociology/Gender" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Sociology/Gender</a>. Now, word definitions are more complex than that article describes, if you look at Merriam-Webster it will tell you that "sex" can both mean intercourse and male/female, and that gender can mean what I'm saying or "sex". But when the two terms are used near each other in a compare/contrast way, the breakdown is typically the way that Intro. to Sociology text describes. (And I don't have a third alternative that's less ambiguous, if I did I'd be very open to using it.) Given that both words are ambiguous, I kinda go with "sex", not because it's titillating, but because (a) I think it's what's used in the literature, and because (b) it's unlikely that someone reading the full article will think that the subject refers to relationships of intercourse and sexuality, but might well be confused as to whether the article discusses relationships of sexuality and physical characteristics, or relationships of sexuality and social constructs. Anyway, hope I didn't overexplain this. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Decker_f7b7.html" title="User:Joe Decker">Joe Decker</a> 03:48, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I don't think your explanation is overly much, I just don't feel convinced by it. I'm aware of this technical distinction, I looked at the subject when somebody first objected to the alternate name I proposed. It didn't convince me, as while that may be the usage in that field, the problem with the ambiguity itself comes from an entirely different source, and that problem doesn't exist in the common vernacular with say <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_and_intelligence.html" title="Gender and intelligence">Gender and intelligence</a>. Ah well, I think it's a problem, but it's not one that's causing problems right now or violates NPOV. It's just a question of clarity. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:34, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Don't move it to sexism because sexism has a negative connotation, and this topic need not be negative or positive, but objectective as a scientific article representing facts and not opinions. Sexism is very arbitrary and subjective as a topic, and if we were to combine intelligence with sexism we would be changing the tone of the article from scientific to non-scientific. The non-scientific should stay in sexism. The idea of changing the name to Gender and Intelligence is not good because, as someone else already mentioned, Gender is a social construct in which a person of male sex could have "female" gender. This is not good because once again it would change the tone of the article to nonscientific. 71.207.94.117 22:34, 12 March 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScifiintel_126b.html" title="User:Scifiintel">Scifiintel</a> 22:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC) I wrote this but forgot to sign in.</li>

His father is <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Barrymore_Halpenny_6595.html" title="Bruce Barrymore Halpenny">Bruce Barrymore Halpenny</a>, his mother Marian Rose Halpenny, so it stands that he will be in the right environment for the arts in one form or another. All so eager to delete, just because you cannot find him on the internet? Why not check the newspapers or magazines like I did, some of which are listed on his article. I would also like to point out that he has not paid me nor do I know him personally, and I will take extreme offence if this is in anyway implied. Self projection, really I ask you?!</li>

<li><b>Comment!</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting topic and am suprised he is being considered for deletion, but then, that is just my view. I can confirm that Baron Barrymore Halpenny is the son of Bruce Barrymore Halpenny. What has not been said here, or anywhere else for that matter, is that Mr Halpenny’s son, Baron, illustrates many pictures in his fathers books, he also has designed many book covers, including the Ghost Stations series that his father wrote. So when you are looking at a book cover, you may be looking at Baron Halpenny’s work, whether you regard that as notable, I really can’t say, though I personally would have thought it was and certainly from who his father is. I cannot comment on any of his cartoons in newspapers or magazines as I have not seen them, but his work that I have seen in his fathers books are exceptionally good and of a high standard. That is as much as I can offer in this discussion, as it is Mr Halpenny’s historical work, especially airfield histories, that I am more interested in and most of his books I have.</p>

<p>To top it all, at long last I have had a reply from the artist, who has had a look at the Wikipedia. It was a nice email, but alas, well I’ve pasted some of what he says</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Thank you for your email and as I do warn, I am busy so don't get much time for emails etc. I’ve had a look at this wikipedia, and I have to admit, I had not heard of it before, but then my Internet involves my Websites, Yahoo, Hotmail and Google. I find the Internet takes up too much time and I’m not much of a fan of it.
<p>However, I am amazed at seeing so much information about myself, and they have certainly been very busy, but then much can be found from the newspapers and my own Website along with where my Work appears. I see that there is a discussion to delete this and (I’m sorry if this may upset you) I really don't mind if they do. You see if I want someone to know about me, I would much rather they come to my Website … that is why I had them done for me.</p>
<p>My websites are part portfolios for such as publishers and agencies and my baronhalpenny.com site is for people who buy or are interested in my paintings.</p>
<p>In your discussion I note some very snide remarks (another reason why I like to keep things contained onto my websites only), one remark is, "Wow, he's just done it all. And so young", this I think was meant to be a catty remark, though I like the young bit ... I have done much, but not it all. I did do the Isle of Man DC-3 first day cover when I was 14 (not 15 as stated) and I was on the front page of the regional paper for this. I am also proud of creating Shaftism and love doing Cartoons and Illustrations.</p>
<p>I do however like the article of my father, he has done a lot and much, much more than has been put there, and should be acknowledged for his Work, much of it pioneering. His own personal military history would fill several sections of that website.</p>
<p>Anyway, once again thank you for e-mailing me, and my advice is not to get too wrapped up in the Internet. It’s always good to get a reality check. When I am abroad and especially in Italy I often visit the local War Cemeteries as a mark of respect. They made the supreme sacrifice for us to be here today and should never be forgotten. Seeing the graves row after row, helps to put things in perspective.</p>

<p>He does say more more, but is merely thanking me politely and asking my opinions and thoughts on the paintings I saw of his in Italy. It's like I've gone to all this trouble on Wikipedia for nothing. So I leave it to you! He would like it removed! But even so, I still feel he is notable and people will look him up, so should we make it an artist stub? This way it can be expanded at any future date. At least salvage something from my work! I have to say he is a very nice young man, it's just a pity he doesn't want to be in the Wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I'm the one who made the "Wow, he's just done it all. And so young" comment above, and I do apologize for the sarcasm. When I made that comment it was with the belief that the subject himself had written this article. I'm getting tired of self-promotional articles and I responded as such. It's clear that the subject did not write the article and it's also clear that the author(s) are sincere. I still feel the artist has not reached notability at this point, and the standards of wikipedia maintain that independent sources are important for establishing notability. Wikipedia isn't meant to be a directory, nor an extension of a personal website. However, I don't think this was the intent of the authors. The artist may be notable some day. As for other artists with less notability, this may be because no one has stumbled those articles yet. Wikipedia is huge. But I would be interested in someone passing along the names of those articles to my talk page. I do believe in standards for wikipedia, and although it is very subjective on what is and isn't notable, some basic rules can be established. (That's why there's no article on me!). As for reducing the article to a stub that is built up as the artist establishes more notability, I'd have no problem with that. If the subject wants the article deleted outright, an administrator can do that, and it can be protected so google searches won't find negative terms associated with the artist (correct me if I'm wrong about that one). Also, if an administrator wishes to delete my first comment, I wouldn't object. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 14:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Artist Stub</b> I will try to make this article an Artists Stub, if this is okay? If anyone here would like to help me please? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> is agreeable to this and I hope others are as well. I do do it reluctantly I might add, but at this moment in time I think this might be the best solution. The more notable the artist becomes, remember I started the article. You may all thank me later.</li>
</ul>
<p>James Dunston has pointed out that the artist has created several book covers and even if these are for his father’s books, this is merely a collaboration. The publishers wouldn’t have used the artwork if it were not any good. Let’s face it, the family are talented and obviously work together. If Baron Barrymore Halpenny created the covers for the Ghost Stations series that would be 8 books he has designed and if you go to Amazon.co.uk, you will see it has a good following and are popular books. But of course, as the book cover illustrator he will not be mentioned on Amazon or the web. How many book cover artists are mentioned?</p>
<p>I have asked James Dunston to provide a list of the books that he knows the Artist has worked on, seeing as he has Bruce Barrymore Halpenny’s books. One point I would like to raise is that someone has put “James Dunston (talk • contribs) has made few or no other edits outside this topic.” Next to his name. This “topic” is about Baron Barrymore Halpenny and James Dunston has made it clear that he is interested in Bruce Barrymore Halpenny’s historical work, especially airfield histories. That is a different topic to this one.</p>
<p>I still say Baron Barrymore Halpenny is notable and you cannot deny what he has done and is continuing to do. Even if he himself does not wish to be listed (he didn’t say not to, just that he wouldn’t mind if he wasn’t and NawlinWiki says The wishes of the subject of an article are usually not controlling.), his achievements and continued achievements warrants him a place in the Wikipedia, for people will look him up and it is the responsibility of a credible encyclopaedia to be useful and informative with credible information available to the user. My father always told me you have to list with an open mind and not be swayed by opinions.</p>

<li>The problem is that what you are looking at is a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">dictionary definition</a> and it is against Wikipedia policy to have articles that are nothing more than a definition of a term.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> as an indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture any appearance of anything that in the unattributable opinion of any random editor looks like it might possibly be similar in shape to a swastika, with no regard to the importance or triviality of the appearance in the fiction from which it's drawn or the real world. The arguments in favor of keeping it were largely centered around the notion that it was better to have this trivia in its own article than have it fouling the featured article <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swastika.html" title="Swastika">Swastika</a>, which argument is <a href="../../../b/h/t/WP%7EBHTT_103f.html" title="WP:BHTT">not compelling</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not a separate concept which can be independently researched or discussed. There is nothing you can say <i>about</i> the topic of swastikas in popular culture except what's already in the main article. It's a fundamentally unfinishable and unmaintainable list. The primary reason given for the creation of the page (and in the article's defense in the prior discussions) was to keep the junk from overwhelming the primary article. Hiding the problem on a separate page does not solve the problem or somehow make bad content better. A few examples are appropriate in the main article. Attempting to create comprehensive lists are not. Encyclopedias are not concordances. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 01:11, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clean up</b> I agree that the article looks similar to what Crosses in popular culture would look like but I don't think it is beyond repair. If the list was organized by types of uses instead of the media it appeared in it could have some value. For example, if there was a section on "accidental swastikas" that had no intended meaning at all but people got worked up over is encyclopedic especially if the company later removed it. There are also many "misunderstood swastikas" which the author intended a manji meaning, listing them also has value. Many of the others on the list which are simply a reference to nazism should be removed ("In American History X, lead character Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a white supremacist, has a swastika tattooed on his chest.") <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> 10:57, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Jon513, I think if this article has any hope for survival it will need to be cleaned up right away, in the next few days, before the AfD closes. As it stands there seems to be little support to keep it. A serious attempt to clean it up now would give it a chance of survival, because even if the closing admin deletes it, it could be put up for review and restored, based on the fact it had been cleaned up late in the AfD process, after most of the votes had been cast. But if no one cleans it up before the AfD closes, it will be too late. How long would it take to clean up? -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 19:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

However, I think that unless someone actually makes this an article and nukes the list of trivia by the time this AfD ends, we've given it enough time as a <a href="../../../22/i/n/Wikipedia%7E_In_popular_culture__articles_a4c6.html" title="Wikipedia:&quot;In popular culture&quot; articles">trivia article</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:38, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> A trivial piece of malicious gossip. No way is this encyclopaedic.

<li><b>Delete</b> as the original AfD and DRV nominator. From my prior statement: "This article unnecessarily publicizes embarrassing events in the life of an otherwise unknown living person. As noted in the article itself, the Internet publicity given to these events has seriously damaged this individual's life and we should not knowingly participate in further doing so. The page, although created and edited in good faith, is the functional equivalent of an attack page against a non-notable person. See my comments at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Doc_glasgow_7bc7.html#Outside_view_by_Newyorkbrad" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Doc glasgow">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Doc glasgow#Outside view by Newyorkbrad</a>, and other participants' comments in that RfC, as well as recent threads on the notability policy pages for related discussion. In addition, it has been noted that this article's reports of unproven allegations raise WP:LIVING issues, and also that the proposed NOTNEWS guideline would also strongly support deletion. The "do no harm" test underlying WP:LIVING as applied to a non-notable person strongly supports deletion of this article, whose encyclopedic value is slight, as a matter of principle. It would be desirable for the community to have the opportunity to address this set of issues in a situation that is not wiki-notorious a la Brian Peppers and Daniel Brandt." <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 19:18, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per NYB sometimes we need to rise above the tendency to source count (and the sources here are bad anyway - and article which uses 'alleged' and 'claimed' as often as this one does should be speedy deleted anyway). With the powerful medium we are comes some responsibilities - the fact is that we don't need this trivial rubbish, and we are a better encyclopedia without it.

<li><b>Delete</b> WP:NOT vigilante justice. This is the sort of material which circulates in a tabloid for a week then ends up in the bottom of the bird cage.. where it belongs because it's just not encyclopedic. Maybe if people are still talking about it years from now it will be worth documenting, but it's a violation of our duty to make a determination of notability which may ultimately be self-fulfilling. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 21:41, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> once again. This is not encyclopedic, it's just a continuation of unfounded harrassment based on an unproven claim against a living person.

<li><b>Rename</b> (possibly to Laptop Guy?) - the article needs a new name, certainly, but has notability via mention in several daily newspapers. I recall hearing about this back when it was still fresh, and I'm hardly a blogoholic. NPOV here is tricky, as to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Tofangsazan has not gone on the "official" record with his version of events, and I beleive it prudent to keep in mind that <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> was never convicted of any crime, either.

The sources from the Google News Archive are mostly from the same week, and the ones which come later are one- or two- paragraph mentions which use it as a hook for articles whose main focus is digital privacy. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a> requires multiple-paragraph coverage in distinct articles spanning multiple weeks.

The question remaining is whether those concerns are outweighed by other considerations. In this case, I do not consider them to justify the continuation of this page. It is a hostile page written about a person who is at best semi-public and who has not apparently taken any steps to put himself into the public eye. This is a trivial little spat that got some column-inches on a slow newsday. Wikipedia is not WikiNews. The argument that we have to keep it because "it's an internet meme" also utterly fails to convince me.

Even in the absence of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a>, common sense indicates that we are not a directory of news stories, and if we have to cut off minor news stories this is a good place to start. The argument that the sources focus on the event, not the person, is also a good argument for not having an article <i>at this title.</i> Having said this, if this event happens to be discussed in an article describing its historical significance (if there is any), its significance to the study of Internet memes, etc., I don't think I would object to including the information in those kinds of contexts. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 00:58, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Full professors at research Universities are N, having gotten there by rigourous peer-review, but Chitoise University was established only in 1998, and therefore probably does not yet count as a major research university. (as distinct from Hokkaido University, which is a notable research university of very high quality). Therefore it would depend on his publications. He has 44 peer-reviewed publications, according to Science citation Index, mostly in the top chemistry journals. The most cited one has been cited 116 times, the next highest 72 times. This is high for a physical chemist. This may not have been the reason the article was added (&amp; lnone of the work seems to bear directly upon hot springs), but he is N. as a chemist. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:37, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: One needs to keep in mind that the article was created, not because of his work in chemistry, but because of the hot spring issue. He is simply not notable because independent, reliable third-party sources failed to write about him (emphasis on the pronoun "him") in either capacity. That said, the article would need to be entirely re-written from a chemistry-biography perspective in order for it to make sense to the general reader. DGG's edits only compound the puzzle. In layman's terms, what did he specifically discover? How did the contribution affect the field? The fact that the 152 entries for "German chemists" do not usually rely on the number of index citations (and, by the way, relative to what subjective benchmark?) to justify an article tells us that we either need to re-write the article or delete it entirely.

<dd><b>Criteria</b> He may have gotten noticed here because of the hot springs. Having been noticed, it turns out he's an important chemist &amp; I dont see what's wrong with that. I added information tending to show that the chemistry aspect was sufficient, because its much easier to be objective about things that can be counted. Articles about chemists are not intended to teach chemistry. The importance of chemists for WP purposes is measured by their relative importance as compared with other chemists. Those who wish to find out about polymer chemistry should read the WP article on the subject. Those who want to find out about the career of Dr. K, should read the article about him. The article on Ringo Starr is not intended to teach about drumming. It is intended to describe his career.</dd>
<dd>The use of subsequent citations is not necessary for an article. In the case of a professor at a less-known university, it seemed advisable to offer additional evidence, since it was a questioned article. (It also technically meets the old N requirement--each article citing him is necessarily about his work. Scientists are N for their work, not for their bio details.) Each field is judged by its own standards, which can be see by examining other AfD'd articles. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:39, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since May 2005, virtually no material edits have been made by knowledgable persons in chemistry who care to improve the article. As it stands, unfortunately, it reads like a substandard resume. It's my sincere hope that those who vote to keep this article know (or intend to research) what exactly his contributions to the field are, and intend to improve the article, before they vote to keep it on a technicality. Regarding point 3, has he written a <b>textbook</b>? Is it <b>the subject</b> of multiple, independent works? More importantly, on the third clause (index citations), are they aware of what ideas are actually being discussed? The caveat to the third clause specifically states: <i>Note that if an academic is notable only for their connection to a single concept, paper, idea, event or student it may be more appropriate to include information about them on the related page, and to leave the entry under the academic as a redirect page.</i> Have the editors in favor of keeping this article actually read the works in question to know the answer? I would be willing to withdraw my delete nomination tomorrow if someone actually read these articles and can articulate their substance for Wikipedia readers in the form of a well-written article.

A "textbook" is only one of the examples given, and the other is this: <i>if it is widely cited by other authors in the academic literature</i>. This is how those 5 works meet point 3.

A complete review article or an article totally about him isn't needed, but a mere cite isn't enough. A sentence or two in an independent article that indicates he's done something notable which has influenced subsequent work is the barebones minimum for what's missing, and multiple such articles (at least two) would meet policy requirements.

<li><b>Reply</b> Precisely, Shirahadasha. This has been my position from the beginning. DGG's edits (supported by Black Falcon) are appreciated, but far too mechanical. What exactly is Karthaus' contribution to the field of chemistry (in layman's terms) that makes him notable? This is not a rhetorical question; it's a genuine attempt to write articles for the benefit of the WP readership, and not for the sole benefit of the WP editors. <a href="../../../j/_/r/User%7EJ_Readings_19a7.html" title="User:J Readings">J Readings</a> 07:23, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Counterpoint</b>. The sole benefit of the WP editors? Exactly what benefit am I or DGG getting out of this article? I admit that my basic knowledge of chemistry and my complete ignorance of the academic field do not afford me the capacity to discover the particular nature of Karthaus' contribution to the field nor to express it in layman's terms if I knew of it. But if your concern is the "benefit of the WP readership", let me assure you as a reader of WP for over 2 years before I became an editor that readers would prefer to find the few details available in this article over the absence of an article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:28, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just because one blog online presents us with this fun trivia information doesn't mean it merits inclusion on wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's kind of interesting, but appears to be copied from its one source, changed only in alphabetizing- that's still a copyviolation issue, in my opinion.

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>rename</b> and <b>add more sources</b>. The term "celebrity" is loaded, so change it to "actors" or "public figures" or something like that. I think the topic warrants inclusion and is a specific enough subject to be maintainable as a list. Plus it is of genuine interest - I'd heard about Marlon Brando's invention recently, and Hedy Lamarr's work is legendary and notable, but it's a revelation to learn Abraham Lincoln and Danny Kaye also had inventions. Once again, though, material like this needs to be better sourced, but otherwise in my view the subject is perfectly encyclopedic. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:17, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. One in 100 Americans has a patent - it's not especially notable that members of one profession (or one POV aggregation such as "celebrity") have filed patents.

In Srebrenitza of Bosnia,Herzegovina, Hollands' soldiers in United Nations submitted muslim bosnians to serbians and 8000 bosnians were killed. Holland's government gave medals to their soldiers!! Now, in 2007 European Union Justice Court announced that Srebrenitza was exposed to an explicit ethnic-cleansing. The fact that Holland's government gave medals to their soldiers DOES NOT indicate that these soldiers protected honorously the innocent bosnian people. Do they?

<p>This was the first article I created on Wikipedia, and was originally created to increase awareness of my project. As an administrator I now feel that letting it exist without any kind of discussion about possible issues (such as <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROG_9df6.html" title="WP:PROG">WP:PROG</a>) would be a violation of the community's trust. Despite this being listed in AfD, I am not voting to delete or keep. Since I am involved in the topic of the article I would prefer to stay out of the debate entirely, but I do want to see the debate happen. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazycomputers_f72a.html" title="User:Crazycomputers">Chris</a> <a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazycomputers_ef3d.html" title="User talk:Crazycomputers">(talk)</a> 20:42, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> As near as I can tell, YICS is a project of the author of the article that has not yet reached the stage where it justifies an entry. If he gets it up and running, and succeeds in attracting a substantial number of users, it may then meet the Wikipedia notability guidelines. Most of the links on the page do not yet appear to function. The project itself is commendable as Yahoo! Games continues to be one of the most popular places to play chess online despite bearing almost no resemblance to bona-fide chess servers. YICS is a worthy project; the Wikipedia article, however, should be deleted. <a href="../../../j/s/t/User%7EJStripes_772c.html" title="User:JStripes">JStripes</a> 02:52, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> many useful Wikipedia articles are being deleted after an AfD because notability is not established. Other useful Wikipedia articles are being deleted after AfD even though proofs of notability are given, because there is disagreement whether the proofs are sufficient. I don't think any of that is fair, but is there sufficient proof of notability in this case? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 19:27, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I feel that this article was neccesary because i found many empty links on other pages citing the rathalos. Also i feel that if this page should be deleted because it is irellevent due to the fact that the rathalos is a video game character than the many other pages with video game characters should be deleted also such as Vincent Valentine from Dirge of Cerberus. Also i plan on updating it i was in a hurry the day i made it as i am now. <a href="../../../b/a/v/User%7EBaval2_fd3b.html" title="User:Baval2">baval2</a>12:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
