<li><b>Keep</b> - I realise this article may not appear significant, but the technical crew consists of only a very select group of people, while many students at Calday Grange (which I may add consists of around 1600 people) would like to be a part of it. It commands great interest in the school community, and this page gives the best practical means of supplying information about it which is wanted by many people. Besides, It's a reasonable article, as far as I can see it's encyclopaedic in the way it is written and isnt wikipedia supposed to be about supplying information, "notable" or otherwise? And why does it matter if YOU consider it notable, if it's supplying information that is useful to other people?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vwozone (<a href="../../../v/w/o/User_talk%7EVwozone_8713.html" title="User talk:Vwozone">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vwozone_4a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vwozone">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>I'm not a "notability" freak and I tend to vote against deletion on those grounds more than most wikipedians, but this really is silly (see my comments below). If you want people to know about it -- make your own web page (which is easy) or start a Calday wiki or something. Google will do the rest for you. As you well know, a lot of people in Calday will have no interest in being a member of the team. Again, think what would happen if every group had a page? Wikipedia is not a useful billboard.

<li><b>Delete</b> About as non-notable as one can get. I am an Old Caldean and had great involvment with the technical crew when I was there and I really don't think this can be said to deserve an article in its own right. When I attended the school, it had a very large number of clubs and societies. Are we to see an article on each one? For every school? What is more, this article really only covers a very recent group of members. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 19:56, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I can say with absolute certainty that there is a large number of people with an interest in joining , having been approached personally many times. The article does not only cover a small number of members, it merely names the current team amongst the large amount of information on other aspects. "...Are we to see an article on each one? For every school?..." Allowing one article does not mean there will be a sudden influx of every school club in the world making a wiki. You may well see this as uninteresting or insignificant, but what bad effect will come of leaving it to be read by those who are interested? I really see no downside in leaving a small wiki alone - it's not harming anyone, and if you dont want to read it then you needn't search for it.</p>
<p>... Incidentally, mr davey, I should be interested to know what lighting equipment was in use in your time with the technical crew at calday - I should be willing to bet it was probably the same old ancient strand stuff we're using now! If you wouldnt mind, let me know.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vwozone (<a href="../../../v/w/o/User_talk%7EVwozone_8713.html" title="User talk:Vwozone">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vwozone_4a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vwozone">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, we see this all the time from a lot of schools. We can't have an entry for every school's A/V club, or chess club, or dorm council. The fact is that this is not something likely to be of interest to anyone outside the school. Surely there's some better way of sharing the information with your schoolmates. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 15:03, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Why not? The page provides information that is useful to some people, again, if you don't want to read it then don't, somepeople would say it's quite sad to be searching around on wikipedia to find entrys that are of no inportance to YOU, and pressure for their deletion this passionately. Would someone please tell me what harm it does? How do all of you people from america know wether it's notable or not, you live thousands of miles away! How does it concern you? How do you know wether it is notable or not? How do you know now many people want information? Maybe an injection of common sense is needed.{A comment which was DELETED by another user, unfairly - it may not have been phrased politely, but "You are wrong..." etc was not either, and as a discussion page, I was under the impression that deleting others' comments was not allowed.)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vwozone (<a href="../../../v/w/o/User_talk%7EVwozone_8713.html" title="User talk:Vwozone">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vwozone_4a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vwozone">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is getting silly. I thought the idea of checking for "notability" was to prevent people creating badly written pages about their friends - not to delete encyclopaedic articles regarding something perfectly reasonable. If people have gone to the trouble of creating a page, then leave them alone! What harm is it doing by being there? Wikipedia is not supposed to be a small encyclopaedia of carefully chosen articles, selected on the grounds of how "notable" they are, surely.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vwozone (<a href="../../../v/w/o/User_talk%7EVwozone_8713.html" title="User talk:Vwozone">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vwozone_4a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vwozone">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> May i ask also, what signnificance is it that you are an old caldean Modulus 86? and Francis Davey? I am also noticing that there are no replies to any of my questions so far, they have all been deleted by someone, confirming that you are passionate about having things of no importance to YOU deleted, and would go to any lenghts to achieve this, inluding violating the rules of this conversation page yourself. I take it that beacause no-one has any replies but would prefer to pretend that i never asked the questions, that you have no replies to give? and that therefore it might pay just to leave this article alone, is my reasoning correct?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.65.107.236 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.65.107.236_fad4.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.65.107.236">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not for every man and his dog. It has limited resources. Even if it had infinite resources, it is not a universal repository of information.

<li><b>Comment</b> It would be useful if you signed your comments and indented any comments you have on what other people are saying. It quite difficult to work out the thread of what you are saying because you aren't following accepted conventions on a page like this (that may be why some of your comments have been deleted, though they should not have been - its trivial to re-instate them). So please can you impose some structure on what you say and don't repeat yourself? You seem to be directing various comments at me personally, but I'm not clear which ones or what you think I have said. Avoid saying "YOU" if its not clear to whom you refer -- not to me certainly I hope. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 15:12, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I second that. If you want to make a point, then please do it properly.
