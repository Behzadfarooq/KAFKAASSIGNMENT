<p>This article was previously subject to an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_6058.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">articles for deletion nomination</a>, was deleted, and is now being relisted following <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_February_11_7d58.html#Web_Cartoonist.27s_Choice_Awards" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 February 11">a deletion review debate</a>. The key issue raised in the deletion review was that sources were introduced late in the original debate and not all the participants may have had a proper chance to evaluate them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 02:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Sources assert some notability, even in the mainstream press. As far as I can see, the awards are well-recognized within the web comic community. Regardless of the current quality of the article, a well-written article can be written about this subject that is verifiable with reliable sources. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 02:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Multiple independently published sources have noted these awards in a non-trivial fashion (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">NYT</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Show_45ce.html" title="Attack of the Show">TV</a>, etc); these are the singularly most prominent and admired awards within an entire genre of art (webcomics). The case is crystal clear. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 02:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the awards are so notable that /they themselves are a source of notability/ for the comics they are presented to. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> 02:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Comment - This sounds almost circular at first, but consider this: The fact that <i>these</i> comics won awards is why <i>these</i> comics were covered in this NYT article. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom832_2ea5.html" title="User:Random832">Random832</a>(<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">t</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Random832_9c40.html" title="Special:Contributions/Random832">c</a>) 03:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There new york times is a trivial piece. Here's the whole content from that article that is about the award:</li>
</ul>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">And there are contests too. The fifth annual Web Cartoonists Choice Awards took place at <a href="http://www.ccawards.com/2005_ceremony.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ccawards.com/2005_ceremony.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccawards.com/2005_ceremony.htm</a> last month. The master of online ceremonies was a Web cartoon character and so were all the award presenters. Otherwise, it was much like the Oscars. There were too many award categories (26) and some commercial breaks, and all winners were rewarded with the Web equivalent of Hollywood fame: a live link to their sites. Consider "Copper," a beautifully drawn animal comic that won the prize for best art in the Web Cartoonists Choice Awards. The prize for best-written comic went to "Narbonic," by Shaenon Garrity. "Alpha Shade," by Christopher Brudlos and Joseph Brudlos, the winner of the long-form comic prize, is 107 pages long. The winning entry in the category of "infinite canvas" went to "Pup" by Drew Weing. "The Perry Bible Fellowship" by Nicholas Gurewitch, the winner of the "comedic comic" prize, does begin to verge on the infinite. The prize in the category "outstanding use of flash" was shared. One prize went to "Alpha Shade" (the one with the great page-turning feature). Another went to "The Discovery of Spoons" by Alexander Danner and John Barber.</td>

<dd>It utterly transparent that the author isn't actually talking <i>about</i> the awards, noting that this was several months after them should provide <i>some</i> clue. This source fails utterly to establish that this is "singularly most prominent and admired awards within an entire genre of art." the attack of the show's re-broadcasting is great and all, but we don't have articles based upon everythingthat ever was on one show.

<li><b>Long Comment with no real point.</b> I see where you are coming from. And I might even agree with you to say that the article isn't about the WCCA. But I think the article demonstrates something interesting. The author of the article is using the WCCA as a way to get into different web comics. For him (in the article), the WCCA is a prop... something to get him talking about specific web comics. Maybe that's what the WCCA does... it provides a starting point for people to approach the subject of web comics. It shows people which comics are liked and respected by other artists. As far as I can tell, this is the most notable award for web comics. I think it's a good idea to keep it around. -- <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESwerdnaneb_2a97.html" title="User:Swerdnaneb">Ben</a> 05:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My point is that an award given at a solitary high school is different than an award given to an "industry." One difference would be that we would expect better sources for a seven-year-old "industry" award than we would for any single school's perfect attendance award in a single year. But instead we see the opposite difference, that we seem to have far more sources for an award given in a single year at a solitary high school than we do this seven-year-old award given to an entire "industry." Feel free to draw fruit comparisons. Maybe: "If an attendance award were an Apple, and we shouldn't have an article on the Apple Attendance Award, then we shouldn't have an article on any fruit-based awards with less non-trivial coverage than the Apple Award, so if the Orange Juice Choice award has worse sourcing, then we shouldn't have an article on the Orange Awards." Mmmm ... is anyone else getting hungry? I know am. In fact, I'm really hungry for enough reputable sources that we can cover this topic from a neutral point of view. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 04:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I see. With that in mind, there is at least enough information to fully cite a stub... maybe not enough for a full article, but the article should at least be started. Anyway, it should be short work to make a stub out of the existing information, and when more sources come to light, we can of course restore the appropriate statements from the page history easily. Myself, I'd just leave it as is&#160;— asserting notability on a verifiable topic is good enough for me when the topic is obscure... there are bound to be at least one unsourced statement in an article anyway. Probably the best thing to do here is to leave it alone and simply wait for the sources to appear in the media. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidH</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidHOzAu_91ad.html" title="User talk:DavidHOzAu">Oz</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EDavidHOzAu_59c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:DavidHOzAu">Au</a> 11:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I disagree, as I would fully expect an awards committee to be aware of the awards they give out. Further, he is blogging on how little known the awards are: "Problems with the WCCAs [include] making people aware of them, getting people to care about them ...

<dd>Once again, I don't see how that is at all relevant. The quality of the site design has nothing to do with its notability, nor does forum activity, nor even the number and quality of the voters have anything to do with it. For all Wikipedia is concerned, the WCCAwards could be appointed by a single shadowy figure who fakes all the votes. This is not a discussion of the quality, or professional level of the WCCA, but its <i>notability for inclusion</i>. That is all. Besides being the subject of an article in the New York Times and on a public television show, the WCCA have been regularly referred to by <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristopher_Straub_c1b4.html" title="Kristopher Straub">Kristopher Straub</a>, <a href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/blog/index.php/2007/01/29/bracing-for-back-patting/" class="external text" title="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/blog/index.php/2007/01/29/bracing-for-back-patting/" rel="nofollow">Howard Tayler</a>, and many times by <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquestionablecontent.net%2Fview.php%3Fcomic%3D400&amp;ei=IoHVRZTXEKiusALpmbTlDA&amp;usg=__lUH205qRoZqhsROCr3r9iWd2eV4=&amp;sig2=cyAN-HTz7NQDmZvj0zesjg" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquestionablecontent.net%2Fview.php%3Fcomic%3D400&amp;ei=IoHVRZTXEKiusALpmbTlDA&amp;usg=__lUH205qRoZqhsROCr3r9iWd2eV4=&amp;sig2=cyAN-HTz7NQDmZvj0zesjg" rel="nofollow">Jeph Jacques</a>, three very well-known comic authors that I pulled out from the very, very tip of the list of webcomics I can name of the top of my head.

<dd>It hasn't been the subject of an article in the NYT, it was a passing mention. I disagree with your assertation that the nigh-impossbility of providing sourced information about this site's voting processes is irrelevant: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Attribution</a> is a core policy. How is an encyclopedic treatment of this site's achievements, impact or historical significance possible if the site itself is minimal and, as you suggest, asking for information about it asking too much? As for the webcomic world, I believe that webcomics constitute a fairly small subculture and that webcomic fans have an unrealistic view of their popularity. 'Notable in webcomics' doesn't mean notable, any more than 'notable in origami' or 'notable in homebrewing'. Why can't these awards just be mentioned and linked in <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> or <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>, as is normal?--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 11:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>See my post below re. validity of the NYT article - namely, what exactly would an awards article have to say to be notable in your books, besides describing an award and listing and describing its winners, a process that takes up about 2/3 of the article?</dd>
<dd>I do agree that attribution is difficult, and a paring down of this article is probably in order. I don't claim to know much about the WCCA besides that they exist, and pretty much all the webcomic artists I know of get excited when they win one, even the big names. I, for one, don't care to edit articles I don't know a thing about, but I think it would strengthen the Keep argument if someone who <i>did</i> know something were to edit this a bit.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the importance of the webcomic subculture, it is (ok, getting sick of "irrelevant". New word? um...) unimportant what you "believe" the size of the community is. I would be supporting the inclusion of an article about the Origami Artists' Choice Awards if they had been written up in the New York Times as an example of the internet awards given out to origami artists on the internet, had it been brought to my attention. Especially if a few people who were interested in origami then joined the discussion and listed several origami experts, citing their discussion about said awards and showing that experts in the field were aware of and gave a hoot about the "OACA" one way or the other.</dd>
<dd>The reasoning behind your argument yields the end result, "I don't see how <a href="../../../o/k/a/Okazaki_fragment.html" title="Okazaki fragment">Okazaki fragments</a> are all that notable. Can't they just be contained in the article on <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_replication_3f4b.html" title="DNA replication">DNA replication</a>?" If Wikipedia is not in fact about creating articles that meet Wikipedia's notability standards, and expanding on those articles to the limit of available noteworthy knowledge, I am a little confused about what we are doing here. <b><a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Erk</a></b>|<a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Talk</a> <sub>-- I like traffic lights --</sub> 12:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

Quotes from the creator, their motivation, the quirky speeches, info on the judges and a selection of nominees, context and so on. No such coverage exists for the WCCA. If the NYT did an actual write-up of these awards, rather than three or four paragraphs, then the article should be kept. If there was sustained coverage every year, as one would expect for popular awards, then there would be absolutely no question about it.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 13:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>All right, you have me in the sense that that shows a lot more information about the Webbys than the NYT article does about the WCCA. Clearly the Webbys are more notable than the WCCA (can't say as I'm surprised), and that is a better article. Regarding annual coverage in a newspaper, comparing the WCCA to the webbys is very misleading: the BBC coverage of the Webbys seems to be mostly "BBC won a webby award last night..." type stuff, in which the resource in question clearly has a vested interest in the awards. In fact, that is also the case in the article you linked, where it appears BBC's intial interest was in their own winning of the award - not that I am calling the article into question, it is definitely valid.</dd>
<dd>However, I would say the NYT article is still very clearly not trivial, and I am not sure where you can come out saying it is. Even if only pared down to the barest bones of absolute direct reference, as Brenneman has done, one comes out with a solid paragraph of information. The definition of non-triviality according to WP:N is: <i>"Non-triviality" is an evaluation of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and of how directly it addresses the subject."</i> with the further elabouration: <i>Examples: The 360-page book by Sobel and the 528-page book by Black on IBM are plainly non-trivial. The 1 sentence mention by Walker of the band Three Blind Mice in a biography of Bill Clinton (Martin Walker. "Tough love child of Kennedy", The Guardian, 6 January 1992.) is plainly trivial.</i> These stress, at least from my perspective, that a "trivial" reference is in fact <i>trivial</i>. It does not spend a paragraph describing the topic in question, in relative detail, nor does it go on to refer back to the topic in nearly <i>every subsequent paragraph of the article</i>. A trivial mention of the WCCA in a New York Times article would be something like, ";There are also awards, like the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards (link)", the end, proceed with article as planned.</dd>
<dd>Be careful not to apply a judgement call to what is trivial and what is not, based on how important <i>you</i> think the WCCA is. Unless triviality is some ephemereal, hard to define concept - which WP:N does not seem to suggest, else notability would be subjective - there is no way to claim this article is trivial. Not to mention anything of a notable television show devoting an entire episode to it, which Brenneman would like to shrug off, but which is certainly a "non-trivial, reliable published work, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." <b><a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Erk</a></b>|<a href="../../../m/r/e/User_talk%7EMrErku_e3a0.html" title="User talk:MrErku">Talk</a> <sub>-- I like traffic lights --</sub> 14:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did say the NYT snippets were passing mentions, not trivial. However, the NYT article is about webcomics generally, and there is only one paragraph that provides any hard information about the awards themselves, and not very much at that. The TV show did not 'devote a whole episode' to it, it was one of several segments. Whether this segment truly counts as an independent source is questionable, given that it was the WCCA 'Chief Executive' that was hosting it. With both sources being frankly borderline, the lack of further, ongoing coverage clinches it for me; an encyclopedic article can't be created with what is available.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 15:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I don't know what the naysayers expect a NYT article to SAY about an internet webcomics award. One would hardly expect them to write a dissertation about its history and management/nomination practices. One would expect, in fact, an article <i>exactly like this one</i>, for almost any award. If this NYT article is non-notable, I can't really imagine a notable article being printed. More importantly, this seems like a strong case of wikilawyering to me. Whether or not there is a dearth of printed articles about the WCCA, almost anyone with ANY involvement in the webcomic industry, from casual readers to authors, has heard of and recognises the WCCA. What is the <i>definition</i> of notability? Is it a tallyup of how many newspapers have mentioned a subject, as WP has lately been leaning towards? Or is that just meant to be an arbitrary measurement of something like, I don't know, how <i>notable</i> something is within its field? Because I would say this is pretty bloomin' notable to webcomics. It doesn't really matter in this debate, since this article meets wp:n anyway, but it is definitely food for thought. <b><a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Erk</a></b>|<a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Talk</a> <sub>-- I like traffic lights --</sub> 08:32, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notabilty asserted due to the fact the awards represent an entire industry. Notability asserted due to multiuple coverages in known publications (NTY, G4). And a comment - award presentations - even well known ones - can be boring and often don't attract huge coverage in media, but that has nothing to do with the notabilty of the award.

<li><b>Keep</b> For the main article, merge the years into a single article or with the main article. To repeat my argument in the undeletion, 'As per the NYT article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/17comi.html?ex=1281931200&amp;en=08e3777cc4943486&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=geartest&amp;emc=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/17comi.html?ex=1281931200&amp;en=08e3777cc4943486&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=geartest&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and most of an episode of "Attack of the Show" <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/episodes/4335/Web_Toon_Awards_Picture_Podcasts_The_High_Speed_Scene.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/episodes/4335/Web_Toon_Awards_Picture_Podcasts_The_High_Speed_Scene.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>'.

What is relevant is that the writer thought the awards were important enough, or representative enough to devote 7 paragraphs to them and its winners in an 18 paragraph general article about webcomics (actually, rereading it, the WCCA's seem to be used as one of the articles main 'hooks').

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">'fame' and 'importance' are not the right words to use, they are merely rough approximations to what we're really interested in, which is verifiability and NPOV. I understand and appreciate where people are coming from on the 'Yes' vote, but feel that they will only get the unanimity necessary in a wiki environment if they rephrase the issue in those terms. Consider an obscure scientific concept, '<a href="../../../q/u/b/Qubit_Field_Theory_b73c.html" title="Qubit Field Theory">Qubit Field Theory</a>' -- 24 hits on google. I'd say that not more than a few thousand people in the world have heard of it, and not more than a few dozen understand it. (I certainly don't.) It is not famous and it is arguably not important, but I think that no one would serious question that it is valid material for an encyclopedia. What is it that makes <i>this</i> encyclopedic? It is that it is information which is verifiable and which can be easily presented in an NPOV fashion. (Though perhaps only as a stub, of course, since it's very complicated and not many people would know how to express it clearly in layperson's terms.)</td>

<li>Francis, you want an article so bad I'll write you one, but let's not compare apples and oranges here, eh.

So let's go right out and delete everything less notable that Francis, God help us if Jimbo shows up and demands the same treatment, or does it only work for Francis? Let's examine the article on its merits. Wikipedia is case by case and has shades of grey. Wikipedia is a broad church. Wikipedia works when we respect each other, listen to each other and work to a solution. Let's try and achieve that here in line with our policies.

<li>I am not notable enough to merit an article, neither is this organisation, the point being that a couple of trivial mentions in mainstream press does not a make something notable. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 21:08, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, the point is that you think these are trivial mentions and that you think they aren't notable enough. The NYT article used the awards as a hook, criticised them but placed a value on them. The NYT article assessed them as relevant to the field of webcomics, discussed them as part of the medium. It was not trivial. Triviality is a throw away "The WCCA were awarded on Tues night". Triviality defined in the guideline as follows:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trivial coverage, such as (1) newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, (2) newspaper articles that simply report the times at which such content is updated or made available, (3) a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or (4) content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This was not trivial coverage by that definition. It wasn't a brief summary of the website. This wasn't reporting the internet address, it wasn't an internet directory listing and it wasn't telling you update times, in fact it deferred to the awards in picking strips to cover.

<li>I applaud the effort, but at this stage the author's opinion is pretty much invalid. Her article has been published already, and clearly makes more than trivial mention of the WCCA. Whether or not she <i>intended</i> the mention to be trivial is not the issue: very clearly, the mention is not trivial. I know you know the definition of trivial, brenneman, so I am in the dark as to why you think this doesn't meet it. At best, one might call this a "casual" mention, but it covers far too much ground to be trivial. Allowing the author to amend their opinions on a published work defeats the entire purpose of using published works, namely that they are in print and unchanging.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are some confusion about the format that Comixpedia uses and as a long time reader, and previous contributor, I can shed some light on this. Comixpeida.org is a comic wiki, not to be confused with comixpedia.com (although they have the same publisher). Comixpedia.com consists of one magazine part, which is under editorial control. The content is contributed by staff writers and freelancers to editors. Back when I contributed, you got payed for what you wrote (a rather symbolic amount though, it was 10 US$ for columns and somewhat more for articles if I remember correctly), but I admit I don't know if they still do this. The current month's magazine content can be found on the right side of the frontpage. The second part of comixpedia.com is the community/news section consisting of forums and blogs. The way the frontpage news work is by community contribution. A person writes in their blog on the site, and the newseditor promotes it to the frontpage if he/she finds it to be of interest. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpameinondas_efbf.html" title="User:Epameinondas">Epameinondas</a> 14:58, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The current procedural argument to establish notability is currently based on minimal foundations but these are solid enough to support the existence of an article. The argument against the NYT article supporting notability requires that the mention of the WCCA be trivial, that is, the NYT article would not be substantially changed or significantly reduced by the removal of references to the WCCA. My understanding is that it would be significantly changed in that one or more introductory paragraphs would be lost and the structure of the NYT article would be lost, reducing it to a series of isolated comments on a random and, to the read inexplicable, sampling of comics without any basis for asserting that they are in any way representative of web comics or to show that they have not been carefully selected by the NYT reporter to support her positions regarding web comics. I believe this argument shows that the WCCA were not a trivial part of the article and since there appears to be a consensus that the article as a whole was non-trivial it therefore follows that the mention of the WCCA was non-trivial.</li>

<dd>I don't think there's any reason not to list all past winners, but I think giving a separate article for each year's awards is overkill. - <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaron_4a89.html" title="User:Zaron">Zaron</a> 02:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I take that back. Looking over the vast number of categories given, it would be one hell of a mess to stuff it all into one panel. It might be best to keep the other articles. - <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaron_4a89.html" title="User:Zaron">Zaron</a> 03:00, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
